"Since then India has gone from strength to strength and is now a strategic partner with the EU, which I warmly welcome."
"India remains a stable secular democracy, which therefore disproves the Chinese position that size of country is a bar to democracy and human rights."
"The Sixth EU-India Summit in New Delhi on 7 September between EU Council President Tony Blair, Commission President Barroso and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was a great success, with the signing of the joint action plan for an EU-India strategic partnership."
"This sets up a high-level group to study differences over intellectual property rights, anti-dumping and non-tariff barriers."
"It is clearly in India's interests to join forces in the WTO negotiations to lower protectionist barriers, particularly in services such as accounting, law and finance, as this will free up trade and generate greater investment flows."
"India now has a 220 million-strong middle class and India-EU trade volumes touched USD 35.37 billion last year and are growing at an astonishing 20% per annum."
"India recently bought Airbus, and in my country we are outsourcing call centres and even healthcare to India, which I – unlike my UKIP colleague – welcome."
"India, though, still only represents 1.5% of the EU's external trade, compared to the EU representing some 20% for India, so the growth potential remains enormous."
"More could be done to facilitate so-called Mode 4, free movement of professionals – particularly research scientists – and India is now participating, as mentioned, in the Galileo project."
"I was responsible for the amendment to the report asking for India to be granted privileged status in the exchange of information with Europol in fighting terrorism."
"I was pleased that this was raised at the summit."
"Lastly, I thank India that in spite of its Communist Party protest it voted with the US and the EU on an IAEA resolution on Iran's nuclear programme."
"India deserves its own dedicated European Parliament delegation."
"– Mr President, I should like to congratulate my colleague Mr Menéndez del Valle on his excellent, balanced report."
"The strategic partnership, which was reaffirmed in early September in New Delhi, also contains commitments."
"I think it would be contradictory if the Commission were to cut the funding for India instead of increasing it; it would be incongruous, somehow."
"I also think that the EU needs to increase its visibility in India."
"On the British Prime Minister’s visit, it was often unclear whether he was there as the President of the Council of the European Union or as the Prime Minister of a Member State."
"We must clear up this confusion; we must make it clear that we are speaking on behalf of the EU and not just of one Member State."
"The issue of the economy has been raised."
"This is one basis for this strategic partnership."
"I, too, believe that possibilities for trade have been far from exhausted."
"Bureaucracy needs to be reduced, barriers dismantled and infrastructure, ports and airports increasingly expanded."
"As has been said several times here, fair trade is also needed, however, as well as respect for workers’ rights, the abolition of child labour and respect for intellectual property."
"This is part of the package, and I absolutely disagree with Mr Clark of UKIP: India is investing in Europe."
"Thousands of jobs are being created in Europe, too."
"For example, an IT company was recently established in Northern Ireland, with the creation of 600 jobs."
"This is not a one-way street, but rather an exchange."
"With regard to the political issues, I should like to see India showing commitment to multilateralism, for example recognising the International Criminal Court and acceding to the United Nations Convention Against Torture."
"I believe that both parties have a good deal more planned with each other."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Menéndez del Valle for a successful report in which human rights questions have been incorporated into the partnership in an exemplary manner and not set aside as if they were a separate category, as is often the way."
"India’s development in recent decades has been remarkable."
"Its technological development is looked upon with envy universally, and at the same time it has managed to preserve its multiethnic, multireligious, multicultural and linguistically diverse society."
"EU-Indian relations are close; we are friends."
"We have a particularly high regard for the way this, the world’s largest democracy, is trying, through legislation, actively to rectify the defects observable in its society."
"One example of this is the practice of positive discrimination."
"Good legislation is not enough, however: time and effort must be invested in its implementation."
"The Indian Human Rights Commission has already done a remarkable job, but local authorities should also systematically comply with good political decisions."
"The EU could provide support here by means of its development programmes, for example, which would focus on the fight against discrimination."
"Approximately 35% of India’s billion or more inhabitants live below the poverty line, and a large number of people are still totally deprived of basic rights."
"The single most significant reason for this is the caste system, which legitimises human inequality."
"Especially worrying is the plight of women and the more than 160 million Dalits (Scheduled Castes), whose exploitation is socially accepted and commonplace."
"Those Dalits who try to break away from the caste system by marrying into a higher caste or, for example, by acquiring education or land legally, often become victims of physical violence and social outcasts."
"Local authorities are all too ready to interpret the law to the benefit of a higher caste."
"We Members of the European Parliament have on many occasions raised the issue of human rights violations resulting from the caste system, but so far we have seen little practical action on the part of the EU."
"Now that industry is talking openly about the leaps in technology that India needs and which the EU can help realise, the EU should be providing India with more tangible support in issues of human rights in order for it to be able to put its excellent political will into practice."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and India are predestined for strategic cooperation and for strategic partnership."
"Together we make up the two largest democracies in the world."
"These democracies are based on respect for human and civil rights and on the principle of the rule of law."
"The EU and India are predestined for strategic cooperation in global, political and security matters, be it on a bilateral level or within the United Nations, for example."
"The EU and India are predestined to be economic partners, with the EU being India’s largest trading partner, and, as has already been mentioned, with India investing massively in Europe."
"In my own country, the Czech Republic, for example, Mittal Steel has successfully restructured the Czech steel industry."
"India and the EU are also predestined to cooperate on the environment, agriculture, human rights, in meeting the Millennium Goals and in the fight against poverty."
"I would like to conclude by thanking and congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Menéndez del Valle, for his well-balanced and first-rate report."
"I support this report and believe that the House will also give its full support to it in tomorrow’s vote."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0227/2005) by Claude Turmes on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the share of renewable energy in the EU and proposals for concrete actions [2004/2153(INI)]."
". Mr President, the 21st century will be the century of renewable technologies."
"This Tuesday afternoon we organised a conference with major industry representatives and it was really impressive to see the wide diversity of renewables and new developments such as ocean energies, solar thermal electricity and second-generation biofuels."
"When we speak about renewables we are not just talking just about security of supply, about the environment; it is also about the future industrial and economic policy of Europe."
"Because we have had a small number of dedicated countries, this sector is one of the sectors where Europe is leading the world."
"Last week I was in Denmark."
"Denmark has won the biggest-ever wind investment in the world, in the US, and it is a Danish company which will do it."
"So we have an advance in this technology and we have to keep it."
"We therefore need a political approach."
"We also need a systemic approach to energy policy."
"The best renewable energy is the intelligent use of energy; it is energy efficiency."
"A second important systemic approach – and this is something that we often forget – is appropriate energy densities."
"Taking electricity to heat or to cool a house is completely irrational and uneconomic. Via our energy policy we must give up today's inefficient uses of energy and move on to the use of low-temperature renewables or waste from electricity production."
"Let us look at the sectors."
"In the building sector – we had a concrete example of this on Tuesday – with Commission money we are financing a project in Hungary."
"It was a – one of those very bad buildings."
"There was a monitored 80% reduction in energy."
"Then, what was a small 5% of solar heating, if you do an 80% reduction, immediately becomes a 25% of renewable share."
"That means more comfort for the people who live there and job creation in Europe."
"Especially in eastern Europe, refitting the building stock and then modernising the central district heating systems to bring biomass instead of coal, is a major part of that area."
"Now to solar thermal cooling: yes, we can cool houses with solar energy, and this is a perfect combination because when the sun is there, buildings are getting hot, but then the sun is also there to help us produce energy to cool this building."
"In the electricity sector, ocean energy will be the next big development and we have to put money into solar thermal electricity development."
"For the southern part of Europe, that is a big opportunity and in the sun belt of the world there is also a big industrial opportunity for our industries."
"But we have to put the functioning of the electricity market right."
"Commissioner, we talk a lot about it."
"I think we have to act more fiercely."
"We need ownership unbundling."
"We need to stop subsidies for coal and nuclear energy and we need a stable framework for renewable electricity."
"My final words go to the transport sector."
"Transport is the most inefficient sector."
"A car only has an efficiency of 10-12%, whereas in the electricity sector we are at 40%, and in the heating sector we are at 80-90%, so the first work in transport is efficiency through mandatory efficiency for cars, moving trucks from road to rail and so on, and only then do biofuel and second-generation biofuel make sense."
"There again we need a stable framework until 2020, otherwise investments in second-generation biofuels will not happen."
"Lastly, I would like to thank all those colleagues who were with me."
"I think we did a good job and I hope that we will see a good vote tomorrow."
". I would like first to express my gratitude to Mr Turmes, the rapporteur on the Commission communication on the share of renewable energy in the EU, as well as to all of his colleagues who contributed to this report."
"This issue has increasing importance not only with the current high oil prices but also for the medium- and long-term policies in the European Union."
"We have already had the chance to speak about this today."
"I would like to emphasise that even if in the renewable sector we have made quite substantial progress, still a great deal should be done, even with the target that is for overall consumption from renewable sources such as green electricity and biomass, we are still far from fulfilling the targets we have for 2010."
"The Commission is doing all it can to encourage and pursue the Member States to stick to those targets."
"It is clear that we need to and can do better."
"I really enjoyed reading the report."
"It presents a cohesive and comprehensive overview of the possibilities that exist in the short and medium term as regards renewable energy."
"I understand that there have been amendments to alter certain parts of the report."
"As this is an own-initiative report from Parliament, I will not comment on all elements in the report or the amendments, but take some of the key points of the report."
"First of all I was impressed with the broad overview of the possibilities that renewable energy allows us."
"It goes to show that we can make changes in our energy mix in the future."
"Furthermore, I was very pleased to see the complex and systemic way that Parliament is approaching energy."
"You rightly say that liberalisation is linked with fair conditions for renewable electricity."
"You also team energy efficiency with renewable energy."
"You have a vision for the use of research, market uptake and support schemes."
"Furthermore, you argue convincingly that renewable energy is part of the global solution to our global problems on energy."
"And finally, but also very importantly, you also link competitiveness, security of supply and environmental protection."
"I want in particular to welcome the points devoted to biomass."
"This sector is very important in the draft."
"I can inform you that an action plan will be adopted by the Commission at the end of November."
"The energy potential of biomass in the Union is significant and needs to be developed."
"I share the view that biomass energy is intimately linked to other European policies."
"In the recent Commission proposal for a Council decision on rural development, the Commission proposed the integration of biomass and biofuels in rural development as an important new market in a sustainable agriculture."
"It is obvious that direct support measures will remain essential in the future to ensure sufficient penetration of renewable energy in the market and to meet our agreed targets."
"As you know, the Commission aims to adopt a communication on support schemes on renewable energy sources at the end of November."
"This communication will be a good opportunity to evaluate the many different support schemes which actually exist in Europe."
"It will also address the barriers which are hampering the development of renewable energies."
"These include complex licensing procedures and poor integration of renewable energy in local planning."
"We have to do a thorough analysis of the various national systems."
"On the basis of their impact we will have to decide on a larger-term perspective."
"On heating and cooling, I welcome the own-initiative report from Mrs Rothe which will also contribute to bringing the appropriate initiatives forward."
"I have seen the amendments on heating and cooling, and the Commission will carefully consider what more can be done in this respect."
"In the current context of high oil prices we have to react with determination and ambition."
"I outlined my five-point plan earlier today, a plan which has the support of the Commission."
"I once again thank the rapporteur and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for taking the initiative to prepare the report that allows us to have the debate today, and will help the Commission to come up with appropriate initiatives."
". – Mr President, I should like, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to thank the rapporteur and to congratulate him on his important report."
"Given the important advantages of renewable sources of energy, the question is how we can further promote their development, so that the citizens of the future can enjoy their advantages."
"Steps have been made but, as the Commission recently reported, there is a significant delay in relation to the targets set in Directive 2001/77/ΕC."
"Consequently, we need to do more and I believe that we need to do more on four counts."
"Firstly, we need to create a more favourable political environment for renewable sources of energy. The role of governments is decisive here given that, unfortunately, the large multinationals are still investing first and foremost in oil."
"So we need a fabric of incentives to encourage alternative energy investments and create profitable markets."
"Secondly, we need to create a suitable legal framework which will support renewables."
"A framework which will go beyond the confines of an energy system which, together with its legal bases, was built at a time when renewable sources of energy were more or less unknown."
"Thirdly, we also need immediate public and private investment in research to develop better and cheaper technologies in relation to renewables and"
"fourthly, we need to set binding quantitative targets up to 2020 both for overall production from renewable sources of energy and for electricity for heating and cooling."
"Two hundred and fifty thousand jobs could be supported with planned investments in the future of renewable sources of energy."
". Mr President, I thank the rapporteur for his work and his consideration of the views of the Agriculture Committee on this important report."
"I suppose there has never been a better time for a report on renewable energy."
"As I came down to this debate the price of oil is at USD 67 a barrel, and as we know its supply is finite."
"And all the while, if you look at rural areas of the European Union, where much of the renewable energies will come from, they are screaming out for sustainable alternative enterprises."
"It is deplorable, in my view, that the EU is unlikely to meet its 12% renewable energy consumption target by 2010."
"It is obvious that in some Member States there is neither the will nor the inclination to take seriously the need to generate renewable energy, while others are forging ahead."
"The Biofuels Directive sets targets of 2% market penetration for biofuels by the end of this year, but in Ireland a target of only 0.03% for biofuels has been set."
"As for the whole area of biomass production – this so-called sleeping giant of renewable energies – which the Commissioner has just mentioned, I am pleased to see that we will have an action plan in this area."
"It is very much to be welcomed."
"The contribution of the common agricultural policy towards renewable energy production must be recognised in both biofuels and biomass."
"Renewable energy can assist rural areas by providing diversification options, securing farm income and generating jobs."
"But incentives are required to make sure that the many renewable options reach their full potential."
"Specifically, taxation policy must not hinder the expansion of renewable energy."
"While we are keen to encourage diversification by our farmers, I want to add a word of caution."
"There is a concern that there may be a conflict in time between the production of crops for food and for non-food usage, and that would be regrettable."
"Both must be sustainable and provide incomes."
"I agree that the rural development policy in the future must have as its priority the promotion of renewable energy."
"I will finish by saying that yesterday in Ireland, 60 000 people were at a ploughing championship, many of whom were talking about this whole area of renewable energies, and one researcher, who has worked tirelessly for 20 years, said to me: 'At last, I think, our time has come'."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, wish to join in thanking Mr Turmes, our rapporteur."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is in favour of renewable energy, but we have occasionally had to remind Mr Turmes of the need for the matter to be approached with more realism."
"Indeed, we did partly succeed in this when it came to the vote in committee."
"The report has many positive aspects."
"The subject of biomass was very important to us, and I am pleased that we succeeded in voting in a whole chapter."
"We want to see harmonisation of European support systems in the electricity field over the long term."
"We know that this cannot be done overnight."
"In the long term, however, we must create a single European market for this, too, with all its benefits; one of the purposes of which – and this is another important point for us – being to reduce costs."
"We have limited funds, and we have to achieve as much as possible with those at our disposal."
"This is why support systems have to be oriented with a view to reducing costs."
"We still take issue with a few aspects of the present draft of the report."
"For example, we feel that the target of 25% by 2020 presents problems and have tabled amendments on this."
"We believe that not only the positive aspects of wind power should be discussed, but that issues of grid stability and the local people’s objections must be taken into account."
"We believe that more attention should be paid to the field of heating and cooling than the report already does, because a great deal can be achieved in this field with little money: considerable reductions in the quantity of fossil fuels used and of carbon dioxide produced."
"These are also the reasons why we want to promote renewable energy: we want to reduce dependence on oil and gas, and we want to bring the problem of climate change under control."
"For these reasons, I ask for support for the PPE-DE Group’s amendments."
"There should be no doubt, however, that Europe must cooperate on renewable energy."
". – Mr President, I, too, should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Turmes, most sincerely for his outstanding report and for his excellent cooperation."
"In spite of the few words of criticism from Mr Liese, I am very confident that this report will be adopted tomorrow with a large majority."
"The current oil crisis, in particular, has made it increasingly clear that finite sources of energy must be replaced with constantly self-renewing sources."
"The EU has recently launched a successful strategy for the expansion of renewable energies, which includes legal requirements for targets, for example for electricity from biofuels."
"We have achieved market penetration and thus made an important contribution to the fight against climate change."
"Creating 300 000 jobs and producing an annual turnover of approximately EUR 15 billion, this expansion has also made an important contribution to the Lisbon Strategy."
"The efforts being made are insufficient, however."
"As has also been noted already, the level of compliance with the biofuel targets is far from satisfactory, and the Commission has had to give a number of Member States strong reminders about meeting the electricity targets."
"Obstacles to be removed include bureaucratic barriers, problems of grid capacity and inadequate support systems."
"For I have not yet given up on one thing: the idea that we can meet the target of doubling the renewable-energy share of overall energy consumption to 12% by 2010."
"There is one thing that remains very important to this end, however: closing the legislative gap in the field of heating and cooling."
"This means that we need clear legal requirements with clear targets, in order to create incentives for the Member States to take appropriate action, and in order to exploit the considerable potential of biomass, solar thermal energy and geothermal energy in this field."
"This is a very important message to the Commission, therefore: I urge you to take action in this field and table the appropriate legislation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to thank Mr Turmes for his work, for the work that we have done together."
"The document is very important because it restores the balance in a situation that seems to favour centralised, concentrated energy production."
"Renewable energies have been remarkably neglected."
"Now, at last, we can consider redressing the balance and therefore devote to renewables the research effort that they have not enjoyed until now, but which they deserve because of the essential contribution that they can make to our energy requirements."
"They contribute to a guarantee of sustainability, in that they are non-CO2 emitting and CO2 neutral, and to our energy independence, as well as to job creation in the European Union precisely at such a difficult time, as we have already seen today in the debate on the oil document, thanks to technology in which we are world leaders."
"It will be an effort that should first of all give us precise information on the contribution that each source can make."
"I am sure that their contributions will be extremely important in an absolute sense – beyond our wildest dreams – not least because production will be spread out."
"That will lead to a greater sense of responsibility and a leap forwards in energy efficiency, through the widespread adoption of electricity generation coupled with heating and cooling at the same time."
"That approach should be a priority, because it embodies our commitment."
"In particular, I should like to highlight the contribution of biomass; in gas conversion processes it can produce hydrogen directly, and we all know how important that is."
"Other renewables like wind power have already made a considerable contribution, and others are extremely promising."
"That must be our commitment, and I believe that with Mr Turmes and his group we shall succeed in doing a lot more work yet."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I join in thanking Mr Turmes for the excellent work we have done together."
"Let there be no doubt: the great majority of the scientific community is now convinced that greenhouse gas emissions are the main cause of the rise in global temperature, and there remains a reasonable doubt that the increasing frequency and violence of recent natural disasters are correlated with this warming."
"To reduce greenhouse gases we have to aim at bringing the oil age to an end and turning to alternative energy sources, starting with the first alternative source which is energy efficiency."
"A policy to increase efficiency and reduce waste can, within a few years, achieve a saving of over 20% in oil consumption; a similar amount could result from a massive switch to renewables such as wind, solar and biomass."
"The European Commission’s Green Paper on energy is a good starting point but, for it to be effective, research programmes need to be prepared that can simulate the development of sustainable and competitive energy systems, including by means of multi-annual demonstration projects – here in the European Parliament, for instance –and policies supporting small and medium-sized enterprises that invest in the sector."
"Mass investment needs to be accompanied by financial and fiscal incentives for alternative energies, aiming at the development of the necessary infrastructure – for hydrogen for instance – and at sustainable transport."
"The role of the European Union is decisive, not least to spur on national policies and to put Community directives into practice: only by making a coordinated effort across the continent can Europe become a credible player in global energy policies."
". Mr President, I would like to commend the rapporteur on his excellent work."
"The various energy crises coupled with the prospect of the exhaustion of non-renewable organic fuels in view of increased demand and the need to protect the environment have led to increased interest in sources of renewable energy."
"I therefore welcome the decision to debate this issue in the House."
"Mr Turmes referred to the sun."
"Even if all the supplies of fuels such as oil, gas, coal and wood could be burnt as efficiently as possible, the amount of energy obtained would only be equal to the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth in barely four days."
"That is something worth noting."
"The issue we are debating is of fundamental importance, and it is unfortunate that we are debating it late at night with so few Members present."
"There are many aspects to the challenge before us, for instance the technical, research, environmental, climatic, economic, social and defence aspects to name but a few."
"Specific action in this regard must be taken across the whole Union, with due consideration for international cooperation."
"This should be undertaken in individual countries ..."
"Regrettably, the countries of the European Union do not possess significant natural sources of energy."
"A few months ago, the institutions of the European Union addressed the issue of energy security in Europe."
"According to one admittedly platonic statement, the dependency of European countries on external energy sources will increase from 50 to 70% in the next twenty years."
"If we consider the implications of these facts, then the energy policy of the European Union appears markedly naïve, especially from the standpoint of securing an adequate level of energy self-sufficiency."
"I certainly support measures in favour of increased energy efficiency, establishing the preconditions for an increase in the share of alternative and renewable energy sources, and energy conservation."
"On the other hand, to have a realistic chance of meeting energy requirements, Europeans must overcome their phobia of nuclear energy and of established forms of energy production, operated, of course, in strict compliance with environmental and operational norms."
"European institutions should also adopt a more far-sighted approach to the closure of existing energy installations."
"In this context, I must criticise the decision, motivated largely by political considerations, to decommission prematurely the nuclear power plant at Jaslovské Bohunice, in spite of the fact that the plant meets operational safety requirements."
"This will weaken the energy potential not of only Slovakia, but of the entire European Union, and will draw away resources that might have served, among other things, to finance programmes aimed at supporting alternative forms of energy."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we know that the question of promoting renewable sources of energy is of crucial importance."
"The recent opinion simply emphasises this."
"I think that Mr Piebalgs' recent five-point action plan moves in this direction."
"Allow me now to focus our attention on two issues."
"Firstly, we need to promote the independence of island systems in the European Union."
"In my country, for example, we have a great many islands which are cut off from the national electricity grid."
"Advanced hybrid generation technologies, which combine renewable sources of energy and storage technologies, need to be applied to independent energy systems as a matter of priority."
"This will allow us to have independent, decentralised energy units, together with constant production and supply of energy to the consumer."
"The second issue relates mainly to solar and wind energy."
"Connecting them to existing energy networks is causing problems."
"The Commission needs to study best practices in managing networks, in order to resolve these problems."
"This must be our first concern, if we want renewable sources of energy to penetrate each country's energy system."
"Mr President, energy produced from renewable sources should be exploited according to the technological priorities for a given country."
"The climatic and agricultural conditions prevailing in Poland mean that biofuels should have priority for immediate support, with geothermal energy in second place."
"The experience gained to date, however, does not paint a particularly rosy picture concerning the production of electricity from solid biomass."
"Amongst other reasons this is due to the low efficiency of conversion of heat energy into electrical energy, and also to logistical and environmental problems."
"In addition, wood-based biomass has to be dried to remove about 20% of its water content, and this process consumes additional energy."
"Another priority for Poland could be energy contained in municipal waste."
"Not only is this energy source constantly renewing itself, but is actually increasing at a dramatic and alarming rate."
"By definition, it is certainly a renewable source of energy."
"Existing technologies such as pyrolysis make it possible to obtain hydrocarbons from the waste and convert them efficiently into electrical energy."
"The benefits are twofold: energy as well as a form of secondary recycling and liquidation of landfill sites."
"The Commission should recognise this type of energy as renewable energy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the rapporteur, Mr Turmes, has, in his own inimitable manner, produced a thorough report, this time on a strategy for the use of renewable energies."
"The report deserves credit and speaks for itself."
"It is predicted that the world’s population and use of energy will continue to grow."
"When we speak of renewable biofuels and the cultivation of energy crops, it must be realised that energy production competes with food production for the same area of land."
"Considering the current prices of oil and grain, it may be cheaper to use grain rather than oil as a heating fuel."
"At the same time, a large number of people in the world are starving."
"That is the way the market mechanisms work."
"While following the Greens’ energy strategy – and Mr Turmes is a Green – I have noticed that there is a hostile attitude to research into the use of fusion energy."
"Like Mr Turmes, we are in favour of financing research into renewable energy sources and energy efficiency under the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development."
"That, however, cannot be allowed to happen at the expense of research into nuclear fusion."
"Mankind needs to explore this possibility for energy production thoroughly."
"It is an energy resource which is halfway between being renewable and non-renewable."
"We are faced with problems, and solving them will rely on the coordination of population growth, food production and renewable energy production."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on a highly informative report on the 21 types of renewable energy, which will play an ever-increasing role in the 21st century, whether from a climate-change perspective or that of the security of supply of fossil fuels and increasing prices."
"My own country, Ireland, is uniquely placed for the development of green energy and green fuel: we have the technological base, the climate and amongst the strongest wind and waves in Europe off our Atlantic coast."
"Just yesterday our minister announced a new scheme to support another 400 megawatts of renewable capacity."
"However, despite all of that, the ambition of our renewables sector is completely frustrated."
"Again the minister has got it wrong: his proposal is an attempt to defy economic gravity."
"He is proposing the only scheme in Europe to cap prices and quantities."
"This will totally distort competition in a market that is already stacked against independent renewable generators."
"We do not have de facto liberalisation of the electricity market in Ireland."
"The investigation into anti-competitiveness practices in the electricity market announced six months ago by Commissioner Kroes will no doubt show that the ESB – our Electricity Supply Board – like its French counterpart EDF, still holds an effective monopoly and abuses its dominant position as the gatekeeper of the national grid, instead of ring-fencing generation from grid operation with cross-subsidisation of uneconomic fossil fuel generation with the national grid profits."
"The fear that the ESB could switch off the lights at any time causes the regulators to take a softly, softly approach to the opening up of the market."
"There is nothing the government can do!"
"It has relinquished all power to form policy in this particular area."
"The 1999 Act, which set up the Irish Commission for Energy Regulation, had an in-built provision for ministerial policy directions to be cut off in 2002."
"Conveniently the author of that act is now head of the Irish Commission for Energy Regulation, which has carte blanche to regulate without any government input or supervision."
"Necessary independent arbitration should not preclude ministerial policy directions."
"We have what is effectively a marginal grid policy, where each project requires an upgrade of the grid and has to fight for access on an ad hoc basis."
"The bureaucracy and financial uncertainty this causes for renewables is considerable."
"It is high time the Irish Government took back control over shaping a progressive renewables policy in Ireland."
"I represent a Member State which certainly occupies penultimate place in the European Union in the use of renewable energy."
"The reason for this is Estonia’s heavily-polluting and very inefficient – and yet monopolistic – oil shale-based energy."
"The only partly unavoidable reason for using this energy source is the fact that the value of oil shale is not based on the world price, but has instead been determined by a committee at the Ministry of Economics and Communications."
"Thus, in heating buildings, we have been independent of price fluctuations on the world market."
"Now, however, companies which produce oil from oil shale have apparently raised their prices considerably through a cartel agreement."
"Since sustainable energy has not been seriously implemented in Estonia, many consumers have no other options."
"As we all know, it is the poor who suffer the most from price increases."
"Today, from morning till evening, the European Parliament has been discussing possible measures for the alleviation of both the social and economic consequences."
"Our Minister of Economics and Communications, however, has shrugged his shoulders and claimed that there is nothing he can do if oil shale companies have tied the price of oil shale to the price of oil."
"The price of oil shale itself, however, has not risen."
"The moral is that the European Union must increase pressure on those Member States’ governments that are burying their heads in the sand."
"I wish all power to representative Andris Piebalgs, and I would like to thank MEP Claude Turmes for taking a large step in the right direction."
". Mr President, I should like to make some brief remarks."
"First, I can assure you that the Commission will do everything within its legal powers to implement the existing directives."
"Second, there has been enough evidence given today about the necessity for a directive using renewables in heating and cooling."
"The arguments in favour of that are very strong."
"I would also like to mention that it is extremely important that the Committees on the Environment and Agriculture were consulted but, if the objective of renewables is to be successful, then other committees should also take these questions on board."
"As long as it is just the Committee on Energy, the goals will not be achieved."
"It is a much broader issue – the committee responsible for taxation questions and other committees, especially those that are concerned with economic development, should deal with these issues."
"The report on the situation of the internal market will be ready in November."
"Then I will be glad to discuss with you the situation and challenges in different Member States."
"Definitely the situation of market liberalisation differs from one Member State to another."
"I thank the rapporteur and everyone else who contributed to this very good report."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,"
"I strongly welcome the Turmes report outlining the future of renewables according to the overall guidelines of the Lisbon Strategy."
"I also agree that within the framework of a consistent European energy policy, renewable energy sources can have a positive impact on job creation, environment protection, market integration, research and development, innovation, as well as sustainable economic development in the coming decades."
"However, I would like to point out that technologies using renewable energy are very expensive, both in terms of their absolute value and their efficiency."
"Having said that, the price of energy, especially under current circumstances, is a highly sensitive issue in many of the Member States, to such an extent that it can even endanger social cohesion itself."
"Therefore I believe that before starting to prepare an overly ambitious policy on renewable energy it is extremely important to support cohesion between regions, Member States and small regions as well as the integration of the European energy market by a comprehensive energy policy based on reasonable balance."
"The next item is the Commission declaration on the human rights of minority groups in Kosovo."
". Mr President, this declaration covers answers to three questions posed by honourable Members relating to the human rights situation of the Roma in Kosovo."
"Generally, it would be fair to say that the return process for all minorities has thus far failed in Kosovo, with only 13 000 returnees since 1999."
"Furthermore it would be a fair assessment to say that the Roma community is in a very disadvantaged position in Kosovo."
"The Commission is concerned that the forced returns of members of the Roma community may be happening in a framework that does not ensure their safe and sustained reintegration into Kosovo society after they return."
"Meanwhile the Commission supports the Roma community where it can, notably through our assistance programmes to improve the overall sustainability of their living conditions."
"At the same time, we do not target forced returnees specifically."
"The second question concerns the issue of whether the principle of non-refoulement is being fully respected in the event of the forcible repatriation of Roma refugees to Kosovo."
"It is not within the Commission's remit to establish whether the principle of non-refoulement is fully respected or not."
"The ultimate administrative responsibility falls to the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, UNMIK, as well as to the European Union Member States that have decided to forcibly return members of the Roma community to Kosovo."
"Meanwhile in March 2005 the UNHCR, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, assessed that returns should be considered unsafe for Kosovo Serbs and Kosovo Roma, as well as Kosovo Albanians where they are in a minority situation."
"Returns for Ashkali, Egyptians as well as Gorani and Bosniak people are considered safer."
"As far as the Commission is aware, the agreement between UNMIK and the German government on forced returns concerns the Ashkali and Egyptian minorities only, and not the Roma and other minority groups."
"Thirdly, the question on Roma in Kosovo in general."
"All progress reports contain a chapter on the political situation and the criteria as laid down by the Copenhagen European Council in June 1993."
"This chapter contains a section on minorities and minority protection in candidate and potential candidate countries, including the Western Balkan countries."
"This year's progress report on Kosovo will be no exception and thus provides an assessment of the situation of minorities, including Roma."
"This issue will also be regularly monitored and addressed in future progress reports and in the Commission's political dialogue with Kosovo."
"Of course we will very carefully study what Ambassador Kia Eide will present in his standard report on Kosovo, which is due in a few weeks."
"This will concern the implementation of the decentralisation measures and the critical issue of minority protection."
"That report will be indispensable when it comes to determining the likely start of the status talks on Kosovo in the course of this autumn."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, our opinions differ on many issues, but I hope that we shall at least succeed in reaching a certain consensus in the field of minority rights."
"The Commissioner’s home country, Finland, has in place an exemplary settlement for its Swedish minority."
"There was once one of our own fellow Members in this House who had the same surname as you, and she belonged to that minority."
"It is high time that the European Union developed uniform standards for minorities, not only within the EU – where, to be frank, there are no standards at all for minorities, which is a problem – but also in our external relations with the candidate countries and with the associated countries."
"We cannot keep arbitrarily picking out this or that minority in this or that country, but instead should make a real attempt to arrive at a common basis."
"I believe that the Kosovan Constitution, which President Rugova developed whilst underground, contains exemplary minority rights."
"Then there was the mass expulsion of the Albanians in 1999, and since then the wounds of the war have been bleeding."
"A few years after a war such as this, the return of the displaced persons is of course the most difficult chapter."
"Yet we should begin with the right to vote."
"The right to vote does exist, and seats in the Kosovan Parliament are reserved for minorities."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner what he, and what the EU, is doing to ensure that all minorities actually take up the seats in the Kosovan Parliament to which they are entitled."
"Secondly, is the Commissioner aware that, in neighbouring Serbia, there are no seats at all for minorities?"
"What is the Commissioner doing to ensure that the same standards are applied to the Serbian Parliament regarding the right to vote as are applied in Kosovo? In Kosovo, minorities have a disproportionately large parliamentary representation, whilst in Serbia, in view of the 5% threshold and the fact that Serbia is a single constituency, there are no seats at all for minorities."
"These are glaring differences."
"How do you see the outcome of the status question, which has to be resolved taking these issues into account?"
". – Mr President, I should like to make a point of thanking Commissioner Rehn for his objective presentation of the drastic situation of minorities in Kosovo."
"It truly is worrying that this is the first time since 1999 that the European Parliament has debated the question of minority rights in Kosovo."
"This policy of double standards, this selective sensitivity towards the Serb minority and towards other minorities in Kosovo is truly worrying."
"If we look at the situation as described in the reports by both the High Commissioner for Refugees and the special UN envoy, we see that, since 2004, after the bloody events and the murder of Serbs and other minorities, nothing has improved in Kosovo as regards the protection of minority rights."
"We see constant ethnic bloodshed, not to say ethnic cleansing against the minorities in Kosovo by the hard-line nationalistic gangs in Albania."
"Not only is UN Resolution 1244/1999 not being applied, it is also being undermined."
"None of the eight criteria set on the basis of the principle of 'standards before status' is being applied, it has not been implemented and I should like to ask the Commissioner what the European Union's policy is, if it will assent to the start of negotiations at the UN on the final status of Kosovo without these criteria having been met."
"The European Union designed a European strategy on the basis of the conclusions of the European Council in Thessaloniki."
"We support a multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo which will move towards future integration into the European institutions."
"That being so, however, we must help to shape stable democratic institutions."
"The European Commission must make use of Community programmes, such as CARDS to fund development programmes, and of education, culture and youth programmes for the benefit of all the citizens of Kosovo."
"The restoration of the churches and cultural monuments of the minorities, especially the Serb minority, must also be funded."
"To close, the European Parliament must take its responsibilities."
". Mr President, at the end of June I became aware of the fact that 35 thousand refugees are in deep trouble in Germany."
"They had all arrived from Kosovo six years ago."
"All of them are Roma."
"It does not matter whether we call them Ashkalis or ‘Egyptians’."
"In the first half of July, the chairmen of the fractions – except for the conservatives – urged the German Government in a letter to re-consider its decision."
"Namely, Germany has decided to repatriate 35 thousand Roma to Kosovo."
"To the very country where only six thousand Roma remained out of 150 thousand, and even this small group continues to live there in inhuman circumstances."
"They live in refugee camps in their own land."
"Severe lead pollution was detected in the refugee camp situated in northern Mitrovica, with lead levels six times higher than normal, resulting in many children being born with various impairments ever since."
"The houses that had been used by Roma before the war are now illegally occupied by Albanians or other people, or have been demolished."
"Germany has been thinking for six years about whether or not to grant refugee status to the Roma, and has now decided to send them back to Kosovo, to nothing."
"Another approximately 70 thousand Roma are living mostly illegally in other European or Balkan states, such as the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Macedonia, Serbia, etc."
"We have no mother country to take us in when we find ourselves in such a situation."
"When I propounded this debate, I actually asked that Europe as a whole take a position in this matter, and not that ten MEPs discuss the issue of minorities after 11 p.m. here in the European Parliament."
"We, the Members of the European Parliament, must exert an influence on Germany."
"Deportation must be stopped and the problem of Kosovo must be tackled."
". Mr President, since the arrival of the UN Mission in Kosovo in 1990, the Kosovo Liberation Army, or UCK, has been using torture, rape, targeted killings, arson and burning of Roma houses as methods of ethnic cleansing against the Roma community from Kosovo, Ashkali and Egyptians included."
"The UN administration did not find any appropriate measures to calm down the Kosovo-Albanian majority."
"On the contrary, many clear cases of anti-gypsyism are not prosecuted and charges are not even brought."
"Today Kosovo is a human rights vacuum."
"Access of Roma to housing, healthcare and jobs remains extremely difficult, while children stop attending school for security reasons or due to lack of money."
"It cannot be a surprise that many returnees are selling their property, unwilling to live in fear and indignity."
"In wartime citizens of all ethnic backgrounds flee."
"When war is over it is unacceptable that one or two ethnic groups are welcomed as citizens and codecision makers, whereas the others find themselves changed into disadvantaged groups, minorities and IDPs."
"This double standard approach on the basis of ethnic background is the worst scenario for the founding of an independent state."
"With the final status discussions drawing near, the exclusion of the Roma from the decision-making process would be one more proof of the lack of respect for East European citizens."
"The high level pan-European consortium ..."
"– Mr President, while we have been sitting in this House today, the German television station ARD has been presenting the 2005 Media Prizes for Cultural Diversity and Integration in Europe."
"The television prize in the information category was awarded to a report on forced deportations of asylum seekers and refugees at dawn."
"This is a harsh reality for what are possibly soon to be thousands of Ashkali and Egyptians, who in principle belong to the Roma family of peoples, and other Kosovars, who have often been living in Germany or other European countries for more than ten years, and whose children were born and have become socially integrated there."
"Sadly, in Kosovo they do not find even the most basic conditions for starting a new life."
"Their houses have been destroyed; the unemployment rate stands at approximately 60%."
"There is no free access to education, particularly for minorities."
"I find this irresponsible."
"I would appeal to the Commissioner to make every effort to prevent Member States carrying out forced returns, or for him to at least press for an increase in financial support."
"This also applies to the unacceptable situation, which has already been mentioned, of approximately 700 Roma living in camps in northern Mitrovica, for whose resettlement there are insufficient resources."
"This is a violation of fundamental human rights."
". Mr President, thank you for those remarks, of which I have taken due note."
"We will take them into account in our future work."
"I will begin by responding to the questions from Members Mohácsi, de Groen-Kouwenhoven and Kallenbach."
"There are three camps of internally displaced persons in northern Mitrovica for Roma Ashkali and Egyptian people."
"These sites suffer from major lead pollution as a result of the activities of the former Trepca mining complex and this poses a serious health risk to the inhabitants."
"In July 2004, the World Health Organization released a report on elevated platelet levels in those communities and recommended a set of emergency measures, including the evacuation of the centres."
"An agreement was signed in April 2005 by UNMIK, UNHCR, OSCE and the President of the Mitrovica Municipal Assembly, creating a framework for the return of former residents of the Roma Mahala to their homes in southern Mitrovica."
"Unfortunately, however, this process has not yet started."
"In the case of the Roma Mahala, we could not easily make funding available and so have communicated the request to all EU Member States through the Management Committee, asking them to consider making sufficient funds available."
"We will continue to raise this issue on the ground through our EU liaison office and the European Agency for Reconstruction, which works in that area."
"I would also like to respond to Mr Posselt's question concerning minority rights in different countries, in the EU, in accession countries and in our partner countries."
"It is true, as Mr Posselt said, that there are many violations inside the European Union."
"The minimum rights of minorities are set out in the relevant documents of the Council of Europe and the Convention on Human Rights."
"Some countries inside the European Union stick close to the minimum standards, while others go beyond that and have a very high level of minority rights and protection."
"As the Commissioner responsible for enlargement, I am faced with difficult situations, because it is hard for us to go beyond what some EU Member States practice."
"Nevertheless, we must practice what we preach when we are dealing with our partners, whether they are accession countries or countries in the wider world."
"That has to be taken into account, nevertheless."
"I agree that there is a case for working towards a more uniform definition of minority rights."
"In my view, human rights in general and the rights of minorities are at the heart of the European idea and of the European Union."
"Therefore, we should not see it as a static product but as a dynamic process which develops these rights at ever higher levels inside the European Union and throughout Europe."
"Finally, concerning the questions raised by several Members on the future of Kosovo and its standards and status, there is clearly an urgent need for the economic and social development of Kosovo."
"The level of unemployment depends on which statistics you look at."
"However, it is at least 40% and often more than 50%, and the situation on the ground is extremely difficult."
"People have no hope at the moment."
"Therefore it is high time to move from stability and reconstruction towards defining the status and working for economic and social development and for the real needs of citizens."
"That is why it is time for the European Union to move from a policy of standards before status to a policy of standards status so that we move forward in the status talks, ensuring that they can start soon and be conducted and concluded without unnecessary delay."
"In that context, it is worth noting that the Council has reached an agreement at working group level on the negotiating guidelines for the stabilisation and association agreement with Serbia and Montenegro."
"That is important because it enables us to open the negotiations on the stabilisation and accession agreement around the fifth anniversary of the democratic transition in Belgrade and, moreover, because it will make Serbia and Montenegro's European prospects concrete and tangible and will also pave the way for a genuine dialogue on Kosovo and a resolution of the question of its status without undue and unnecessary delays."
"The debate is closed."
"Roma living in Kosovo become victims of racial discrimination on a regular basis."
"Discrimination affects them in all areas of their lives."
"They live in the internment camp of Mitrovica in inhuman circumstances, their health is endangered by poisonous water in the wells, and the local authorities do not take appropriate measures to eliminate the problem."
"Refugee status must be granted to Roma coming from Kosovo."
"We often hear about Roma being repatriated, in spite of the fact that the prevailing international law clearly prohibits the repatriation of refugees."
"In this context I would also like to call to your attention the right to family reunification, which grants Roma, just like all other immigrants, the right for protection together with their families within the Member States."
"According to the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, legal immigration must be made possible to all victims of inhuman treatment and war who were forced to leave their country because they had lived in constant fear and danger, were persecuted, their homes were burnt down and their lives were in constant jeopardy."
"We must find a solution for the protection of these victims."
"Special attention must be paid to the situation of children because they are especially vulnerable."
"In my opinion, the issue of migration must soon be re-considered so that a solid European immigration policy can be developed."
"Opportunities for illegal immigration must be reduced and appropriate protection must be ensured for each legal immigrant within the European Union."
"There are rumours of 38 thousand refugees in Western Europe who have been forcibly repatriated to a country where their human rights are not granted."
"I would respectfully ask for the support of all fellow Members on this issue so that such a situation can never occur in our Europe."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0225/2005) by Ari Vatanen on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the Commission communication ‘European Road Safety Action Programme: halving the number of road accident victims in the European Union by 2010: a shared responsibility’ [2004/2162(INI)]."
". Mr President, it is a pity that this debate is taking place so late, because when you drive home on an empty stomach that can be a safety hazard too."
"Debate on traffic safety is a question of attitude."
"It is a question and a test of how we value human life."
"That is what it amounts to: is human life precious to us?"
"The figures regarding traffic safety are as bleak and grim as the weather outside tonight."
"There are about 50 000 deaths per year, about 2 million people are injured."
"It is the main cause of death in the under-50s age group."
"It costs about 2% of GNP, equivalent to EUR 200 billion."
"But that is only money."
"We have to realise that what is at stake is the human suffering."
"Why do we do so little?"
"It is because it is not the Concorde which crashes, it is not the pride of the UK and France which crashes."
"When that happened, all Concordes were grounded immediately."
"No stone was left unturned in seeking to remedy the problem."
"But when it comes to traffic safety, it is just one family crying here, another family crying there. Their lives are shattered, amputated."
"You do not recover from it."
"You have to live with it."
"And perhaps only those people who have experienced that know what the grief of a family means."
"When I was a small boy I was with my entire family in a motor car when my father was killed."
"I remember him leaning against the steering wheel, that anxiety in my chest."
"I am sure that experience has left me with a bigger internal handicap than I dare to admit."
"There is still so much that we could do and can do."
"First of all law enforcement."
"Okay, that is not an EU matter, it is not within our competence, but that is by far the most efficient way to get things done - through law enforcement, just abiding by and obeying the current rules."
"On the way here tonight I saw the French police carrying out an alcohol check."
"When more radars appeared on French roads, immediately fatalities came down."
"Sometimes I think that, although it is a matter for subsidiarity, EU citizens should be protected from their respective governments."
"I am sorry to say that, but that is how it is, because we do not seem to realise the magnitude of the problem."
"There are incredible discrepancies between different States."
"It is up to eight times safer in the UK or in Sweden than in some of the new Member States - eight times - imagine that incredible diversity!"
"We have to learn from one another."
"From now on we must carry out a systematic scrutiny of what is going from country to country."
"We have to render that transparent, so that people know about it, so that they make a noise about it, so that they create political pressure."
"We must coordinate our actions and we must disseminate our best practices."
"If we make mistakes, why should those mistakes be made in those countries which are still on the road to development?"
"We have to name, shame and fame."
"That leads to action."
"When people have been woken up they will demand action from the politicians in their various Member States."
"At an EU level we can promote new technology, we can promote new cars with fiscal incentives."
"At the moment a Chinese car is coming onto the European market, with no EU approval."
"That should be stopped, because it is downright dangerous."
"We must invest more money in infrastructure."
"We should have an infrastructure directive on TEN roads."
"Europeans are mobile thanks to the European road network."
"It is not justified, or fair on European competitiveness, that we should spend so much money on railways, which serve so little purpose compared to the road network."
"We have to be just in that allocation."
"Yet things are not so bleak."
"Traffic has grown threefold since 1970 and yet fatalities have been halved."
"So cultures can be changed."
"We must believe in the new generation."
"At the end of the day, whatever we do, responsibility always lies with the individual."
"At the end of the day we are responsible."
"Mr President, I know my time is up."
"The EU must act decisively."
"When our time really up, hopefully it will not happen on a road."
"There are still many small boys out there waiting for their fathers."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Vatanen for his excellent work."
"Over the next few months, the Commission will provide an assessment of the third Road Safety Action Programme and Mr Vatanen’s comprehensive and balanced report will provide useful fodder for the considerations that the Commission needs to take to prepare this mid-term review."
"This report demonstrates the need for common initiatives at European level."
"To follow up on the 2001 White Paper on European transport policy, the European Union had already set the objective of halving the number of deaths on the roads of the 15 Member States at that time by 2010."
"The benefit of this objective was that it mobilised each country within the framework of its national competences."
"The results are noticeable."
"Today, in the enlarged EU, some Member States have made remarkable progress in implementing credible and dissuasive control and sanction policies."
"In other countries, however, progress has been more modest and shows that considerable efforts remain to be made."
"We must recognise that the Union’s policy on road safety has remained in the embryonic stages for too long, because of the subsidiarity principle."
"You just have to think back to the unsuccessful debate on setting a general blood alcohol limit; and the current difficulties in making certain Member States adopt the revised directive on driving licences, even though it is essential for preventing fraud, also bear witness to this."
"Without anticipating the mid-term review that the Commission will publish shortly, three points in Mr Vatanen’s report are worth commenting on."
"Firstly, we need to ensure that the essential rules, whether with regard to speed limits, blood alcohol limits or the requirement to wear a seatbelt, are respected."
"At the moment, we cannot help but notice that Member States’ interventions against drivers who breach these rules are limited, in the absence of cross-border cooperation."
"I am particularly grateful to Mr Vatanen for advocating considerably closer cooperation between Member States to control and deal with offences."
"I would point out to you that the Commission intends to launch an initiative next year to improve the organisation of cross-border enforcement."
"My second comment relates to the improvement of infrastructure."
"Progress could be made everywhere and, in some Member States, considerable efforts are needed."
"The European Union, via the cofinancing that it provides under the Structural Funds, already contributes to the construction of safer and more modern infrastructure."
"A legislative instrument, as Mr Vatanen said, could prove necessary to make impact assessments, audits and road safety inspections, including dealing with black spots, more systematic."
"My third comment is that technological innovation in vehicles is a decisive element in road safety."
"A dialogue has been launched between the Commission and the European automotive industry."
"This relates to the initiative known as CARS 21, as part of which your Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection will soon organise a Parliamentary forum."
"The technical standards needed to enable innovations play an important role, but we must, as Mr Vatanen points out, properly understand the costs and benefits of these innovations before we bring them into widespread use."
"It is in this spirit that the Commission is currently assessing the possibilities for new initiatives to encourage the installation of mirrors that eliminate the blind spot and the use of daytime running lights."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would remind you that opinion polls show that European citizens put road safety at the top of their list of concerns, thus echoing what Mr Vatanen explained so well, illustrating his speech with some personal memories, which were very moving."
"The European Union cannot continue to do nothing in the face of the citizens’ worries."
"Of course, we must take subsidiarity into account, but, in view of the increase in international traffic on trans-European networks, in other words the number of foreign drivers on the main arterial routes of each country, we cannot avoid asking ourselves whether the limits currently set on the EU’s actions are the right ones and whether we should simply decide, in the name of subsidiarity, to leave the Member States to face this scourge alone."
"In order to achieve our consistent collective objective of reducing the number of deaths on the roads by 2010, above and beyond the initiatives that I have already mentioned, the exchanges of good practice and the initial considerations need to be as open as possible, and relate particularly to the adoption of measures targeted at professional drivers and at young drivers, who are particularly prone to accidents."
"Mr Vatanen’s report is therefore very timely."
"I would like to thank him for his very open reflections on the problem as a whole and I will listen attentively, Mr President, to the comments by the Members, who I know are keen to make progress on the good cause of road safety."
". – Mr President, imagine it is 31 December and the news tickers are announcing 50 000 dead and several million injured, some seriously, in Europe."
"What horror, what an outcry this information should provoke."
"Yet people are indifferent, unmoved."
"Was it a false alarm?"
"No; it was only that year’s statistics on victims of road accidents in the European Union."
"Have we really done enough to combat indifference towards road accidents and to improve road safety?"
"Could it be that vehicles are, after all, modern weapons in the hands of millions of Europeans?"
"There is no need to worry: no one in this House is considering banning vehicles; it is only in the way we use them that a decisive improvement is needed."
"I should like to extend my thanks and congratulations to Mr Vatanen for his excellent report."
"He succeeded in showing the complexity and interactions of hazards on our roads, so that both the Commission and the Member States can be obliged to do more towards the achievement of road safety in Europe."
"We urge the Commission to help towards accelerating the implementation of the Action Programme, and we also encourage it to develop a long-term road-safety concept, which goes far beyond 2010 and is oriented towards the ‘zero vision’, namely the avoidance of all fatalities caused by road accidents."
"I welcome the choice of an integrated approach, which takes into account all three components of road traffic: road users – drivers and pedestrians – the vehicles themselves, and also infrastructure such as roads and tunnels."
"Vehicles can be equipped with the latest technologies such as Electronic Stability Control, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, Intelligent Speed Adaptation or eCall, but there will be no improvement in safety unless there is intelligent interaction with the person actually doing the driving."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to thank Mr Vatanen for the huge job he has done on this report and for his dedication to it, and I would also like once again to express the frustration I feel given the great sense of expectation and potential I felt, knowing that Mr Vatanen was the rapporteur for this report."
"In his report, it is clear that his diagnosis is not wrong, in fact he acknowledges it, he emphasises it and presents it in such a dramatic fashion as the figures."
"The full magnitude of the problem is not therefore expressed."
"He also points out that there is a great discrepancy between the safety percentages of the different Member States, but I believe that that discrepancy does not exist in the diagnoses or in the most useful instrument: the legislation, setting limits and dissuasive measures."
"What is truly frustrating is to see that what we are proposing today for the European Union, for a Union in which, as the Commissioner has said quite rightly, we citizens are seeking a strong message and added value, in terms of what each Member State has been wisely imposing, there are great differences and, sometimes, enormous deficiencies, in relation to the legislation on speed limits, limits for alcohol in the blood and the use of safety belts."
"In this regard, we believe that this is the time to take that step and the Socialist Group has presented an amendment in which we call upon the Commission, following the evaluation of the Recommendation, specifically in the case of limits for alcohol in the blood, also to offer us the necessary legislative measures applicable to those three aspects that are fundamental, which all the European citizens and all the Member States recognise."
"But they also recognise that there are problems."
"And it is in relation to these coordination problems that the greatest weakness lies."
"We would therefore call on the Commission to be understanding and to accept our amendment."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to begin my minute-long speech by thanking the rapporteur, Ari Vatanen, for this excellent and thorough report."
"The report reflects Mr Vatanen’s expertise and experience."
"Moreover, his calling as someone who preaches road safety is reflected in this report in the form of positive mediation and action to support the aim to actually halve road deaths by the year 2010, which is our common objective."
"The report contains some excellent proposals concerning compliance with rules and legal provisions relating to seatbelts, speed limits and alcohol."
"It is very important to invest in roads and to remember the importance of education and enlightened attitudes."
"In addition to this, we need awareness, since the biggest threat on the roads is always to be found between the steering wheel and the driver’s seat."
"Mr President, I too should like to say thank you for, above all, the first part of Mr Vatanen’s introduction today."
"I thought it was a quite brilliant description of the extent of the problem."
"The problem is on a horribly huge scale, and it is appalling that we are not doing anything more serious about it."
"Indeed, I have to say that the proposals produced by Mr Vatanen really have no bearing on the extent of the problem."
"The larger and broader roads would be there for many more cars to drive faster on."
"We can say with some certainty that the result would be more accidents when, instead, we should be limiting traffic."
"I am delighted that the report mentions vulnerable road users and that the aim is to have no accidents at all."
"The fact is, however, that this report would offer no protection at all to vulnerable road users unless we were to have the amendments adopted that would set fixed speed limits in Europe, namely a maximum of 130 km per hour on motorways and 30 km per hour in towns, and unless, at the same time, something serious were done to have these requirements complied with."
"I think that the proposals, pathetic as they are, fall spectacularly short of dealing with the problems so splendidly described by Mr Vatanen."
"Mr President, I too wish to thank Mr Vatanen for this report and for a notable piece of work."
"What we face is a serious problem, but I want to point out that we are on the right road in Europe."
"We have a huge number of fatalities – far too many; indeed, no figure is acceptable – but the numbers are going down."
"It is important for Europe to be a model in the global work to promote road safety, and that is something we can be."
"We are a model where technical development is concerned."
"If we obtain better cars in Europe and the rest of the world, we shall reduce the number of fatalities."
"We must make use of constructive examples, such as the proposal we have in Amendment 5 whereby those purchasing haulage services would be urged to demand road safety from those selling the services."
"Use can be made of legislation, for example in relation to alcohol and driving, for we know that no one should ever drive when drunk."
"I do not, however, think that legislation should be used as a tool where speed is concerned, because the state of a road can vary a very great deal, and one road be in a different condition to another."
"We need, then, not to take a uniform view of road safety."
"In that way, we can set a good example to the rest of the world."
". Mr President, I will be fairly brief, but that is not to say that I am underestimating this problem, which is a major one."
"I am therefore very pleased with this debate."
"I find comfort in the conviction that effective control is vital."
"It is true that we must have a better influence on the behaviour of drivers, particularly of young drivers."
"We must also not forget the importance of education from a very early age and we must mobilise all our energy and gather all our resources to combat this scourge."
"That is clearly a responsibility shared between the European Union, our Member States and our regions, but also by every one of us."
"I would like to say quite simply, echoing Mr Vatanen’s report, that the three institutions of the Union now seem to be converging towards the same objective: namely the desire to make progress down this path."
"It is about time, because we have gone from 50 000 deaths to 43 000 deaths in the 25 Member States."
"We are a long way from reaching the targets we set ourselves."
"As a consequence, we are going to have to redouble our efforts."
"As for the Council, on 4 and 5 November we will hold an informal meeting in Verona on the subject of road safety."
"I also know that the Austrian Presidency will also want to work hard to come up with new solutions."
"I am therefore delighted that Parliament feels so committed and I must say that, with regard to the Commission’s commitment and to my own personal commitment, you can be certain that I really will make every possible effort both to convince the Member States to get involved in considerably more courageous policies and to assess what the European Union, at its level, can provide and require."
"That is why this report is so very apropos, and it comes as a wake-up call for consciences in this matter, which, indeed, requires from all of us resolute and determined ethical behaviour."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The target of achieving a further reduction of 50 % of road accident victims by 2010 might be ambitious but not impossible through proper and combined measures."
"The setting of targets, allocation of responsibilities and proper planning can contribute to the success of this ambitious programme."
"Legislation, social acceptance, planning and monitoring are integrated elements of this strategy."
"There is a striking diversity between Member States in many aspects which should be taken into consideration: cultural, diversity in attitude and, one of the biggest difference, economic wealth, the latter being the major cause of bad quality of road, limited length of highways."
"This is also one of the reasons of grave road safety records of most of the ten new Member States this is mainly why we are lagging far behind the EU-15."
"I’m sure that the introduction of the European driving licence, the strict conditions to get that licence and enabling the physical and mental faculties of drivers and their driving skills checked over time is a must."
"It is extremely important that proper continuously updated information and monitoring network throughout the EU should be established which could help a lot with cooperation of authorities in road safety surveillance."
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on the textile industry."
". Mr President, Commissioner, on 10 June, Mr Mandelson concluded an agreement with China that makes it possible to monitor and limit imports of certain Chinese textiles to the European Union until the end of 2008."
"However, the implementation of this agreement has run into some difficulties, such as the piling up of many goods in European ports, on which subject you have already spoken to us."
"Today, following the agreement of 5 September, we hope, Commissioner, that we can avoid new supply blockages, and avoid the entry onto European markets of additional quantities outside the Shanghai Agreement."
"Similarly, we would hope that the revised agreement could take appropriate account of the interests not only of the European textile industry, which has put a great deal of effort into adjusting, but also of textile producers in developing countries who have suffered the consequences of the liberalisation of this sector."
"Finally, Commissioner, how can we envisage building a sustainable future for the European textile industry beyond 2008?"
"In the light of the recommendations of the Textiles High Level Group and of the European Parliament’s own-initiative report, what are the foundations for this future?"
"In addition, the crisis linked to Chinese textiles has taken on, in addition to social and industrial aspects, a geopolitical dimension."
"I therefore think that we must now ask ourselves how, in the long term, the European Union views its commercial relations with its major partners, particularly with China."
"We will also have the opportunity to debate this point when we discuss Mrs Lucas’s report."
"In the meantime, we must identify new avenues of development for the European Union’s industrial sectors, which will, in future, enable us to anticipate imbalances and to provide a competitive response to all global challenges."
"The European Union must, at the next WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong, support its partners’ efforts to combat the counterfeiting and piracy of textiles and clothing by effectively implementing the agreement on intellectual property rights, negotiate reciprocal access to the market by insisting on the removal of technical barriers to trade, and see to it that the social and environmental standards are applied by all."
"Would that not, Commissioner, be the best way of ensuring that, ultimately, we could all trade on an equal footing?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission on concluding the textile negotiations with a positive outcome."
"We know how complicated and how difficult that was and our Group would like to congratulate you warmly on that."
"I very much regret that the Council is not present for this debate."
"We have just seen how necessary it is for the Member States to act coherently, and I find the Council’s absence from this debate most unfortunate;"
"I would like it to be informed that we are not happy about it."
"I would like to return to a few points that Mrs Saïfi has already raised."
"The safeguard measures were introduced in the context of the WTO negotiations; that also shows how skilfully the Commission, the Member States and the relevant parliamentary committee negotiated at the time."
"We in Parliament have always said that this is necessary."
"Regarding the first crisis we have just seen with safeguard measures, Commissioner, I would like to ask you something on behalf of my Group."
"Do you believe that the safeguard measures proposed during the WTO talks and agreed to by China are adequate in the light of the crisis?"
"Do you think that the safeguard measures perhaps need to be reviewed again and possibly amended?"
"When you reply, which you are welcome to do in writing, I should be grateful if you would again make an assessment of the Member States’ role in this crisis and suggest what must be changed in future."
"There is one point you raised, Commissioner, with which I wholeheartedly agree."
"You said that China has already become a political and economic world power."
"That clearly shows, of course, that many of the talks we have held in the past, in the WTO or in connection with other international agreements, are now presenting us with a new challenge."
"We are now dealing with major world powers: China, India, too, in other areas with its software industry, Brazil when it comes to sugar."
"What challenges do you believe the European Union will have to face in the future in the light of this situation?"
"You said that business is capable of taking on the competition and pointed out that we are the second largest exporter."
"My question, on behalf of my Group, is this: do you believe that is enough?"
"Do we need to do more, especially for small and medium-sized businesses?"
"Do you think the aid we sometimes give to firms, many of which even then are guilty of outsourcing, is sufficient?"
"Or would you as the Commission suggest that we need more controls to keep a proper check on it?"
"My final question is this. What do you think of the idea of introducing a European label for products, including textiles, so people can see the conditions under which they were made and the standards to which they were produced?"
"Finally, thank you again and I look forward to your answer."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I have been trying to figure out for some time why people have not seen the disturbing developments of textile dumping from China coming any sooner, even though these developments could be clearly deduced from the product categories that were liberalised before."
"I hope you will not mind me saying this, but the measures that were taken on 5 September to eliminate the quotas, particularly those on the textile products that were blocked in European ports, are reminiscent of a game of panic football."
"It is obvious that the memorandum of understanding, which Commissioner Mandelson brokered with China in June, and which entailed the imposition of quantitative import restrictions on ten product categories, was very badly prepared."
"How else can we explain why less than two months later, the quota for 2005 has already been used up?"
"The blocked goods were hurriedly cleared, and the June agreement ignored, with all the confusion that this entailed for producers, traders, buyers and consumers in the textile industry."
"I have a few very concrete questions, Commissioner."
"Where do we go from here?"
"How can the existing uncertainty and confusion be dispelled in an industry that is struggling as it is?"
"How do people envisage the further implementation of June’s memorandum of understanding?"
"How will imports from China be monitored in the coming months?"
"And what if, within a few weeks’ time, another load of clothing is stuck in European ports?"
"And what about the quotas laid down for subsequent years?"
"As you can see, the latest agreement with China clearly produces far more questions than it answers, and I fear, Commissioner, that the Commission does not have those answers either."
"I hope you can convince me otherwise."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are now seeing in the textile sector is the beginning of a trend or the emergence of a trend that has been going on for some time and is going to accelerate and become more acute."
"We are faced with the fact that world trade is no longer what we used to imagine it would be in the future."
"We always assumed that we here in Europe would do high-tech, while everyone else would supply us with cheap raw materials and cover our basic needs, as it were."
"That strategy is not working because development has proceeded much quicker, as with textiles in China, for example."
"If we are now saying that the agreement, the memorandum of understanding, has given us a breathing space, then it really is nothing more than that and will at best only slow the trend down somewhat, but it will not solve the underlying problems."
"Europe is not adapting quickly enough."
"I also note that European interests are divided in this matter, between consumers, traders and politicians."
"Consumers want cheap T-shirts."
"At the same time, a growing number of people in Europe are supporting campaigns like the Clean Clothes Campaign, promoting products that have been made under fairer conditions."
"People want ethical standards in production; they also want ecological standards in production."
"At the same time, however, everyone wants to have these low-cost products."
"The traders are the same."
"I would like to ask you a question, Commissioner."
"If you say you believe the Commission acted diligently, how could the fact that any amount of Chinese-made products have piled up in the ports within a very short space of time be overlooked?"
"I fail to understand how European Heads of Government can attend the opening of firms that have relocated to China and then come home and complain about competition from China."
". Mr President, there is none so deaf as he who will not hear."
"This is a proverb that applies very well to the Commission and to Commissioner Mandelson."
"At a time when the textile sector is experiencing a true industrial and social disaster, they were listening, but they were not hearing."
"In the matter that put us in opposition to China, the European Union threw in the towel by agreeing to reassess the import quotas."
"The proposals and calls for help from employees’ unions and professional associations in the sector went unheeded."
"The only winners in this affair are the dealers that fear neither God nor man, the saboteurs of European industry, masters of delocalisation at all costs."
"Demonstrating quite extraordinary courage, the Commission and the Commissioner jointly decided that, faced with hundreds of thousands of job losses, faced with the closure of thousands of businesses, they urgently needed to do nothing."
"They therefore hid behind this schoolyard phrase ‘20 million Chinese or Indian shirts equals one Airbus’."
"This equation is particularly stupid, because even an absolute imbecile knows that it is not the textile producers who buy Airbuses but the airlines."
"I can even tell you a secret: when these companies buy aeroplanes, it is because they need them, and they expect to fund these purchases from their activities, not by selling shirts."
"Moreover, the United States was able to sell its Boeings at the same time as taking the necessary measures to protect its textile industry."
"Faced with these pressures, with the anger of European workers and, above all, with the approach of the French referendum on the Constitution, you very strategically pulled out some tempting proposals, which were immediately received enthusiastically by all your friends in the club of two-faced hypocrites but which very quickly turned out to be nothing but smoke and mirrors."
"As you declared so cynically, globalisation is a game in which there are winners and losers, but we cannot say that to the people, so we are sometimes required to take tactical measures."
"In order to defend the interests of employees in the textile industry ..."
". Mr President, Commissioner, the textile industry is in crisis."
"Two egocentric ideas are threatening it: the single-minded attitude that refuses to see what is wrong with the new international division of labour."
"Today, even the high-tech industries are leaving the continent."
"We must fight against this deindustrialisation of Europe and not surrender to this mirage of the tertiary sector above all."
"The other idea is that of the ideology of the EU which consists, in your view, Commissioner, in seeing this industry as a relict and China being forced to look outwards as a smooth transition."
"We must open our eyes if we are to save this industry."
"We must re-establish the principle of Community preference as provided for in the Treaty of Rome so that competition is not competition between social systems."
"We must re-establish a competitive monetary policy so that we can fight on an equal footing against the monetary dumping of the dollar and of the yuan."
"In the immediate future, let us encourage China to concentrate on supplying its internal market, let us re-establish the quotas according to the 2004 standards and let us not forget the poor textile-exporting countries that are the main victims of this irresponsible policy."
"Mr Mandelson said that ‘the EU is the most open economy in the world’."
"I will translate: ‘It is the least protected economy in the world’."
"Mr President, Commissioner, seeing one child die every minute in the developing world from whooping cough or from measles, when there is a vaccine, is heartbreaking."
"Well, it is the same for textiles and delocalisation."
"Watching jobs dying, watching businesses dying by the thousand, seeing all of these diseases of globalisation, when there is the possibility of developing new customs technology, is an incredible piece of obscurantism."
"I have explained this to Mr Mandelson."
"Today, the old generation of customs duties is highly complex, with quotas, tariff peaks and non-tariff barriers."
"It is all technically complex and inefficient."
"We could, however, make it much simpler."
"We simply need to invent, as we in France did for VAT in 1954, a customs duty deduction."
"Under this principle, the customs duty payable on the textiles would provide the Chinese exporter with a customs credit that would be deductible on his purchases in Europe."
"The Chinese exporter could use this customs credit, either on the stock market or by rediscounting it to the banks, and, very simply, we would have invented customs VAT, which has taken 50 years to spread."
"I have explained this to Mr Danet, Secretary-General of the World Customs Organisation."
"I have sent a note to Mr Mandelson."
"Seeing where we have ended up because of technological obscurantism, though, being unable to invent a new generation of customs duties, is heartbreaking, Mr President."
"– Mr President, the go-ahead for the unblocking of Chinese textiles was clearly a concession to China."
"It is contrary to the Shanghai philosophy of a controlled increase in imports in order to give the European industry time to adapt."
"The bureaucracy of the Commission bears a great deal of responsibility here."
"The Commission has given preference to the interests of importers."
"The crisis in a traditional industry, the European textile industry, comes before them."
"Factories are closing one after the other."
"Workers' jobs come before the interests of importers."
"That is the European interest and the European Commission, the guardian of European interest, is being called on to protect it."
"I personally am not in favour of neo-protectionist trends in international trade."
"Nonetheless, aggressive Chinese imports demonstrate that the balance of the world trade system depends on converging systems, institutional transparency and converging social and environmental protection standards."
"It also depends on effective protection for intellectual and industrial property and avoiding economic, social and ecological dumping practices."
"In addition, I believe that effective measures for the gradual adaptation of the European textile industry are needed, as are the necessary balancing measures in keeping with WTO law."
"The Commission needs to leave all the bombast behind."
"We, Parliament, have Mrs Saïfi's report and the relevant motion which accompanies it; we are pointing out the way forward for the European Commission."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the recent review of the memorandum of understanding with China, which took place on 5 September, is perhaps today a lesser evil rather than an actual success."
"This review stems from the Commission’s apparent inability to guarantee compliance with the international agreements to which it is signatory."
"The flood of textiles since January 2005 had been on the cards and it is appalling that the Commission was neither ready for it, nor sufficiently flexible to react to it."
"Furthermore, the practice of reviewing in September an agreement to which it had signed up under oath three months earlier does the Commission no credit on the international stage and severely weakens it in future negotiations."
"The Commission’s fragility is alarming and has, worse, instilled among European businesses, producers and importers alike, an atmosphere of uncertainty in terms of marking out strategies, which we must act quickly to dispel."
"I should therefore be grateful, Commissioner, for direct answers to the following four questions:"
"One: the Commission continues to regulate production in the EU, for example with the Reach Directive."
"What specific plan does the Commission have in order to ensure that the opening up of Europe’s markets will actually be accompanied by international compliance with minimum rules on human rights, the environment and workers’ rights?"
"Two: the high-level textiles group has recommended a range of political measures aimed at speeding up the process of revitalising the competitiveness of European textile regions, a recommendation accepted by the Commission."
"You referred to these initiatives, albeit very briefly."
"What exactly is the state of play with regard to these measures and to what extent does their implementation depend on the financial perspective?"
"Question three: what guarantees can the Commission give us that the September agreement will not suffer the same fate as the June agreement?"
"What capacity and/or desire has the Commission acquired since that time to monitor the agreement and ensure that it is honoured?"
"Question four: given that the problems facing the footwear industry are similar to those of the textiles sector, can the Commission confirm the rumours that anti-dumping measures are in the pipeline for implementation in 2006?"
"Thank you very much in advance for your answer, Commissioner."
"Mr President, I represent a constituency with a long history of leading in the textiles trade."
"The cotton mills of Lancashire helped form the backbone of the industrial revolution in the United Kingdom."
"Much of that has changed over the years."
"Mills that once employed thousands now employ in the very low hundreds."
"It was unfortunate in Lancashire that the management of the process was not provided at a governmental level and many valued people found themselves with redundant skills overnight."
"The provision of knowledge to empower and innovate was not catered for at a national level."
"The new changing circumstances that we face must not be allowed to be a repetition of that experience, but rather a window through which we evolve our industry."
"The so-called 'bra wars' have been the unfortunate side effect of our lack of foresight and preparation."
"Nobody is expecting change overnight."
"We should not forget how remarkable it is that China and Europe have found themselves able to reach such a compromise under immense pressure, but the first tentative steps must be taken immediately before the situation worsens."
"We require management, not protectionist measures."
"The agreement reached is a sticking plaster on future trade relations with China and European industry must find a way to compete with low-cost competitors."
"Commissioner, I am sure you will agree that current circumstances cannot be allowed to continue."
"What specific measures do you intend to initiate immediately to provide the management that EU producers so require?"
"We simply cannot be caught unprepared and off guard again."
"Mr President, I wish firstly to thank the Commission for not, as it happened, allowing things to go completely wrong."
"If EU industry is to have a chance in the future, it will not be heavy industry that holds its own but industry that is leanest, most environmentally sound and most knowledge-intensive and that also goes easy on resources. What we have witnessed in this case has, in fact, been quite shocking."
"It is specifically the old-fashioned heavy industries that have tried to do others serious damage by invoking state protection in accordance with the most repellent traditions of the rich OECD countries whose desire has been to protect their own markets but force poor countries to open up theirs. As a rule, the result has been twice as much harm caused to the poor."
"The fact is, the rich countries must open themselves up and also pin their hopes on renewal."
"It was of course in order to guarantee this whole process that ten years were spent on developing the Multifibre Agreement."
"There are, in actual fact, countries that have taken these matters seriously and that have managed to adapt, and without job losses."
"Going back on the agreements would penalise those countries, for they cannot possibly compete successfully with government-protected sunset industries."
"This is of course exactly the same as what is happening within the chemical industry, where another ‘Chemical Ali’, backed by governments, is coming along and trying to destroy modern industries."
"We must hope that the industry we obtain is one that can hold its own, even if the poor countries get their act together, and we must do everything we can to help the poor countries thrive."
"That is not something I can go into here – there is not time to do so – but that is what the aim must be, rather than that of isolating ourselves again to the detriment of everyone concerned."
"– We had hoped for something fresh from the Commission."
"We had hoped for practical measures backed by appropriate, urgently-needed resources to implement important proposals laid down in Parliament’s resolution of 6 September."
"What we heard, however, was more of the same, and attempts at defending the indefensible."
"Let us cast our minds back:"
"On 1 January, the liberalisation of the textiles and clothing sector was accompanied by an exponential increase in imports to the EU."
"The Barroso Commission had been warned of the grave social and economic consequences for countries such as Portugal, and of the pressing need to activate the safeguard clauses provided for in the trade agreements."
"Yet it was not until 6 April that it implemented these clauses, albeit watering down the impact of their implementation."
"It then took until 17 May for it to open talks on just two categories of textile products, leading to the presentation on 10 June of an agreement, which quite apart from turning its back on the use of the safeguarded clauses, was laden with booby-traps."
"Once again, because of the absence of regulation on implementation, it did not enter into force until 20 July, which gave the large European multinational importers and distributors time to undermine the import limits agreed in June."
"In September, the Commission, pandering to the wishes of the large multinationals, this time acted quickly, and forced the admission of millions of textile and clothing items, going back on what it had itself agreed."
"The moral of the story is that those who have gained from the liberalisation of the textiles and clothing trade are the large importers and distributors; it is they who have raised their profit margins to ever more outlandish levels."
"The losers are the European textiles industry, the workers and the thousands of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises."
"First of all I would like to express my satisfaction with the fact that the Commission has agreed to restrict the import of Chinese textiles, which have swamped Europe and the developed world, even though it has unfortunately taken exactly one year to do so, during which time events have unfolded as expected."
"Last year, when the Commission was informed of the forecast, and a few politicians, myself included, were sounding the alarm, Europe failed to say anything and sent no warning signals, either to China or to the retail chains, and failed to prepare in time for rapid monitoring."
"It was a mistake not to make it clear to retailers before they signed contracts that the EU would take protective measures and limit the growth in imports to acceptable levels, and that we would not foolishly sit back and watch an industry that provides work for millions of women in southern and central Europe die out."
"Unfortunately limits were imposed only after six months had passed, after massive import contracts had been signed, and after the goods had clogged up European ports."
"It was clear that the Chinese expected vast quantities of goods to be allowed into Europe."
"This agreement turned out to be a mere scrap of paper."
"This begs the question of whether it was meant in earnest."
"Critics say that it was just a matter of reassuring the European Parliament."
"I do not share this view, which is why, on behalf of Czech textile workers and others, I demand that the quotas be enforced for one further year, until the end of 2008."
"This would balance out the agreed limits that were exceeded after June."
"Above all, however, I would call for this respite to be used to change the EU’s trading strategy."
"All economic and political levers should be used to force communist China to open its own markets on a reciprocal basis, to accept the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and thus to comply with minimum standards in the near future."
"It should also be forced to stop circumventing the ban on state subsidies to exporting companies, to limit trade piracy and to assume partial responsibility for industrial waste and for repairing environmental damage."
"I believe that the EU will ultimately become a strong player on the world stage, and that the Commissioner will become a strategic decision maker, rather than simply an arbitrator of the occasional dispute."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the reality is that the total opening up of the textile trade on 1 January of this year led to an avalanche of Chinese products."
"The Commission proposed restricting these imports and, as a result, reached the agreement in June."
"Taking advantage of the time period necessary to establish this agreement, however, certain European importers accumulated a large quantity of goods."
"The new agreement of 5 September 2005 contributes to resolving this problem, which had reached a point at which it was not benefiting anybody."
"But that agreement cannot be described as satisfactory, because it has given the impression that there has been a lack of rigour."
"Some people have said, right here today, that the textile industry should have adapted more quickly because it had known what was going to happen for the last 10 years."
"But I would predict that, if we do not deal with these challenges in an ordered manner, though we are talking about textiles today, tomorrow we may be talking about cars or communications and information technology products."
"This is not an argument between free trade and protectionism, but rather what we want is increasing, but fair and transparent, trade, which respects minimum social and environmental standards."
"Finally, I would like to draw your attention to a situation that is causing alarm in the sector."
"In addition to the well-known distribution chains that produce goods in China at stable prices, unfamiliar makes have appeared that declare unusually low prices, which do not even cover the cost of the raw materials for the product."
"For example, prices of trousers entering the Union can oscillate between EUR 6 and EUR 0.43; in both cases we are talking about trousers produced in China."
"In my country, these practices represent around 40% of imports originating from China."
"I suspect, Commissioner, that we are dealing with a case of fraud, in which the value declared in customs is being used to reduce the importer’s tax bill, both in terms of the Community tariff and in terms of VAT."
"I would therefore like to know what decisions the Commission is going to take in this regard."
"Mr President, yet another business in the south-west of France has just announced that it intends to cease production."
"As a result, 54 textile workers specialised in the production of luxury cloth are at risk of long-term unemployment in an already devastated region."
"The situation we are experiencing is catastrophic."
"Large numbers of jobs have been lost in this sector since the start of 2005."
"The recommendations from the high-level group prepare for the future but what will happen in the short term?"
"Commissioner, you say that we have a respite period of two and a half years, following the agreements that you have signed."
"However, we must act fast, and I would suggest a number of paths worth considering: authorise the Member States to use the Structural Funds reserve to assist businesses suffering cash-flow problems, and to help them to innovate and restructure; assist businesses in creating consortiums so that they can form a true commercial force able to conquer the Chinese market; impose social and environmental criteria; require product labelling that indicates the country of origin; and, finally, as the speakers before me have already said, create true European labels."
"– Mr President, the problems in the European textile industry were foreseeable several years ago and they would not have been an isolated example, given that similar situations exist in the production of other goods, such as footwear, automobiles, steel etc."
"Capitalist restructurings in world trade, especially in the textile industry, result in huge profits for large textile export and distribution groups and big business in general."
"At the same time, thousands of workers are being thrown out into the street of unemployment."
"According to the official statistics of the European Textile Organisation, 1 million jobs will be lost in the Member States by the end of 2006."
"What is all this talk of the invasion of Chinese products into the Member States trying to hide?"
"Obviously it is trying to hide the responsibilities of the European Union and the governments of the Member States, the anti-grass roots policy whose criteria are competitiveness and the profit of big companies, of big business."
"The workers need to draw the necessary political conclusions, given that the statistic quoted in the relevant reports is this: that 60% of Chinese exports to the rest of the world come from foreign investments in China."
"That is why radical changes are needed at the level of the economy and government for fair international trade and grass-roots prosperity."
"Mr President, the textile industry is highly wage- and labour-intensive."
"It consists mainly of small and medium-sized firms and has successfully gone through a great deal of structural change in Europe in the last 30 years."
"We are not at the beginning."
"The crisis that has now been triggered by the dramatic rise in imports from China is not, however, affecting companies in the European Union alone; it is those in some of the world’s poorest countries, Bangladesh for example, that are primarily affected."
"They are the ones that are suffering the most."
"So is our customs union partner Turkey."
"It would be completely wrong for the European Union now to insist unilaterally on new subsidies."
"As the Commissioner rightly said, we need to concentrate on innovation, on efficient methods of production."
"On the international stage, of course, the Commission must enforce standards and try to ensure that fair conditions for competition prevail."
"Unfortunately, I am unable to join in the eulogies that say the Commission got everything right in 2005."
"It waited too long."
"The high-level group constantly put us off."
"Then it gave only half a response, did not know that imports were piling up in the ports."
"The praise for the Commission is therefore very muted."
"I would also like to make clear, however, that there are two sides to the question we are debating today."
"Consumer prices are also involved."
"We cannot ignore the fact that our consumers in the European Union like being able to buy low-price textiles."
"Europe’s two largest groups, H[amp]M and Zara, are proving tremendously popular with consumers."
"This, too, is connected with the fact that the international division of labour cannot be stopped in such a labour-intensive sector."
"The Commission can however, especially this year, provide a better and more sensible environment for it than in the past."
"I call on the Commissioner to act sooner and more decisively, not to devise new programmes of subsidies but to ensure that conditions are fair."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in the course of this debate you have received a few congratulations and many criticisms."
"I think that, above and beyond all the polemic, this is due to Parliament’s grave concern regarding the future of the textile industry and above all, which is the striking aspect of this matter, due to the perceived lack of foresight on the part of the Commission and of the Member States."
"True, you have mentioned an unprecedented increase in volume, but this increase in import volumes was anything but unpredictable."
"Everyone knew what we were dealing with regarding the end of the multi-fibre agreement and the lifting of quotas on 1 January this year."
"Consequently, I cannot understand why we had to wait for so long for the Commission to react."
"We had the option of bringing safeguard clauses into play, which is permitted under the WTO’s rules."
"It was not at all necessary to wait for agreement from the Chinese, nor to wait until June."
"Furthermore, we also question the conditions under which the protocol signed on 10 June has been implemented and the way in which we ended up in this imbroglio of 85 million products piled up in Customs and breaches of the quotas agreed for 2005."
"How is it that appropriate measures were not provided for when the agreement was signed and what guarantee do we have that the conditions of this agreement can be kept for the two and a half years to which you referred and which are supposed to give the sector time to organise its restructuring."
"The professional textile and clothing association has signalled the loss of 165 000 jobs since the beginning of the year and projects that one million jobs will be put at risk by the end of the year."
"Can you confirm these figures?"
"What measures does the European Commission intend to take?"
"Can the restructuring fund, which was defended by Mr Špidla and the previous Commission, be used to help the employment areas and businesses worst affected?"
"Finally, several speakers have referred to the structural problems now posed by competition with China, which distorts competition in reality, according to the WTO’s rules: export subsidies and hidden aid, such as the provision of electricity or interest-free loans given to state-owned businesses by state-owned banks."
"We could also ask ourselves whether it is time to raise the question, along with the other partners of the European Union within the WTO that are targeted by this increase in Chinese imports – Bangladesh, Turkey, Tunisia and Morocco – of fundamental social standards."
"Does the Commission intend to talk to these partners and to put these subjects on the negotiating table, particularly at the Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong?"
"Mr President, the European textile industry is in crisis, and China is being blamed for that."
"This House’s left-wing Members in particular are calling for the market to be sealed off again."
"The Committee on Regional Development is calling for new programmes to support the European textile industry."
"Sealing off and subsidies – if that is all we can think of in this age of globalisation, then this sector must be in a really bad way in Europe."
"Fortunately, the European textile and clothing industry is a lot further ahead than the politicians, because the companies in question have been facing up to global competition for decades."
"For a long time now, they have been strengthening their competitive core areas in the European Union: research, marketing and finishing, and developing supplier structures in the Far East, especially in China."
"The European textile industry did not receive any subsidies for this structural change."
"That is why more than 100 000 jobs were lost in the Dutch-German border region, for example."
"Unemployment is nevertheless now far below average in the regions concerned."
"That is precisely because there were no subsidies to preserve the existing structure."
"It is because the European Union supported structural change outside the textile industry, in technology centres and redevelopment, for example; you remember the RETEX programme from the past."
"New programmes specifically to support the textile industry are not the way."
"Firms in Europe that have regained their health by slimming down would not understand if their ‘reward’ was now to have to compete with neighbours that were suddenly subsidised."
"Instead of distorting competition with subsidies, we must shape the regulatory environment."
"This includes, for example, making patent protection easier, prosecuting product and trademark pirates consistently and expanding research capacities, particularly in nanotechnology, new materials and production processes."
"We must help the affected regions, not by using operating subsidies to delay structural change but by pursuing an active structural policy."
"– Mr President, the textile and clothing industry in Greece is in dire straits."
"I should like to quote the Commission certain statistics: in 2004 alone, redundancies exceeded 15 000."
"Recently, new textile factories have closed in areas of Greece such as Corinth, Thessaloniki and Thrace."
"It is a crucial problem and the traditional productive fabric of the country is being damaged and unemployment is increasing."
"However, this is a wider problem; it is a European, not a national problem."
"That is why active rather than passive intervention is needed."
"The question is how is the European Union reacting and how is it making use of the mechanisms of the World Trade Organisation."
"The question is what integrated European policy does Europe have at its disposal to modernise and strengthen the competition of the European textile industry."
"European citizens do not believe today that the Shanghai agreement was the most correct framework; or they probably believe that it was very late coming."
"Just as European citizens believe that the September agreement achieved by the Commission will not stand up."
"The problem will bounce back even more strongly next year."
"It is very difficult, Commissioner, to persuade the European citizens losing their jobs and finding themselves unemployed that the European Union has every interest in full liberalisation because it can export its goods and services to China."
"This is simply because not all European countries have heavy industry, they do not all produce cars and airbuses."
"The European Commission needs to formulate a new integrated strategy for the textile industry in the run-up to the crucial milestone of 2008."
"It needs to be more proactive in defending the rights of the European Union at the World Trade Organisation."
"To close, I call on the Commissioner for the European Commission to tell us what it intends to do about the textile companies financed from Community funds which then either relocated outside Europe or closed."
"It is a particularly important issue which requires an immediate response from the European Commission."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, nothing is so susceptible to structural change as the textile industry."
"We went through this painful experience in Austria a few years ago, when the textile industry in the province of Vorarlberg, where it had traditionally been based, collapsed overnight as a result of relocation to other countries – at that time to Hungary, and later to Romania, then Ukraine, now Serbia, and so on."
"Today we are faced with a global phenomenon."
"The trade conflict with China has made us all very much aware of this."
"What did we do?"
"We adapted, we went in for modern technologies, we went into research, we created an economic environment that has made Vorarlberg one of the most modern high-tech locations in Europe and has made it competitive."
"What I am saying is, we must create an environment where the European Union can be competitive, too."
"What has happened in the past, wavering between liberalisation on the one hand and applying the brake by reintroducing protectionist measures on the other, cannot be the way."
"We must find more sustainable solutions, sustainable solutions that also ensure that we know the conditions under which products are made."
"It is clear that China is taking a lot of measures to help state enterprises that are also distorting competition here, such as interest-free loans from state banks, export subsidies, hidden subsidies in the form of free electricity supplies, etc."
"I remember attending a short conference held by one of Europe’s textile manufacturers and traders, who pointed out that China is quite naturally pushing its textile products on to the market because half its earnings have to be in foreign currency."
"If we are talking to China, we should therefore also be stressing that Chinese firms should be relieved of this pressure."
"That would unquestionably help the European textile industry."
"Mr President, unlike many of the previous speakers I would like to say that the Commission has done well in the case of textiles, in this situation of conflict between industry and trade where everyone in the European Union was trying to go behind the other’s back."
"The Commission has done well with the measures it took in connection with the talks with China."
"Before we spend a long time talking about where the textile industry is going and what we can keep here, it would be better – and I am saying this as a member of a textile trade union – to talk about an orderly withdrawal of the textile and clothing industry within the European Union."
"That does not mean there will be no textile industry at all – quite the contrary."
"There will still be the technical textile sector, high-tech with nanotechnology, the beginnings of which we already have."
"That will be what remains of the textile industry in Europe."
"There will still be a remnant of in the European Union, but it will be no more than a remnant."
"That is why we must talk about an orderly withdrawal. An orderly withdrawal of course needs alternatives for those employed in these sectors."
"Today the Council is again conspicuous by its absence from this debate."
"I am saying that specifically for the British Presidency, which has insisted there will be no more money for the European Union."
"I am not asking for money for the textile industry."
"I am asking for money for the regions where, despite agreements, employment will plummet by more than a million in the next few years."
"That is what we need in the European Union."
"We should also give some thought to a matter about which I would like to ask the Commissioner a question: should we not be talking about textile labelling?"
"Labelling must be discussed with the WTO."
"I mean labelling that would cover both social and environmental aspects."
"The WTO should also require China to implement human rights and ILO standards."
"That is the best way for further development."
"We must focus on our own workers and also on the workers and on development in China."
"Then we will be ready for the development we need in world trade."
"Mr President, the question at issue here is the political management of globalisation, so that we can encourage the orderly development of trade and avoid market disruption."
"A balance must be struck between EU textile protectionism, which costs an extra EUR 270 per year for each four-person household, and complete market distortion."
"It is a difficult tightrope."
"Yes, as politicians we are operating in the sphere of practical politics and not pure economic theory."
"We cannot have a situation such as that which arose this summer, when the sale of 80 to 90 million items of clothing and textiles was blocked in the warehouses of Europe, paralysing European businesses and damaging their trade relations with Chinese counterparts."
"We need more flexibility to manage unforeseen changes in global trade."
"That involves setting up a level playing field where everyone plays by the same rules."
"It is essential that the Commission does its utmost to enforce the terms of trade agreements where exporters to the EU comply with international norms on workers' rights and environmental standards."
"The Chinese have the advantage of cheap labour and sometimes, by our standards, questionable labour standards."
"But let us be honest, the textile industry in Europe is one of the lowest paid too and the more educated our workforce becomes, the less inclined they are to take up the sewing machine."
"There are a lot of circles to be squared here, less revisionism about what conditions were like in our industries years ago, and we need an honest, open dialogue."
"There is tension, even within the EU, as to how it should be handled."
"Since the setting-up of import quotas, Chinese textile exports to the EU are allowed to grow by between 8 and 12% for the next couple of years."
"The Spanish and the French have one view on how this should be handled, the British, Irish and the Nordic countries another view."
"Those speaking on behalf of retailers and consumers take one view, whereas those in relation to producers have another view."
"My own government has in recent years changed its policy and now actively encourages and assists Irish companies to source in the People's Republic of China and elsewhere."
"We have no choice since we joined the European Union and lost our advantage to the Euro-Mediterranean producers."
"We need open and honest dialogue and need to look to ourselves internally first."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the best thing to do concerning our trade relations with China and Asian markets in general is to desist from an unequal contest that will cause irreparable damage to European industry: the textile industry today, manufacturing tomorrow, then the car industry, technology and so on."
"Trade relations should properly be based on mutual respect for Community laws and that is not happening at present."
"One need only think of the indiscriminate use in those markets of materials, including chemicals, that are now prohibited in Europe and indeed of the abuse of workers who in that economy have no representation, the exploitation of children, prisoners, slaves and in short of those who lack any kind of protection by society."
"The agreement that has just been reached and the unblocking of the blocked goods cannot constitute a definitive solution to the problems that have emerged."
"We need a fundamental change of course to bring us back to equitable conditions and respect for rules binding on both parties."
"Perhaps a first step might be to investigate the idea of bringing back quotas and customs duties, at any rate on a short-term basis, to limit the damage, as well as considering the issues of traceability and trademarks."
"Something is now being done to remedy the previous lack of action by the Commission."
"Last July’s text in defence of intellectual property and against counterfeiting and piracy certainly made a start in defending our textile businesses and our economy in general."
"This is the aim, Mr President, of the two amendments tabled by over 40 Members on which voting will take place this morning."
"I hope that they will be incorporated in the Lucas report: one of them welcomes the proposal for a directive on penal sanctions and the other concerns respect for environmental measures."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing my gratitude for the congratulations and also for the understanding that has been shown for the difficulties of the situation."
"I am also grateful for the concerns and critical remarks that have been voiced."
"I have already addressed some of these in my introductory remarks."
"The Commission is prepared to learn from the situation and to take on board all relevant concerns and criticisms."
"When we deal with China, we of course take into consideration the geopolitical aspects and the important role China plays in the world."
"However, in this particular case, we are giving preference to the aspects of trade policy, the interests of our textile industry and even to the possible social consequences of the situation."
"Our trade policy vis-à-vis China – the memorandum of understanding and even the agreed minutes – are aimed at establishing a sustainable future for the European textile and clothing industry, which is basically competitive."
"We are very strong in upmarket products, for instance, and we are the second largest exporter of textile and clothing products in the world."
"The memorandum of understanding has given our textile and clothing industry additional time to prepare for the challenges it faces."
"Measures are also aimed at protecting the interests of the Maghreb states, as well as those poor developing countries which export textile and clothing products."
"The work on the reform of the rules of origin and origin-marking, which is being considered by the Commission, is also intended to help the developing countries."
"Concerning the problems of implementation of the memorandum of understanding and the question of whether the Commission acted too late and lost time before May 2005, I would remind you that we first had to evaluate the situation and examine the quotas."
"Some Member States were late in submitting or providing the necessary information."
"It is true that there has been a huge stockpile of textile products and there were many reasons for that."
"One of the reasons is that it occurred in a short period between the signing of the memorandum of understanding and its entry into force, and some importers even put in orders in an attempt – ultimately unsuccessful – to block the system."
"At the end of the day, we had to apply a flexible solution, which was the advance use of the quotas for 2006, but of course this did not result in any increase in the quantity of the textile products which China will be able to export."
"The agreed minutes and the monitoring will prevent similar problems, similar bottlenecks, and the Commission regularly makes the quotas public in order to inform importers."
"Many speakers referred to the burning issue of counterfeiting and there is no question that the Commission is firmly committed to combating it."
"I want to refer to the customs cooperation agreement we signed with China, which entered into force this spring and for which we have high expectations."
"As far as the prospects for the European textile and clothing industry are concerned, several questioners asked whether the industry needs protection."
"My answer is 'yes' and the measures concerned appear to be good enough, although we are prepared to review them."
"One measure, for instance, is the ongoing anti-dumping investigation on footwear."
"In reply to another question raised, Chinese garments are subject to the same provisions as EU products."
"Of course, we cannot extend the quotas after 2008, but as far as other solutions like outsourcing are concerned, my answer is 'yes'."
"However, the real solution is to further strengthen the competitiveness of the European textile industry through research, innovation and investment, but certainly not at the expense of environmental protection and environmental standards."
"But we will urge, encourage and help China to respect these same standards, as well as urging it to respect ILO standards."
"So, we understand the situation in its full complexity."
"These were the most important points raised during the debate."
"In the limited time available, of course, I cannot answer all the questions raised."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the report by Mrs Caroline Lucas, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on prospects for trade relations between the EU and China (2005/2015(INI)) (A6-0262/2005)."
". Mr President, it is very timely that we are having this debate on my China report straight after the debate on textiles."
"The thrust of my report is that the textiles industry is really just the tip of the iceberg."
"We are talking about textiles today, but tomorrow it will be footwear, the day after that it will be bicycles, and then automobiles, machine components or high-tech goods."
"What we are facing here is not just a one-off issue limited to one sector, but a systemic issue, a challenge of much greater scope than I believe the Commission recognises."
"What we have heard from Mr Kovács echoes what we hear all the time from Mr Mandelson too."
"To be honest, it is not very reassuring."
"What we are hearing from the Commission is an extraordinarily complacent and also rather patronising attitude that somehow, all we need to do in the European Union is to move a little bit further up the higher value-added chain and even perhaps to give up what is left of our old manufacturing base and concentrate instead on the knowledge-based industries."
"That kind of idea seems to be in complete denial of the fact that China is developing its own lower-cost but highly-skilled expertise in those areas too."
"Almost 20% of China's exports are now classified as high-tech."
"With over 2 million graduates every single year, there is every reason to believe that percentage will grow."
"The traditional assumption that the EU and US will keep leading in knowledge-intensive industries, while developing countries will somehow just be left to focus on the lower-skilled areas, is rightly being seriously contested."
"This is a patronising and complacent attitude and one that is completely out of date and out of tune with where we are today."
"That is why my report calls on the Commission to rethink its strategy, to wake up to the fact that old fashioned concepts of national comparative advantage simply no longer apply in a world where brain power can zip round the globe at the flick of a computer key."
"The importance of rethinking that old trade paradigm is crucial, not just for employment in the EU, but also for the survival of many developing countries' industries as well, including some of the poorest in the developing world."
"To take the example of textiles again, we have heard already in the debate how countries such as Bangladesh, Laos, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal all depend on textile and clothing for the vast majority of their industrial exports."
"Many of them face devastation as a result of increasing volumes of cheap Chinese exports."
"Not only are they facing the closure of their own factories, but we are seeing Chinese competitive pressures forcing down social standards, This essentially savage free trade dogma means that some of the poorest countries in the world are being thrown into cut-throat competition with one another in a race to the bottom on wages, social standards and, basically, anything that can be made cheaper."
"In the Philippines the government has ruled that the minimum wage will no longer apply in the textiles sector."
"In Bangladesh restrictions on night work and overtime are being lifted."
"We are seeing these key standards that have been fought over for very many years now being rolled back in the name of trying to be ever more competitive."
"As well as demanding a complete reassessment of the trade model, it is clear that we also urgently need to redouble our efforts to ensure that international trade is based on a platform of minimum social and environmental standards."
"It is clear, unfortunately, that China's competitiveness is built, at least in part, on its exploitation of its workers and on its externalisation of social and environmental costs."
"For example, although in theory at least China has strict laws when it comes to what is in its rule books, in practice those laws are flouted time and again."
"It is a shocking fact that over 100 000 people per year are estimated to die in work-related accidents in China."
"The report calls for minimum social standards, the ILO standards, trade union standards, and cooperation between European trade unions and those groups that are trying to set up similar bodies in China."
"It also looks at the environmental impact of the development model which we in the West have also followed."
"We need to change it, but what we see in China is the acceleration of that model."
"The impact is clearly a massive one on the resources of other nations."
"China is already the world's second largest consumer of oil and water and trails only the US in CO2 emissions."
"It is only by challenging the key free trade model that we can really make sure that all workers in the world have the chance to earn a decent livelihood."
"I urge Members to support this report."
". Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Parliament and the Committee on International Trade for putting this very timely and important issue on the agenda and I would also like to express my personal appreciation to the rapporteur, Ms Lucas, for the report."
"The Commission highly appreciates this report and sees it as a very valuable contribution to its policy making."
"China's rise is a challenge, but it is also an opportunity."
"Both aspects are well reflected in this report."
"When the report says that Chinese expansion will bring enormous beneficial possibilities but also raises legislative concerns for European industry, I can only agree, and it is in precisely this balance that we have to act."
"Let me give you a few facts regarding the latest strengths of our trade relations with China."
"It is clear that China is a big economy and will gradually become competitive in more and more industrial sectors."
"Just like the EU or the US, China is likely to produce a broad range of industrial products."
"The challenge for Europe is not only to trade Airbus planes for tee-shirts, but increasingly to trade similar products within the same sector, so that European firms prosper as a result of their products' distinctiveness and quality."
"For example, parts of Europe's textile industry remain very competitive."
"At present Europe's overall trading position remains strong due to its ability to sell upmarket products."
"The EU is the first exporter of goods and services and the first direct investor abroad."
"This is a key point for the linkage between competitiveness and the EU social model."
"The EU produces value-added upmarket products and can sell them abroad due to settled non-price factors such as innovative features, quality and reputation, continuity over time or related services."
"However, the EU position is under challenge."
"The European industry is losing ground in high-technology products."
"It is trailing behind in several high-tech products, whereas China is rapidly catching up."
"The EU position is also at risk due to the geographical orientation of its exports which are strong in countries where demand is static, but less well-positioned in rapidly growing areas such as Asia."
"It is more a race to the top than a race to the bottom."
"EU companies cannot afford to miss market opportunities in these dynamic areas which already account for half of world import growth."
"Europe's future is to focus on what we do well."
"The EU has a strong global export profile in high-quality and high-tech products and services which now account for about half of European exports and a third of world demand."
"However, continued innovation and investment in this comparative advantage is crucial."
"Better respect and enforcement of intellectual property rights at international level is therefore of the utmost importance."
"Addressing barriers to EU exports in third countries also accounts for the bulk of the potential to improve the competitive position of EU industry."
"The EU stands to win from the further opening of markets worldwide."
"By negotiating the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers and promoting regulatory dialogues with our trading partners where appropriate, the EU can open new markets for its exporters."
"Therefore the Commission's Lisbon Strategy, the strategy of growth, jobs and competitiveness set out last February, rests on three pillars: opening markets to drive productivity and innovation; investing in education and research to enable us to compete; and reforming labour markets and welfare states to get people into jobs, improve employability and skills and extend opportunities to those whom economic developments are leaving behind."
"We acknowledge the efforts China has undertaken to implement its WTO commitments as it enters into its fifth and last year of transition after its accession."
"We also have to make clear that unsolved issues have to be addressed."
"In sectors such as automotives, telecom and banking there is a clear call for action on the Chinese side to get fully in line with its commitments."
"On our side we must use the whole range of instruments at hand to push these cases forward both bilaterally and multilaterally."
"For good reason, this report gives special attention to lack of intellectual property rights implementation in China."
"This report and the public at large are right to say that while we acknowledge China's competitive advantage in particular in labour-intensive production, it is only just that our intellectual property is equally acknowledged and protected."
"We are not only speaking about CDs and handbags, but also machinery and hi-tech products."
"China has made progress in adopting adequate IPR laws; we now have to focus on issues of implementation."
"The conclusion of a customs cooperation and mutual assistance agreement between the European Commission and China, which entered into force on 1 April 2005, is an important concrete development in this field."
"The fight against counterfeit and piracy, including the protection of intellectual property rights and security of the international supply chain, are the main EU priorities for closer cooperation in the customs area."
"These issues, among others, will be discussed at the first meeting of the joint customs cooperation committee on 14 November 2005."
"Joint activities are already ongoing in the area of intellectual property rights where a working visit of a team of EU custom experts is scheduled at the invitation of the Chinese customs."
"More generally, the newly established EU-China working group on IPR will concentrate on concrete business issues."
"We stand ready to assist China on this way forward."
"Because, as the last OECD report has shown, it is very much in China's own interest, I am grateful that Parliament strongly backs our report on this issue."
"As an advocate of high social standards the Commission believes it is in the interest of all countries to ratify key ILO conventions and other relevant international agreements."
"We believe that high social and environmental standards are fundamental for sustainable development and cooperate with our trading partners to this end in all relevant instances, be they bilateral or multilateral."
"The Commission supports China's recent efforts to take greater account of environmental considerations and is actively engaged with China on ways to develop further environmental cooperation including technical assistance in the area of trade and the environment."
"We believe the carrot of cooperation to be much more effective than the stick of clauses and conditionality in trade agreements."
"On several occasions this report mentions the need for in-depth knowledge of opportunities to do business with China."
"The Commission has taken the initiative and launched a tender for a study and a seminar on the future opportunities and challenges of EU-China trade and investment relations, also comprising ten sectoral analyses."
"The result will be presented during a conference in 2006 and will be yet another important input for our way ahead."
"I also want to mention the prospects of negotiating a new framework agreement with China, reflecting the full breadth and depth of the strategic partnership between China and the European Union."
"This framework agreement will of course have an important and forward-looking agenda on the trade and investment side."
". Mr President, it was almost unanimously, let us say with one abstention, that this House’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, on 13 July, adopted its opinion on the report by Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, about the prospects for trade relations between the EU and China."
"In its opinion, the Foreign Affairs Committee focused on the issue of the arms embargo as well as the enforcement of human rights in the People’s Republic of China."
"With regard to some EU Member States’ intention to lift the arms embargo with Beijing, the Foreign Affairs Committee noted that such political action would be inappropriate at this time, mainly for three reasons."
"First of all, there has not been a significant improvement in the enforcement of human rights in China."
"Secondly, the adoption of the anti-secession law in March 2005 by the Chinese Parliament leaves the door open to Chinese military intervention in Taiwan."
"Thirdly, the Foreign Affairs Committee would stress that lifting the arms embargo could seriously undermine regional stability in East Asia."
"In its opinion, the Foreign Affairs Committee does not mince its words where the protection of human rights in China is concerned."
"It is deeply worried about the persistent violations of such basic rights as freedom of opinion, assembly and religion."
"Not for nothing does the committee see a direct connection with the continuing Council debate on a possible lifting of the arms embargo."
"In the unlikely event of the Council deciding in favour of lifting it, then this would certainly not prompt the Chinese authorities into taking respect for human rights seriously at long last."
"What remains is considerable loss of face for the European Union internationally with regard to its own basic values."
"I hope, as draftsman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, that its position with regard to the Lucas report will strike a sympathetic chord with the European institutions and will be considered worth following."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have considered this matter very seriously and also very amicably in the last few weeks, and so I extend sincere thanks to the rapporteur and the other Members involved."
"China joined the WTO in 2001."
"That means new rights, but also new obligations."
"China is already claiming all those rights, but is failing to fulfil its obligations in many respects."
"It is far from allowing foreign firms free access to its markets."
"Requiring them to work with Chinese firms is clearly against the spirit of the WTO."
"The effects are particularly harmful because intellectual property, patents and copyrights are not protected in China today."
"Illegal copying of technical products, counterfeit textiles and utter disregard for intellectual property are intolerable."
"The Commission will have to give a much higher priority to this in future."
"The Commission will have to speak to the Chinese much more plainly about this than it has so far."
"Things cannot go on as they are."
"Please tell that to Commissioner Mandelson."
"There are a lot of other things that need to be put right."
"The currency is still not allowed to float, China is not a democratic market economy, its public contracting is totally opaque, and the state looks on approvingly as protective duties are circumvented."
"Social issues are still not being addressed, workers have almost no co-determination rights, there is no freedom to form strong trade unions, environmental pollution is unconscionable."
"It is in these areas that China must make improvements, and that is what our resolution calls on it to do."
"Only if China does that will proper world trade will be possible."
"There are things we need to do too, however."
"We must work hard to ensure that Europe remains a strong economy in the future."
"We need more commercial freedom and more commercial responsibility."
"We need more training and research and a greater willingness to face up to challenges."
"The fact is that if China is a problem today, it will certainly be a major challenge in the future too."
"China also, however, offers a great opportunity for creating new jobs in Europe."
". Mr President, I congratulate Caroline Lucas on her report."
"We have very little disagreement with the contents of the report; we have more problems with the content of her speech, which seemed not entirely to reflect the report as it stands."
"I have had the opportunity to visit China recently, at the invitation of the Chinese Government, to look at developments in the country that represents a fifth of the world's population."
"While man does not live by bread alone, the year-on-year growth rates of 10%-plus have transformed China from the country I first knew more than 20 years ago."
"Even the so-called depressed north-east of the country has a skyline littered with cranes that shows a level of economic activity that would be impressive anywhere in the world."
"Across the country, 300 million Chinese have been pulled out of poverty, even if more than 100 million remain in the more remote rural areas living on less than EUR 1 per day."
"China is succeeding in manufacturing, not by a race to the bottom, as the flourishing department stores of Harbin and Chengde prove."
"The result of this economic boom has transformed China into the world's fourth-largest exporter and, as we have seen in today's earlier debate, has made it extremely competitive in a number of industrial sectors."
"We have to take care when dealing with those issues."
"As a Member of this House back in the mid-80s, when Japan played out the role that China is playing today, I saw the wrong steps being taken."
"The initial voluntary quotas on exports to the United States bought from the Japanese by President Nixon in exchange for the return of Okinawa to Japanese rule, later extended to Europe, led to a situation where unmet demand allowed Japanese corporations to make super-profits which, reinvested, exacerbated the problems in the long term."
"Instead, we need to match China's exports to Europe with our own to China."
"We have to recognise that economics is starting to transform Chinese society."
"To echo Mr Caspary, there are a whole series of human rights and other problems."
"We are particularly concerned in relation to this report at the restrictions of the rights of labour activists to organise free trade unions."
"We hope the Commission will pressure European business operating in China to set an example by giving their own workers full trade union rights."
"There are environmental problems in China, of course, and these should be addressed."
"We should avoid the hypocrisy of asking China to refrain from doing what we are not prepared to do ourselves in Europe."
"We cannot expect China to voluntarily restrict its use of energy below levels that we see in the European Union."
"We have to move away from crisis management of economic and trade issues as we threaten to cascade from textiles, to footwear, to bicycles and an endless sequence of other products."
"We need to build a serious partnership with China on economic and trade matters."
"If we do not, others will."
"We also need a serious political dialogue with China."
"We have much to say to each other."
"This report is not the place to raise these issues, but the decision by the Foreign Affairs Committee to draft a report on EU-China political relations is to be welcomed."
". This is not the first time we have talked about China in Parliament."
"When discussing the condition of textiles post 2005, Commission member Louis Michel expressed his view that the cause of the decline and potential collapse of the textile sector, and, evidently, other European industrial sectors, is the inability of countries to run their economies."
"They were unable to transfer their manufacturing to countries with cheap labour."
"No one, however, has discussed what we can offer the citizens of our own countries where we were elected."
"Where will they work when we transfer all industry out of Europe?"
"In the Lucas report the consequences trade with China has on the economies of EU Member States are hardly even considered."
"The report gives great attention to developing countries, which suffer from China's expansion into the world's textile markets."
"A whole chapter of the report is even devoted to China's social problems, wage increases, welfare, while this is essentially a domestic affair."
"Bear in mind that not even the EU itself has a common social policy, every State takes care of its employees' salaries, which in the EU vary from State to State, and are very low in some there are citizens living below the poverty level."
"What should we do in the European Union to find an adequate response to the challenges posed by the global economy?"
"I call on the Commission to assess the impact of the application of the WTO rules on EU Member States, particularly the new ones, to review foreign trade policy, and to take steps and preventative action to eliminate negative consequences on EU textile, footwear, furniture, electronics, automobile and other industries."
"However, once the condition of EU industry has been analysed, the most important thing is to prepare a long-term forecast for 2030-2050, establishing areas where EU manufacturers could be competitive and giving industry recommendations about sectors of the future, which ought to be invested in now."
"I also call on you to take care of our own people, because, it seems, we cannot expect someone else to create jobs for us, to boost economic competitiveness, and maintain social welfare."
". Mr President, there is no question that this is a fundamental problem."
"On the one hand, it is because of the different production conditions, and hence prices, that international trade exists, but, on the other hand, completely free trade between economies operating with very different labour costs, as in the case of China and the European Union, involves several elements that distort the rules regulating competition."
"What must we say in these circumstances?"
"Firstly, as consumers of Chinese products, we in the European Union have a greater responsibility, since we are China’s main trading partner, above even the United States."
"Secondly, China’s development and its opening up to the world is good news that we must celebrate."
"Thirdly, however, that that opening up must be conducted within a framework of respect for certain minimum and common rules, which guarantee clean and fair commercial relations, and also that the benefits of that opening up and trade should be enjoyed by the weakest parts of the production system, that is to say, the workers, while at the same time guaranteeing respect for international environmental rules."
"The key is therefore not to promote free trade, but rather to promote fair trade."
"This means establishing new rules in the trade between countries, which includes quotas based not on price but on production conditions, the establishment of traceability rules in order to guarantee respect for those conditions and, above all, regulation of the practices of large multinational companies, which are increasingly mobile and often indulge in a ‘race to the bottom’, seeking to produce in places with the fewest social, employment and environmental requirements."
"Mr President, the subject is ‘Prospects for Trade Relations’ and Mrs Lucas began by asking for support for her report. She will have mine."
"If we look at how things have developed, we find that both the European Union and China have become each other’s second biggest trading partner."
"What has changed?"
"A few years ago, the trade surplus was still on the European Union’s side and now it is on the Chinese side."
"I am convinced it will remain that way for the next few decades."
"There are a number of unusual things about China."
"It has an enormous internal market; at the same time, it has a great capacity for labour-intensive production and it is able to take full advantage of that because it has very low wage levels."
"It also has high-tech production."
"Labour-intensive production is increasingly moving away from many Member States of the European Union even though we have a very high level of productivity, which is a reason why we actually could keep it."
"At the same time, if we look at the volume of trade we can see that European industry has benefited tremendously from exporting to China."
"Today, we have been discussing the situation as regards textiles."
"The European Union used to earn billions from the export of textile machinery."
"If you look at today’s export statistics, you can see how many steel works are exported, how many pressing tools for the motor industry, how many aluminium smelters for making bicycles."
"It is perfectly clear that we will have the same problem in these industries in two or three years’ time."
"The draft Constitutional Treaty spoke of an open market economy with free competition."
"What we now have in the European Union in textiles is a result of that."
"It is the result of an open, unprotected market economy with free competition."
"That is why a majority of the French rejected it."
"I believe we need a social market economy with fair competition."
"That is something different."
"If we are constantly saying that production in China is not up to European standards, that is correct."
"It would be extremely easy, however, to get a rule laid down in the WTO to the effect that countries that fail to comply with ILO standards cannot export or that their goods will not be imported."
"If anyone fails to comply properly with ILO occupational safety standards, his goods cannot be exported."
"Anyone who uses chemicals that are banned worldwide or in most countries is not allowed to export."
"Then we would immediately have a competition that was driving things upwards because producers would be forced to bring in better social, environmental and industrial standards."
"I believe that is the right way forward."
"Anyone who believes the European Union can survive in the long term simply by always making the sweeping statement that we must make more high-tech products is failing to recognise that China produces far more highly qualified college and university graduates every year than the entire European Union."
"That cannot be the way either."
"We must not delay in doing what we are always talking about."
"We must invest much more in education."
"If you look at the Member States’ budgets, however, you will see that they are not doing that either."
". Mr President, it is wise to bear the facts in mind when discussing the Union’s trade relations with China."
"The Chinese economy has been growing by 9% a year for the last 25 years."
"Beijing’s currency reserves currently stand at USD 700 billion, whereas the Union’s are a mere USD 179 billion."
"The second greatest power in the world is not a democracy, nor does it have a market economy."
"Together with the ASEAN countries, China is hoping to create a free trade area by 2010, and this would be the largest economic block in the world."
"China is moving to expand its trade at global level."
"The Chinese take-over of the US giant IBM is an example of this movement, as is the current Chinese attempt to take over Rover in the UK."
"As we try to establish what all this means for us, we should consider the situation in the USA, where many jobs have been lost due to the disadvantageous balance of trade with China."
"Whole branches of US industry have relocated in China, which has become the largest factory in the world."
"Textiles aside, China is already producing two-thirds of all electronic goods."
"At present, China is the Union’s second largest trading partner."
"In 2004 the Union had a trade deficit with China in excess of EUR 78 billion."
"Unfair competition is possible because China has a Socialist market economy, a type of primitive capitalism that disregards human rights."
"In the interests of the future of our economy, we should adjust our relations with China."
"The latter should be deemed a strategic competitor rather than a strategic partner."
"Strict import quotas on Chinese goods should also be introduced, so as to protect jobs in our countries."
"Whenever we deal with China we should keep the following question in the forefront of our minds: will there be any jobs left for our children?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my contribution to the report by Mrs Lucas – whom I should like to thank for the excellent work that she has carried out – I wanted to emphasise a fundamental aspect of the relationship between these two large trade areas: the need to obey the rules which in the field of trade are indeed the principles of the World Trade Organisation and the agreements that derive from it, but which in the political and social context relate to respect for basic human rights."
"Hence the need for monitoring through ongoing negotiations between the Commission and the Chinese authorities, in order to guarantee the principles of freedom and democracy: respect for these must be a prerequisite in the development of China’s trade relations with other economic areas."
"In addition the latest news from China concerning the oppressive controls imposed on use of the Internet must be studied carefully."
"The decision by the government in Beijing, which has announced new laws for controlling information on the Internet so as to prohibit any conceivable criticism of its policies towards religion and in general of its widespread intolerance towards religious preaching, must inevitably increase our concern."
"In China the degree of freedom and democracy is in inverse proportion to the economic and commercial power that it imposes upon world markets."
"We therefore call on the Commission, in the framework of the ongoing negotiations with the Chinese authorities that it proposes to institute to ensure equitable, shared management of trade relations with the Chinese continent, to think over and take due account of all the aspects that are linked to respect for the rights and freedoms of individuals and, by extension, the workforce."
"We call for standards to ensure that goods originating in China conform to the security guarantees applied in Europe and that there are sanctions to prevent any trade with or within the Union for several years by those who illegally import goods or import illegal goods into Europe."
"This is the right moment to say that damage to fair competition is sometimes inflicted by unscrupulous European entrepreneurs who, thinking solely of their own short-term profit, infringe a rule by promoting the unlawful importation and distribution in Europe of counterfeit or dangerous goods."
"They should be treated with the utmost severity."
"Furthermore we invite the Commission and the Council to call upon Member States to institute stricter checks on their territories concerning the presence of numerous illegal immigrants who are forced to work in unlawful premises to produce low-cost goods."
"Mr President, I am keen that we finish this debate."
"Could you confirm that we shall continue until all the speakers have spoken, so that we can vote this morning?"
"I was actually just about to make an announcement to that effect."
"I still have about 50 minutes worth of speakers left on my list, which means, as that is a theoretical figure, that we have about an hour of debate left."
"You will understand, seeing that it is quarter to twelve, that we cannot make the Members who will come to vote wait."
"Officially, according to our agenda, we should close the debate at 11.50 a.m."
"What I would suggest is that I give the floor to Mr Vanhecke, who is due to speak in his capacity as a non-attached Member, and then to do one circuit of representatives who wish to speak in a personal capacity."
"We would therefore have Mr Rübig, for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr van den Berg, for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mr Van Hecke the other Mr Van Hecke  for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mrs Auken, for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Mr Farage for the Independence/Democracy Group, Mr Didžiokas for the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, and finally Mr Allister for the non-attached Members, which would take us 12 minutes."
"That would then take us to noon or five past, which I think is reasonable."
"The other speakers, I am afraid, will have to wait until this afternoon."
"I already know that the rapporteur will shortly ask plenary for the vote to be postponed, so that the vote takes place not this afternoon but during our mini-session in Brussels."
"It is plenary that will decide on that shortly."
"That is what I can tell you."
"If you agree, we will finish, as regards the speakers on behalf of the groups, with the non-attached Members, then one round of speeches, in other words 12 minutes, and we will then suspend the sitting for the votes, from noon."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider it unjust that on a matter of such importance it should be the speeches of those Members who belong to groups, and not for example those of the Non-attached Members, that are always given special treatment: we are already subjected to speaking restrictions and are not allowed to vote at the meetings of heads of groups."
"I maintain that this is truly undemocratic for all of us who are Non-attached Members; we are elected representatives of the people, just like all the others."
"When the Commissioner takes the floor on such a subject not for two and a half minutes but for at least seven, a speech from each one of us becomes very important. I am therefore in complete disagreement with the position expressed by the Presidency."
"I have only two options, Mrs Mussolini: either I can follow the agenda as approved by plenary and suspend the sitting in exactly one minute, or, to allow as many speakers as possible to comment, I can take one circuit of speakers which will, in any case, include non-attached Members to the same extent, no more and no less, as the other groups."
"I have no other option."
"With regard to the Commission’s speaking time, it is unlimited."
"It is only Members’ speaking time that is limited."
"Therefore, as yours seems to be the only objection, I propose to continue by giving the floor to a non-attached Member, Mr Vanhecke."
"Mr President, our raising the issue of the very serious difficulties that our companies are experiencing as a result of Chinese competition, has nothing whatever to do with any fear on our part of fair competition, or with our possible criticism of the free market."
"It is certainly true, though – and we have to face up to this – that our consumers benefit to some extent from the price cuts and that European companies see opportunities for growth in the Chinese market."
"The problem, however, has not gone away."
"China is a Communist dictatorship with a state economy that is unfamiliar with the game of fair competition."
"More than half of China’s industry is owned by the state and receives interest-free funding without any real obligation to pay the loans back."
"The value of the Chinese currency remains artificially low."
"That, as well as many other unreasonable factors – forced labour springs to mind, as do inhumane working conditions – result in our markets being flooded by Chinese finished products at prices for which our own companies can sometimes hardly buy the raw materials."
"I would like to make it clear once again that whilst this is not an argument against the free market, or indeed, against free competition, Europe has the duty to protect its companies and to guarantee fair competition, and this has, unfortunately, recently fallen by the wayside."
"Given the way in which the Commission has mismanaged the textiles issue, we, in fact, fear the worst for the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, China is an important partner for Europe, the EU’s second largest trading partner after the United States."
"Chinese statistics show that the EU is China’s number one trading partner, ahead of the United States."
"I believe the mutual opening of markets should be an absolute priority for us."
"We cannot have a situation where we open our markets while our firms are faced with problems over there."
"I believe the future opportunities for growth on the Chinese market are of the utmost importance for our manufacturing industry in particular and that much of the plant that has been supplied there came from Europe."
"European firms must of course also position themselves on that market in good time in order to safeguard jobs here at home."
"Imports to Europe also increase our purchasing power."
"Many of our families save hundreds of euros a month because they can buy goods of very acceptable quality at a very reasonable price."
"The money they save can then be spent on other services or products, so the Chinese are actually increasing our purchasing power disproportionately."
"It has already been mentioned that intellectual property is a tremendous problem and that our European firms need more protection."
"The Commission needs to enforce patent and trade mark rights."
"I call on it to use its influence, especially in the talks in Hong Kong and in the TRIPS too, to ensure that these international obligations are scrupulously observed."
"I believe this will strengthen our relations in future."
"I believe a communist country is on the way to becoming a market economy, which will also underpin democracy and human rights."
"We all ought to give this our backing."
"Mr President, although there is, in Europe, a great deal of fear of China, now is not the time to be passive and cautious."
"We have to accept at times that jobs will disappear to developing economies."
"We have to show solidarity with fellow workers throughout the world, for they too are entitled to employment and growing prosperity, but the European social model means that we must offer people who lose their jobs here sufficient scope and assistance in finding new employment, as well as training and retraining."
"They should not be the victims of these rapid developments."
"The European clothes shops and importers whose orders were stuck in warehouses for ages as a result of the temporary import ban also deserve compensation for their financial losses."
"Meanwhile, the European Union can, and indeed must, exploit the opportunities which prosperous economic growth in other parts of the world creates for us."
"These opportunities include new consumer markets and good prospects for the tourism industry, including for the less educated."
"European companies are entitled to have their intellectual property protected in law but certainly also in practice, and are also entitled to access to the Chinese markets."
"Rather than putting protectionist measures in place to protect these jobs, the EU must promote the interests of its companies by reminding China of its WTO commitments."
"Above all, the EU must come out of its shell and stand up for the standards and values we hold dear, including fair trade, trade union freedom and workers’ rights."
"Working conditions in China are abysmal; workers are not free to set up trade unions."
"Trade union activists are rounded up and locked up for years."
"Tens of thousands of fatal industrial accidents occur every year; they are no exception on the Chinese shop floor."
"Workers are forced to work many hours’ overtime and child labour is also not uncommon."
"As one of China’s largest trading partners, the European Union must take responsibility for putting these abuses on the agenda."
"Mr President, given that, in this House, much has been said about the trade relations with China recently, I would like to confine myself to one aspect, namely counterfeiting and piracy."
"Commissioner Mandelson admitted that this problem was taken off the agenda at the beginning of the latest EU/China trade talks in response to pressure from China."
"That is surprising, given that the European Union, in accordance with the WTO rules, is entitled to issue protectionist measures in the event of unfair competition or distortion of competition."
"That is clearly the case with regard to respect for intellectual property."
"Every year, increasing levels of counterfeiting and piracy cause the loss of between one and two hundred thousand jobs in Europe."
"One morning this summer, during a one-hour raid on the Belgian coast, more than 2 500 counterfeit pieces of clothing were seized, 70% of them originating from China."
"Our creativity and innovation is just about the last asset we have in the unequal struggle against competition from the East."
"It is high time the Commission took this on board and finally raised the problem of illegal counterfeiting with the Chinese authorities."
"Mr President, we are certainly all delighted that China, huge and poor as it is, is getting its act together and developing. At the same time, it is also important, however, to draw attention to the abominable conditions in the social and environmental spheres."
"Emphatically, something must be done about these."
"I hope that most of us can agree that it is not only the EU that has a big responsibility but that action should be taken within the system of international agreements. It is, then, the WTO and the rule of law principle that should govern development and not arbitrary quota arrangements, which too easily bind the poor countries into relations with their old colonial powers that are reminiscent of slavery."
"If we are to make our presence felt in the WTO, we need to be trustworthy, but people are only trustworthy if they are worth trusting."
"It is somewhat incriminating, moreover, that we only remember about all these rules when it is what we ourselves produce that is to be protected."
"If these rules really were to apply, we could not import a drop of oil from Saudi Arabia, which does not of course have even the first clue about human rights. However, there is never any talk about, for example, human rights and the environment to be heard in relation to Saudi Arabia."
"We need to strengthen our position within the WTO by opening up our markets rather than by coercing the poor countries. The rich countries need to have open markets, and we need to make demands: demands in terms of the ILO and demands that the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the other environmental conventions be observed."
"That is absolutely the only way that is practicable, and it is also the way that, in all conscience, we must keep to."
"Mr President, the shortage of bras in our department stores has indeed proved to be a beneficial crisis because it has exposed the EU for exactly what it is: a backward-looking customs union, an anachronism in the 21st century, and a bloated bureaucracy that failed to spot the obvious happening, while the Commissioner was enjoying a lengthy holiday."
"From the UK's perspective, here we are – the fourth biggest economy in the world, the second largest global investor, a truly global trading nation – and we are not allowed to make our own trade policy!"
"Oh no, that is done for us by the overpaid, unelected bureaucrats in Brussels and today we have a former Communist Commissar lecturing us on what we can and cannot do!"
"A one-size-fits-all trade policy for the European Union cannot work when you have countries and economies as different as the United Kingdom and Italy."
"In the modern world sovereign states use free trade agreements."
"The really good news though is that British business is waking up to the fact that the innocuous-sounding common market was actually always intended to be far more than that, and British businesses are saying: we do not need the European Union, we would be better off making our own trade deals."
"So thank you to the European Commission."
"Thank you for this cock-up, because the day that Britain leaves the European Union has come much closer."
"– While welcoming this initiative and this report, I would also like to make a few comments, which, in my opinion, are important."
"Tendencies of recent years give us grave concern and do not bode well for the future."
"The trade deficit has been growing at a catastrophic rate, as has the assortment of goods from China, not to mention the transfer of manufacturing and the closure of companies in the European Union itself."
"And international companies play a large part in this."
"If we fail to establish the right mechanisms to control these processes, the consequences will be tragic."
"Companies in all European Union states, including Lithuania, suffer from unfair competition from Chinese companies."
"Our business communities are forced to adhere to high EU labour, social insurance and environmental standards, and must compete with Chinese manufacturers, who do none of this."
"On the contrary, in fact – workers toil under horrendous conditions and are practically unpaid."
"The European Union must ensure that compulsory adherence to labour, work safety, social insurance and environmental standards is set forth in international treaties."
"In addition intellectual property protection regulations and the certification of quality and origin must be tightened and the procedure for bringing anti-dumping cases to court must be simplified."
"The European Commission must ensure that companies are only allowed to import goods into the EU when the European Commission confirms the companies' adherence to such standards."
"In fact, this is exactly what Russia does when allowing goods from the European Union to be imported into its territory."
"The final speaker on this report this morning is Mr Allister, who has 90 seconds available to him. I would also point out in passing to Mrs Mussolini, who is not listening to us, that the non-attached Members will have spoken for the same length of time as the Members of the other groups."
"If discrimination does exist, it is positive discrimination as far as you are concerned."
"Mr President, let me begin by endorsing much of what Mr Farage had to say in his pertinent observations about the state of trade policy."
"However, I want to deal with another issue."
"Trade cannot be viewed in isolation."
"It is not immune from ethical and moral considerations."
"China needs our trade."
"The price attached can properly be more than financial."
"We cannot ignore the widespread abuse of human rights in China, particularly with regard to a harmless but tiny minority – namely practicing Christians."
"It is wholly unacceptable to have Chinese Christians in prison for merely expressing their Christian beliefs or distributing copies of the Bible."
"Freedom of worship is a fundamental right recognised by most of us in Europe."
"Its denial in China is not something we can ignore to facilitate trade with a state that persecutes Christian people, whatever the mutual economic benefits might be."
"I therefore call for a linkage between ongoing EU-China bilateral dialogue on human rights and the negotiations on trade."
"We should make progress on trade conditional on progress in securing and improving human rights."
"Liberalisation of trade requires liberalisation of human rights in China."
"We shall suspend the debate on the report by Mrs Lucas until 3.00 p.m. and resume with the list of speakers as scheduled."
". Mr President, as you know, we have just been discussing my report on EU-China trade relations, but the debate is not yet finished."
"I propose that, while the rest of the debate takes place this afternoon, the actual vote be postponed until the Brussels part-session in two weeks' time."
"This is an important report and there should be a full House here to vote on it, not just the 40 or 50 Members who might still be here at 5 p.m."
"I am afraid that I myself will not be here at 5 p.m., as I have another engagement this evening."
"The change to the agenda that shifted my report from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. this morning was made only very recently."
"That is what caused this problem."
"I formally move that we postpone the vote until the Brussels part-session in two weeks' time."
"– Mrs Lucas, I believe that you are referring to Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure."
"I imagine that you are expressing an opinion on behalf of your political group, as you are entirely justified in doing."
"Are there any objections to the request that Mrs Lucas has just made to postpone the vote on her report?"
"I take the liberty of supporting Mrs Lucas’ request, because the resumption of the debate this afternoon is going to pose a problem for a number of my fellow Members who were scheduled to speak: some of them have an aeroplane to catch, others have appointments."
"If we could, in fact, conclude the debate in Brussels or next month in Strasbourg and vote in the process, that would be helpful."
"After having heard Mr Goebbels declare himself in favour of a postponement of the vote on the report by Mrs Lucas, are there any speakers who wish to oppose such a postponement?"
"The vote on the report by Mrs Lucas is therefore postponed until the next part-session, on the understanding that the debate will resume at 3.00 p.m., since we must suspend it at present in order to make room for voting time."
"I rise on a point of order under rule 132 concerning the agenda, with reference to question time."
"As you know question time is supposed to last a full hour."
"Last night it only lasted just over thirty five minutes."
"There were two reasons for this, not only did the debate overrun by ten minutes but also the Presidency-in-Office felt impelled to take an urgent telephone call which left us doing nothing for fifteen minutes and the debate only started therefore at twenty five past."
"Can I please ask the Presidency to take note of this?"
"Question time is the one opportunity that backbenchers have to challenge the Presidency-in-Office; it is supposed to be one full hour."
"Please can the Presidency ensure that in future we get our hour of questions?"
"I have taken due note of your remark, which is well-founded. It is true, however, that the agenda for this part-session was particularly full."
"That being said, we will forward to the relevant authorities your request which, I believe, we all agree on, namely that question time be respected by the Council, as it is one of the fundamental rights of this Parliament to be able to put questions to the Council."
"We shall now move on to the votes."
"Mr President, on Monday, when the groups met to prepare this joint motion for a resolution, we had agreed on a text on paragraph 10."
"Unfortunately, when this text was being transcribed, part of a sentence was missed out."
"I take the liberty, therefore, of presenting it to you in the form of an oral amendment;"
"I have the text in English."
"'Asks the Commission to keep the regulatory status of hedge funds under review' with, as an addition: 'and examine ways in which added transparency could contribute to more stable oil markets'."
"I believe that I have Mr Chichester’s consent to present this text."
"Mr President, we have the same technical problem with the sixth indent of paragraph 15."
"We wish to add: 'Put forwards proposals for'."
"The same procedure applies as for the other part."
"Mr President, this is an addendum that we had already accepted in the compromise negotiations but which has been omitted owing to an editorial oversight."
"It is about democracy in the United Nations."
"I will now read the text out in English."
"The following is appended to Part 20:"
"'Reaffirms its belief that the UN itself needs to considerably enhance democracy within its structures, and therefore underlines its call for a caucus of democracies within the UN General Assembly.'"
". Mr President, I am asking that the second part of paragraph 10 contain the following: ‘and requests that any such future action contribute to bringing to an end discrimination based on sex or caste, wherever it takes place’."
". Mr President, this is a small insignificant detail relating to the very familiar issue of the Constitution."
"Given that the European Constitution has yet to be approved — I hope that it will be soon — the last two lines of paragraph 17 should read: ‘including the progress of the common foreign and security policy which the entry into force of the new European Constitution could entail’."
". Mr President, this consists of adding the following: ‘urges the Commission, the Member States and India to increase cooperation in the field of renewable energies’."
"That concludes the vote."
". We support the resolution before us, which is critical of the bilateral agreement signed on 14 September 2005 between the EU and the USA on the wine trade."
"We feel that the agreement is ‘inadequate’ and ‘inappropriate’."
"The resolution reiterates its support for:"
"- traditional production, family winemaking and the high quality of our wines, along with international recognition for traditional, EU-protected wine designations;"
"- the establishment of a register of geographical indications recognised at international level and the inclusion of this objective in its main priorities in the multilateral negotiations on agriculture at the World Trade Organisation (WTO);"
"- the recognition of the 17 designations listed in Annex II, whereby all European designations of origin are properly protected, at the earliest opportunity, by the US authorities within their own internal market;"
"- the vitally important task of strengthening Community support measures to improve and promote the quality of Community products as part of the next reform of the common organisation of the market;"
"It also emphasises that the agreement considerably weakens the EU’s position in negotiations on agriculture at the WTO, insofar as it undermines the approach based on production areas and on the quality prevalent in much of the winemaking sector."
". I support this Motion and call on all Member States to take urgent note of our concern at the recent continuous increase in the price of crude oil and its effect on the poor in our society."
"Increasing crude oil prices are having a detrimental effect on the European economy and are likely to impede our chances of attaining the Lisbon objectives of high quality full employment."
"We must tackle our dependence on oil, diversify our energy sources, promote energy conservation measures, develop renewable energy sources."
"The EU should hold a world summit of oil consumer and producer countries."
"Every Member State should contribute by assessing its domestic energy needs and how best it can move towards sustainable energy use."
"The most logical response to higher oil prices is to switch to using alternative energy sources and focus on the use of renewable energies to promote energy efficiency."
"Bearing in mind that 40% of energy usage is for the purpose of warming or cooling our homes Member States should urgently introduce incentives for green energy solutions."
".I voted in favour of this text."
"What kind of price increase are we talking about?"
"For want of suitable Community powers, I first address the Member States:"
"In the price of oil, we pay between 60% and 80% tax to the Member States."
"For example, in France, each time I pay EUR 1 to a petrol pump attendant, that amounts to paying 80 cents to the taxman … With proportions such as these, oil consumption is turning into an outright revenue pump."
"If this national tax windfall helped to fund Research and Innovation to make us less dependent on oil, then I would see the positive aspects of it, but I am afraid that it does nothing of the sort."
"I would also like to address the Commission:"
"The Commission should enhance its programme to support the development of biofuels and thus revise certain strategic pillars of the CAP."
"In the context of the revision of the Lisbon Strategy, developing industrial innovations in the environmental sector and becoming self-sufficient in terms of energy sources are among the keys to successfully reviving the growth Europe requires."
"In particular, I am thinking of the car industry and the example of hydrogen-powered fuel cells."
"The Commission could also take a strong initiative to support solar energy and the means to permanently eliminate all kinds of energy waste …"
". I wish briefly to point out that there is no paragraph calling for urgent measures to support sectors that are being seriously damaged by the rise in fuel prices."
"Quite the opposite, it stresses the ‘importance of avoiding political intervention’."
"I wish to point out that following the issues raised by fishermen regarding the consequences of fuel price rises for the fisheries sector, the Council of Ministers on Agriculture and Fisheries of 19 and 20 September inexplicably only once ‘took note’ of the situation and failed to decide on a single measure to address the problem."
"As the fishermen have warned, the rise in fuel prices has triggered massive problems for the sector. Many vessels will become unusable unless immediate action is taken, such as financial support to restrict fuel price rises."
"Let me add that fuel increases have served to exacerbate the already difficult situation of many fishermen using traditional methods, who use petrol in the course of their work and do not receive any support to offset the impact of the successive increases in the cost of this fuel."
"Urgent action is therefore required, in addition to other long-term measures."
". The resolution of the European Parliament on reducing oil dependency, which I supported with my vote, comes at a particularly hectic time of constantly-mounting oil prices that endanger the economic stability of the Union."
"Europe must diversify its energy sources and energy supplies, and strengthen its strategy of supporting energy-saving measures and decentralised renewable energy sources."
"The use of alternative energy sources is the most logical answer to increasing oil prices."
"On the other hand, it is necessary to adopt a more forward-looking approach to the ill-considered decommissioning of existing energy installations."
"Provided that the operational safety requirements of such installations are strictly observed, it is not logical to take an stance against nuclear energy, which belongs among the most up-to-date technologies and is a clean source of energy that does not produce CO2 emissions."
"The ill-considered approaches adopted by the opponents of nuclear energy may seriously endanger the energy potential not only of Slovakia, but also of the entire Union."
"The time has come to adopt progressive technological solutions."
"One such solution is the production of bio-ethanol for adding to motor fuels."
"This represents a great opportunity for farmers, who may gradually change from being food producers to energy producers."
"The architecture of the 7th Framework Programme for research and technological development offers an opportunity to consider providing funds for boosting innovation and development in the area of alternative energy sources, and their practical exploitation."
". I welcome the interest which both the Council and Commission have shown concerning the impact of fuel prices and the fisheries sector."
"I hope that the Commission will look seriously at a number of possible initiatives which will help the fisheries sector."
". I believe the United Nations constitutes the most appropriate and only global institution potentially able to foster solutions to global problems."
"I particularly welcome the decision to create a Peace-Building Commission as well as the inclusion of the concept of human security in the official UN framework."
"I also welcome the recognition of the international community's responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, as well as the clear responsibility of each individual state to protect their own citizens from these crimes."
"Reducing extreme poverty and child mortality, providing education and access to clean water and enhancing gender equality must remain at the centre of the development agenda and it is most unfortunate that there is no precise timetable committing all developed countries to the pursuit of the intermediate and final MDG targets;"
"While glad to welcome many of the reforms now proposed by the Summit I deeply regret the it's failure to reach agreement on measures for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament."
"Work and efforts to make progress on these issues must intensify considerably."
". In 1945, the world was emerging from World War II and Europe lay in ruins."
"The United Nations was set up as a beacon of goodwill and hope, and of a desire to free the human race from a kind of tribal relationship of estrangement and exclusion. The idea was to lead us towards a greater civilisation in which we were united in the dignity of equals, and it was through dialogue that this was to be achieved."
"Even without the strength befitting the dimensions of its foundations, the United Nations attempted to dissipate Cold War tensions, in its handling of decolonisation and in regional conflicts."
"Indeed, the organisation is constantly attempting to punch above its weight, with its patchwork of States, for the purposes of peace."
"The EU is rooted in the same moral foundation as the United Nations, in terms of the values of peace, solidarity among peoples, democracy and the rule of law."
"The EU also continues to seek tangible form for its stated aims, by promoting governability, integrated coexistence and the spread of its humanitarian ideals around the world."
"At this time, what is missing in the reform of the UN is the reform of the EU; after all, multipolarity is becoming increasingly embedded in the EU’s political and legal architecture."
"In other words, what the United Nations is missing is a European Constitution."
"This is the way in which high ideals can be put into practice."
".The World Summit 2005, which has just ended, has been a failure, despite many of us preferring to concentrate on the minimal progress made, even if it means exaggerating the scope and importance of that progress."
"The final text adopted, which was the outcome of a laborious compromise, resembles more a catalogue of good intentions and pious hopes than an action programme."
"It must be said, however, that the UN is an old lady of 60 years of age, whose organisation and way of working seem to have been set in stone from birth."
"It is high time, in fact, that the developments brought about in the world since the end of the Second World War were taken into account."
"This would include, for example, agreeing to an increase in the number of permanent members of the Security Council to incorporate Germany, Japan, India and Brazil, but without the right of veto so as not to paralyse the institution."
"Finally, I would like to reaffirm the fact that the UN is an organisation of independent countries and that it is entirely unacceptable that the Commission should claim to represent the Member States of the European Union there on its own."
"Moreover, that is the case whether it is representing Member States at the General Assembly or on the Security Council."
". I voted in favour of this resolution."
"However, I voted against the second half of paragraph 19."
"I believe, in fact, that the political and constitutional conditions for Europe to benefit from a single seat in the United Nations are far from being met and that this situation will not change any time soon on account of the fact that Europe still has no Constitution."
"In the absence of a European Minister for Foreign Affairs who is capable of obtaining a consensus within the European Council, France must retain its seat."
"This resolution either omits or lends tacit support to the ambitions and attempts at transforming the UN into an instrument dominated by the major capitalist powers led by the USA. It also glosses over imperialism’s aggression and interference, which, where possible, is conducted multilaterally."
"Hence the measures proposed by the USA aimed at exploiting human rights, at imposing its ‘right’ to interfere and to resort to force, and at attacking the people and the sovereignty of (other) countries, under the ‘umbrella’ and ‘(pseudo)legitimacy’ of the UN."
"The ‘Millennium Development Goals’ are referred to, yet no mention is made of progress in implementing those goals, such as reducing hunger, poverty and child mortality, guaranteeing access to water, health, education, and promoting equality."
"There are no measures aimed at disarmament and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, having been blocked by the USA, with the complicity of its allies."
"I also wish to highlight the drift towards federalism, which was defeated in the no vote on the draft EU Treaty, but to which the resolution gives succour, in its reference to the ‘prospect of acquiring a joint European seat on the Security Council’ and the ‘merging’ of cabinets and delegations from different countries into a ‘common EU external delegation’."
". The European Parliamentary Labour Party fully supports reform of the United Nations Security Council, in order that it better reflects today's world, and calls for further improvements in the way that the European Union speaks at the UN."
"However, it is inappropriate to talk of an EU seat in paragraph 19, as the UN Charter does not allow for organisations such as the EU to become members."
". I welcome this resolution following up the UN Summit on reform of the Millennium Development Goals."
"It is essential to keep these objectives at the top of the world communities’ priority list."
"Parliament's resolution will be a modest contribution to that objective."
"It is a source of deep regret that the Outcome Document from the summit failed to set new clearly defined targets and measurable indicators for each of the MDGs."
"It is now up the Commission and the Member States to take the initiative to correct this and to ensure that commitments are fulfilled."
". Although I support the substance of this resolution, I could not support the second part of paragraph 19 which supports a separate seat for the EU in the UN Security Council."
"This would undermine those countries which already have a seat on the UN Security Council and thus is not in the British national interest."
". – The resolution by the summit on 60 years of the UN bears the stamp of the new imperialist order, partially overturns the founding principles of the UN and creates preconditions for its being led by the USA and other imperialist powers."
"Despite the objections and certain oppositions expressed, the basic uniform strategy of imperialism has been passed, especially in sections ΙΙΙ and ΙV; the strategy which attempts to legalise its aggressive and barbaric policy."
"In the name of peace and collective security, changes are being made which relate to the use of strategic force by the UN and which indirectly bring ΝΑΤΟ and its rapid intervention forces into its operation."
"A new intervention mechanism is being created entitled 'Peace-Building Commission', which includes a military corps, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (see Iraq)."
"At the same time, references are made to numerous issues which might be pretexts for intervention."
"The proposals of the USA and other imperialists have been adopted to abolish the Human Rights Commission and set up a council and create a Democracy Fund which will be used to consolidate imperialist rule."
"We voted against the joint resolution, noting that everyone who signed it has huge political responsibility in misleading the people as to the future of the UN and, at the same time, accepting the imperialist barbarism which needs to be overturned."
"The proposal for developing a partnership between the EU and India contains quite a few constructive suggestions, including that of developing the economic links between the two continents and strengthening human rights."
"We object, however, to the EU’s threat to introduce protectionist measures in relation to India at a time when the EU is subsidising its own agricultural products and dumping them on the Indian market."
"This would put an end to local production, including that of milk."
"We cannot support the proposal’s overarching aim of strengthening the EU as an international actor."
"The partnership would then become a further way of strengthening the EU’s global role, which undermines the Member States’ foreign policies."
"We therefore choose to vote against the report as a whole."
". This reports outlines the fact that the EU and India have the potential to build a privileged relationship in international relations."
"I welcome the recognition of the role of India as a regional power with global aspirations which shares a common vision with the EU on key factors such as democracy, multilateralism, trade, investment, development and many other issues."
"Given the country's political and economical weight, the report rightly recommends that the EU spares no effort to progress quickly with the consolidation of the strategic association between the EU and India."
". During the recent EU-India Summit, the issue of trade barriers to Scotch whisky was raised."
"I hope that India will reduce its tariffs on this world-class Scottish product."
"Bioenergy is unnecessary. An energy plan consisting of energy savings and involving energy from the permanent energy sources of sun, wind and waves, with hydrogen as the energy carrier, is more than enough to cover the needs of the planet."
"At the same time, such a plan leads to high energy efficiency and clean combustion."
"There is, then, no reason for using cultivatable land for energy purposes."
"If bioenergy comes into the picture, it should only be as fuel for furnaces used by more than one supplier."
"It does make for clean and efficient bio combustion, but not on a scale that justifies its figuring as part of an overarching plan for supplying energy."
"Bioenergy is a renewable, but not a permanent, energy source."
"The plants concerned absorb CO2 corresponding to the CO2 released on combustion."
"Ethanol produced from grain, clover-grass and wood biomass is outweighed by the fossil energy inputs."
"In the case of grain, 29% more energy is used than is produced, the equivalent figures for clover-grass and wood being, respectively, 29% and 57%(1)."
"Finally, the EU should not dictate energy choices in the individual Member States, and certainly not on so doubtful a basis."
". Conservatives are longstanding supporters of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency and energy conservation as important components of the energy mix."
"Conservatives strongly support positive action on climate change and this is why we proposed an ambitious but realistic target of 60% of electricity in the EU from ultra-low or non-CO2 emitting and CO2 neutral energy technologies."
"As Conservatives we firmly believe in a realistic approach to energy policies and oppose adopting mandatory targets which have never been achieved in the EU up to now and therefore make little sense"
". This report seeks to take stock of the progress of Community policy and practical measures developed by the various EU Member States in the area of renewable energy."
"It states that, although some progress has been made, the policies and measures in place will not be sufficient to meet the targets set for the use of energy from renewable sources."
"Against this backdrop, measures are proposed with the aim of reversing this trend, albeit with limited success at present, of which I wish to highlight the following:"
"- Increased training for qualifications and research and development in the areas concerned;"
"- Greater independence for each Member State regarding the targets, options, sectors and technical solutions to be applied;"
"- Greater independence in terms of decision-making and availability of resources for local and regional authorities;"
"- Support for energy agencies at the various intervention levels;"
"- A substantial increase in the structural and cohesion funds and, indeed, the common agricultural policy (rural development) for this purpose;"
"That being said, the report fails to expand on the key issue, which is the clear and explicit recognition of the fact that oil has peaked out, that petrol consumption must be reduced and that alternative energy sources must be made use of."
". The fossil fuel supply will start to run out over the next few decades."
"As a major consumer of energy, Europe must prepare for the switch from fossil fuels to alternative sources of energy."
"In his report, Mr Turmes puts all his money on wind farms and biofuels."
"These so-called sustainable sources of energy are not even part of the solution."
"They have, in the past, taken up a disproportionate share of the European budget without ever having been profitable, or showing any signs of becoming so."
"It is time Europe turned its attention to sustainable energy that in time can meet the requirements of our industries and consumers and struggled out of the grip in which the environmental lobby has kept us for years."
"We should stop being naive and dare to invest in nuclear energy and nuclear fusion."
"In recent years, we have witnessed major scientific breakthroughs in those fields, but Europe is at risk of missing the boat in this respect because it has not thought about nuclear energy for the past 20 years."
"We cannot afford this attitude, if only because China, for example, throws up a new nuclear power plant every six months."
". I should like to congratulate Mr Turmes on his timely report on the Commission communication on the share of renewable energy in the EU."
"I share his opinion on the vital importance of renewable energy to the future of the human race, not least in view of the benefits to the environment and health."
"More specifically, I agree that renewable energy will only increase if there is both the political will and the implementation of measures worldwide, including at EU, national, regional and local level."
". I would like to put forward the following reasons for my vote in support of Claude Turmes’ report on the share of renewable energy in the EU and proposed measures."
"Today, as well as in the foreseeable future, renewable sources of energy are perhaps the only possible solution for decreasing Europe’s dependency on energy (mainly oil and gas) imports, thus reducing the political and economic risks associated with such imports."
"In addition, they bring us a step closer to the fulfilment of the conclusions of the Kyoto Protocol concerning the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which have global effects on climate."
"Support for renewable energy sources must become integrated into European structural policies."
"This will create, especially for the new Member States, an opportunity to encourage their small and medium-sized businesses."
"It also offers a great opportunity for the effective use of public resources – to create added value, employment and income for rural areas through the possible development of multifunctional agriculture, which would otherwise have no prospect of public funding due to its poor economic returns."
"Biomass and biogas production offer environmentally friendly technologies for energy generation that can foster the practical implementation of rural policy in the direction of sustainable development, energy independence and the creation of new jobs."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues reluctantly felt unable to support this report on the grounds that many of the matters voted on are issues for Member States' exclusive competence."
"Whilst we fully support the aims of the Rapporteur in ensuring a reduction in road traffic accidents, we nevertheless feel the best way to achieve this is through an exchange of best practice between Member States rather than legislation at a European level."
".One cannot but endorse the objective of reducing the number of road traffic accident victims, which is very high (43 000 deaths per year in the European Union)."
"I fear, however, that in order to achieve this, priority will be given, once again, to poorly targeted crackdowns, in place of training and information."
"I fear that there will not be enough attention paid, either, to the specific characteristics of certain countries which, on account of being popular destinations – tourist or otherwise – or of being transit countries, are forced to manage substantial traffic flows that by definition increase the risk of accidents, but where those who are penalised the most are the citizens."
"When all is said and done, I fear that the mistakes made in my country will be repeated, whereby drivers often have the impression that they are being persecuted over trivial matters while the criminals are prospering and that the government measures are designed less to guarantee their safety than to make them pay systematic fines, while the only alternative proposed to the freedom offered by a car is to take public transport, which is impractical, too expensive and often plagued by crime."
"The report contains many constructive proposals for improving road safety in Europe."
"We think, however, that the EU is being given a disproportionate role in road safety work."
"The report points out that, if all the Member States were to achieve the same results as the United Kingdom and Sweden, the number of fatalities would fall by 17 000 a year in the European Union of 25 Member States, representing a reduction of 39%."
"The report also points out that, through a campaign launched in 2002, France succeeded in reducing the number of fatalities by 30% over two years."
"The individual Member States can, then, improve their own road safety records, and it is they who, in the last analysis, are responsible for these issues."
"Political responsibility lies with the national parliaments."
"This report goes too far in, for example, even calling upon the Commission to promote training as early as at elementary school level with a view to reducing the death rate among the young."
"Responsibility for integrating road safety training into school curricula lies with the Member States."
"We are voting against this report as we think it is based on false ideas about the political level at which responsibility for road safety issues lies."
". Whilst the volume of road traffic has trebled in the last three decades, the number of deaths has halved."
"Nevertheless, road accidents remain the biggest killer among the under-50s."
"Strong action must therefore be taken to promote road safety."
"Mr Vatanen’s report, which has my full support, welcomes the implementation of the 3rd Road Safety Action Programme, which targets halving the number of deaths on Europe’s roads by 2010."
"The report also highlights the key role that the European Road Safety Agency and an EU Road Safety Framework with performance indicators could play in achieving the objectives of the 3rd Road Safety Action Plan."
"Accordingly, in the short term, drivers’ behaviour should improve with the implementation of legislation, monitoring campaigns, training and education."
"In the long term, technological initiatives (electronic safety) and the increasing integration of electronic devices in ‘intelligent vehicles’ will help to meet these objectives."
"Lastly, road infrastructure should be improved and adapted to current traffic levels."
". In light of the increasing number of road accidents in Europe this report is a timely initiative calling for the number of accidents and deaths on EU roads to be cut by half by 2010."
"This laudable objective has my full support."
"In particular I welcome the emphasis given in the report to the protection and safety of vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists."
"However, in attempting to raise standards across the EU attention should be paid to the situation in individual Member States, such as the UK, which have good working mechanisms in place: Concerted government-led campaigns have contributed to an attitude of zero-tolerance among the British public with regard to drink-driving."
"It is therefore unclear that an EU wide harmonisation of speed limits and blood-alcohol limits would significantly benefit road-users in the UK at this time."
". I support the stance of this report that, if the fundamental rules of road safety are not adhered to, neither improved infrastructure nor technological advances can guarantee the life of the everyday road user driver, cyclist, passenger or pedestrian."
"Estimated figures for 2004 reveal that there were 43 000 road fatalities in Europe."
"A quarter of these fatalities were 15-24 years old."
"This is a shocking figure."
"The objective of reducing and even removing this statistic should be at the centre of all future road safety policy throughout Europe."
"In Ireland some schools have been providing driving lessons as part of the transition year curriculum."
"I think this is something that could be expanded upon, throughout Europe, because schools offer a unique opportunity to educate this very venerable road user group."
"I would like to see a more targeted approach being taken to curve the number of road users drivers, young drivers specifically, cyclists, and pedestrians dying, unnecessarily, on European roads."
"We have a lot to learn from each other on this and exchange of best practice is important."
"I agree with Mr. Vatanen that the improvement of the road users' behaviour offers the biggest potential for cutting road accident figures."
"On paragraph 5, Amendment 9, I voted against harmonisation of speed limits to km/h, as I believe people in Scotland are happy with miles/h. This amendment would have created a heavy burden on the Scottish taxpayer without any tangible benefits and I am glad it was defeated."
"On the other amendments concerning blood/alcohol levels, as the UK has more stringent legislation I prefer our own national legislation."
"The European Parliamentary Labour Party (EPLP) is in favour of this initiative to halve the number of road traffic accidents in the EU by 2010. However, we have several reservations."
"For example, the UK currently has blood alcohol limits of 0.8mg compared to 0.2mg in Sweden."
"Despite the divergence between these levels, the two countries have the best road safety record in the EU."
"If the EU had the same road safety records as these two countries there would be 17 000 fewer road fatalities a year, a reduction of 39% on current levels, going a great way to achieving the 50% reduction in fatalities by 2010."
"The EPLP believes therefore the emphasis should not be on harmonization but in sharing best practice on enforcement in road safety."
"Similarly the EPLP does not see the need to harmonize speed limits."
"This would lead to very peculiar road signs in the UK resulting in bizarre figures when speed limits are converted from Km/h to miles per hour."
"The EPLP therefore cannot support harmonization of blood alcohol levels and speed limits at this time."
"The Swedish Conservatives and Christian Democrats have today chosen to vote against the own-initiative report on road safety."
"We believe that road safety in all its forms is incredibly important and that the report makes a number of very important proposals."
"The reason for our position is, however, that the report is in large part dominated by issues that should be dealt with at national, rather than EU, level."
"An expansion of EU influence in the road safety area would lead to unnecessary detailed regulations and more bureaucracy."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report by Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on prospects for trade relations between the EU and China [2005/2015(INI)] (A6-0262/2005)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe seems remote from the man in the street, but China scares people."
"Just as globalisation is frightening people at the moment – at any rate that is the outcome not only of the referendums in France and the Netherlands, but also of the elections in Germany, which have shown that people are somewhat afraid of reform."
"The particular subject of China, however, and of trade relations with China in particular, can give the European Union greater meaning and purpose."
"We are an export-oriented economic unit, and we Europeans need the Chinese market."
"For that, we need as much free trade as possible, yet it is the European Union alone that will ultimately help us against unfettered globalisation and the possible loss of our own cultural identity."
"That is easy to demonstrate."
"We do need safeguards, though."
"Particularly where intellectual property is concerned, we Europeans are not strategic enough; we do not act decisively enough."
"If that does not change soon, we will be sawing off the branch on which we are sitting, and that will become clear very soon, especially in the Europeans’ relationship with the Chinese."
"We must be even more forceful, more outspoken and more strategic in protecting intellectual property against the Chinese, and we must do that as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, after a summer of difficult negotiations between Commissioner Mandelson and China about the global textile industry, it is time we replaced sectoral, ad hoc policy by a sound and long-term vision of trade relations between the European Union and China."
"The enormous growth figures and the prospect of China as the world’s largest exporter should not stand in the way of a factual analysis of the European trade relations with China."
"After all, the opportunities of the Chinese market must be seen in the right light."
"China is primarily geared towards taking care of the growth potential of its domestic demand itself."
"Above all else, Beijing wants to promote its own activity whereby it does not hesitate to stimulate price harmonisation or to dump temporary surpluses on the world market."
"Another problem in the trade relations with China is the large-scale violation of intellectual property."
"China acts too much in the tradition of Confucius, the Chinese philosopher, according to whom the imitation of a master is commendable."
"The European Union must put this problem at the top of its agenda."
"A climate of piracy and counterfeiting not only damages European enterprises, it also hinders the innovative character of local Chinese enterprises."
"The European Union must insist on the Chinese judiciary extending its specialist knowledge in the field of intellectual property."
"I take the view that Europe must venture to compete with up-and-coming economies such as China’s, provided this is done on a level playing field."
"Even the world’s largest exporter has duties as well as rights."
"– Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for her excellent and informative report and I also want to add some thoughts to what was mentioned by her in her introductory part of the report."
"As far as China is concerned, we have to develop a comprehensive system in the field of trading relations because if that is missing, we have to fight against the dumping of textiles today or that of shoes, cars or anything else in the future."
"Therefore, I would like to call attention to other aspects of the relationship between the European Union and China as well, that can help us in creating and implementing such a complex commercial reform."
"The amazingly rapid development of China must inevitably entail a political reform in the country."
"Well, we may have to wait for that for a while, and a rapid change would most probably destabilise the Far East region at this point."
"Nevertheless, there is no doubt about the fact that China has become a global player not only because of its size but also of its economy."
"Therefore I strongly urge each and every institution of the European Union not to fight against China but to assist it on the road to becoming a country where norms meeting EU requirements will be implemented in everyday practice by modifying and complying with the applicable laws."
"This way we give China the opportunity to reconsider everything that myself and my fellow Members have condemned within the field of environment protection, the rights of employees, counterfeiting and so on."
"Earlier this year I had the opportunity to negotiate with several representatives of the Chinese Government and they were all very open to the idea of a comprehensive conversation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as China has now started to open up to the world, if we can lend a helping hand to them politically, we will be able to shape their future in a way that meets both their expectations and our own."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fact that the most highly populated country in the world is an economic superpower capable of affecting the course of the global economy."
"It is incontestably a power with which all the other economic zones need to compete."
"Nor must we forget that China is today the second biggest trade partner of the European Union after the United States of America."
"With its accession to the WTO in 2001 and the opening of its market to international trade, China is now a very important factor in international trade."
"So we are talking about an economic, historic, cultural and commercial giant which appears today to be waking up after a very long sleep."
"However, one of the obstacles to harmonious relations between the European Union and China is the problem of passing off; the imitation of European products and brands by Chinese industries is a serious infringement of the rules of international trade."
"The Commission therefore needs to take suitable measures to protect the intellectual property of European companies and to support the Chinese authorities in the fight which they have started to control the problem."
"The Member States, in turn, need to carry out effective controls of their internal markets in order to protect European consumers from products which do not meet the 'C' standard."
"What measures does the Commission intend to take in this direction, Commissioner?"
"Another point I would like to comment on is the transport sector."
"China needs to improve connections between its transport networks and international networks, in order to facilitate the free movement of people and goods."
"This is also the only way to safeguard controls of exportable products."
"Finally, I would like to ask this: would it be a good idea for the Commission to create a closer partnership with the People's Republic of China by extending bilateral cooperation in several sectors, which might prove to be beneficial to both sides?"
"It is therefore in the interest of the European Union to support the consolidation of democracy and the market economy and the development of China in a free and open country in which the rule of law will prevail."
"– Mr President, several fellow Members have spoken about China’s entitlement to the advantages of WTO membership and globalisation."
"However, when enjoying those advantages, China must comply with the WTO rules and other international norms such as human rights and social rights."
"The free flow of goods is important, but the free flow of thoughts is equally important."
"Free trade is important, but the freedom of people is just as important."
"Several people have recently expressed their concern about the Hungarian Prime Minister, Mr Ferenc Gyurcsány, promising that more than one billion Chinese citizens can travel to Hungary without a visa."
"I would like to assure you that this is not the official Hungarian position, and it is not supported either by the Fidesz or the European People’s Party."
"At the same time, I strongly appreciate that the report draws attention to the alarming situation of human rights in China, initiates the immediate elimination of child labour and hard labour and expects compliance with the fundamental social and labour norms."
"In this context, it is hard to interpret the statement of the Hungarian Prime Minister that the economic and social model of China should be followed in many respects."
"European Union membership means that countries share the same common values and these common values – like freedom and respect for human rights – shall govern the common foreign and security policy."
"Maintaining visa requirements in the case of China serves the safety of European citizens."
"These higher interests cannot be subordinated to the momentary vagaries of politicians."
"Mr President, it must be very difficult for the Commissioner to come here with a brief that he may not know quite as much about as some of the speakers."
"At this point I should like to add our disappointment that Mr Mandelson decided not to come and also not to inform the Committee on International Trade that he was not going to attend."
"It would have been polite."
"I understand the reasons why and would have accepted them had he at least informed us."
"Today, we heard the Commissioner again trying to explain the inexplicable, claiming that his actions with regard to the reinstatement of the Chinese textile quotas were carried out diligently and transparently and that the difficulties arising from this nonsense of a compromise were caused by unforeseen circumstances."
"I wrote to the Commissioner in June prior to the Shanghai Agreement, asking him how his proposals would square the circle of the seemingly insatiable demand for Chinese textiles in Europe."
"His response was to claim that he had found a once-and-for-all agreement."
"I do not underestimate the scale of the tasks that the Commissioner faces with China."
"It is a problem and there is no easy solution."
"However, I believe that fudges of the kind perpetrated in June and again at the beginning of this month will not solve the underlying potential difficulties we have with our trade with China."
"There are many aspects of the Lucas report with which I do not agree."
"However, in recognising that in years to come we will have the same problem with other industries that we have with the textile industry, I believe she is extremely and entirely accurate."
"Saying that we can move up the value-added chain will only work for so long."
"China is producing two million graduates a year."
"If you believe that these young people will continue to make cheap t-shirts and bras, then you are slightly misinformed."
"We should view the growth of China as an opportunity and not a threat, and we look forward to working closely with China."
"I must add one last point: selling China arms to balance our trade deficit is not the answer."
"I hope the Commissioner will have an answer for that."
"Geopolitical concerns over Taiwan and international relations should only make short-term profits."
"I just wondered what your position is on the sale of arms."
"Mr President, I would like to thank my friend Robert for a very Sturdy speech!"
"I can only support this report very reluctantly because the tone of it is not quite right."
"We have to understand that China is a great country with a population three times the size of the European Union. It became a nation state 2000 years ago and has remained one until today."
"China has a civilisation that is much older than most of ours and our relationship with China is a relationship of equals in which neither side really has the right to lecture the other."
"China has its own way of doing things."
"We must continue to find ways of cooperating with China and if each side of the relationship tries hard enough to understand and accommodate the basic concerns of the other, by looking ahead in a proactive way, the future is bright."
"But if we fail, we will be plunged into damaging and acrimonious competition."
"The recent crisis over textile imports should be a lesson to us all."
"Today the EU-China relationship is in a very active and productive phase and bilateral relationships are in a more mature, healthy and stable condition than ever."
"We have to develop this with diligence and sensitivity, striving always to find common ground and to minimise our inevitable differences."
"We need to maximise our trading synergies and work together on the big international problems of our age, including terrorism, nuclear proliferation and the fight against hunger and disease."
"None of this will be easy but there is a very relevant proverb in China: ."
"I will try to translate: in effect it says that there is nothing so difficult in this world that it cannot be resolved by people with high aspirations."
"I have no doubt that there are such people on both sides of our relationship and I look forward to a bright and mutually rewarding future in cooperation with China."
". Mr President, I am happy to say that the scope of the debate which we are just concluding has gone much further than trade relations."
"The debate has confirmed that China is a powerful country, with 20% of the world's population, with a rapidly growing economy and a huge volume of international trade."
"China is a country which plays an increasingly important role in the world economy and also in international politics."
"All the speakers raised legitimate concerns: the shortcomings of democracy; the vulnerability and fragility of human rights, including the rights of employees; the extremely low wages and the low environmental standards which make China very competitive."
"I assure you that the Commission is fully aware of these problems and furthermore we are aware of the serious impact of the Chinese model on other developing countries attempting to compete with China."
"They are forced into a race to the bottom; they are forced to lower their social and environmental standards, if they want to be competitive."
"In dealing with China, a country of enormous potential and stark contradictions, the European Union has two options."
"The first is the schoolmaster attitude: to exert pressure on China to comply."
"I do not think that will work."
"The second is to establish a partnership, to cooperate with China and make it listen to our concerns and take them on board – to engage with China and not try to isolate it."
"This, I believe, is a promising option."
"In 1985 the European Communities signed the first framework agreement with China, which was limited to trade relations."
"We have to appreciate the enormous changes in China; the political, economic and scientific development, unprecedented in such a relatively short period of 20 years."
"And the changes are accelerating."
"China has changed, and so have our relations."
"We have achieved a breakthrough in different fields."
"I refer to the customs cooperation agreement, which will and should play an important role in combating counterfeiting."
"I refer to the dialogue on employment and social standards; the partnership on climate change; and the working group on intellectual property rights."
"The recent summit confirmed that it is time to start negotiations on a new framework agreement."
"The Commission is seeking a mandate from the Council to start the talks as soon as possible."
"The new framework agreement will be much broader in scope than the first one signed 20 years ago, because it should reflect the changes in China and in our relations."
"It should work as an umbrella, covering all possible fields of cooperation."
"It should have a substantial trade and investment component, but it should also cover energy, political dialogue, social issues, human rights and a number of other fields."
"Through close cooperation, through a relationship based on partnership, we can encourage China to play an active role in addressing the global challenges."
"All the changes we want to promote and encourage serve the interests of the international community, the European Union and its Member States, but also serve the interests of China."
"That makes me optimistic."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 13 October 2005."
"China is one of the major economic players in the world."
"Europe is competing with India, Russia and the USA for the Chinese market of over one billion consumers."
"Europe is also fighting for its own place in the world trade system, trying to deal with unfair imports and with international importers whose only aim is to make the maximum profit with no regard for the economic interests of countries and the economy as a whole."
"As we open up our markets to the cheap imported goods eagerly awaited by European consumers who make up our electorate, we should keep rising unemployment and the thousands of collapsing companies in the forefront of our minds."
"We have been unable to deal with the ongoing crisis in the textile industry."
"China does not only represent imports, but also the opportunity for investment in Europe."
"We should be encouraging the latter, so that jobs can be created in Europe."
"Within the framework of the European Union, it would be appropriate to consider possibilities for relocating the production of European companies in Member States with relatively low labour costs that were worst affected by unrestricted imports."
"The Chinese economy and the whole of Chinese society will undergo a period of instability over the next few years."
"This will be due to the relaxation of the policy on work and the retraining of a large section of society that will cease to depend on farming for a living."
"We must also be prepared for the emergence of strong tensions within Chinese society, and the Union should help to deal with these."
"Europeans should be active in China, and Europe and China need to learn to work together and cease doing battle with each other."
"Both parties will lose out if we continue the battle, but if we learn to cooperate we shall win friends and partners."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the human rights situation in Nepal."
". Mr President, for nine years Nepal has been in the middle of a bloody civil war."
"Maoist rebels have engaged in violent confrontations in Nepal with the state army causing thousands of deaths."
"Human rights abuses have been rife; NGOs have published shocking reports of child soldiers fighting for Maoists, and who, if captured, were imprisoned by the state."
"We also heard of villages being destroyed in the midst of armed conflict and minorities being targeted for discrimination."
"However, very little has been done to quell this particular situation."
"Disbanding the government in February has only served to increase civil unrest and demonstrations and to harden the stance of the Maoists, with restrictions placed on the media and political players doing nothing to help restore public confidence or restart the process of democracy."
"We in the European Parliament have been disappointed that our previous resolution was ignored."
"I would now urge the government and the King to engage in political dialogue to find a peaceful solution."
"I would strongly implore him and his government to make progress, especially in light of the Troika next week."
"I call on Nepal to work towards elections by next year."
"I appreciate that municipal elections are planned for April and I see no legitimate reason why national elections cannot be held at the same time."
"On 3 September 2005, the Maoist groups declared a ceasefire."
"It must be sustained and reciprocated."
"With the support of the international community, it could mark the start of much-needed peace talks."
"If changes are not made, the situation will worsen."
"Nepal is among the poorest and least-developed countries in the world."
"However, it has so much to offer."
"We must do all in our power to allow this beautiful and inspiring people to develop into a peaceful nation once again."
"The international community must support peaceful negotiations."
"I would strongly urge the Council and the Commission to work with the King and all the other players to broker a peace deal in this fragile country."
". Mr President, the ceasefire declared by the Maoists in Nepal now offers a new window of opportunity which, if exploited properly, could help to resolve the armed conflict in that country."
"To this end, as recommended by the International Crisis Group, international society must change its current approach, particularly with regard to the monarchy."
"Over the seven months since the royal coup d’état, the violence has increased considerably, as well as kidnaps, torture, unjustified arrests, disappearances, etc., committed by both government forces and the Maoists."
"For its part, the Government is caught up in a spiral of corruption and inefficiency."
"And not just that: it cannot manage the conflict properly and it is also failing with regard to general government and State affairs."
"The persecution of leaders of democratic parties, the arrest of journalists during pro-democracy demonstrations and the harassment of union groups have only made the situation worse."
"Within this context and in view of the ceasefire declaration by the Maoists, and following the first steps taken by the alliance between seven parties to promote a political process aimed at resolving the armed conflict, King Gyanendra must respond with a governmental ceasefire and must begin constructive talks with the political groups and with the Maoists, with the ultimate objective of re-establishing democracy in Nepal."
"Furthermore, the government must release the political prisoners still behind bars and must guarantee respect for human rights and freedom of expression, particularly on the part of the Nepalese security forces and military."
"In the mean time, the Council and the Member States must ensure that the suspension of military assistance remains in place, in strict application of the code of conduct on arms exports."
"Finally, we must demand that the Nepalese Government re-establish the Tibetan Refugee Welfare Office in Kathmandu, in cooperation with ACNUR, as is usually the case."
". Mr President, in February King Gyanendra executed a military takeover in Nepal that overthrew the legal government."
"The parliament had already been dissolved earlier on, and the opposition had not had a chance to act."
"Journalists have been imprisoned, as have active trade unionists."
"The king has breached the constitution and all the rules of democracy."
"A state of emergency has been declared in the country, whose only reason is the takeover."
"Many kinds of human rights violations have been reported in Nepal."
"People are disappearing without a trace to a greater extent than in any other country, and only the police and army know what has happened to them."
"Internal security troops have no kind of control of the law and are reported to be torturing citizens."
"People are being arrested and held prisoner without a trial."
"The European Parliament does not have competence in external policy, but there is every reason to adopt a joint political position with regard to Nepal’s internal affairs on behalf of democracy."
"Mr President, the debate on Nepal is taking place at the right time, because the EU Troika will be visiting that country early next week."
"King Gyanendra’s intervention on 1 February has done little to alleviate poverty."
"The main source of revenue, tourism, is increasingly drying up."
"There have been 2 000 casualties this year alone, and 30 000 people have been driven out of the Kapilvastu region by the conflict."
"Despite the European Union and the international community having called on the King to restore basic democratic rights, politicians, student leaders and trade union members are under arrest."
"Journalists continue to be banned from voicing their opinions."
"Commissioners answerable only to the King have been appointed chairmen of the village parliaments."
"The district committee chairmen elected by the people have been replaced by palace envoys."
"On 3 September, the Maoists announced a three-month ceasefire and many hopes were raised."
"I have my doubts, because the rebels have already broken their unilateral ceasefires twice in the past."
"Nevertheless, every opportunity should be taken for bilateral and trilateral talks."
"The announcement of local elections for April 2006 is a positive sign."
"We in the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats believe it is important that elections to the national parliament should be held at the same time and not just within two years; there should be international observers present and, it is to be hoped, with all the parties taking part."
"The political leadership could give a sign that human rights are being respected by at last reversing the closure of the Tibetan Refugees Welfare Office (TRWO) in Kathmandu."
"This partner institution of the UN Human Rights Convention is an indispensable place of refuge for Tibetans who are obliged to flee their homeland."
"The Dalai Lama’s representation must also be reopened."
"I hope the citizens of Nepal, some of the nicest people you could imagine but who have been suffering deprivation for many years, will finally get the peace for which they long."
". This conflict has cost 12 000 lives over the last decade, many of them civilians from among the most vulnerable sections of the population."
"Amnesty International has reported that tens of thousands of children are abducted from schools by Maoist fighters to attend so-called political education and some, of course, are recruited as child soldiers."
"The security forces are also guilty of violations of children's rights."
"The extrajudicial killings of young people and others must stop."
"All abuses by the security forces must be properly investigated."
"All political prisoners must be released or tried under due process of law."
"I welcome the Maoist ceasefire and I hope there will be an indefinite extension to this, but the King must reciprocate and he must also engage in constructive talks."
"We in the EU must also play our part."
"I call on the Council and the Member States to continue the suspension of military aid and call for all aid to be monitored and for certain sanctions to be imposed."
"This really is to put pressure on the King and the government to restore democracy in Nepal."
"It is long overdue."
". Mr President, Nepal is one of those fragile, weak states."
"Such countries’ hallmarks are the inability of the state to take responsibility for a monopoly on legalised violence and general security, and an inability to control its borders."
"Moreover, systematic violation of human rights, a democracy deficit, non-transparent decision-making and a restricted economic structure are what unite these weak countries."
"As we have seen with Afghanistan and Sudan, the problems of fragile states can create regional instability, cause uncontrolled floods of refugees, and in the worst cases provide terrorists with hideouts."
"If full-blown civil war breaks out, the costs of such a conflict are colossal."
"The situation is also made problematic by the fact that there are those in Nepal who are benefiting financially from the disorder there."
"They have nothing to lose if the war continues."
"Despite the difficulties, the international community should not leave Nepal to its own devices."
"If we do, innocent civilians will bear the burden."
"I enthusiastically support the recommendations concerning the United Nations and the European Union in the resolution, and I hope that Parliament will send observers to the elections in 2006."
". Mr President, Nepal is home to 23 million people and it is one of the poorest countries in the world."
"Half the population of Nepal is unemployed, and 42% of it lives below the poverty line."
"The situation is further aggravated by the violation of fundamental human rights resulting from brutal fighting between Maoist rebels and government forces during the last nine years."
"Armed Maoist rebels control a significant proportion of the rural areas and over 12 000 people, half of whom were civilians, have died as a result of their activities."
"In an attempt to put an end to this lengthy conflict, the King of Nepal declared a state of emergency earlier this year."
"This led to the suspension of most civil rights and to the curtailment of freedom of the press and of expression."
"Since the introduction of the state of emergency, dramatic waves of arrests have taken place in Nepal, hundreds of political leaders and activists have been detained, and violence and murders have escalated."
"Women and children have also suffered during the years of war and violence in Nepal."
"They have been killed, illegally detained, tortured, raped or recruited to take part in military activities."
"At present, Nepal is relatively calm as there has been a temporary cease-fire, but the Nepalese authorities are unable to tackle the enormous problems facing them single-handedly."
"In my opinion, it will only be possible to restore democracy and the rule of law in Nepal with the help of the international community."
"I would therefore also like to call on the international organisations to help launch a constructive dialogue bringing together all parties to the conflict with a view to restoring the democratic political process and ensuring respect for human rights and civil liberties in Nepal."
"Mr President, we welcome this resolution on human rights in Nepal, particularly because the Socialist International Asia-Pacific Committee in Ulan Bator recently expressed its grave concern over the deteriorating situation in that country since the February coup d'état."
"All sides in this civil conflict – the insurgent Communist Party of Nepal, Marxists and the Nepalese Royalist Army – are committing human rights abuses on a massive scale."
"However, we saw on 3 September the declaration of a unilateral ceasefire by the Maoist rebels and the response by the Seven-Party Alliance to try to start at the political level a process to resolve the armed conflict."
"We therefore call on the King to restore democracy, call fresh elections and lift the restrictions on the media; to call for a follow-up to the 2002 London International Conference; to set out the principles to underpin a peace process in Nepal and to bring together King Gyanendra, the Maoist rebel groups and the main political parties."
"In the meantime we ask that the Commission, the Council and the Member States continue to put pressure on the King and his administration to respond positively, making it clear that any failure to respond will mean the isolation of the current regime, accompanied by smart sanctions."
". Mr President, seven months have passed since the royal takeover in Nepal, but the political and human rights situation in the country has not improved."
"On the contrary, the human rights situation remains critical and it is estimated that the conflict-related death toll has risen considerably since 1 February."
"It can also be observed that a number of measures introduced under royal rule are contrary to the guarantees of freedom of expression and association in the 1990 Constitution, pointing towards a return to the pre-1990 Panchayat system of governance."
"As was to be expected, the Royal Nepalese Army has failed to control the insurgent threat and incurred heavy losses, most notably on 7 August when the Maoists overran an army base in Kalikot."
"The Maoists, on the other hand, do not appear to have been weakened since February, although they lack wide popular support."
"Nevertheless, there are some positive developments as well: a Memorandum of Understanding was agreed at the UN Commission of Human Rights in April this year to launch a human rights monitoring mission and to set up four regional offices of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the country."
"The European Commission is planning to support the mission with a contribution of EUR 5 million, which is 30% of the total mission budget, and the first results are encouraging."
"It becomes increasingly apparent that the 1 February coup has unleashed many genies from the bottle: demands for republicanism and total democracy are now permeating Nepalese society from all sides and it remains to be seen whether the much advocated 'twin pillars' of constitutional monarchy and multi-party democracy are the only viable option for Nepal's future."
"The forthcoming EU Troika visit to Nepal, planned from 4 to 6 October, will assess the developments since the last visit in December 2004 and aim to offer public support for the moderate voices in the democratic middle ground working towards the EU's goal of a sustainable peace based on the principles of civilian, accountable and democratic government."
"Working closely with the European Union Member States and especially the successive European Union Council Presidencies, the Commission remains committed to pursuing all efforts, whether they are diplomatic, political, or developmental, that might facilitate the peace process and the return to democracy in Nepal."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5 p.m. this afternoon."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the human rights situation in Tunisia."
"Mr President, it is always very unpleasant to have an urgent debate involving a country with which we have an Association Agreement. Such is the case with Tunisia, and I would say that, in many respects, this Association Agreement is very productive."
"Be that as it may, certain events have taken place recently which my friends from my party and from the other parties undoubtedly will describe and which force us to examine this resolution."
"The first thing I would request from Tunisia, therefore, without entering into the core debate on the current problem, is that it implement and put into operation as quickly as possible its ‘EU-Tunisia Human Rights’ Subcommittee, which might allow us together to deal with individual and collective cases that we encounter in this resolution, without having to engage in an urgent debate."
"The second issue, and one of the most significant, that we have with Tunisia is the freeze on funds allocated to the Tunisian League of Human Rights, a freeze on funds that is preventing projects from being carried out today."
"We insist, in the resolution, that these funds be released."
"The third issue, which is the one mentioned here, is the matter of harassment affecting organisations such as the Tunisian League of Human Rights, the Magistrates’ Association and the Journalists’ Union, which are being prevented from operating as they should."
"It is unacceptable for a country with which we have such worthwhile agreements, for a country that, moreover, has a social security system, is witnessing an increased life expectancy among its inhabitants, has played an altogether leading role in the areas of education and health care and where equality between men and women is a reality."
"Consequently, we have a paradoxical situation, and we genuinely hope that this resolution leads Tunisia not to consider human rights and the activities of those who defend them as undermining national security."
"An offence against national security is a very elastic concept, and we genuinely hope to resume our efforts on a firm footing, while demonstrating our strong determination in this resolution."
"Mr President, like Mrs De Keyser, I too am extremely concerned about the complaints reaching us from Tunisia of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, particularly given that we have an association agreement with that country. In fact, this was the first Mediterranean country with which we have signed an association agreement within the context of the process of Euro-Mediterranean integration."
"Article 2 of that Agreement clearly stipulates that respect for democratic principles and fundamental rights must underpin the internal and external policies of the parties and that respect is an essential element of the Agreement."
"Nevertheless, within this context, on 5 September the National Congress of the Tunisian Human Rights League, scheduled for the 9th and 10th of this month, was suspended by judicial decision."
"Furthermore, on the eve of the World Summit on the Information Society, which must take place in Tunisia in the middle of November, the situation today is as follows: there is no free movement of information, websites with political content and those relating to human rights are being blocked and human rights activists are constantly threatened and the lawyers defending their causes persecuted."
"For all of these reasons, and within the framework of the privileged political dialogue between the European Union and Tunisia, we must demand that the Tunisian authorities immediately cease all forms of violence and persecution against human rights activists and guarantee freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of association."
"To this end, we must ask them explicitly to allow the Tunisian Human Rights League, the Union of Tunisian Journalists and the Association of Tunisian Judges to carry out their activities."
"Secondly, the Tunisian authorities must legally recognise all of the human rights NGOs and suspend the legal proceedings underway against them."
"Specifically, we must call for the release of all those people arbitrarily sentenced, for example, in the Zarzis Internet users affair, as well as those people being held solely for having exercised their right to expression, association or assembly, as in the case of the lawyer, Mohammed Abbou."
"In summary, we wish to urge the Council and the Commission to base their political dialogue with Tunisia on a clear defence of democracy, respect for human rights, the Rule of Law and good governance."
"To this end, we, like Mrs De Keyser, also call for the creation of a European Union-Tunisia human rights sub-committee to debate the overall human rights situation and to deal in particular with individual cases."
". Mr President in November the World Summit on the Information Society is to be held in Tunisia."
"The imprisonment and trial of the lawyer, Mohamed Abbou, show that this meeting is being organised in a country which does not practise freedom of speech and does not permit freedom of activity on the part of journalists’ trade unions and human rights organisations, in particular the International League for Human Rights."
"In our resolution we are calling for the immediate release of Maître Abbou."
"There is good reason to press Tunisia to act to strengthen democracy, establish the principles of the rule of law, respect human rights, safeguard people’s right to speak and express themselves freely, and guarantee the independence of the judiciary, in accordance with the acquis of the Barcelona process."
"Furthermore, the social status of women needs improving."
"It is not just a problem of Tunisia’s Arab culture: it is a common problem with developing countries."
"It cannot be excused in Tunisia just because there are other countries where women are socially inferior."
". Mr President, Tunisia is an EU-Euromed Association partner country, which is almost unique in the Islamic world by its full commitment to building a modern secular society."
"This is to the point that it actually forbids polygamy; it bans the hijab in public places and has an established and protected Jewish community."
"Tunisia has in recent years faced a hostile, fundamentalist, Islamic opposition inspired by Salafist and Wahhabi teachings and committed to the violent overthrow of its government."
"This state of affairs explains in part why the government of President Ben Ali has had to impose a rather tough regime, which falls well short of the standards we would enjoy in the EU."
"I am convinced, however, that Tunisia is now genuinely committed to long-term reform and to promoting genuine human rights, good governance and secular democracy."
"I commend this resolution, which is balanced and constructive, and I will be supporting Tunisia in the process."
"We in the European Parliament – and I in particular, as the rapporteur for the European Neighbourhood Policy – will all be closely monitoring this process."
". Mr President, Tunisia is a country that in recent years has made significant steps towards the advancement of respect for the human rights of its citizens."
"Nevertheless there is still plenty of room for much-needed further progress."
"Many disturbing reports still come from Tunisia of arbitrary detentions, judicial harassment of human rights activists and their organisations, systemic repression of freedom of expression and association, as well as censorship and state-control of internet access and use."
"The team of eminent experts in the fields of new information technologies, the media and human rights that visited Tunisia last January seems to have documented convincingly many instances where the Tunisian authorities appear guilty of violation of international law and disregard for human rights."
"Furthermore, the severe intimidation to which the state has subjected the Tunisian League of Human Rights for the last 30 years is totally unacceptable."
"We condemn such practices and call upon the Tunisian Government to make sure, through prompt and decisive action, that they soon become a thing of the past."
"This will not only enhance the EU-Tunisia relationship but will strengthen democracy and the rule of law and, consequently, will substantially improve the quality of life of the Tunisian people."
"I am sure that this joint resolution, with its fair recommendations, will be taken very seriously into consideration by the Tunisian Government and I hope that it will not be seen as an act of aggressive interference in internal national matters, but rather as well-meant critical advice from an associate and friend."
"Mr President, Commissioner, practically everything has been said on the subject of this draft resolution, but I would like to give an account here of the visit I made to Tunisia only ten days ago with the Delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries and the Arab Maghreb Union (including Libya), of which I am one of the vice-chairmen. It was a visit during which we met quite a number of important local figures in the context of this relationship between Assemblies."
"The feeling I have upon returning from Tunisia is an ambiguous one. On the one hand, it forces us to bear in mind that, in actual fact, Tunisia is a relatively advanced country, and even a very advanced one in a whole range of areas, as has been pointed out here, whether in terms of equality between men and women, social security or sickness and invalidity insurance, and that, as regards the economy too, there is undoubtedly momentum, but that, alongside this, the government is unable to take on board the slightest criticism or challenge with regard to what is carried out."
"The point I would like to make here is that, as has been mentioned in this House, we have important agreements with Tunisia, which provide for chapters relating to the human rights issue, and that, as the European Union – and I am addressing our Commissioner, in particular – we are not succeeding in enforcing respect for these agreements, which were signed by both parties."
"Consequently, I lay great stress on the need for our representatives on the ground, the representatives of the Union and our institutions in general to exert maximum pressure to ensure that freedom of expression can become a reality in countries such as these."
"That is not sufficiently the case, or at any rate our official representatives in the country do not persuade us that that is the case and, therefore, I would make an appeal to the Commissioner and to our institutions, calling on them to support the democrats who are continually being harassed in Tunisia."
". Mr President, in the first years following the end of French colonial rule nearly 50 years ago, Tunisia appeared to be a model of a modern and tolerant democracy."
"Compared with other Arab countries, it has had, since then, a good record on health care and women’s rights."
"The only imperfection in this positive development at the time was the glorification of Habib Bourgiba, the man who considered himself to be the Father of the Nation."
"His authoritarian traits were later adopted, and reinforced, by successors who were far less popular."
"These successors have constantly identified threats against which the state has to protect itself."
"In order to maintain the stability of a state unencumbered by opposition or a free press, they have taken steps to gradually curb freedom and democracy."
"The upshot is that non-governmental organisations cannot function freely and that people with a critical attitude end up behind bars."
"Europe is still too lenient in its judgment of Tunisia, but it is time we made it clear that that country is moving further away from Europe."
"My group believes that this should be spelled out more clearly than it is in the proposed resolution."
"I can attest to all the positive things that have been said about Tunisia, a country where I worked as a medical doctor during the term of President Bourguiba."
"At this point, however, I would like to speak about a case currently being dealt with by the Slovak Republic."
"In February 2003, a Slovak national was detained in Tunisia and, in contravention of all customary procedures and the obligation of consular notification under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the Slovak side was not informed about the detention of this Slovak citizen until December of that year."
"This citizen was denied his rights; although he did not understand the language of the proceedings, he was not provided with an interpreter, and in two trials held on the same day in December 2004, he received a 14-year prison sentence, allegedly for fraud."
"The Slovak side has doubts about the impartiality of the court proceedings against this Slovak citizen and about the observation of relevant European legal standards."
"The Tunisian side, moreover, has so far failed to respond to the aide-mémoire of Slovak foreign minister Kukan in the case."
"I would like to ask the entire international community to assist in ensuring that court procedures and democracy are implemented correctly in Tunisia."
"Mr President, restrictions on freedom of speech in Tunisia are nothing new."
"There is something slightly cynical about the increasing repression of the opposition media, NGOs, students and lawyers in the run up to a UN summit on the information society."
"The development of the information society means free access to information and also the right to disseminate it."
"Like the previous speakers, Commissioner, I too would like to call on you to use the political dialogue with our partner Tunisia to enable the Tunisian League of Human Rights, the journalists’ association and also the judges’ association to resume their activities as quickly as possible and also to secure the immediate release of the lawyer Mohammed Abbou, who was sentenced in April in a trial marked by several irregularities."
". Mr President, the European Commission is devoting great attention to the human rights situation in Tunisia and is using all the means at its disposal to encourage the Tunisian authorities to make progress in this area."
"We are particularly concerned at the breaches of fundamental freedoms, such as the freedoms of expression, association and assembly."
"The European Commission, notably on the basis of the provisions of Article 2 of the Association Agreement, has systematically raised the importance of respecting human rights at the highest level in a bilateral context with the Tunisian authorities, including at the last meeting of the Association Council held on 31 January 2005."
"The European Commission delegation in Tunis is closely monitoring the worrying situation regarding the Tunisian League for the Defence of Human Rights, the significant difficulties faced by a number of other NGOs and professional associations, as well as the independence of the judiciary."
"Direct and regular contact is maintained with the different sectors of Tunisian civil society and the Tunisian authorities to overcome the current difficulties."
"The Commission fully participates in the EU démarches to support human rights in Tunisia, notably the recent EU Declaration and the Troika démarche on the obstruction of the activities of the Tunisian League for the Defence of Human Rights."
"The entry into force of the EU-Tunisia Neighbourhood Action Plan marked an important step forward, since it includes extensive commitments in the fields of human rights, democracy and governance."
"It establishes as priority actions the pursuit and consolidation of reforms guaranteeing democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the independence and efficiency of the judiciary and, most important of all, it provides for the creation of a human rights sub-committee where compliance with these commitments will be assessed and monitored."
"The establishment of an institutional dialogue framework of this kind, which is expected to be in place by the end of the year, should enable human rights to be discussed in a more structured manner."
"Concerning the reform of the judiciary, a MEDA project on the modernisation of justice is being finalised with a view to specifically addressing the existing shortcomings and the need for better access to justice."
"A number of human rights-related projects are also being funded in Tunisia under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights."
"Most of these are experiencing serious problems in their implementation, as the Tunisian authorities are deliberately blocking access to EU funding for NGOs, including the Tunisian League for the Defence of Human Rights."
"All efforts by the European Commission to unblock this situation have been unsuccessful so far."
"I should like to reassure you that the European Commission will continue its efforts to ensure that the human rights provisions of the Association Agreement and of the EU-Tunisia Action Plan are duly implemented, as well as to impress upon the Tunisian authorities the need to allow NGO access to EU funding."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5 p.m. this afternoon."
"The next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on Vojvodina."
". Mr President, more than a year ago, on Thursday 16 September 2004 to be precise, this House again debated the alarming situation in Vojvodina and the threats faced by the Hungarian minority in this Serbian province."
"The day before, a Hungarian girl from Subotica/Szabadka made a shocking discovery."
"Ready for school, 13-year old Klementina Sötét opened the front door on that Wednesday morning, 15 September 2004, only to find what she thought was blood on the door."
"Klementina recoiled in horror and ran back inside."
"Upon closer inspection, the word ‘dead’ was written on the door in red, Cyrillic letters, and a 35 cm knife had been stuck in the middle of the door."
"The words ‘Hungarians, you will die’ were written on the freshly painted walls of the house of the Sötét family."
"As far as I know, the Sötét family is currently living in a refugee camp in Hungary, as they could no longer bear the anti-Hungarian atmosphere in Vojvodina."
"We are now a year down the line, but, sadly, not much further down the line metaphorically speaking."
"In its report last month, the Hungarian Human Rights Foundation reported that since an EP fact-finding mission has been based in Vojvodina since the end of January, no fewer than 32 new incidents have taken place, with minorities specifically targeted."
"That is depressing for sure, particularly for the Hungarian minority who live there."
"For this House, though, this is an extra reason to take up their cause openly, and not just in the defensive sense of prevention and penalisation of ethnic expressions of hatred in Vojvodina."
"The European Parliament is just as much in favour of a positive interpretation of the rights of national minorities."
"That is why I stand by the questions I put to the Council and Commission a year ago: What is the situation on language teaching and other cultural facilities (including newspapers, magazines and other media) for the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina?"
"And how much money is the Serbian Government earmarking for public facilities for this specific ethnic group?"
"It has already been announced that this House will be conducting hearings on the political situation in Vojvodina, and I am looking forward to them."
"This is a splendid initiative by our Delegation for South Eastern Europe under the inspiring leadership of Mrs Pack, who chairs it."
"That way, the Serbian authorities will also find out that the European Parliament will not agree to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Brussels and Belgrade until such time as Hungarians and other minorities in Vojvodina can live in a truly democratic, constitutional state."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we are talking about the situation of national minorities in Vojvodina here today, it is because we are concerned that the exemplary multi-ethnic coexistence in this part of Serbia could be lost."
"When we were in Vojvodina at the start of this year we spoke with politicians and other people affected and also put forward proposals for how such regrettable events might be prevented and healed."
"My written enquiries to government offices in Belgrade six months after our visit produced only evasive answers."
"Something needs to be done both in the educational system and about the composition of the police and judiciary, however, if the situation is to improve."
"One factor in the increasing incidence of atrocities may be large-scale immigration of Serbs from Kosovo and Croatian Krajina into parts of Vojvodina formerly dominated by national minorities."
"All politicians in Vojvodina and Belgrade should therefore be anxious to condemn this, to urge their offices to show the utmost vigilance and to use the forthcoming talks with Serbia and Montenegro to ensure European funding is used to help the national minorities in particular to get their rights."
"To this end, the European Parliament has increased resources for Serbia and Montenegro by EUR 8 million."
"I would like to point out, however, Mr President, Commissioner, that the Hungarian Government also has a definite obligation to join with its neighbours, Serbia and Montenegro, in addressing these problems."
"Let me say once again that I want to revive this Vojvodina, which is a model for the coexistence of national minorities; that is in Serbia’s interests and it is in the interests of the European Union."
". – Mr President, Parliament has already passed an urgent resolution."
"As a result of that, there was a slight temporary improvement."
"The Serbian leaders do not deny or play down the incidents anymore, but express their regret and distance themselves from the incidents."
"Meanwhile some of the culprits have been arrested, but have not been sentenced yet."
"Unfortunately however, the events of recent weeks and months are alarming again."
"There are more and more incidents against ethnic minorities and assault attempts against leaders of Hungarian organisations."
"All these indicate that there have been no real changes in Serbia."
"The promises made by the Serbian Government have not been kept."
"It was promised that there would be more Hungarian policemen in Vojvodina."
"This has not happened."
"It was promised that there would be a swift and efficient administration of justice in these cases."
"This has not happened."
"It was also promised that two committees would be set up to investigate these incidents and reduce the tension between ethnic groups."
"This has not happened either."
"The grace period is almost up."
"The Serbian leadership must understand that there will be severe consequences if they are unable to guarantee the safety of their citizens, or to safeguard order and fundamental rights."
"Just like Mrs Doris Pack said, there must be consequences."
"Both in terms of the financial assistance granted to Serbia and in terms of signing the stabilisation agreement."
"With my fellow Member, Csaba Tabajdi, we proposed to increase the support granted to Serbia in the next year."
"Mrs Pack has also referred to this."
"However, this trust on our side is not unlimited and not unconditional."
"If there are no real changes in Vojvodina next year, we will have to propose consequences reflected both in the EU assistance granted and in the stabilisation agreement, as our common objective is to ensure that Vojvodina becomes once again a province of ethnic cooperation and ethnic peace."
". Mr President, on the map of the former Austrian-Hungarian Dual Monarchy from 1856, which is displayed on the second floor of this building, anyone can see how ethnically fragmented Vojvodina then was, divided up between Hungarians, Croats, Germans, Slovaks, Romanians and Serbs."
"When in 1918, Hungary was treated as being on the losing side in the First World War, it had to relinquish not only areas mainly populated by other nations, but also essentially Hungarian areas such as the northern part of Vojvodina."
"Since its transfer to Serbia in 1918, Vojvodina has become more and more Serbian, and other groups have either moved away or have been driven out."
"Since 1989, the autonomy of the large Hungarian minority has also been greatly curtailed."
"After a string of violent conflicts in the states of former Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2001, everyone had hoped for the peaceful co-existence of the survivors."
"Sadly in Vojvodina, where bridges were bombed but no ethnic war was waged, non-Serbs were once again bullied by their neighbours."
"Serb refugees from Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo have now moved into the houses of those who can no longer hold their own in Vojvodina."
"This is not even so much a case of violence being deliberately organised by the state; it is clear that ordinary citizens are engaging in violence and intimidation wherever there is a predominant sense that many of their own people are excluded by state boundaries and that many others who used to be considered as occupiers, have stayed behind in their own country."
"In Serbian public opinion, many consider the Serb residents of the north and east of Bosnia and of the north of Kosovo to have been administratively cut off, and wrongly so, from the motherland."
"By way of compensation, attempts are being made to completely Serbianise the areas that are recognised as Serbian territory."
"Anyone who opposes this notion is regarded as an enemy and associated with former Turkish, German, Hungarian occupations."
"With the proposed resolution, we are confirming the anxiety that was expressed a year ago."
"We should, however, not forget that both Serbs and Hungarians will need to be better protected by clear and widely supported agreements on linguistic rights, autonomy and administrative boundaries."
"That is the only way to prevent future outbursts of ethnic hatred in and around Serbia."
". – Mr President, it is the credibility of the European Parliament that is at stake if it does not call Serbia to account for its promises."
"Of course, we do not intend to isolate Serbia but it has to keep to its undertakings."
"Serbia and Montenegro cannot come closer to Europe without that."
"The fact-finding mission led by Mrs Pack was very positive, but only managed to bring a temporary improvement as the situation has not actually been settled."
"Therefore it is crucial that in the spirit of today’s resolution the European Parliament – as well as the Commission and the Council – continuously checks and monitors the violation of minority rights, and it is even more important that we do not just accept resolutions but see some actual improvement at last."
"I would like to mention two areas: on the one hand, the restoration of the autonomy of Vojvodina suspended by Milosevic is pivotal, and on the other hand, the equal opportunities of minorities in the economy is also essential."
"At this point, I would like to assure Mrs Pack about the intention of the Hungarian Government to make every effort to protect the rights of Hungarian people in Vojvodina."
"In case she does not have appropriate information on this issue, I will provide all the necessary references."
". – Mr President, after some debate, our Parliament unanimously agreed that we have to speak out for Vojvodina."
"This is not about disputes between two distant nations or ethnic groups but about an extremely serious series of attacks against native national communities, especially against Hungarian people."
"Additionally, these communities are integral parts of European Union nations, such as the Hungarian or Slovak nation, or of nations awaiting EU accession, such as the Romanian or Croatian people."
"The European agreements also recognise the importance of protecting these ethnic groups, which means that the principle of European solidarity expressly applies to them."
"It is an offence against the EU itself if in some countries people cannot use one of its official languages on the streets or with their visitors or parents in prisons without being physically insulted."
"On the other hand, these communities intend to attain their goals with peaceful political means."
"However, past experience has shown that in the Balkans this method is not as effective and impressive as the use of weapons."
"If the European Union wants to avoid the failures resulting from its behaviour in the early 90s, it cannot encourage the punishment of the unprotected."
"As mentioned in the resolution, Vojvodina has lost its autonomy, and failed to regain it during the five years following the fall of Milosevic, although the autonomy had operated successfully before 1989."
"This means that a considerable part of the preconditions for a normal rule of law is missing."
"Therefore there is a great discrepancy between the reports of official bodies about the continuously aggravating situation and incidents and the reports made to civil organisations by the people affected."
"As far as human rights are concerned, we have learned that the manner in which the people suffering the attacks judge their situation and react to insults is more important than the manner in which these incidents are reported by the official bodies which have completely lost the trust of the minorities."
"According to the resolution and taking into account the political responsibility of the European Union that I had pointed out in February this year, not only the European Parliament but also the Commission and the Council must react and make clear to the Serbian leadership that this situation cannot continue."
"With regard to this, I had suggested that the High Commissioner for Foreign Policy should look into the incidents taking place in Vojvodina as well as the causes of those incidents; also, the English Presidency should see the reality at last, and the Commission should call the Serbians to account for the lack of preconditions for a rule of law – and not only on paper but also in reality."
"The responsibility of EU bodies is also considerable because we have been made to believe that we are going in the right direction just because certain favours have been granted in exceptional and individual cases, which in themselves are not a bad thing."
"No, I believe that instead – after analysing the motivations of each of these serious incidents – we should force Serbia to provide a future for minorities living within the Serbian community."
"Despite the one-sided and good-intentioned messages, it would be an invitation for further crimes if we increased the amount of support provided from the EU budget, opened our agricultural markets and started accession talks against our principles."
"We should not allow ourselves to be blinded by institutions existing only on paper and polished reports – instead, we should wipe the blood of our very nations from our faces and prohibit further bloodshed."
"Reconciliation after aggression has always resulted in tragedy, especially in the Balkans."
". Mr President, last January we heard many promises from the leaders of Serbia on the situation of the minorities in Vojvodina."
"Those promises included a teacher training academy in Subotica, more ethnic Hungarians in the Serbian police force and tolerance programmes for young Serbians to learn to respect the history and culture of the Hungarians and other minorities living in Vojvodina."
"Few – frankly, hardly any – of these promises have been fulfilled."
"Our Parliament should send a clear message to the government in Belgrade."
"Ethnic peace and minority rights are crucial criteria for the further integration of Serbia into Europe."
"We understand the difficulties of the democratic Serbian Government."
"We do not want to weaken the democratic parties there, but they should act: not sometime in the future, but right now."
"The Serbian Government should be encouraged to combat the nationalist forces in Vojvodina and all over Serbia, but they should also respect the rights of the minority in Vojvodina and all over Serbia and Montenegro."
". Mr President, I would like to express my total respect for the people of Serbia, for Serbia itself and for its aspirations to reintegrate itself into the international community, and also for the Serbians’ call to be respected wherever they are minorities."
"That is precisely what gives us the legitimacy to demand that they treat the minorities in their territory with full dignity."
"Serbia’s call for respect for the Serbian minority in Kosovo for example — in which it has our every support, and there will be other opportunities to talk about that — will remain entirely illegitimate unless it ceases allowing and tolerating, either passively, or in some cases with direct involvement, abuses, aggression and harassment against the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina."
"I believe that it is very important that we approve this resolution in order to send a clear double message: on the one hand, to the government of Serbia so that it knows we are here and we are watching and, on the other, to the European Commission and this Parliament so that this issue can be treated as a priority and is not just studied by a handful of experts and so that we are aware that there are daily violations of human rights very close to our borders."
"– Serbia and Montenegro is today one of the European countries where more than 20 nationalities live side by side."
"It is a fact that the cowardly bombardments by NATO forces have resulted in unemployment levels of over 40%, and that ethnic cleansing in the neighbouring countries has driven out 700 000 refugees."
"It is to be welcomed that our resolution states our interest in preserving peaceful coexistence among nationalities."
"A positive contribution to this is the economic aid with which the EU intends to support the economic development of this severely tested country."
"Otherwise this resolution too would simply be further evidence of our hypocrisy and the mockery we are making of the people of Serbia and Montenegro."
"I believe that the main investments being prepared are earmarked for the motorway across Vojvodina, for the rebuilding of the bridges over the rivers Sava and Danube, and for improvements to the main railways in the country."
"Please do not tell me, however, that after the cowardly support for the bombing of the country, you are not trying to tell the Serbs and the other nations; ‘we’re sorry, come and start accession negotiations."
"We know that you are a key country in the Balkans and we would like, while we still can, to right the mistakes of the past.’"
"Do not try to tell me that this resolution is about anything else."
"Otherwise no one present here would be able to support it."
"That is, of course, if you have the slightest shred of honour and know that our voters take a negative view of the NATO operation."
"Or could we be deceiving ourselves?"
"Mr President, when discussing this situation it is advisable to consider the whole picture and not just part of it, however important that part might be."
"The clear violations of the rights of the Hungarian minority are largely due to the activities of the influx of Serbs displaced from other parts of the former Yugoslavia."
"Oppression breeds oppression."
"The Hungarian people are an ethnic minority with a fine history and splendid traditions."
"Sadly, they have become the main scapegoat, although there are others."
"Our approach to Serbia must change if justified appeals like the one we are making today are to have any impact, and not be merely a sop to our consciences."
"At the risk of making myself unpopular I will now say that Belgrade should be presented with a clear and detailed programme aimed at gradual integration."
"I mean gradual integration, not in the immediate future but not in the far distance either."
"Such a programme should be tabled and the access of Serbia and Montenegro or the access of Serbia alone to subsequent stages of integration should then be made conditional on full respect for human rights, including the rights of minorities."
"This is the only strategic solution."
"Mr President, Mr Kohlíček has just claimed that we are not giving any money to Serbia."
"A tremendous amount of money is going to Serbia."
"The minorities who are oppressed there include not only Hungarians and Croats, but also, sadly, Czechs, Germans, Slovaks, Poles and many other nationalities besides, who for centuries formed that prosperous miniature Europe that Mr Meijer described so impressively just now."
"We are therefore all in the same boat, so to speak, and as Europeans it is our duty to help the many minorities in that country."
"At present, this flourishing miniature Europe is being systematically destroyed by a nationalistic policy that begins by undermining autonomy, thereby striking not only at the minorities but also at Vojvodina’s long established Serb community, which has always been in favour of reform."
"Weakening Vojvodina’s reform-minded European Serbs is what these measures are actually intended to do."
"Secondly, there is a deliberate policy of settling immigrants in the minorities’ communities in order to destroy those communities by quickly getting a new Radical Party mayor elected and suddenly outvoting the established population."
"The teacher training colleges – for which we have given money – are not being established, with the flimsy excuse that the region is unable to set up any accounts."
"All these things are unacceptable."
"They are trying to drive the young generation of minorities out of the country, to force the administration into line with central government and to create a nationalistic atmosphere in which the minorities take flight."
"We do not want that, and that is why we must take a clear stand against it."
"– Mr President, as a Member of the European Parliament I strongly believe that resolutions and ideas discussed here cannot be trashed without trace."
"They will have their impact on and consequences for the Council, the Commission and the targeted groups."
"That is why we proposed this successful initiative a year ago here in Parliament, to pass a resolution concerning Vojvodina in order to call the attention of European institutions to the atrocities and intimidation suffered by Hungarian people and to request that the Serbian bodies do not tolerate and therefore do not encourage such acts."
"It is to be regretted that one year on we still have not made any progress."
"The intimidation is continuing, the harassment and severe mistreatment of Hungarian children has become an everyday act."
"There is graffiti abusing native Hungarians."
"This is happening despite all the promises made as a result of official letters, parliamentary visits and ad hoc missions."
"Therefore we have to propose again to return to this issue."
"We have to be consistent, and the Commission and the Council must also be consistent."
"We cannot accept the fact that a neighbour state of the European Union, the Belgrade Government – receiving millions of euro especially for the promotion of tolerance – tolerates this aggression and encourages an atmosphere of fear by never finding the offenders guilty, while being especially austere – I would say cruel – when it comes to punishing Hungarian youngsters."
"I would like to quote a Hungarian mother: ‘Fear is there in the very soul of the children – their youth is poisoned’."
"It is the responsibility of all of us, Parliament, the Council and the Commission to remedy this situation."
"– Mr President, we passed a resolution exactly one year ago in respect of the problem we are discussing now, and the fact-finding mission of the European Parliament to Vojvodina was also implemented as a result of that resolution."
"A report has been prepared but it has never been discussed by either the Subcommittee on Human Rights or the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Meanwhile, the attacks on minorities in Vojvodina have continued."
"Atrocities affect especially the over 250 thousand native Hungarians living in the region."
"The intimidation, the incidents resulting in bloodshed and the staged trials of Hungarian leaders have not been stopped despite the promises of the Serbian Government."
"The tension in Vojvodina is right here, at the border of the European Union."
"Since the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Belgrade is in the preparatory phase, we should pay more attention to this situation."
"We have to request the enforcement of civil, human and minority rights."
"This is our duty."
"The proposal on the floor is categorical and constructive."
"Let us hope that it will indeed contribute to the elimination of the intolerable situation in Vojvodina."
"– Mr President, after one year I have to say it again: the passive government of Serbia and Montenegro remains responsible for inciting the strained relations, for the assaults suffered by Hungarians, the harassment, robbery, violation of cemeteries and the destruction and abuse of historical monuments of the Hungarian community."
"I would like to send a message to the Serbian nation from here in Strasbourg, that it should not allow itself to be a pawn of the hatred against foreigners incited by the post-communist, nationalist elite."
"This does not provide a solution – it only causes further suffering."
"The Serbian nation should face its past, especially the organised genocide that took place in Vojvodina sixty years ago and had more than 40 thousand Hungarian victims."
"The decision is in the hand of the Serbian nation."
"Serbia has to decide whether to become a European democracy that is free from discrimination and fear, or the North Korea of Europe."
". Mr President, the Commission attaches great importance to the preservation of the multi-ethnic character of Vojvodina."
"The Commission has the authority to investigate thoroughly any ethnic incident and effectively promote good inter-ethnic relations."
"We appreciate that the authorities have condemned the ethnic incidents that have occurred and we concede that these incidents do not amount to any form of gross violation, nor are they backed by the Belgrade authorities."
"Nevertheless, we are convinced that the authorities have often been late and negligent in investigating reported incidents."
"The fact that the perpetrators of violent acts and harassment are neither identified nor brought to justice creates a climate of impunity, which unfortunately can foster further incidents and increase the feeling of frustration and insecurity among the minorities."
"In this respect, the law enforcement agencies and the judiciary are often failing in their duties."
"Let me stress that this is a sign of a much wider problem."
"There is an urgent need in Serbia to reform the police, to make it professional and accountable, and to reform the judiciary, which needs to become efficient and truly independent from undue political pressure."
"These reforms are key for the protection of the rights, not just of minorities, but of all citizens."
"In line with the recommendations issued by the European Parliament after the fact-finding mission of last January, we have urged the authorities to take concrete measures in the field of police and judicial reform."
"This includes the need for more adequate representation of the minority communities in these institutions."
"Nobody needs a police or judiciary based on ethnicity, but it is certainly true that a better and more qualified presence of personnel coming from the minority communities could improve their functioning, by facilitating communication with citizens in their mother tongue."
"It would also increase the trust placed by citizens in the State."
"If we look at the incidents that have been reported, very often they involve youngsters."
"This shows that there is an urgent need for the authorities to take measures in the field of education, as recommended by the European Parliament."
"Schools can play a key role in preserving the cultural richness of a region like Vojvodina and in helping young people take full advantage of that richness, rather than withdrawing into nationalist isolation."
"We know that often the youngsters involved in or supporting these incidents are the children of people displaced because of the wars of the last decade."
"The influx of displaced persons has sometimes changed the ethnic composition of the regions."
"There is no simple solution to this issue and we should seek to prevent people who belong to the Serbian community but are often themselves in a very precarious situation, including from a socio-economic point of view, from turning their frustration into violence."
"The authorities still have much to do."
"It is also important for cooperation between Serbia and Montenegro and its neighbouring countries to be intensified in the context of their bilateral agreements."
"This is particularly true of the agreement between Serbia and Montenegro and Hungary."
"We appreciate the initiative of holding a European Parliament hearing on the situation of the minorities in Vojvodina on 13 October."
"This will offer an excellent opportunity to discuss the issue directly with both the authorities and the representatives of the minority communities."
"For its part, the Commission is continuing to monitor respect for the rights of the various ethnic communities in Vojvodina, as well as in the rest of Serbia and Montenegro."
"In the feasibility report issued last April the Commission concluded that Serbia and Montenegro were adequately meeting the criteria – including the political ones – for the opening of stabilisation and association agreement negotiations."
"At the same time, the Commission drew the authorities' attention to a number of issues, including respect for human and minority rights."
"Respect for these rights is indeed an integral part of the political criteria for the stabilisation and association process and it is an essential element of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"The way a country treats ethnic minorities and the quality of the relationship among them are important indicators of democratic maturity."
"A country aspiring to come closer to the European Union needs to show such maturity."
"During the stabilisation and association negotiations process, the Commission will continue to monitor respect for human and minority rights, as well as the other requirements related to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"In this regard, let me stress that we would be failing in our duty if we looked at the situation of only one minority in one region of Serbia, however important it may be."
"We need to pay due attention to all minorities and in particular the most vulnerable ones, such as the Roma."
"The progress report on Serbia and Montenegro due to be published next month by the Commission will also review respect for human and minority rights."
"At the same time, the Commission will continue to support Vojvodina with financial assistance, although there is no specific programme targeting the province as such."
"Vojvodina has benefited as much as the rest of Serbia from EU assistance."
"Let me mention just a few examples."
"A contribution of EUR 40 million was made to the reconstruction of the Sloboda Bridge, which will be opened in October."
"The support given to small and medium-sized enterprises amounts to EUR 8 million worth of credit."
"In addition, the two neighbourhood programmes with Hungary and Romania were launched in January 2005."
"I am confident that strengthening the relations between the EU and Serbia and Montenegro, through the conclusion of the Stability and Association Agreement, will help consolidate democracy and the rule of law, which will also be to the benefit of the ethnic minorities."
"Thank you for your attention."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 5 p.m."
"The next item is the vote on the motions for resolutions on violations of human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"Mr President, the original English text was never translated."
"We sent it to the translators and the translation service, after some problems, indicated to me that the first two lines of recital E in the original English text, which would be the basis of the translation for all the European languages, should be clarified, while keeping to the substance."
"That is why I would like to amend orally the first two lines of recital E. The text should read as follows: 'whereas no real progress has been made in reversing the deterioration in the conditions for national and ethnic minorities in Vojvodina, thereby jeopardising their future in the region, or in facilitating their participation', and then continue according to the original text."
"This was the request of the lawyer-linguists, in order to clarify our intention."
"I think it is a legitimate issue, because we have to have concrete and good texts for the other translations."
"That is why I ask my colleagues and you to vote for this oral amendment."
"Are there any objections to the oral amendment?"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 29 September 2005."
"Ladies and gentlemen, today we are sharing in the pain of the families of the many victims of the natural disasters that took place last week: a terrible earthquake in south Asia and Hurricane Stan in Central America."
"The earthquake, which has struck Pakistan, the north of India and Afghanistan, has led to thousands of deaths, many injured and immense material losses."
"The damage has been greatest in Kashmir in particular."
"A great tragedy has struck Central America."
"Hurricane Stan passed through several countries in the region, caused huge material damage and irreparable human losses."
"The consequences are difficult to overcome, and will continue to be so for a long time to come."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, our President, Josep Borrell, immediately expressed our solidarity and our sympathies to the authorities of the countries affected by these tragedies."
"The European Union has acted quickly, mobilising and offering emergency aid to the affected regions and their inhabitants."
"We shall have to consider how we are going to contribute to the reconstruction effort in the regions that have been struck by these disasters in cooperation with the governments of the countries affected."
"We in the European Parliament wish to express our solidarity, our love and our support to the families and victims in Asia and Central America."
"We stand beside them at this extremely hard and difficult time."
"I would now like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to observe a minute’s silence in memory of these people who have been taken away from us forever by the cruel forces of nature."
"It is also my sad duty to inform you of the death on 8 October of our fellow Member, Jürgen Zimmerling."
"As you know, Mr Zimmerling was a Member of our Parliament during the last term in office and had been sitting once again on behalf of the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats since last July."
"He was a Member of the Committee on Development and of the Delegation for Relations with the Gulf States, including Yemen."
"It is now my painful duty to ask you to observe a minute’s silence in memory of our esteemed colleague, who has passed away serving Europe and the ideals that we all share."
"The final version of the draft agenda for the present part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 26 September pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"Mr President, I have a motion in relation to the agenda."
"On behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I move that the Commission should, in the course of this part-session, make a statement on its position in relation to the European social model, and we move that this statement be delivered jointly by Commissioner McCreevy and Mr Barroso, the Commission’s President."
"By way of justification for this, let me say that, unless we have been misinformed, Commissioner McCreevy, in Sweden, gave the world the benefit of his views on the European Social Model, stating that the Scandinavian model of the European welfare state is not one that the Commission regards as compatible with the European internal market."
"If that is what the Commission thinks, then they can reckon with determined resistance from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"I now gather that they can count on resistance from other groups, the Greens among them, and we are very glad to hear it."
"When it comes to fashioning a social Europe, the Scandinavian model is one of the fundamentals on which we Europeans can rely, and so it is quite utterly unacceptable that the President of the Commission should assert to this House in every one of its sittings that he defends the European Social Model and then goes on to allow his Commissioners to go about saying the very opposite."
"That is not on!"
"Our group therefore asks that the Commission should make this statement."
"The summit at which the European Social Model is to be considered is now only a few days away."
"If it is to turn out to be the social model favoured by Commissioner McCreevy, then I can tell you on behalf of the Socialist Group in this House that the Commission had better prepare for stormy weather, for there will then be a fight about the direction that this European Union of ours is to take, and you can take it from me that it will not be going Mr McCreevy’s way!"
"We demand that the Commission should not delay in clearly stating where it stands on this."
"In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, one Member may now speak against."
"Mr President, I have to say that I am now rather surprised."
"Having considered this matter, our group has come to the conclusion that, if a member of the Commission makes a statement, this House is entitled to hear him, irrespective of the qualitative judgment that might be made about what he said."
"We are insistent that this matter should be clarified, and so our group has decided that Commissioner McCreevy should clarify his position before this House."
"I can tell Mr Schulz that it is for this reason that we are in favour of Commissioner McCreevy appearing, but I also ask that things should not be taken too far right now."
"We do not regard this as an occasion for requiring the President of the Commission to appear before us; instead, we want to hear Commissioner McCreevy first."
"If what he has to say to us proves to be unacceptable, then we can move on to call the President of the Commission before the House, but we support this only on the assumption that it will be Mr McCreevy who will be the first to explain himself to this House."
"I believe that, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, we should hear one opinion in favour of the motion presented by Mr Schulz and one opinion against."
"Nevertheless, since the presidents of the different groups have requested the floor, I shall interpret the rules flexibly, but I would ask you ― Mr Cohn-Bendit, I would like you to listen to this request in particular ― to restrict yourselves to one minute and to speak extremely concisely."
"Mr President, now that we have a Grand Coalition, we want to make a bit of a crack in it."
"We Greens endorse the Social Democrats’ demand that not only Commissioner McCreevy, but also Mr Barroso, should appear before this House."
"This is not a circus, and, if Commissioner McCreevy can make that sort of statement at a time when the European Social Model is in place, then it is incumbent to the President of the Commission to say, on its behalf, what is acceptable and what is not."
"Mr President, if this is a sign of things to come from the influence of the events in Berlin on this House, then they will do us no good whatsoever."
"Commissioner McCreevy is entitled to his opinions."
"What he said in Sweden is perfectly normal."
"My group would not support calling Commissioner McCreevy to this House."
"If we are serious about making the European Union work, then we owe each other solidarity."
"Solidarity involves allowing companies from the new Member States to bid successfully for work in the existing Member States and carry it out."
"That is part of getting our economies working together properly."
"That is the reason why my group will oppose calling Commissioner McCreevy to the House."
"Mr President, if I thoroughly support Mr Schulz’s request that Mr McCreevy and the President of the Commission be simultaneously invited to express their opinions, it is because Mr McCreevy can be relied on not to pull his punches."
"I think he is used to saying bluntly what a number of his colleagues in the Commission dress up."
"For example, Mr McCreevy declared at a conference in London that it must never be forgotten that the single market is far and away the project that goes furthest in terms of deregulating the European Union."
"We therefore want to know whether, when Mr McCreevy expresses his opinion, he in fact says bluntly and without beating about the bush what Mr Barroso does not dare to say in public."
"That is why I suggest that, on these issues, they both express their opinions in this Chamber."
"Mr President, I totally disagree with Mr Schulz with regard to what Commissioner McCreevy did or did not say, because if you read the 16 different press reports on the incident in Sweden, none of it was related to the Swedish social model."
"The only person who mentioned the Swedish social model was the Swedish Minister for Industry."
"There is nothing whatsoever in this storm in a teacup that is trying to be wrapped up by the Social Democrats against Commissioner McCreevy."
"Indeed, if you want to judge him on his record, then look at his record as Minister of Finance in Ireland concerning the social model, where health care was increased, pensions were increased and the highest minimum wage was introduced under his watch."
"In addition, more trade negotiations and more trade union negotiations took place at a national level and, over seven different years, there were four different programmes to guarantee the rights of workers and the right to participation of workers’ representatives."
"This is an opportunist action on behalf of the Socialist Group to try to create a storm before the conference takes place in London."
"We should wait to hear what the discussions will be and ensure that we focus our work on real and important issues for European citizens, not pie-in-the-sky attitudes."
"I oppose the motion."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a formal proposal from Mr Farage."
"Mr President, you seem to have forgotten that there is at least one group in this Parliament that is eurosceptic, that opposed the European Constitution and, for good measure, is rather bigger than the UEN Group."
"Though not known for being shy in my criticism of this Commission, could I with your permission ask Mrs Sinnott to speak on behalf of our group to give our position?"
"Mr President, two proposals have been tabled: one by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to summon the President of the Commission before this House and one by Mr Poettering from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to give Commissioner McCreevy the right to repeat here what he said in Sweden."
"That means, therefore, that two proposals should be put to the vote."
"Commissioner McCreevy should be entitled, if the statements are false, to put these right here in Parliament."
"I appeal to you, Mr President, to have both proposals put to the vote."
"Let us clarify this point so that we can decide on the basis of the true facts."
"Mr Schulz, I understand that you are proposing formally that Commissioner McCreevy and the President of the Commission appear, the two of them."
"Mr Poettering, could you clarify whether the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is requesting that Mr McCreevy appear?"
"Mr President, politics is a trial, and we want to remain credible."
"Our group has just decided that, if the Social Democrats move that Commissioner McCreevy be invited to appear before the House, we will vote in favour of that."
"Now, though, another motion is before the House, to the effect that the invitation be extended to both Commissioner McCreevy and the President of the Commission."
"We will not be voting in favour of that; we will, that is to say, be voting against it."
"Although we did not table the motion that Commissioner McCreevy should appear, we do want to be seen to be credible, and so, if this motion, that the President of the Commission should also come, is voted down, you can have a second vote to decide whether Commissioner McCreevy should come on his own."
"As matters stand, we owe it to our own credibility to take this decision."
"Mr Poettering, are you proposing on behalf of the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that Mr McCreevy appear or are you proposing that we vote if Mr McCreevy appears?"
"Mr President, it is perfectly clear that, if the Socialist Group’s motion for both the President of the Commission and Commissioner McCreevy to be invited were to fail, we would then have to vote on whether to invite Commissioner McCreevy on his own."
"That is how things stand as regards the vote."
"In accordance with the decision of this House, the Presidency will contact the Commission in order to follow up on what this Chamber has decided."
"Mr President, the name of a specific debate has become the subject of a frenetic internal parliamentary discussion."
"This frenetic response is really typical of the way migration, as well as criticism of national governments, is dealt with in the European Union."
"One of the items on today’s agenda is: Current problems regarding immigration."
"That is quite a broad subject that makes no specific reference to a name or country, although we all know exactly what this is about."
"It is about the human tragedies in Ceuta, Melilla and on Lampedusa."
"We should simply call it by its name."
"Initially, most of the groups were in favour of a proposal by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, who had stated that the debate should be entitled , and which had received the backing of most of the groups."
"Meanwhile, the leadership of the Socialist Group has withdrawn support for this and the fog has lifted."
"I want us to take another vote on this title, which should make it much clearer what we are talking about, and I also am relying on the Socialist Group’s honesty with regard to the debate we will be having today."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must now consider some amendments to the agenda for today and tomorrow."
"The first amendment relates to what Mrs Buitenweg has just explained and consists of adding, before the statements by the Council and the Commission on Iran, Council and Commission statements on the current problems in the field of immigration."
"Mrs Buitenweg has just proposed an amendment to the title of this item on the agenda in order to specify certain places where the problem arises."
"Mr President, I wonder whether there might not perhaps have been a misunderstanding."
"While it is the case that there are specific examples of it, it is also clear that migration to Europe, being a general and fundamental problem, cannot be solved at the locations to which Mrs Buitenweg has referred."
"It is for that reason that we opted for this all-embracing title and are inclined to stick with it."
"In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, I can allow one Member to speak in favour."
"Mr President, I totally support Mrs Buitenweg’s request, because this is not just any old debate on immigration."
"We shall have other such debates, moreover."
"The problem is that, this time, men have died."
"On this subject, I am sorry that, at the start of the sitting, we did not pay tribute to these innocent victims."
"Extremely serious acts have been committed on both sides of Europe’s southern border, acts so serious that even colleagues who do not see European immigration policy in the same terms as ourselves could, I think, join us in deploring and condemning them."
"That is why I fully support changing the title and specifying ‘Ceuta, Melilla’."
"Mr President, I should also like to make it clear to Mr Swoboda, who wants to have a general debate, that such a debate will take place during the next part-session in Strasbourg, as immigration/migration is on the agenda with the report by Mrs Klamt."
"I would like to make it clear that the proposal is to add the names of specific places to this item on the agenda."
"(1)"
"The speaker before me has made serious false comments about me. I would ask for your support and would like to invoke this Parliament’s Rules of Procedure so that I can respond."
"Mr Barón Crespo, you too have the floor on a personal matter."
"We are not going to start a debate on the matter; only on something that concerns you that you wish to clarify."
"Mr President, a careful look at the Minutes will reveal that I have not referred personally to Mr Díaz de Mera. In any case, I shall not respond to the inappropriate comments he has made;"
"The debate is closed."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Alexander, Mr Figel’, the decision by the Iranian authorities to suspend negotiations with the three European countries acting as negotiators is worrying."
"I would like, however, to state right away and without ambiguity that we rule out any kind of military solution to this crisis."
"On that point, we call on the United States Administration to become involved in these negotiations, as it did with some success in the case of North Korea."
"We are, actually, concerned by this difference in the attitude of the United States, partly because many of Iran’s concerns about its own security spring directly from the attitude of the US, its policy in the region and the pressure that is being exerted, partly in military terms, in the military bases located in areas bordering Iran."
"Iran, for its part, must suspend any activity designed to obtain nuclear material for military purposes; it must do so because it has signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty, thus also undertaking to apply its Additional Protocol."
"We therefore fully support the resolution by the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which mandated its Director General, Dr El Baradei – who has since been deservedly awarded the Nobel Prize for peace – to continue to pursue the path of negotiation."
"We also welcome the European Council’s resolution of 3 October. Our endorsement is not at all a formality, since we believe that this approach is particularly wise."
"Indeed, as is well known and as the Iranian authorities are well aware and as Mr Alexander also pointed out, this issue falls within the competence of the United Nations Security Council. The decision not to launch a procedure which could lead to an escalation of the situation is thus a choice which makes the path of negotiation even more persuasive, offering Iran a chance which should not be missed."
"In the interests of greater clarity I should state that Iran, like any country in the world, has the right to equip itself with nuclear capacity for non-military purposes, and that is clear both in the resolution from the International Agency for Atomic Energy and in our resolution."
"I would like to conclude with an appeal to the Council on the issue of human rights, an issue that everyone has alluded to."
"In our resolution we referred to the cases mentioned by you, Mr Alexander."
"I would like to encourage the Commission and the Council to continue the policy of dialogue, and never to separate human rights issues from trade agreements with Iran."
"."
"Madam President, Mr Alexander, Commissioner Figeľ, I am obliged to you for what you have said and for giving attention to the issue of human rights, for we all know that peace presupposes human rights and vice versa."
"Our debate today is being held at a time when nobody knows what is going to happen next, so – not least in view of the various resolutions we are to vote on tomorrow – we should argue them through very precisely."
"It is the details that will determine whether we in this House meet our responsibility of finding a de-escalation strategy, which I would describe as being about opening up new negotiating options in furtherance of our policy objective of preventing further proliferation of weapons in the Middle East and Iran’s eventual possession of an atom bomb."
"My group sees de-escalation as being achievable, but not – as we have learned from Iraq – by invoking the Security Council."
"Our fear is that failure to present a united front to the Security Council will result in escalation, and that the IAEA will no longer be able to do its work in Iran without hindrance, something that we know will end up making military escalation more likely."
"I do not doubt that we agree on the objective, and we must seek ways to keep the doors open, for the people of Iran – the people we are in contact with, the journalists who we know, the human rights organisations, not to mention the Nobel prize-winners – have expectations of us; they also expect us to give diplomacy a chance. On that point, I endorse what Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner said."
"We have spoken to them this week; we have to turn our backs on the Security Council and seek political solutions."
"It is not usual for us to talk constantly about human rights, but the human rights dialogue is one of the things that have been put on ice since President Ahmadinejad was elected, and the human rights situation is getting worse. Teheran has sent official representatives to listen to this debate, and I appeal to them to clarify for our information whether or not Akbar Ganji is still alive, to ensure that he is released at once without conditions, along with his lawyer, who was a guest of this House as recently as July and discussed these issues with us."
"That is what our resolution is driving at, and I mean this very seriously. I would be glad of support from the Commission and the Council in achieving this objective."
"Madam President, I would like to emphasise that I am speaking on my own behalf."
"I am not expressing the opinion of my Group."
"In Iran the human rights situation has deteriorated after the new President was ‘elected’."
"In particular, the situation of women and young people has worsened considerably."
"The number of public executions has increased. The regime has been condemned in the UN for violations of human rights more times than any other country in the world: 51 times."
"All hopes of Iran moving towards moderation have now evaporated."
"There are also many reports of the Iranian regime becoming increasingly involved in Iraq in an attempt to set up a sister Islamic state."
"Tehran has also decided not to respect any of its agreements with the EU with regard to nuclear programming, including the Paris agreement."
"One of Iran’s main demands concerns the People’s Mujahedin Resistance Movement. They were put on the terror list about three years ago without any legal basis."
"Many MEPs in the House as well as the majority in the British, Belgium and Italian Parliaments have called for the removal of the Mujahedin from this list. We believe the only way to improve democracy in Iran is to support the main opposition."
"Madam President, we have heard about two key issues regarding Iran: its programme to develop nuclear weapons and its record on human rights."
"However, a third factor is becoming apparent: Iran’s role in training and equipping insurgents in Iraq who are not only killing British and American soldiers, but also working to ensure that Iraq’s painful transformation to a democratic state is unsuccessful."
"If Iraq does not successfully transform into a democratic state, then the whole region will be destabilised."
"Mr Figeľ had nothing much to say except to offer more of the process of proffered dialogue and cooperation."
"As the British Government has discovered over the last few years, this approach has so far not yielded much success."
"The seriousness of the situation and the difficulty in resolving it peacefully cannot be overstated, but it will not be solved by the European Union."
"Once again the EU presumes to take on the attributes of a political state. The serious situation posed by Iran must be addressed by the properly constituted sovereign states working within the properly constituted international institutions."
"If the EU successfully develops its European defence identity – that is, an EU military force – and if Turkey becomes a member of the EU, then a militarised EU will share a border not only with Iran, but also with Iraq and Syria. If the current situation is alarming, then just imagine that one."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on 1 August, in Isfahan, Iran resumed its recycling of nuclear fuel, which constituted an unambiguous breach of the Paris Agreement."
"The IAEA’s Board of Governors stated on 24 September that past experience had led it to have no confidence that Iran’s nuclear programme was for peaceful purposes only."
"What does that mean?"
"It surely means that it is not just our relations with Iran that are at stake, but also the future of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the dangers that result from more and more regimes getting their hands on nuclear weapons."
"Along with the ever-increasing flow of reports of executions of juveniles under the age of 18 and of others being sentenced to death, there is also the fact that Akbar Gandji, having been arrested over five years ago, is still in jail and is in a critical condition."
"One cannot fail to get the impression that Iran is using the European Union as a means of buying time for its programme."
"It would also appear that Iran is working on the assumption that the European Union will, in future, still not have the capacity for joint action – something that was lamentably apparent to us from our experience with Iraq."
"I am convinced that this is not the time for sympathetic resolutions and friendly visits; instead, we must present a united front in order to make it plain to Iran that it is harming itself by persisting on this perilous course."
"Madam President, the situation in Iran is on a knife edge."
"However, let me start by making it clear, including to the last-but-one speaker, that we would not be where we are today without the painstaking work of the ‘EU-3’."
"Members across this House have called for a stronger, more decisive European foreign policy."
"Our negotiations with Iran have represented just such an example of what we can do when we work together."
"That is why it is right that today’s resolution calls for renewed negotiations, seeks to engage third countries internationally in support of our efforts and not as an alternative to them, and should be within the framework of the Paris agreement of last November."
"In that context I am proud that the British Foreign Secretary said on 28 September ‘there is no question of us going to war against Iran, this can only be resolved by diplomatic means and by diplomatic pressure’."
"Today’s resolution is also right in saying that the breaking-off of the EU’s human rights dialogue with Iran should be treated as seriously as the breakdown of talks on Iran’s nuclear programme."
"Indeed, Tehran seeks to justify the arrest of human rights lawyer Abdolfattah Soltani by labelling him as a nuclear spy. Whilst Mr ElBaradei should be warmly congratulated for his Nobel Peace Prize, let us not forget today the former Nobel Prize winner, Iranian human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi, who is currently in receipt of personal threats against her because of her work."
"The political and human rights issues are intertwined and again I welcome the assurances given this afternoon by the President-in-Office in this respect."
"Finally, this morning further evidence came forward of the possible involvement of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in providing armour-piercing infra-red bomb technology to insurgents in Iraq."
"Whilst I cannot attest to these claims with certainty, when eight soldiers from my own country, the UK, have been killed in Iraq in the last five months it is right that Europe does its utmost to dissuade Iran from the proliferation of civil as well as nuclear weapons."
"– Madam President, the question is, what do we want: do we want a new Iraq in Iran?"
"We should not adopt an aggressive resolution which might be used as an alibi by the Americans for a unilateral invasion of Iran. I worry about seeing more innocent victims, as in Madrid and London."
"I do not want to see oil go back up to USD 70 and 100. So we have to proceed down another path: ."
"To reduce its intolerance and to disarm its fanaticism. Fanaticism is worse than a nuclear bomb."
"Deng Xiaoping said, never corner a cat, always leave it a way out."
"We are cornering the cat."
"I do not want the cat at my throat, I do not want the cat at Europe's throat."
"The United States is asking us to put Islam in Europe with Turkey and are asking us to fight Islam in the person of Persia. Let us at long last follow a clearly European policy."
"Madam President, the statements by the Council and the Commission, as well Parliament’s resolution, reflect another failure of the Union’s policies. The joint resolution carefully presents a line of justifications for Iran’s nuclear programme."
"We must state clearly that there is a real danger as the terrorist and terrorist-supporting fundamentalist state is going to obtain nuclear weaponry by ‘confusing and deceiving stupid Europeans’, as it was openly described in July 2005 by the head of Iran’s nuclear programme."
"If the European Parliament marginalises this great danger to international peace and to the future of democracies, this Parliament will marginalise itself."
"Paradoxically, the only effective opposition to the rulers of the terrorist state was put on the terrorist list and persecuted in Europe."
"If the Mujahideen movement were taken off this list, it would be a real and sound European policy."
"Special pro-Iranian and American warning points, as stated in Amendment 12, if adopted, would be politically unwise and counter-productive. Two amendments – the first and fourth – introduce the clause about the Security Council, which is to be supported."
"Possible opposition to it should be explained as a service for Russia, in order to prevent it from an unpleasant veto in the Security Council. I do not understand why the European Union should lose face in order to save Russia’s."
"In the event of such a veto, we would realise how strategically reliable our alleged strategic partner really is. If Amendment 1 is rejected, the whole resolution has no sense but prevailing surrender."
". First, I would like to thank the distinguished MEPs for their well-considered views, the great majority of which express not only support for a common approach to the nuclear question and observation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, but which also touch very seriously upon the issues of human rights and support for dialogue with the emerging civil society in Iran."
"Secondly, I would like to express my appreciation for the extensive draft resolution, which bears witness to the great amount of work done by the political groups, and which, in fact, constitutes an expression of support for the balanced, considered and responsible strategy towards Iran that we are pursuing."
"Thirdly, I would like to express a wish for continuing constructive and effective unity among EU Member States, European institutions and the international community in this agenda, which is sure to bring positive results sooner or later."
"Mr President, avian flu is once again knocking on Europe’s door. The cases of highly suspect mass poultry deaths reported in Romania and Turkey are very worrying."
"The fear of a global avian flu epidemic is real. Extensive plans on how to cope with this threat are being drawn up by all responsible European governments and by the Commission."
"Unfortunately, the Turkish Government does not appear to be taking this problem seriously."
"This has been clearly demonstrated in two instances."
"Firstly, EU officials reported that the results of important tests were delayed and are still awaited because Turkey was late in sending samples to the appropriate laboratory."
"Secondly, in a public statement yesterday, the Turkish Minister of Agriculture declared that ‘there is no reason for concern’."
"Mr President, could you convey to the Turkish Government our deep concern at the complacent and irresponsible way in which the authorities in that candidate member country seem to be dealing with this extremely serious matter?"
"In addition, could you stress to the Commission that we expect drastic action to be taken in order to prevent this disease spreading from Turkey into other neighbouring countries?"
"I should just like to report that national parliaments meeting under COSAC on Monday resolved that the Council should meet in public, so you have support there too, Mr Farage."
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of one of my constituents, John Packwood, a British citizen who has recently been extradited from Spain to Morocco to face charges of drug smuggling in spite of a complete lack of evidence."
"Not only has he suffered a gross miscarriage of justice, but he is also the victim of discrimination on grounds of nationality, contrary to the letter and spirit of EU law."
"Mr Packwood was extradited under a highly discriminatory treaty between Spain and Morocco. It exempts Spanish nationals from extradition, but provides that other EU nationals can be extradited without the Spanish authorities being in any way obliged to investigate the merits of the case."
"This is directly contrary to the EC Treaty ban on discrimination on the grounds of nationality and is fundamentally incompatible with the values of the EU."
"I therefore call on the President of the Parliament and, in particular, Commissioner Frattini to take action to ensure the reality of an EU area of freedom, justice and security is put in place, by remedying both the injustice and the discrimination Mr Packwood is suffering."
"Would the President of the Parliament please write to the Moroccan authorities to raise this?"
"They are claiming the name of Greek Macedonia. So we have to take certain initiatives after the failure of the American negotiator, Mr Nimitz."
"I therefore call on the European Parliament to go and ask those who are enlightened, to ask the professors; I call on you to go to the library and find out what language Aristotle, Protagoras and Democritus wrote in, what language Alexandra the Great spoke and for justice to be done at long last."
"We must not allow this to continue: the hijacking of a name which does not belong to them and of a history which does not belong to them either."
"This nation, this friendly nation, came to the area in the eighth century A.D. How can it claim the history of Macedonia, which dates back to the fifth century B.C.? We are calling for justice at long last."
"Do you understand? The truth is killing us."
"We want an initiative by the European Union. Europe must turn its attention to the issues on its own doorstep."
"Mr President, I should like to raise the issue of a problem that an organisation called Frontline is experiencing. Frontline is an international foundation for the protection of human rights defenders, an organisation that seeks to help those who are working in various parts of the world defending human rights, and who themselves are at risk."
"Frontline has organised a major conference in Dublin this week and eight of the participants in that conference have been denied the right to travel by their states."
"They include a participant from Uzbekistan; a participant from Tunisia; a participant from Palestine who has been denied the right to travel by Israel; participants from Iran and Saudi Arabia; a participant from Western Sahara who has been denied the right to travel by Morocco; a participant from Syria; and a participant from Chechnya who has been denied the right to travel by Russia."
"This is clearly a situation in which people who are defending the universal declaration of human rights are being denied the right they are guaranteed under that declaration to leave and to return to their own country."
"I would ask the Presidency of Parliament to intervene on behalf of these people."
"I will send the details of these cases individually to the Presidency."
"Mr President, VAT reductions on labour-intensive activities were used by countries to make buildings more affordable for people and families. These reductions will end on 31 December if we do nothing."
"This would be counter-productive at this time with an ageing population which will require labour-intensive building adaptations of their homes. Similarly, with the increasing number of persons with disability, adaptations which are labour-intensive will be needed."
"It is also ironic that we are taking away the VAT reductions at the same time as the EU is requiring and encouraging energy efficiency in houses. If we are going to make houses more energy efficient we need to be able to do very labour-intensive building, and renovation, and we are making it more, not less, expensive."
"Are we serious about lowering our domestic energy use? If we are, we need to extend the VAT reductions of labour-intensive activities, particularly in the building industry."
"Mr President, Mrs Sinnott and I have tabled two written declarations that focus Members’ attention on the fact that the lower rates of value added tax will at the end of December 2005 unless the Council of Ministers take the right and proper decision to extend them. We also try to extend the area of choice to make sure that the aged and the disabled will benefit from lower rates of VAT, which will give them cheaper housing accommodation, particularly when they have adaptations carried out."
"At present, the construction industry – I chair the construction forum in the European Parliament – has no idea whether these lower rates of value added tax will continue in a few weeks’ time. It is important that early decisions are made."
"Mr President, as you are well aware, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has approved a statement, on behalf of the 25 Members, in which it expresses its concern about the situation of three political prisoners in Cuba who have been tortured by the Cuban regime: José Daniel Ferrer García, Víctor Rolando Arroyo and Félix Navarro, who were on hunger strike."
"While I know that the President of Parliament, Mr Borrell, will attend the Ibero-American Summit in Salamanca and that the dictator Fidel Castro has not been excluded from appearing in that city in the flesh, I would like to ask Mr Borrell to communicate the European Union and our Parliament’s final position to the Cuban delegates: the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners in Cuba."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a party of mayors was here in Brussels last week, visiting Belgium, and one of them had his rucksack stolen in the Grand’ Place."
"He wanted to report this to the police, but the officers on the Grand’ Place informed him that this would not be possible unless he gave his passport number. This is not the only case of its kind; this sort of thing is going on all the time."
"In my office, there are mounting piles of complaints about parties of visitors being attacked and having things stolen, and I would ask the House and those who run it to consider setting up a helpdesk to follow up these complaints, not least with the Belgian authorities."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to acknowledge the political courage demonstrated by the Commission, in particular Commissioner Louis Michel, in presenting this strategic plan for Africa, which I hope will not be remembered as a catalogue of good intentions — with which the road to hell is paved — but as a Michel Plan, to some extent in the mould of the Marshall Plan."
"That is your challenge. Furthermore, I believe that this is the appropriate time to do it."
"I would like to remind you that the President-in-Office of the Council, Tony Blair, also raised this issue — I regret that he is not here, because I believe that this is a commitment that we must all share — and I would like to stress something that has already been pointed out by the Commissioner: the President of the African Union has also been involved in the presentation of this plan, which demonstrates a desire for parity and partnership."
"Furthermore, I would like to make two specific observations."
"Firstly, with regard to the biblical drama we are witnessing — mass emigration of people fleeing, in the Sahel in particular, from hunger, from locusts, from wars and from drought — the European States have a minimal presence in the States of the south of the Sahel, including in diplomatic terms."
"I therefore believe that we must take urgent action, which the Commission must initiate."
"Secondly, Mr President, with a view to the Hong Kong Round negotiations, we must find a way to make the defence of our interests compatible with opening up to Africa in the agricultural field."
"Mr President, as a member of the delegation of short-term observers, I should like to thank particularly the long-term observers for the work they have done."
"The text as proposed states that the Ethiopians have demonstrated their faith in democracy."
"I think they have done more than that; they have made their dignity a matter of record and proved themselves fit for democracy. It is they above all who deserve our gratitude and the gratitude of the spirit of democracy."
"Once, in Ethiopia, at six o’clock in the morning, I counted a queue of 150 people; around noon, I saw 1 500 of them in various polling stations. Like me, Mrs Gomes saw elderly people queuing up for hours on end without food or water and then casting their votes with broad grins."
"At a time when fewer and fewer of our own electorate were turning out to vote, it was in Ethiopia that I rediscovered democracy’s ‘sex appeal– if I might be permitted to use that frank and sloppy term. I saw how beautiful democracy can be!"
"We also, however, saw how fragile the democratic process can be, with people whispering ‘please don’t go!’ to us as we left the polling stations."
"We saw the sort of reputation the European Union has, and the faith people place in it as an entity that not only parades its ideals before it like a banner, but is also prepared to stand up for them, and, speaking personally, let me say that I have before never been so proud to wear the European Union’s ‘ring of stars’."
"We also had the experience of hearing people who were election observers say that, once the count was over, they were going to disappear for a few days for their own safety."
"When we were in Addis Ababa, we often heard it said that the government might not be willing to relinquish office, but also that the opposition might not be willing and able to assume it."
"In conditions of such insecurity, the European Union was well advised to be guided by caution."
"Subsequent events have shown, though, that the government will probably not be able to remain in office, and that the opposition is better able than we had thought to exercise power."
"The caution evident in these resolutions is something that we should progressively abandon."
"The next item is the report by Mr Bono, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on education as the cornerstone of the Lisbon process (2004/2272 (INI)) (A6-0245/2005)."
". Mr President, Mr Bono’s report is excellent and in my two minutes I should like to make a few brief remarks about it."
"The new Member States are less developed than the older ones in many areas, but not in relation to education. Despite its ideological barriers, the Hungarian educational system became rather successful after the Second World War."
"There was hardly any social discrimination: children from different social backgrounds attended the same schools and extra lessons were either free or particularly inexpensive."
"If we want non-discriminatory access to quality education, we should have more general standards and fewer exceptions in education."
"For example, the teaching of foreign languages as part of the general curriculum should be paid by the budget and not by the parents themselves."
"Non-discriminatory access should mean equal chances provided by the Member States to children from the lower classes as well as ethnic minorities."
"In some Member States, such as Hungary, universities have entrance examinations."
"The general schooling system should provide enough knowledge for those exams, because the special courses are exclusive and expensive for children of the lower classes, for single parents and for children from ethnic minorities."
"The cooperation of the universities, on the one hand, and industry and its research centres on the other hand, should be regular and strong."
"This should also mean not only the development of education but the training of teachers."
"Just today I met a young Turkish expert from Junior Chamber International, hosted by our Socialist Group. She told me about a pilot project run by them and the European Union, which already provided useful information on entrepreneurship for around a thousand Turkish teachers."
"This kind of pilot project should be encouraged by us."
"."
"Mr President, this report is full of good suggestions, and I hope that as many as possible of them will be put into practice."
"There are just two aspects that I want to highlight – one is vocational training and the other is mobility."
"Let me start with vocational training, and a brief account of an experience I had."
"An Italian policy-maker in the educational field was boasting to me about how his region produced more people with advanced school-leaving certificates than any other, so I asked him two questions – firstly, what all these people do with their qualifications, and secondly whether it was difficult to find tradesmen if, for example, you had something wrong with the wiring at home."
"Yes, he told me, both these things were major problems; many of these people were out of work or spending years ‘out of the action’ at university, and practical people, people who were skilled with their hands, were hard to come by in his part of the world."
"That is an example of the wrong-headed education policy that is pursued in many parts of Europe, where vocational training is seriously neglected, with the consequence that there are lots of young people out of work at the same time that there is a serious lack of skilled workers."
"Secondly, there is mobility; it is a matter of complaint that only 1.5% of Europe’s workers are resident in a Member State other than their own. One very useful means of training them and updating their training would be for them to serve as apprentices and journeymen, a practice that goes back to the Middle Ages and should be revived."
"Socrates and Erasmus have injected life into Europe’s schools and universities with splendid success."
"Apprentices and vocational trainees, young professionals and people undergoing practical training still need much more to be done to get them on the move."
"When, though, we see how negligently and half-heartedly the Commission has been preparing itself for 2006, the European Year of Mobility, and knowing as we do how much effort has been required on the part of the Committee on Budgets, and how difficult it has been, over the past few days, to extract even a mere EUR 4 million for this special initiative, it is clear that something is wrong here."
"No real initiative is in sight, unfortunately."
". Mr President, this report calls for greater investment in education in an attempt to achieve the Lisbon objectives."
"It might even reflect a call by my Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who in 1997 launched his general election campaign with the mantra ‘education, education, education’."
"However, decisions on education must be made by the Member States. It is certainly not within the competence of the EU, despite the wish that it should be."
"The lack of realism within this report is emphasised by the appeal for a 15% increase in the number of science graduates in the EU between now and 2010. This is unachievable because young scientists, once graduated, are emigrating in ever-increasing numbers, mainly to the United States."
"Even today the Commission’s own survey says 400 000 European science and technology graduates have emigrated to find jobs. Why is this?"
"The answer is startlingly simple: endless EU regulation and red tape is smothering innovative businesses, leaving them with little choice but to relocate or close down."
"In this context the report serves to highlight the fact that, irrespective of the level of investment made by the Member States in education and training, if businesses and industry have relocated due to suffocating regulation, the investment will not be returned."
"This report ignores the fact that, at the current rate of progress, the Lisbon objectives will not be reached. Attempts to prevent this failure, even by further EU misguidance, are doomed to fail."
"As I have said before, if the EU is the answer, it must have been a stupid question."
"You do not have to be a graduate to understand that."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is unlikely that any Member of this House will oppose the initiative to promote education in Europe as part of the Lisbon Strategy. Society benefits on a great many levels from the promotion of education, and the Lisbon Strategy, the aim of which is to achieve a highly dynamic and competitive economy, highlights the fact that education plays a supporting role as a cornerstone or foundation stone."
"Since we are talking in such terms, I would have expected today’s report at the very least to set out interim goals and a strategic framework of objectives to be achieved en route to these goals, or in other words to provide a more readily comprehensible structure."
"Although I am delighted that the report ‘stresses the crucial role of universities’, it does so in paragraph 21, which is the last but one paragraph and followed only by an instruction to the President to forward the resolution. Yet the recommendation that the ‘importance [of universities] be reinforced by strengthening synergies between European higher education, the European research area, European lifelong learning and the productive sector’ is of such significance that it may be regarded as a strategic priority."
"It is a well-known fact that research turns money into knowledge, and that innovation turns knowledge into money. Increasing university funding in an arbitrary fashion will not produce the desired outcome, however, and the involvement of universities in innovation is one of the crucial structural changes to which the European Union should lend its full support."
"Economic research has shown that cooperation between universities and business, the availability of capital for innovation and development and the promotion of public-private partnerships make a major contribution to a country’s overall innovation potential."
"Such areas therefore provide ample scope for EU funds to be targeted meaningfully and effectively, thus acting as a driving force and catalyst for measures aimed at improving innovation potential. The quality of projects must be the deciding factor when granting access to such funds, rather than compliance with convoluted official requirements."
"Straightforward, flexible and transparent projects, together with the relevant legal requirements, are crucial if the modernisation of universities is to get off to a flying start."
"– Mr President, the purpose of linking education with the Lisbon Strategy is to replace integrated education with fragmented and unscientific knowledge and information based on the needs of the market at the time."
"This, in our opinion, changes the nature of education and turns it into a vulgar commodity."
"The objective of lifelong learning is the satisfaction of the demands of big business, flexible forms of work and the creation of lifelong semi-educated workers, who will be forced to retrain in order to constantly generate more profit."
"The way is being paved for the invasion by companies of education and research, which will lead to the full privatisation of education and to a drastic deterioration in the level of education of workers, in a bid to uncouple education and diplomas from work and strengthen the nanny state and control their consciences."
"Do you want to form cheap, docile workers to generate huge profits?"
"That is your strategy."
"True democratisation in education does not mean access for all young people to retraining and to fragmented knowledge; it means a standard, free, state education up to the age of 18 which will give them an integrated knowledge base."
"Education must educate, not produce cheap, docile workers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, many countries have made, and are making, considerable progress in the establishment of quality assurance systems and in promoting cooperation in the Union, which represents progress in the development of a European Higher Education Area."
"Nevertheless, I would like to insist on the need to take a further step by means of effective cooperation and coordination amongst these bodies, both national and European, since achieving mutual recognition of quality assurance systems and quality assessments is positive for all of the citizens, in that it facilitates the recognition of academic qualifications amongst Member States and the mobility of students and teachers."
"Both issues are key to improving our levels of education and the creation of a common European consciousness."
"In order to make this possible, however, I believe that it is vitally important to promote the necessary mutual trust amongst all the actors involved."
"This also means the involvement of universities, teachers and students."
"Only in this way will we be able to successfully face the challenge of the Europe of excellence on the basis of investment in education, training and research, which is necessary if we are to achieve a fully inclusive knowledge-based society within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy."
". Mr President, in the words of Father Joseph Wresinski: ‘Wherever men are condemned to live in extreme poverty, the rights of Man are violated: it is our sacred duty to unite in order to ensure that these rights are respected’."
"This leitmotif of the World Day to Overcome Extreme Poverty is also enshrined in the very philosophy of the European Parliament."
"Poverty must be eradicated in the new Europe, going beyond strategies enabling it to become the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world. It must be eradicated in order to promote the dignity and responsibility of all of the citizens."
"Is not the well-being of a society also measured in terms of the way it treats its weakest members? It is true that work integrates an individual into a group, but that is not enough to make somebody a citizen, and experience has shown this."
"Yes, the partnership with the least-favoured citizens is needed because they are the experts in combating extreme poverty. Poor people who have not been inducted into citizenship will not be incorporated into the life of society either."
"In order for the poorest people to become active partners, however, they first of all need a voice, they need recognition, security and integration. Combating extreme poverty means respecting the rights of everybody."
"The fact that a person is living in poverty does not mean that others must decide what is best for them on their behalf. For example, why take children away from their families for socio-economic reasons relating to extreme poverty?"
"Would it not be better instead to support their parents, who also have the right to carry out their duties as parents. They feel the same joys, the same aspirations, the same fears and the same doubts, but in much more difficult circumstances."
"And while poverty affects women more, it is they who have the greatest desire to defend their loved ones from poverty and social exclusion. Women, who build fundamental links and create peace, must be encouraged to promote human rights and dignity for everybody."
"With the exception of two or three of them, they have been accepted. The report was then voted for unanimously, and I would like to thank my colleagues for their cooperation."
"There is one point to make, though, since my colleagues from the Communist Group propose, by means of Amendment 7, removing access to primary health care by poor women. It is true that access to public health is an essential element in the quest for a decent common life for everybody."
". – Commissioner, Mr President, the latest data published by the Commission shows that in seventeen of the twenty-five Member States the risk of poverty is higher for women than for men."
"The number is only seventeen because some countries did not submit their data."
"The statistics have long shown that two groups face an exceptional risk: first – single parents, 85% of whom are women, which shows that the risk of poverty is clearly gender-specific; secondly – women in the labour market, who are in a disadvantageous position mainly due to motherhood and differences in remuneration associated with it, which are also reflected in the size of their pensions."
"Two-thirds of people of retirement age are women over 65 and yet, according to the European Economic and Social Committee, their average income is only 53% of the income of men of retirement age."
"Poverty among women is often connected with the poverty of children, and results in the perpetuation of a poorly educated labour force of low employability. One result of this is the creation of an intergenerational poverty trap and an important barrier to the fulfilment of the Lisbon objectives, bearing in mind such figures as the percentage of school dropouts, which is as high as 18% among boys."
"Mr President, poverty clearly has a serious gender dimension. I also want to emphasise this in connection with the fact that some of our colleagues believe that it is possible and necessary to abolish the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality."
". Mr President, as the report states, we in this House generally dedicate much more time and effort to price stability or the budgetary deficit than to poverty, its eradication or the social dimension of the Lisbon Agenda, for example."
"Nevertheless, as has been said, poverty has a female face in Europe as well."
"In the majority of the Member States, social security systems do not take sufficient account of the specific conditions of women."
"For this reason, this Parliament must make a clear appeal to the Member States to establish and guarantee a basic income as a fundamental instrument in the fight against poverty — which, I would insist, affects women mostly — within the context of an overall policy of promoting social and economic integration."
"Furthermore — and we have presented this in an amendment — I would like to insist once again on the need to replace the expression ‘domestic violence’ with ‘gender violence’, since it is a form of violence which should not be characterised by the place in which it takes place, but rather by the way our society distributes roles amongst men and women, which often leads many men to believe that they are superior and that women are their possessions, which regrettably leads to violence."
"In this regard, the amendments that we have presented relate to a structural dialogue which is often established in the European Union."
"Mr President, we in Sweden’s Left Party believe that women should have equal and fair access to all health care and medical treatment."
"We cannot accept that women should only have access to certain forms of health care and medical treatment."
"We believe in equal access to all such care and treatment."
"Poverty obviously affects people’s whole life situation and has bearing upon education, health, housing and social exclusion, but I particularly wish to emphasise the significance of women’s ability to provide for themselves."
"Work is the most important route of escape from poverty, and it is therefore particularly worrying that the 1975 directive on equal pay for male and female employees has still not been implemented."
"Women’s salaries in the EU are on average still only 85% of men’s."
"In certain countries, the difference is even greater."
"Over and above these unjustified salary differences, women are directed to low-paid jobs, part-time work, poorer conditions of employment etc."
"Moreover, this discrimination follows women throughout their lives, right up to retirement age with pensions systems that also discriminate against women. Women are not weak, but they are made weak."
"Mr President, yesterday a motion was put forward to bring Commissioner McCreevy before Parliament."
"The groups were asked to speak on the motion."
"The IND/DEM Group was simply skipped."
"I have observed this before. In this case though, I was designated to speak on this very important issue for the Group and I seek to make that statement now."
"The IND/DEM Group agrees with Mr Schulz that Commissioner McCreevy should be called before this House to account for his statements on the European social model."
"Mr McCreevy has of course always opposed that model."
"He was Minister for Finance as Ireland ascended to wealth, and how did he choose to spend it?"
"On our chaotic health system?"
"On our crumbling school buildings?"
"On a very excluding special needs education system?"
"On our housing crisis?"
"Did he get patients off a two-year waiting list for minor operations?"
"Not our Charlie!"
"He made sure that his friends in the horse racing business did not have to pay tax on six-figure-a-go stud fees."
"I have had seven years to observe Charlie’s distaste for wasting taxpayers’ money on social services."
"The other 719 Members may not yet know how Charlie operates and they deserve a chance to see what they are in for."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0272/2005) by Mr Beaupuy, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the urban dimension in the context of enlargement [2004/2258(INI)]."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I should first like to thank those in the Commission, Parliament and indeed the Council, with which I had some contact, who helped me draw up this own-initiative report. I hope that it will be adopted in due course."
"What has got into Parliament to make it address urban issues, which are certainly not enshrined in our treaties and which do not usually fall within our competence?"
"I feel that, in order to gain a proper understanding of the situation as it stands, it is worth taking a quick look back."
"Over the past half-century, our institutions have focused a great deal on tackling crucial headline issues such as, initially, coal and steel, the common agricultural policy, the Single Act – one of the cornerstones of our European organisation, enabling people, capital, goods and services to move freely throughout our countries – and then, more recently, the single currency."
"While these landmark events were taking place, our European organisation adopted thousands of measures relating to the citizens’ daily lives."
"Yet, despite all of this, we have not seen any coherent development regarding the urban and suburban areas where 3 700 000 people, 80% of the population, live."
"I wish to stress the terms urban and suburban."
"That being said, several important decisions have been taken over the past 15 to 20 years."
"The first of these decisions – and, no doubt, a significant one too – was taken in 1988, when Article 10 of the European Regional Development Fund specified the need for urban pilot projects."
"Two years later, in 1990, two documents were published: a Green Paper on the urban environment and a report on urban areas in crisis."
"In 1993, Jacques Delors organised a European symposium on cities."
"As regards the URBAN programme, which is the subject under discussion, the first programme appeared in 1994, followed by a second in 2000."
"Lastly, the URBACT data exchange programme came into being in 2004."
"In other words, the last 15 years has seen a steady trickle of programmes and measures on urban issues being adopted."
"I should also point out that, at the same time, in recent years, there have been many conferences, colloquiums and other fora on the subject."
"In recent months, though, things have moved ahead altogether more quickly."
"On 30 November 2004 the Dutch Presidency held an informal Council in Rotterdam, which placed the accent on the urban dimension and adopted an outstanding text on the subject."
"I should also point out, in conjunction with my fellow members of the URBAN intergroup, that the URBAN-housing intergroup was set up in 2005."
"A large number of articles on urban policy have appeared in all the documents relating to the regional funds prepared by the Commission before 2004."
"In December, the British Presidency is set to host a meeting on sustainable communities in Bristol."
"We can see, therefore, that urban issues have come a long way."
"What is the question before us today?"
"What we see in our urban and suburban areas is a certain amount of waste."
"One Member of this House, who is here today, pointed out to us the other day, for example, that, in Leipzig, 30% of refurbished housing remains unoccupied."
"Is that not a huge waste?"
"Have we not seen – thanks mainly to our regional funds, but also to national funds and local budgets – the occasional school built here and there without accommodation being refurbished, or vice versa, accommodation refurbished without infrastructure such as public transport being renovated?"
"The time has come to put an end to such waste."
"The time has come for us to adopt a much more coherent policy."
"My report, which has been the subject of lengthy debate, is not intended to set fresh objectives."
"We already have objectives."
"The purpose of this report is to equip us with the resources to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives in our towns and cities."
"What are those resources?"
"I presume you have all read this own-initiative report."
"I should like to highlight some crucial points, such as the fact that our three institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which prepares and implements legislation – need an internal shake-up so as to enhance the effectiveness of their decisions on urban issues."
"We are witnessing a power struggle between the Member States, the regions, the cities and indeed the EU, and these authorities must now work together much more coherently in order greatly to improve their own effectiveness once and for all."
"We need to develop urban policy that is integrated in both spatial and thematic terms."
"I have spoken about this from the perspective of the negative picture I painted earlier. We cannot implement a measure unless it works in tandem with other measures."
"I shall conclude by emphasising good practice."
"I often say that the awareness and application of tried and tested good practice is often far more productive than a small allocation of funds."
"Urban policy does not fall under Parliament’s powers."
"Let us not be under any illusion; Parliament is not about to release further vast sums of money in the framework of the financial perspective to fund new urban perspectives."
"Everything hinges on whether we can improve our organisation and our effectiveness."
"This is the proposal that I put to you in the various provisions contained in my report."
". Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Beaupuy for drawing up an excellent report."
"It suggests a number of very concrete steps which can be taken to reinforce work on urban issues within the context of enlargement in the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"In particular I appreciate your strong support for strengthening the urban dimension in future cohesion policy."
"The motion for a resolution is clear proof of the European Parliament’s strong commitment and dedication to urban policy."
"I also noted with great interest your proposal to amend Annex VI to the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament on the subject of the areas of competence of the Committee on Regional Development to incorporate the urban dimension."
"I am convinced that towns and cities play a central role in achieving greater competitiveness, more growth and more and better jobs in Europe."
"That is why we intend to place urban actions at the core of cohesion policy."
"I share your view that urban planning should incorporate a wide spectrum of policies and develop integrated spatial and thematic urban policy on a human scale to ensure people-friendly cities."
"I agree with you that we must further reinforce urban policy development priorities."
"In fact, I have asked my services to prepare a detailed analysis on the contribution of cities to growth and jobs in the regions."
"A working paper will complement the Community strategic guidelines."
"It will also provide more specific guidance on how cities and regions can cooperate when preparing and implementing cohesion policy programmes."
"This document will also bring out more clearly those city-focused priorities which the Commission considers to be indispensable or highly promising in order to implement cohesion programmes successfully."
"As you know, a number of thematic priorities – such as the knowledge economy, social cohesion and urban environment – are set out in the draft Community strategic guidelines."
"Cities can make an important contribution to these."
"It is my aim to discuss this document with Member States’ regions and cities."
"The debate will be opened at the UK informal Council on Sustainable Communities on 6 December in Bristol, where we will present our paper."
"Afterwards we will start a wide consultation, the results of which will be used to draw up the final version of the Community strategic guidelines."
"I look forward to an extensive exchange of views on this working paper on cities with the honourable Members of Parliament."
"This paper will also respond to your request to develop and propose models and tools for sustainable urban development."
"It will provide recommendations based on current good practice in promoting sustainable local communities through an integrated approach."
"Many lessons will be drawn from cities participating in our URBACT networks."
"In addition, the thematic strategy for sustainable urban development, being prepared under the framework of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, will be a further step in enhancing dialogue between the Commission and national and local authorities."
"This thematic strategy on urban environment is currently scheduled for adoption by the Commission on 21 December 2005."
"Your motion for a resolution also calls on the Commission to move towards a horizontal application of the urban dimension and towards coordination between the departments of the Commission that are directly or indirectly concerned with urban issues."
"I can assure you that the services are already working in close collaboration on the urban content of the Community strategy guidelines."
"In the light of the results of this work, and after the adoption of the legislative framework for cohesion policy 2007-2013, we will assess the working practices with a view to ensuring efficient cross-service coordination on urban issues."
"My intention at this stage will be to establish an interdepartmental task force along the same lines as your Urban Housing Intergroup to ensure a horizontal approach to policy measures which affect cities."
"Finally, you asked the Commission to ensure that intervention in towns and cities and urban agglomerations is strengthened."
"As you know, our proposal for the future cohesion policy programmes foresees that each Member State will present a list of urban areas that will benefit from specific assistance within the regional programmes."
"It also makes provision for sub-delegating the implementation of programme management to the cities themselves."
"However, unfortunately, as we all know, the Council has rendered these provisions optional, like a number of other measures in favour of cities, such as the consultation of urban authorities in the framework of partnership."
"I count very much on your support to convince the Member States to reinstate our initial ideas in the negotiations."
"The lack of strong commitment from the Member States would undermine our efforts towards strengthening the urban dimension in our policy and it would call into question some of our concrete initiatives, like the Urban Audit programme."
"I also wish to tell you that there has been some progress on urban-related issues in the negotiations as well."
"The UK Presidency has proposed to turn urban sustainable development into a fully-fledged priority, in addition to those priorities proposed under the convergence and regional competitiveness objectives."
"Let me assure you that I have no doubts that we need both cities and regions if we want to achieve greater competitiveness, more growth and better jobs."
"I am also confident that the cities will receive the place in our policy which they deserve."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Beaupuy, for addressing such an important issue to the development objectives of the European Union and the daily lives of its citizens, given that the majority of citizens live in urban and suburban areas."
"More importantly, if we are to achieve social and regional cohesion within the Union of 25 Member States and in the run-up to further enlargement, we need to study the various factors which affect life in towns and cities and propose coordinated and effective intervention through all our policies."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur for his thoughts and proposals on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality for incorporating our ideas."
"As you know, we maintain that the strategy for towns and cities must include a wide spectrum of policies and opportunities as regards transport, the environment, planning, economic activity, migration policy, public health, social integration and safety standards."
"Within this network of policies, the gender dimension must be taken into serious account."
"This means that women must participate in planning the humane towns that we all want to achieve; in other words, towns and cities that address the common problems of our fellow citizens, but that also address those that arise from the particular circumstances of the two sexes."
"Women, as we make clear in our opinion, face particular situations and various needs, in transport for example, in their everyday life."
"I therefore believe, Commissioner, that in consultation with local communities, to which you just referred, you will take account of the balanced participation of men and women in consultation fora."
"The same gender mainstreaming, in other words the participation of women, must also be a criterion for evaluating our policies."
"To close, I wish to point out that, in the new financial perspectives, where we shall no longer have the Community initiatives as we have known them, we must not forget to also integrate this gender dimension, in keeping with the experience we already have and the new positions and proposals presented today in our rapporteur's proposal."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the rapporteur has already – and rightly – said, even though there is no provision in the Treaties for the EU to have any direct power over or responsibility for the conduct of an urban policy, the European Parliament has always argued the case for one at European level."
"I would just like to remind the House that it was this Parliament that campaigned for URBAN as a Community initiative and, in due course, made a successful job of implementing it."
"For the sake of simplification, the existing URBAN dimension is now to be integrated into the mainstream programmes for the coming planning period for 2007 to 2013."
"That can definitely be advantageous provided that the URBAN dimension’s successful continuity is ensured."
"There is no doubt that urban areas are – as the rapporteur has highlighted – economic motors and key elements in regional development created within the EU."
"The fact that over 80% of economic activity goes on in towns and cities is as indispensable justification for the principle of partnership as one of the key elements in cohesion policy."
"Urban and rural policy are dependent on each other; it is for that reason that they may not, in any one territory, be considered in isolation, even though there are extreme differences between rural and urban zones in the ten new Member States."
"What is remarkable about the cities of the central and eastern European states is the decline in their population, the phenomenon of emigration brought about by the decline of industry, and this is a process that the Eastern European states will have to master in exactly the same way as did the towns and cities of the former East Germany: as a consequence of the socialist era."
"This is where the Urban Dimension’s city policy, among others, could – indeed, must – have an effect."
"That is why the rapporteur’s balanced report deserves to be endorsed and its conclusions need to be followed up."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, urban policy and urban areas are becoming more and more important."
"The report was explicitly drafted as a response to enlargement, which had made these problems even more acute."
"Let me just remind you that there are in the Central and Eastern European states vast districts full of buildings made of large panels, and with all the problems, both in building and social terms, that are associated with them."
"Apart from the Structural Funds, though, there are scarcely any instruments capable of being used to address the problems of urban areas, so, while there are indeed means available to the new Member States whereby they may, with the help of the European Union, monitor and support their urban policies, I would stress that urban development is problematic not only in the new Member States, but also, of course, in the old ones."
"I see this as a topic that we will have to revisit in the future if we are, given the need for them, to develop instruments with which the European Union can address certain problems."
"We may not – as Mr Beaupuy rightly said – have any powers or responsibilities where urban policy is concerned, but to act as if urban problems were not problems for Europe as a whole would be to ignore the facts of the situation, and so I agree with the rapporteur’s idea that urban policy should be given a broader, horizontal approach, with the Commission being called on to take appropriate action."
"I do think, though, that it makes a great deal of sense to proceed with great moderation when it comes to changing this House’s Rules of Procedure, and it is for that reason that my Group has tabled an amendment on the subject."
"Far from opposing urban policy, we are in fact very strongly in favour of it, but we are opposed to altering the Rules of Procedure."
"The idea of amending the Rules of Procedure resurfaces from time to time, but I do believe that this would be the wrong way of going about decisions on urban policy."
"Perhaps I might be permitted to touch on another point that may well not have any direct relevance to Mr Beaupuy’s report."
"Commissioner Hübner explained what the Council is working on at the moment."
"I can do no other than urge the Council and the Commission to come to a decision as quickly as possible on the Financial Perspective and thereby give us a framework, which should as soon as possible have the relevant projects attached to it, for if they do not, we will be unable to implement the Cohesion Policy for the period from January 2007 onwards and will be unable to deal with the problems in the new Member States’ urban areas."
"We need a decision from the Council as soon as possible, and that decision should coincide as far as possible with those taken by Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, right from the very start of this parliamentary term some of us have been paying particular attention to the subject of the urban dimension, and none more so than Mr Beaupuy."
"He was already doing so before the creation of the European Parliament’s Urban Housing Intergroup, of which he himself is Chairman and I a member, and which is working very well."
"I thank the Commissioner for supporting in so timely a fashion the approach we take to our work, and for encouraging it."
"She demonstrated her support yet again just now in her speech to this House."
"Parliament, it is clear, is today requested to make an additional commitment – which I think I can guarantee, and I speak for Mr Beaupuy too – to involve itself more fully, with a view to preventing any disastrous backtracking by the Council."
"Backtracking would only reduce the role of cities, a role which, in my opinion, is not only an essential part of cohesion policy, but also represents one of its central pillars."
"Cities are, in fact, the key players in regional policy. As well as being centres for the most complex issues, such as social exclusion and pollution, they are centres in which the futures of their entire surrounding areas are moulded, a fact I have also tried to assert in my role as shadow rapporteur on the European Regional Development Fund regulation."
"The driving force of a programme which sensibly invests and manages funds earmarked for cities can, and must, give a similar economic and socio-cultural boost to suburbs and surrounding rural areas, especially in the light of the recent enlargement of the European Union."
"That is why I believe that today we need to engage even more with this subject, based on the experience that this Parliament has already acquired."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our group gives this own-initiative report a warm welcome and is grateful for the good cooperation."
"Much of what has been taken up into this report reflects the work of the urban planning Intergroup, of which the rapporteur is the chairman."
"Not only towns and regions, but also civil society, face both a major challenge and an excellent opportunity to communicate European policy and its objectives."
"In Leipzig, from which I come, programmes such as ‘Urban II’ have produced outstanding results, not least by getting the public involved."
"Direct participation makes possible a European perspective at the local level."
"If we squander this potential, we cannot be surprised when many people in Europe see the decisions taken in Brussels or Strasbourg more as interference in their internal affairs than as forward-looking action."
"What is needed today is an all-embracing approach to urban planning, involving jobs no less than issues around suitability for children and senior citizens, the supply of affordable housing or the development of transport connections."
"The urban dimension must, though, also become a horizontal task for the Commission’s Directorates-General, enabling it to be reflected in all policy areas."
"Whether with regard to the structural funds or to the Lisbon/Gothenburg Strategy, European policy cannot really be successful unless the cities and regions are involved."
"My ears pricked up at a recent survey according to which 75% of the cities and municipalities have no concept of what the Lisbon Strategy is."
"Particularly after what the Commissioner reported today, that should provide food for thought for our Member States, who may be willing to implement the partnership principle on a voluntary basis, but are not prepared to be bound by it."
"They are probably less inclined to share power."
"I therefore look forward with a great deal of eager anticipation to the analysis and the proposals on sustainable urban development that the Commissioner announced this afternoon."
"This is the way to really get European cohesion policy to work, and I look forward to continued good cooperation between the Commission, Parliament and, eventually, the Council too."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our debate today is on an own initiative report which would, however, gain by being a report with legislative force, so important is, I believe, the urban dimension in the context of enlargement to the European Union."
"European towns and cities are still the places of creation and the centre of social and cultural development, as we can see from the attraction they exert over people."
"On the other hand, however, they are the places where numerous and varied problems are concentrated, such as environmental pollution, traffic congestion, housing problems, crime and drug addiction and social exclusion, immigration and poverty."
"Therefore, with reference to the report by Mr Beaupuy, I should like to comment on five points which I consider important."
"As a member of parliament from a country which became a Member State in the last enlargement, I cannot but welcome the effort of the Committee on Regional Development to address this issue."
"The first point I should like to emphasise relates to the observation about the great disparities in terms of urban policy between the 25 Member States, particularly as a result of the enlargement to include 10 new Member States, which often have no clear and comprehensive urban policy at national or regional level."
"Although I agree with this recital, we must not forget that the same drawback also applies in numerous older Member States, where urban policy is an endangered species and towns and cities are being left at the mercy of some higher power."
"The effort, therefore, to address and find a viable solution to the problems which are the scourge of towns and cities must be a joint effort in all 25 Member States of the Union."
"The second point on which I should like to comment and which is of major importance to Member States with a rural economy, is that towns and cities or areas form part of regional territory, and hence sustainable urban development must be pursued in harmony with neighbouring rural zones."
"As you know, in numerous Member States, large rural zones often become isolated when neighbouring towns are deserted."
"We therefore need to step up our efforts to make smaller towns more attractive, so that, for example, villages are not deserted in favour of cities, as this can have negative repercussions on the rural economy of some Member States."
"The fact that over 80% of economic activity is exercised in towns and cities makes local authorities pillars of regional development."
"Therefore, regional development and urban development have now become interconnected concepts."
"Taking as a starting point the principle that urban and rural zones form part of the region and that they are interactive and interdependent zones, our action must centre on upgrading rural areas in order to iron out differences between and balance the two zones."
"Similarly, on another point, the rapporteur calls on the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament to propose an amendment to Annex VΙ of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament on the subject of the areas of competence of the Committee on Regional Development with a view to incorporating the urban dimension specifically, in addition to regional and cohesion policy, in its objectives and competencies, taking account of the work of the other committees concerned (transport, environment, research, employment and social affairs, internal market, culture and so on) in a horizontal approach."
"This message is particularly important not only because it will increase the competencies of the committee in question, but also because it will send a message to the citizens that we are concerned, we are listening, we are paying attention to the problems of their daily life and we are trying to find viable solutions."
"To close, I want to say that, instead of admitting the inadequacy of sustainable policies, what we are doing is to suggest that what is to blame is a lack of support for an outdated practice, which is contrary to the Lisbon policy and is not worthy of our efforts."
"We need to separate one term from the other and work – I repeat jointly – to make the vision of sustainable urban development a reality."
". Mr President, Mr Beaupuy is drawing our attention to the urban areas as driving forces in the development of countries and regions."
"Given the role of cities as development areas for knowledge and economic activity, it strikes me as useful to contemplate the specific impact cities have on attaining the Lisbon objectives."
"I am pleased that the rapporteur has devoted his attention to this issue."
"In addition, the rapporteur is right in pointing out that both the Commission and the Member States can each in their own way contribute to the development of cities: the Commission by monitoring the side effects general economic and regional policy have on cities, and Member States by drawing up development plans for their cities and urban areas."
"Although cross-fertilisation is necessary and possible in certain areas, this evaluation appears to be doing justice only to the fundamental powers of both Member States and the Commission."
"I can therefore warmly support his calls to the Member States for added consideration to urban policy, and warmly congratulate him on this fine report."
". Mr President, it is abundantly obvious that our old town centres are dying."
"As one of the previous speakers rightly said, town centres are becoming places where drug addicts, criminals and migrants congregate."
"The Council of Europe turned its attention to this problem some time ago, but with little success."
"There certainly are economic reasons for the death of these old town centres, but the so-called European social model has aggravated the situation further."
"Rents in town centres are cheap and controlled, and rents for subsidised premises on the outskirts are also low."
"Consequently, people prefer not to live in the centres, because it simply does not pay them to do so."
"If this policy remains unchanged so will the state of affairs, and the situation in town centres will steadily worsen."
"Even now, one only has to look upwards of an evening in cities such as Brussels, Strasbourg, Venice, Rome and Florence to see the dark windows of uninhabited buildings that have usually been well maintained."
"People do not wish to live in them because it does not pay them to do so."
"There are also demographic reasons for this state of affairs."
"The population of Europe is decreasing and this means people do not wish to live in the old town centres where criminals and drug addicts are concentrated."
"If things are not put right and the economic and demographic conditions remain unchanged, nothing will be achieved."
"It is worth keeping in mind that all this is the result of the so-called European social model."
"Nonetheless, it suffices for someone to venture to make the least comment on the subject of this notorious social model in the House for all hell to be let loose against them."
"Members will recall the statements made yesterday by Commissioner McCreevy on the matter."
"The Commissioner had Europe’s own interests at heart when he indicated that Europe had to become competitive and efficient, and that it cannot allow itself to be as social as it is and would like to be."
"At least, that is what I gleaned from how his statements were reported."
"The outcome was that Commissioner McCreevy was summoned to appear before the House."
"This is not the way to build Europe and it is not the way to save our beautiful old historic town centres either."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the urban dimension represents man’s way of life today and in the immediate future."
"Eighty per cent of the world’s population will be concentrated in densely urbanised areas of the planet, bringing us close to the posited by the geographer Constantinos Doxiadis in the early 1970s."
"Another geographer of international repute, Jean Gottmann, described the spread of another pattern of settlement and urban development – the megalopolis – as exemplified today by the urban sprawls on the Atlantic coast of the United States, and in Southern China and Japan."
"The phenomenon of massive urban expansion is also underway on the coast of California, in India – between Delhi and Calcutta – as well as in Europe, along the Rhine axis of the Ruhr, which runs from Germany to the Netherlands, and in Italy’s industrial triangle of Milan-Genoa-Turin."
"I will stop there or the list of examples will grow too long."
"These are huge demographic melting pots of often very different cultures and social groups."
"These highly artificial constructs suffer from constant energy and environmental imbalances, as well as worsening problems of communication, water supply, social tension and crime."
"Unlike closed natural systems, these artificial ecosystems are configured as open systems. They should therefore try to sustain themselves by focusing on certain priorities: reduction of waste production and improved recycling of resources; and planning of efficient horizontal dimensions, which depend not only on what a city produces and how it produces it, but also on how a city interacts with other urban centres and surrounding suburban or rural areas."
"Mr Beaupuy is surely right to highlight in his report the importance of urban partnership networks, at both interregional and cross-border levels."
"The dimensions of the problems encountered are spread over such a broad spatial area that it is only through an integrated approach to investment and administration – we might define it as the great urban basin – that we can hope effectively to tackle them."
"We need to find a way of making sure we do not move from the reality of a ‘megalopolis’ to the reality of a ‘necropolis’."
"– Mr President, 80% of the population of Europe lives in towns and cities."
"Consequently, it would be absurd for the policy of the Structural Funds to ignore the problems of towns and cities, be they unemployment, crime or quality of life."
"This European Parliament has always shown an interest in the problems of towns and cities, both small and large, and in 1999, I would remind you, the Community URBAN initiative was maintained at the insistence of the European Parliament."
"The Beaupuy report underlines this interest and sends the message to the European Commission and the Council that we need to show an increased interest from now on in the problems of towns and cities."
"We know that the Structural Fund regulations integrate the Community URBAN initiative into the basic programmes. This is something the European Parliament welcomes and is supporting in its negotiations with the Council on the new Structural Fund regulations for the period from 2007 to 2013."
"At the same time, we shall try in these negotiations to highlight the urban dimension even more, by emphasising the call for it to include a list of towns and cities which will be covered by the Structural Fund programmes for all the Member States for the period from 2007 to 2013, in order to make action by Member States on towns and cities more specific."
"Similarly, we are waiting for the guidelines from the European Commission in order to ascertain how the interest of the European Union in towns and cities is being specialised, including through the guidelines, and we are here to support specific proposals by the European Commission, while remaining faithful at all times to the line which the European Parliament took a great many years ago."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, I had the pleasure and privilege of working with Mr Beaupuy on the report on the urban dimension in the context of enlargement."
"We agreed fairly early on that the problems affecting towns and cities in the new Member States are no different from those that have affected – and to a large extent continue to affect – urban centres in countries that became Member States much earlier."
"I mention this merely to confirm how similar we in fact are."
"I welcome the fact that Parliament is addressing the issue of towns and cities and large agglomerations and I hope that this initiative will meet with a commensurate response from the Commission in the form of practical measures."
"As I discovered in discussions with representatives from Czech towns and cities – and I have no reason to doubt that the situation is similar in the other new Member States – the most pressing problems include sizeable investment deficit inherited from previous years, property inherited from the army, transport and regenerating industrial waste ground and pre-fabricated housing estates; I could go on in this vein."
"We must not forget that towns and municipalities are important stakeholders in the EU’s cohesion policy."
"Between 2000 and 2006 some EUR 30 billion was earmarked for towns and cities, and I firmly believe that that figure will be exceeded in the forthcoming financial perspective 2007 – 2013."
"Some people complain of the red tape involved in submitting projects and applications for appropriations from the European funds."
"I should like to remind those people that we are talking about the money of European taxpayers, our fellow European citizens, and we must accordingly establish clear rules and exercise a certain degree of caution when dealing with them."
"Mr President, in the budget there is a whole title devoted to agriculture and rural development which indeed gobbles up half the available EU money, but there is no heading for urban support, despite the fact that, as Mr Beaupuy’s report reminds us, four-fifths of Europeans live in towns and cities."
"Some of the worst deprivation, the most severe needs and the biggest environmental challenges are indeed found in our towns and cities."
"However, I say to Mr Libicki that they are also the source of Europe’s greatest dynamism, prosperity and cultural richness."
"We pay the bills."
"I can and do argue to my eight million constituents in London – a figure, incidentally, which makes us a city state larger than 11 Member States but without the equivalent representation – that they should pay for sustainable rural development."
"However, I cannot and will not persuade them that their hard-earned tax money should assist the purchase of another Mercedes for a cereal baron."
"Nor can I honestly explain to them why the interests of the 80% majority are so overlooked in EU policy."
"That is why I so welcome Mr Beaupuy’s report and indeed his leadership of the Urban and Housing Intergroup in this Parliament."
"I also welcome Commissioner Hubner’s promise of a study on the contribution of cities to regional development and the UK Presidency’s apparent intentions to make urban development a specific objective."
"It is a pity the Presidency is not represented here today."
"My own particular concern is with the impact of justice and security policies on urban areas."
"Asylum and immigration, and policies on tackling crime and terrorism, are of crucial concern to cities."
"It is here that most migrants arrive."
"It is among the ethnic minority communities of cities like London, Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam and Brussels that we seek cooperation to counter terrorist threats, but where alienation and poverty are sources of tension which repressive policing will only inflame."
"I would be grateful if the rapporteur is able – as he has kindly indicated that he wishes to do – to make some small oral amendments to mention justice, security and liberty policies in his excellent report."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Beaupuy on his report, and say what an honour it was to be part of his team."
"To date, there has been a conspicuous lack of cohesive European policy on urban-related issues, although over three quarters of the Union’s citizens live in urban areas."
"Today’s debate is therefore indicative of genuine realism."
"I am delighted a document of this nature has been drafted. I am also pleased to note that it contains references to the European Urban Charter and the New Athens Charter."
"Of course, matters relating to cities cannot ever be considered without reference to the surroundings of the cities that constitute urban agglomerations."
"It is also important to keep in mind the existence of extensive rural areas."
"Throughout history, the development of cities has acted as a catalyst to the development of whole regions and conversely, the deterioration of the former has led to the downfall of the latter."
"This is still the case, particularly as regards regional capitals, or in other words local metropolitan centres."
"It therefore makes sense to include the urban environment in the strategic objectives for regional development, and consequently to provide for full participation in the Cohesion Fund and Structural Funds."
"There certainly are some challenging specific issues relating to municipal engineering. They include urban transport, the supply of energy and water, waste water treatment and waste recycling."
"Cities have many other roles to play too, however, and I should like to mention education and the promotion of culture in particular."
"Cities must also deal with a whole range of social issues."
"Nowadays these include serious security matters, unemployment, and the death of city centres mentioned previously by Mr Libicki."
"In conclusion, I should like to recall what Pope John Paul II once said to representatives of Italian cities, as it links in with the human aspect referred to by the Commissioner."
"The Holy Father stated that a city cannot be an end in itself."
"Its end should be the service of human beings, to which cities should adjust their structures and governing principles."
"He went on to say that public authorities should guard against losing sight of this truth, for fear of becoming like a machine that hums uselessly and is likely to cause injury."
"Let us all therefore strive to be useful, be it in the House, in the Commission, in the Council or in any of the cities in Europe."
"Mr President, urban development quite properly does not fall within the direct remit of the European Union, though in nation states it is substantially influenced by regional and other policies from Europe."
"Under Urban II in my constituency in Northern Ireland, we benefited from a very worthwhile programme in North Belfast."
"However, with Urban II coming to an end, a similar need in highly deprived areas in East and South Belfast remains unmet."
"These are some of the areas which featured most prominently in recent street disturbances and which show high levels of deprivation and neglect."
"They need far-reaching and tangible help."
"I note in terms of the future that the legislative proposal for regional policy from 2007 explicitly embraces an urban dimension and, within the competitiveness and employment objective for which my region will qualify, there is a commitment to concentrate on areas which have the most serious problems."
"Thus, in terms of those deprived areas of Belfast that I have mentioned, I certainly will be looking for a meaningful programme of assistance."
"Mr President, new challenges have arisen for the European Union as a result of the economic situation in Europe and also of current and future enlargements."
"During the last 30 years the main focus in terms of the implementation of policy objectives has been on economic and social cohesion."
"The outcome of the actions undertaken indicates the need to include territorial cohesion amongst these objectives."
"In the broader context of the problems arising concerning the relationship between centres and peripheries and between metropolitan areas and small centres of population for example, the issue of urban development is becoming increasingly important."
"Pursuant to the Lisbon Strategy, cities are to become centres for innovative activities intended to promote development."
"They are therefore set to become the potential engines of development in the European Union."
"At the same time, however, it is in those very cities that increasing internal disparities have been noted, together with a worrying increase in social problems and even the social exclusion of certain groups."
"Special attention should therefore be paid to cities."
"Consequently, I earnestly hope that due regard will be paid to urban-related issues in all Community policies, not just in cohesion policy."
"In particular, I believe it is necessary to recognise the need for it to be mandatory to include the urban dimension in the implementation of cohesion policy tasks in the Objective I framework and also in Objective II regions It would also be appropriate to delegate authority for project management to city level when a city’s own regeneration programmes are being implemented."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, taking it as given that the objective of our efforts is the improvement of the quality of life for all our citizens and balanced development of the societies in which we live, how can the urban dimension not be a priority issue on the political agenda?"
"Towns and cities play an important role in the social, economic and cultural life of Europe."
"There is something paradoxical today about European towns and cities and urban areas, in which 78% of the population live."
"On the one hand, they are levers for development in an ever-increasingly competitive global economy, concentrating wealth, knowledge and know-how."
"They are also centres for the provision of public services, such as education, health care and transport."
"On the other hand, most of the most serious problems of our modern society are located in towns and cities: acute problems of poverty and social exclusion, deterioration in the natural and man-made environment, lack of green spaces and atmospheric pollution, loss of local identity and higher crime rates."
"The connection between regional development and urban development is clear and cannot be ignored in the efforts which we are making to achieve economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"Our towns and cities are not isolated."
"All towns and cities, irrespective of size, together with the suburban and rural areas surrounding them, constitute the driving force of each region and can play a central role within the framework of the implementation of the revised Lisbon or Gothenburg objectives."
"That is why the need to manage the urban question at European level is fundamental."
"Policy on towns and cities needs to be at the epicentre of efforts to achieve a strong, competitive and viable Europe, while maintaining social cohesion."
"In the new programming period, the policies which contribute to the development of the territorial systems of Europe will need to demonstrate complementarity, coordination and consistency."
"Similarly, coordination is needed of efforts by all partners at local, regional, national and European level, with the proper utilisation of the potential of towns and cities for sustainable development."
"Both the cross-border and the urban dimension must form part of all the policies of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party."
"I am Mayor of Tolfa – a delightful small town north of Rome – and even in this capacity have been able to see how significantly economic development and social dimensions are affected when citizens gather and integrate into an urban whole."
"Our cities are embracing more and more varied realities – different nationalities, disparate requirements, problems on various levels – and as such act as a microcosm of what is taking place on a macroeconomic level across the territory of the European Union."
"I realise, therefore, how actions aimed at fostering integration and social, economic and environmental development can have a correspondingly positive effect on citizens, which is then translated into added value for the European Union."
"Each modest success, in fact, can only help create citizens who are more mature, more open-minded and more European, and who are equipped to understand the challenges they face, and to continue along the path embarked upon in Lisbon."
"Extending a hand to the cities of the new Member States is therefore a vital means of creating the equality to which the EU aspires for all its Member States."
"In that way, all types of friction and inequality may at last be overcome, for the sake of the unified project of a Europe particularly conscious of the problems faced by minorities and by the most disadvantaged groups in the least developed regions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today’s wide-ranging debate on Mr Beaupuy’s report and, above all, the pertinent and meaningful speech by the Commissioner have outlined in the House today the new European city, taking enlargement into account as well."
"It is nevertheless necessary to emphasise and remind ourselves that a good 78% of the population of Europe lives in cities, 50% of which are in areas of high population density, and 26% in areas of medium density."
"Cities, therefore, constitute the backdrop against which the majority of the inhabitants of the European Union live."
"Lately we have witnessed a certain downplaying of the importance of the urban dimension within cohesion policy, and so this report completely changes that particular approach, which we were not able to support."
"It should not be forgotten that in the heart of the Europe of 15 we also find the so-called Pentagon, that is, a zone linking London, Paris, Milan, Berlin and Hamburg in which a large proportion of the economy and population of Europe is concentrated."
"The Pentagon idea is of course completely opposed to the concept of territorial cohesion, as set out in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which stresses cities – especially small and medium-sized ones – as key players in regional development and in achieving the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives."
"Whilst acknowledging, therefore, the practical difficulties the new countries have faced, and must continue to face, we must remember that even the cities of the old Member States had to be integrated into the system and territory of the Community."
"Consequently, social problems – spatial segregation, crime, lack of housing, unemployment – are the crucial problems we must confront and continue to solve, especially given that the URBAN programme will no longer be continuing as one of the Community initiatives of the European Union."
"Madam President, this Regional Development Committee initiative report drafted by Mr Beaupuy is the opportunity to clearly highlight that urban problems are challenges that need to be dealt with at European level, not only at national or regional levels."
"Following enlargement and bearing in mind the forthcoming accession of Romania and Bulgaria, it is obvious that now, more than ever, a pan-European strategy is needed in order to address the challenges of increased disparities in terms of urban policy between the Members of the Union."
"In my country and in most of the new Member States, there are serious large-scale problems that need to be clearly addressed with comprehensive interventions such as economic and social actions, aimed at the revitalisation of deteriorated inner cities and the renovation of large post-war prefabricated housing estates."
"The causes of these problems do not only relate to the new Member States, even if in these countries the situation is worse than elsewhere in the Union."
"In the new Member States, around 40% of the urban population lives in these deteriorated areas, creating ghettos within our cities."
"Beside the disastrous social and economic consequences of this deterioration, environmental aspects should also be addressed."
"It is obvious that the new Member States and cities are simply unable to deal with these challenges on their own."
"The newly proposed regulation only allows for a very limited scope of intervention for integrated urban actions."
"Thus, the fate of the deteriorating inner city areas and the large housing estates will only get worse."
"Everybody agrees that cities and urban agglomerations or areas have a central role to play in achieving the revitalisation and Göteborg objectives."
"It is also clear that cities and urban agglomerations play a major role in achieving regional development objectives."
"It is therefore of the utmost importance seriously to strengthen the urban dimension within the mainstream structure of EU programmes."
"Strengthening the urban dimension does not mean that we are requesting more money."
"On the contrary, we are calling for more flexibility and for the possibility to spend the available money on the most pressing and important issues."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU has been talking for years about how it can bring itself closer to the citizens."
"There is in fact a very simple solution."
"European policy must address the requirements and the demands of those whom it immediately affects, and first in line are towns and communities, which represent a significant proportion of the EU."
"We need to take on board that in the newly-enlarged Europe there are over 73 000 local authorities, and it is those working in the local authorities who are the first to gauge the reaction of EU citizens and to deal with the immediate consequences of the proposals made by us in the European institutions or in national government."
"When it comes to urban policy, then this is the case twice over."
"The first people to be approached should always be the mayors of towns and communities."
"We presumably agree that holding debates with all local authorities is, from a budgetary point of view, virtually impossible."
"We could easily hold debates, however, with the associations to which they belong."
"In the Czech Republic, for example, the Union of Towns and Municipalities covers almost three quarters of the population of the Czech Republic, and provides a platform for dialogue between the local authorities and the government."
"This follows a recently concluded cooperation agreement, according to which the government is required to submit to the Union all newly proposed policies relating to the communities for comment, and in turn discuss those comments with the communities."
"Dialogue of this nature would be beneficial to the EU."
"The national local authority associations come under the umbrella of European associations."
"Here in Brussels, for example, a few dozen metres from the Parliament building are the headquarters of the Council of European Municipalities and Regions."
"I mention this so that we may take advantage of the potential of such umbrella organisations and cooperate more with them."
"As regards urban policy, we have an early opportunity during the debate on the role of towns in the revamped structural policy for 2007 – 2013."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is symbolic that we are discussing the issue of the urban dimension of the EU during the European Week of Regions and Cities in Brussels."
"I should therefore like to call on the Committee of the Regions and the Commission to support this initiative, which involves the towns and cities themselves."
"For proper dialogue to take place, however, our partners require time and space to be able to make their contribution, and we need time and space to be able to make good use of their contributions, and in turn to improve the quality of the laws and initiatives on which we are working."
"I shall conclude by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Beaupuy, for his work on this initiative, which, to my mind, takes account of the actual needs of Europe’s towns and communities."
"Madam President, it is high time that problems relating to cities and urban policy were given the priority they deserve in the context of the implementation of cohesion policy."
"This is particularly desirable if we remember that approximately 80% of the population of the European Union live in towns or cities, as has been emphasised several times already in this House today."
"Cities are crucial to regional development and also to attaining the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives."
"It is cities and the areas surrounding them that generate growth and innovation plus economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"It is also the case, however, that the most complex problems tend to be concentrated in the cities."
"I have in mind social exclusion, spatial and ethnic segregation, violence, drugs, pollution, unemployment and illegal trading."
"There are marked discrepancies between European Union countries regarding urban policy, particularly after the most recent enlargement and the accession of 10 new Member States."
"These discrepancies are partly due to the different degree of economic development and partly also to the fact that certain new Member States do not have an urban policy in place at national or regional level."
"It is particularly in the new Member States that complex urban problems have been noted, relating amongst other issues to management of the housing stock, inadequate infrastructure, transport, protection of the natural environment and waste disposal."
"In addition, it is mainly in the new Member States that the most notable cases of problems caused by social exclusion or by living in neglected prefabricated slab housing estates can be found."
"That is why effective action to regenerate post-industrial premises is vital for those countries."
"The European Commission should waste no time in taking efficient action aimed at coordinating urban policy."
"In particular, the Commission should prioritise the development of tools for urban development, the exchange of best practice and experience and joint projects that strengthen interregional and transnational cooperation."
"Only then will it become possible for these cities that are new to the Union to become assets to it instead of liabilities, hence the importance of Mr Beaupuy’s report."
"I support it and would like to thank him very much for his work."
"Madam President, I would like to make three points."
"First, I would like to thank the rapporteur for what I think is an excellent report."
"78% of us live in cities."
"The nice thing about cities is that they are a common European phenomenon and even anti-Europeans such as Mr Allister could support Urban II."
"That is already a step in the right direction."
"My second point, given that we have the Commissioner for Regional Affairs here, is to focus not only on urban affairs but other affairs towards the Baltic Sea region as well."
"That is perhaps something that the Commissioner and DG REGIO could look at, in other words, the fact that we have eight countries with a whole bunch of big old Hanseatic cities now surrounding the Baltic Sea area."
"Perhaps they could think of a Baltic Sea strategy along those lines."
"I would also like to stress that cities are the most important growth, innovation, economic, social and regional centres that we have and therefore the focus should be on that."
"I would like to address my final point to my friend Mr Libicki in reference to yesterday’s debate about what Mr McCreevy said or did not say."
"I am Finnish and I come from a ‘welfare’ system."
"Whatever Mr McCreevy said, I think what we did yesterday was in many ways wrong."
"The World Economic Forum ranks Finland as the most competitive economy in the world, Sweden as the third and Denmark as the fourth, but I can guarantee one thing: the last person I want to have preaching to me about competitiveness is a German Socialist in the form of Mr Schulz!"
"Madam President, Mr Beaupuy has managed to draw up an excellent report that contains initiatives that can be implemented straight away with 2007-2013 in mind."
"It was a pleasure to listen to Commissioner Hübner’s speech this morning, in which she made specific commitments to the effect that we can look forward to a new framework as early as at December’s informal Council."
"I unreservedly endorse this report."
"Mr Jacques Delors used to speak about the Europe of the regions."
"If we were to draw up the balance sheet right now, it would be the Europe of the regions and the cities."
"Last year, I helped initiate a study in which we compared eight countries, eight regions and eight urban poles of development."
"This involved cities such as Milan, Dublin, Bristol and Nantes, and showed that it is the best possible cooperation between the region and the city that leads to the best results."
"It is therefore important that this same cohesion, and not competence, should be the basis of any analysis."
"Cohesion between the region and between the cities, good governance and multi-level governance offer the best prospects."
"I have noticed that in Europe, even in my own region, a new synthesis is developing: hierarchy is making way for synergy."
"My region comprises , a large area encompassing five cities that have joined forces."
"Good regional policy also implies good urban policy."
"That being the case, I should like to revisit this notion when the regulations are laid down later on in the year."
"Drawing up urban lists to promote the programmes is a fine thing, provided that it does not lead to fragmentation."
"In summary, given that cities are the pioneers in their regions socially and economically, it is useful if we in the Committee on Regional Development could review the clarification of the Committee’s role in the urban dimension."
"Finally, the Commissioner has indicated that she wants to give this urban dimension even more prominence in the regulations."
"I would like to ask her if she could say anything about this during this sitting."
"Madam President, I am standing in for Mr Casa, who is indisposed, and has asked me to make use of his speaking time."
"In any case, we wish him a speedy recovery, so that he may be back on his feet as soon as possible and able to make use of his right to speak in this House."
"On Mr Casa’s behalf, let me thank Mr Beaupuy for his fine report."
"I think we are all aware that towns and cities have to be the focus of any future regional policy, being, so to speak, the epicentres of the problems with which our regional policies will have to deal."
"We know that 80% of people live in conurbations, that more and more people are moving to towns and cities, and that the problems associated with that are becoming more acute."
"The task of using our regional policy to keep the rural areas around our cities attractive, and to prevent this flow into the cities necessarily devolves upon Europe, so the European Union, in the period of time between 2007 and 2013, must not only come up with rational policies, not only for cities, but also for rural areas, particularly in mountainous and isolated regions, in order to be able to offer the people who live there proper conditions under which to work."
"That should not mean, though, that we should neglect the towns and cities, for many of the problems that arise in them could be resolved with the help and support of the European Union, and so we should use benchmarking as a means of highlighting which solutions make sense for everyone."
"I would also like to congratulate Mr Stubb on what he had to say."
"All of us in Central Europe look northwards, if not exactly with admiration, at any rate with very warm sentiments, and are in fact glad that these states have managed to maintain the European social model."
"I would go along entirely with what he had to say about our Socialist Members."
". Madam President, thank you very much for a very good debate."
"We have listened very carefully."
"Mrs Krehl raised the point of the financial perspective."
"All I can say is that I could not agree more."
"I think Europe is simply unable to absorb a longer period of uncertainty without very strong negative political, economic and social consequences, and that is why the lack of a good decision in December will cause damage that European citizens cannot afford anymore."
"Regarding the debate on the urban dimension, I see that debate as a broad and strong support to this need to strengthen the urban dimension in our cohesion policy."
"Once again I want to say how much I appreciate the efforts of Mr Beaupuy and of the other Members of the Parliament who worked with him."
"I also want to assure you that we look at cities and towns on a Europe-wide basis."
"We look at all the problems and all the contributions of Europe-wide cities and towns and the contribution to the change in Europe."
"We are also aware of how much we can learn from towns and cities in Europe."
"There is an enormous amount of best practice which we have taken from the Urban Programme and I hope we will be able to use it in the future."
"Two or three specific issues were also raised."
"One is the gender issue and the issue of equal status between men and women."
"In this context I would like to say two things."
"One, with regard to regulation, we have the provisions in the general regulation, but – also in response to many of your comments – what we have done over the last weeks when revising the position of the Commission was to propose adding the gender dimension for the first time in the history of cohesion policy to the ERDF regulation."
"It has not yet been approved by the Commission, but I hope it will be a major step forward."
"I also want to say that we will take into account the gender dimension in our consultation on the working paper on urban issues which we are currently working on."
"Housing was mentioned in different contexts."
"As you know, the housing issue is among those few issues which are still outstanding in the negotiations in the Council, in addition to some other very difficult issues on which Parliament has also voted, including cofinancing rates and eligibility of VAT."
"My understanding is that these questions will be solved in the context of the debate on the financial perspective, not in the context of the negotiations on the regulation."
"On the Baltic Sea area, I want to say that within the current Interreg Programme it is one of the best – if not the best – performing programmes."
"I also hope that in the future we will have under the third objective this Baltic zone for transnational dimension."
"It is under major threat because, as you know, the budget proposal under the Luxembourg Presidency for the European territorial corporation objective in particular as regards the transnational dimension has been drastically reduced."
"I now turn to the report."
"In response to Mr van Nistelrooij, with regard to timing, we are working on the document on urban issues."
"We will I think start this or next week interservice consultations in the Commission."
"I hope I will be able to say something when I come in November to the meeting with Mr Beaupuy’s group, but generally all I can say at this stage is that we would like to have the first discussion with the Member States already in December and then, as I have said, continue the consultations until more or less March."
"Then, maybe – but we will have to discuss this – sometime around March we could have a joint conference on those issues."
"However, we have to discuss it and see what we can do together."
"I certainly look forward to further cooperation with your Intergroup on urban and housing issues and I once again thank you very much for the discussion today."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"The Urban dimension in regional policy is of course important, in Scotland we have our major cities Glasgow, Edinburgh and others and all have benefited from EU engagement with regional policy."
"My overriding concern on all regional policy matters is that the overall budget is still to be agreed, and the disastrous policies of the UK government in particular would see regional policy suffer most from their planned cuts."
"The Parliament has spoken with a strong voice in the Boge report, and we must ensure that this remains our view."
"The next item is the report (A6-0265/2005) by Mr Chmielewski, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound and amending Regulation (EC) No 1434/98 (COM(2005)0086 – C6-0094/2005 – 2005/0014(CNS))."
". Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Chmielewski, and the Committee on Fisheries for the report on the Commission’s proposal for technical measures in the Baltic Sea."
"I must express my gratitude for the open attitude taken by the committee and the rapporteur, in particular to the arguments put forward by the Commission, resulting in a report which the Commission can accept almost in its entirety."
"This is a very technical file and, as you are aware, technical conservation measures in the Baltic Sea presently originate in large part from fisheries rules adopted at international level in the International Baltic Sea Fisheries Committee – IBSFC."
"The Community has adopted some additional rules for its own waters, which now cover all of the Baltic Sea except for the two small portions of Russian waters."
"In Community legislation, the measures are spread out in three different Council regulations: the Baltic technical measures regulation, the regulation on industrial fishing for herring – both from 1998 – and the annual TAC and quota regulation, which also contains a number of technical conservation measures."
"Apart from this legal complexity, the present rules are, in some cases, over-complicated and, in others, unclear and remain open to interpretation."
"They are therefore difficult to implement and to control."
"On 14 March 2005, the Commission adopted a proposal for a new regulation on technical conservation measures for the Baltic Sea."
"The proposal was drafted after extensive consultation with the Baltic stakeholders and the Member States during 2004."
"It groups together all the relevant rules into a single legislative act, which will improve legal consistency."
"Furthermore, the proposal seeks to simplify and to streamline the rules as far as possible by, for example, proposing uniform closed seasons for certain species instead of having differing time periods in different parts of the Baltic."
"The consultation held within the Committee on Fisheries was characterised by a spirit of good cooperation, which has led to a strong result."
"The Commission’s proposal is very technical with many details relating to the construction and use of fishing gear in the Baltic."
"I am very pleased that the rapporteur and the Committee on Fisheries have been able to address the very technical elements of the proposal and have come forward with a number of amendments which will improve the proposal."
"Amendments 5 and 6 are a good example of this."
"Strict rules were proposed for all the nets comprising the trawl to guarantee its efficient selectivity."
"These amendments allow the reduction of the application of the strict rules to the rear part of the trawl."
"Thus, the selectivity of the fishing gear is not affected."
"The rules have been simplified and are easier to understand for the fishermen, and control at sea is facilitated."
"I can support all but one of the 15 amendments proposed in the report."
"The only amendment on which I have reservations is Amendment 3."
"If we accept that fisheries inspectors can only take samples of a landing if the sample has been accepted by the ship owner, we may undermine the inspectors’ ability to carry out the necessary controls."
"Furthermore, I must remind you that it is always up to the inspectors to prove that the samples they have taken are representative of the landing."
"Therefore, I am not in a position to support the adoption of Amendment 3."
"I can accept Amendment 9, on the introduction of an assessment of the effects of driftnets and other entangling gears on the sea mammal populations."
"However, let me make it clear that I am not prepared to accept the modification of the phasing-out of driftnets, as already adopted by the Council with Parliament’s support, in 2004."
"Let me finish by once again thanking the rapporteur and the committee for their excellent work."
". Madam President, my report concerns the proposal for a Council regulation on the conservation of fishing resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea dated 14 March 2005."
"This regulation is one of a long list of Union documents aimed on the one hand at codifying existing solutions and on the other at extending their application to include the 10 new Member States, four of which are on the Baltic, as is well known."
"It should be noted at the outset that not everything in the Council’s proposal was to the liking of the aforementioned four countries."
"Many key articles were rejected outright."
"As a rapporteur who is a national of one of those countries I found myself in an inordinately difficult position."
"In fact my country is one of those likely to be affected most by the new directive."
"I had to find a way through this political maze, which was no easy task."
"As usually happens, I was challenged to find an advantageous compromise, which was particularly difficult in this case as it involved technical fishing measures which are not particularly amenable to efforts at mediation."
"Whatever the underlying political intentions, there are other factors that impinge on fishing techniques, notably verification by those involved at a practical level, namely fishermen, and the fish themselves, that are quite oblivious to efforts at political mediation."
"Fortunately it proved possible to reduce the controversial issues to just a couple of crucial ones."
"Thanks are due to the Members involved and to the representatives of the European Commission for the efforts made in this regard."
"Most importantly, they succeeded in finding a compromise concerning the issue of cod fishing gear."
"Cod is the most important fish in the Baltic and the main source of income for those who fish in that sea."
"In addition to the exit window for juveniles recommended in the Council’s proposal and known as the BAKOMA – and I know this is just a detail – the Committee on Fisheries and the European Commission agreed to the use of the cheaper tried and tested T90 codend. This is equivalent as far as quality is concerned."
"It was a Polish and German idea."
"As a result of face to face working meetings with the authors of the proposal, the obvious weaknesses of the latter were remedied by the inclusion of essential definitions of items of fishing gear referred to in several articles."
"The most important of these definitions concerned the extension piece, which is mentioned frequently in the regulation."
"Thanks to the efforts made, many concerns were allayed and the controversial restrictions in a number of provisions were toned down."
"The flexible nature of certain articles also became clearer."
"As a result, the rapporteur was able to withdraw Amendment 16 and scale down five other amendments concerning in particular the restrictive Article 6, to which the Commissioner has already referred."
"This article is a source of worry for the entire fishing sector in the Baltic, calling as it does for a ban on items of fishing gear used on a fairly regular basis."
"There was also the problem of salmon driftnets, which gave rise to the strongest feelings in the European Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries."
"The Polish fishing sector is of the opinion that the rest of Europe believes driftnets represent a serious threat to marine mammals, particularly porpoises, if these nets are used for salmon fishing."
"In the southern Baltic, however, these nets do not represent a threat because porpoises are extremely rare there."
"It is also the case that a decision to ban such nets in this part of the Baltic would prevent some 60 Polish ship owners from fishing for salmon."
"Aware of both aspects of the problem posed by these nets, on the one hand the Union’s requirements concerning protection of resources in the Baltic, and on the other salmon fishermen’s livelihoods and their futures, the rapporteur suggested the only possible compromise solution in this situation."
"This was to take account of the Council’s recommendations whilst at the same time undertaking reliable studies of the Baltic waters."
"The study should establish the true state of affairs and evaluate the actual impact of the use of these nets and other entangling gear on marine mammals."
"Completion is set for 2008."
"Here ends the tale of my report."
"I was challenged to move mountains, and like all parliamentary compromises, it meets the conditions for acceptance by the House even if it does not please everyone all of the time, Polish fishermen in particular."
"Our compromise does meet the aforementioned conditions, and the Committee on Fisheries eventually agreed on it unanimously."
"I have already thanked the Members responsible, the rest of the Committee on Fisheries and the European Commission’s experts."
"I should also like to thank all other experts, researchers and fishing gear manufacturers from the Baltic countries who gave their time voluntarily to help the rapporteur become familiar with this very important aspect of fishing activity which is also challenging as it requires specialist knowledge."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to raise the issue of banning salmon driftnets in the Baltic."
"Firstly, I would like to stress that in contrast to nets used in other areas, these nets do not represent a serious threat to the biodiversity of marine life."
"In addition, there is no scientific evidence that they represent a serious threat to porpoises in the central and northern areas of the Baltic Sea."
"Banning driftnets in the Baltic would effectively mean the end of Polish salmon fishing, as there are no alternative nets that could be used in our waters."
"There was no scientific justification for the decision taken and no account was taken of the position of the countries concerned."
"These countries did not become Members of the Union until 1 May 2004, and the decision was taken a mere four days before enlargement."
"For all these reasons we feel that the compromise solution would be the best way forward."
"It would involve postponing further bans on nets in the Baltic for three years, until appropriate scientific data is available to justify the need for such measures or deem them unnecessary."
". Madam President, we endorse the report’s fundamental objective and welcome the intention that changes be made to definitions and various technical provisions."
"Debates on proposals from the Commission that might lead, in the long or short term, to restrictions being placed on fishing activity, are always heated, and that on this proposal has been no exception."
"It might not be evident from the outcome of the vote in Committee, but there were a number of points on which a compromise could be reached only after in-depth discussions."
"With this in mind, I would like especially to draw attention to Article 12 of the Commission proposal, which deals with restrictions on, and the prohibition of, driftnets."
"Our group has previously endorsed all attempts to provide for a reduction in the use of these devices or a ban on them, and so it necessarily follows that the same strict rules should apply in the Baltic as in other European Union fishing grounds, in which driftnets have for years been banned in order to give small cetaceans a better chance of survival."
"Certain efforts are being made to jeopardise the current ban on driftnets, and these our group repudiates."
"Day-to-day practice shows, however, that a valid legal framework will only be any good in so far as it is capable of being monitored, simply and effectively, on the ground, in other words, in practice."
"This, I think, is where the main difficulties lie, and I hope that this legal framework will result in a more vigorous approach to monitoring in future."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for tabling this proposal."
"I have waited for a long time for driftnets also to be banned in the Baltic Sea, the last sea in the EU where these are still permitted."
"Thank you for sticking to that view, even if there is sometimes criticism of this ban here in the European Parliament."
"I wish to take the opportunity of thanking our rapporteur for his willingness to compromise on this issue too."
"It was also wrong of the Council not to involve the new Member States in this process from the beginning. It might have facilitated the process if they had been involved at the first stage."
"I do not think we can wait until the last porpoise is dead before we finally establish the scientific proofs, for then it will be too late."
"We have seen studies showing the risks involved in driftnets, and I think that the studies no doubt justify applying the precautionary principle in this case."
"The biological diversity of the Baltic Sea is very vulnerable."
"It is an extremely sensitive sea, and we should not risk disturbing the balance there."
"I now await your next initiative."
"A year ago, we discussed the opportunities available to countries that, with a view to improving future generations’ potential catches, wish voluntarily to call a halt to fishing and to introduce compensation for fishermen."
"I await rules from the Commission whereby countries that, with a view to future profits, wish to increase the quantity of fish in their waters, are enabled more easily to call a voluntary halt to fishing."
"I hope that we can discuss this in more detail."
". Madam President, the common fisheries policy is without doubt one of the most disastrous of all EU common policies."
"It has inflicted incredible damage on the ecology of the North Sea and has done absolutely nothing for conservation."
"Not satisfied with this disaster, the EU is actually encouraging its repetition in African coastal waters."
"You can therefore imagine the cynicism with which I read this proposal for special technical measures to improve the conservation situation in the Baltic Sea."
"The rapporteur has produced an extraordinarily unhelpful explanatory statement, which is really little more than a blow-by-painful-blow account of a paper trail."
"At the end there is a complicated appendix which seeks to lay down the law on the specifications for codends and even the exact size and shape of codend buoys."
"Why this House should be preoccupying itself with such minutiae is beyond me, unless it is yet another symptom of the European Union’s limitless propensity for control-freakism."
"Doubtless these technical specifications will have been dreamt up by bureaucrats without the slightest experience of sea fishing and will therefore cause enormous problems for the people who have to have such experience and work on a daily basis."
"I do not believe that the EU has any business in involving itself in conservation in the Baltic, or anywhere else for that matter."
"These issues should be resolved by sensible negotiation between national government and fishermen, not by an unelected bureaucracy with an absolutely appalling track record for environmental vandalism."
"Madam President, concerning the report by Mr Chmielewski on the conservation of fishing resources in the waters of the Baltic Sea, the Belts and Sound through technical measures, I would like to say how much I appreciate the technical standard of the report."
"The rapporteur has worked hard to take account of the interests of the four former Baltic partners and also of the interests of the four new Member States that joined at the latest enlargement of the European Union."
"It should be pointed out that the proposal for a Council regulation that is the subject of Mr Chmielewski’s report codifies provisions drafted prior to 2004, that is to say, prior to the accession of the 10 new Member States to the Union."
"At the time, the possibilities for other interested European countries to be involved in the talks were strictly limited, and Parliament’s new elected representatives were of course unable to participate."
"In view of the specific nature of the natural environment of the Baltic, and of the significant differences between its western and eastern waters, input by the new countries to the report before us needed to be taken into account and I trust this was the case."
"I should like to conclude by congratulating the rapporteur once again."
"Thank you."
". Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Chmielewski once again on his report."
"He made reference to the fact that he had been faced with a very difficult challenge and needed to find a workable compromise."
"The end result is very much a workable compromise, and the Commission is prepared to accept all the amendments except the one I have already mentioned."
"I also agree that the breakthrough came with the acceptance of the T90 codend, which could be used as an alternative to the BACOMA trawl."
"I confirm that ISIS advises that the T90 codend has the same selectivity as the BACOMA exit window and we can therefore accept its use."
"With regard to driftnets, we accept the study which can indicate what remedial measures can be taken which would be of a socio-economic nature. However, the Commission has no intention of considering an extension of the phasing-out of driftnets with regard to the Baltic, simply because of the fact that the driftnets ban has already been in place with the regulation of 1998 and the extension and phasing-out up to 2010 for the Baltic was already a special concession and it does not make sense to grant any further extension or concession, otherwise we risk opening up again the whole argument with regard to driftnets and place in doubt the validity of such driftnets in the other Community waters."
"It is true that the number of porpoises is very low."
"This, however, makes it even more important to continue to uphold the ban to ensure that no irreparable damage occurs with regard to porpoises."
"The low populations of porpoises put even more responsibility on us to ensure their protection."
"In addition, there is a general driftnet ban, which is part of the , as I mentioned before, and we must ensure that this is in no way prejudiced."
"First of all I should like to thank Mr Kindermann and Mr Schlyter for their support."
"With regard to the point made by Mr Schlyter concerning the closed season for cod, it must be said that the closure and the closed areas for cod and the closed season for cod is not a voluntary measure."
"It is a mandatory measure, which was introduced together with the TACs and quotas regulation at the December Council."
"However, at the moment we are preparing a recovery plan for cod in the Baltic Sea and it is obvious that technical measures and measures relating to closed areas and closed seasons will form an integral part of this recovery plan."
"It is also obvious that if fishermen are constrained to tie up as a result of such closed seasons, then, under normal Community rules, they would be entitled to compensation for that tie-up if it is considered to be of an exceptional nature or is a result of the measures of a recovery plan."
"With regard to what Mr Titford said, I can only say that I cannot agree with him."
"That concludes the debate on this report."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"Mr President, last month in Strasbourg I raised a similar point of order under Rule 130, because Council Question Time, which was supposed to last an hour, lasted no more than 35 minutes."
"The Presidency-in-Office of the Council clearly thought it more important to make a telephone call than to answer our questions."
"Like all those MEPs on the list to ask questions I was at least expecting a written answer immediately afterwards."
"It did not happen."
"I was then promised a written answer by last Thursday, but that did not happen either and I still have not received an answer."
"I understand that this is first time under any Presidency that MEPs’ questions have gone unanswered for so long."
"Can I ask our own President please to ensure that at the next Strasbourg session we get not only a proper explanation, but also an apology?"
"Finally, I should like to ask that we also get an acknowledgement from the Council that Question Time is not just a time for MEPs to ask questions: it is also a time for the Presidency-in-Office to provide answers."
"Mr Bushill-Matthews, your concern is quite justified, and the President has already written to the Council to criticise this state of affairs in emphatic and vigorous terms."
"We expect the Council to maintain the arrangements that have been customary for years, indeed for decades."
"It is absolutely unacceptable that these things should be dealt with in the manner that you describe, and we have already taken the matter up."
"– The next item is the vote."
"Mr President, I would like to make it clear that this amendment does not challenge the WTO regulations."
"The amendment proposes to add two words, namely ‘high risk’ chemicals."
"The only purpose is to clarify that it does not challenge the WTO."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the House having voted on China today, I now have the great honour to welcome the members of the delegation of parliamentarians from the People’s Republic of China who are visiting us on the occasion of the 22nd EP/China Inter-Parliamentary Meeting."
"A very warm welcome to the delegation from the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China under the chairmanship of Mr Wang!"
"Honourable members of the Chinese National People’s Congress, you will be aware that dialogue between Europe and China is of crucial importance in terms of continuing globalisation."
"Mr President, could you inform me of by what democratic decision-making process our esteemed Chinese fellow parliamentarians have been elected?"
"I would be obliged to you if you could."
"Thank you."
"I put it to you that you should take part in one of the delegations’ sittings."
"You will yourself be aware that the sending of delegations appointed in accordance with national rules is something that national sovereignty makes possible."
"Mr President, I have an oral amendment to paragraph 14 on death sentences for juvenile offenders."
"In Iran, young people are being sentenced to death and executed merely for having sexual relationships or for being gay."
"In the original wording, where we used the term ‘juvenile offenders’, it seems as if we agree with the Iranian Government that having sexual relationships is a crime."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following on from yesterday’s debate and from the Iranian response to our demand that Akbar Gandji be released at once and that guarantees be given that he is still alive, I wish to move an additional amendment"
"Mr President, the background for this request is as follows: the debate on the serious situation in Ethiopia and the motion for a resolution have been in the making for quite some time."
"Political groups agreed on a text last Friday, but since then a lot of things have happened in Ethiopia that are of great importance and ought to be referred to in the text."
"However, since the deadline had expired, there was no way we could really do that."
"The most serious thing that has happened is that the negotiations between the ruling party and the opposition parties broke down about a week ago, primarily because of the refusal of the ruling party and the Prime Minister to even discuss a number of issues related to the need for democratic reform."
"Furthermore, the Parliament in Addis Abbaba convened, and some of the opposition members were not taking part because of the breakdown in those negotiations."
"I believe I should explain the background to this, otherwise it does not make sense for Members."
"Mr President, we, the Members of this House, have just been very generous."
"The only thing I would ask of those who draft resolutions is that they make a point of writing them down before the deadline for submission rather than after it."
"Our job will thereby be made that much easier."
"Mr Swoboda, I asked that very question when we were preparing for the vote, and was told that we had to make some allowances, as the situation in Ethiopia was changing practically by the hour."
"That concludes the vote."
". The euro is one of the most widely used currencies in international trade and as such is one of the most vulnerable to counterfeiting."
"The Union has been taking the necessary measures to ensure that the circulation of the euro is protected by effective and homogenous mechanisms to combat the crime of counterfeiting."
"Whilst counterfeiting rates remain high, measures taken to combat forgery are bearing fruit. Between 2003 and 2004, for example, there was a 20% rise in operations leading to the seizure of forged euro, whereas the same period saw a 38% drop in the counterfeiting of banknotes, such as EUR 100."
"It is clear, therefore, that there is an ongoing need for vigilance, training and technical assistance, so as to ensure that the euro is protected appropriately, uniformly and effectively against counterfeiting."
"I therefore back the proposal to extend this programme, and all of the excellent amendments tabled by the rapporteur, because we will only be able to achieve the aims of the programme if we have a stable financial framework, particularly during the period in which the new Member States are integrated into the single currency."
". Relations between the EU and Switzerland naturally follow special rules."
"In all likelihood, Switzerland would easily become a Member of the EU, given that it fulfils all of the accession criteria, but the fact is that the Swiss people have not wanted to join."
"It also remains a fact that, in geographical terms, the country is right in the middle of Europe and the EU."
"We therefore have everything to gain from concluding agreements such as those before us with this neighbour."
"Agreements of this nature simplify and aid the flow of relations between the 25 Member States and Switzerland, and improve the lives of citizens on both sides."
"I therefore voted in favour."
". I welcome the rapporteur’s work on this issue."
"I feel it is a balanced report, and has clarified and improved upon some key points that had been poorly explained in the version submitted by the Commission."
"The measures put forward seek to protect the overall interests of the fisheries sector."
"The report was based on the opinions of administrative fisheries bodies in the new Member States, of the processing sectors and of other fishing industry representatives. Consultancy of this nature is a key factor in ensuring that the measures to be implemented are properly assessed."
"The proposals adopted today are intended to adapt the equipment used in other marine environments to the conditions in the Baltic, which has particular characteristics that require specific measures."
"Although my opinion is a favourable one, I shall be keeping a close eye on the issue of the effects of driftnets and other entangling equipment on sea mammals."
"We should proceed in accordance with the findings of studies carried out up to 2008, with one option being to consider withdrawing this method of fishing."
". This issue of fisheries is of vital importance to my country and, even though this particular case does not relate directly to Portugal, I read this report with great interest, because I feel it is essential to protect the species and to look after the interests of this sector, which plays such a crucial role in a number of Member States."
"I welcome the participation of the new Member States from the Baltic in the amendments to this legislation."
"The extra information is crucial."
"Consultation with representatives from the fisheries and processing sectors is similarly crucial, because this will rectify any shortcomings in the provisions relating to the conservation of stocks."
"The Baltic Sea has its own characteristics."
"The purpose of this report was to combine, with due care and attention, the issue of protecting ecosystems and social issues relating to fisheries."
"I should also like to stress the importance of this proposal to the development of fisheries in the Baltic, with particular regard to maintaining fish stocks."
"Final decisions must be taken on the basis of in-depth knowledge of the situation and any problems."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of the Chimielewski report."
". Although Parliament’s report improves upon the text submitted by the Commission, we are opposed to some of the underlying concepts on the development of higher education."
"One such example is the setting up of national and European assessment and accreditation agencies – public and private – whose assessments, and the results thereof, may affect the provision of licences, funding, support for students and the ‘prestige’ of the institutions, although this is not explained clearly."
"The opening up of assessments to the private sector paves the way for the creation of a new trade, in which capital exerts a greater influence on the institutions and their programmes, objectives and social strategy."
"In each country, a network of interests could be set up between the agencies, the Member States, the institutions and the economic powers, with the aim of establishing assessment criteria that favour the best possible assessment of their own institutions and harm those institutions and teaching systems that are not up to the mark."
"In this way, economic criteria would prevail and certain ‘qualities’ would be accorded value, leading to further difficulties for those who already have them – as well as overlooking the national and public dimension of higher education – and exacerbate the trend towards the elitism and merchandising of higher education in Europe."
". The quality of higher education is and will always be one of the EU’s priorities."
"The mutual recognition of quality assurance and assessment systems in Europe must be promoted if this objective is to be achieved."
"Many Member States have already made progress in this regard, but much hard work lies ahead if we are to succeed in developing the European higher education area."
"Universities must improve their quality levels by introducing a system of internal mechanisms and through their relations with external quality assurance systems."
"Implementing these systems represents a major step forward towards the mutual recognition of university qualifications in Europe, something that we very much wish to see."
". – Claims about safeguarding standards and improving education through evaluation are an insult which is being hurled directly against any previous standards of higher education."
"It is a basic tool for the privatisation and commercialisation of education and research and aims to create two-speed institutions, with centres of 'excellent' and second-class institutions."
"The register of public and private evaluation organisations and companies is nothing but a concentrating mechanism of the ΕU, which will determine and control the adaptation of higher education to the interests of the monopolies."
"The outcome will be the further subjugation of education and research to the needs of the market and their conversion to 'products' provided by university 'businesses', in a bid to increase their customer base, especially from an international student elite."
"Evaluation means downgrading rather than improving the quality of universities and makes provision for them not to fulfil their social mission, but to increase the profitability of capital through opportunistic study and research subjects tailored to the market."
"The balanced development of scientific sectors and the response of universities to their social role are a matter for the university community, in cooperation with the grass-roots movement, not the subject of revision and control mechanisms with private-sector economic criteria."
"That is why we are voting against the report."
". The quality of higher education in Europe is a key element in our growth and development strategies on the world stage."
"The mutual recognition of university qualifications in Europe, which we all wish to see, needs the right conditions to be in place if quality is to be guaranteed and if our universities are to improve on a consistent basis."
"Against this backdrop, this is a most interesting proposal, which adopts practical measures to achieve a European higher education system that is more effective, more transparent and more attractive to students and scientists."
"Accordingly, I voted in favour of the Novak report."
". – Today textiles, tomorrow footwear, cars, machine parts, steel; and subsequently electronic goods and high added value products, if indeed that process is not already underway."
"How many more European industrial sectors are you going to sacrifice with your blinkered attitude?"
"How many millions more people will be laid off on account of your fanatical devotion to globalisation?"
"China does not honour its commitments to the World Trade Organisation."
"You are aware of this – it is written in your report."
"State grants to companies and exporters, closed markets, voluntary monetary dumping, counterfeiting, pirating; the Chinese are guilty of a host of unfair practices."
"The most significant one, however, is the lack of freedom, not least union freedom, which denies Chinese workers the chance to request pay rises or improved working conditions."
"Our interests and those of the countries and the people of Europe, of our jobs and of our economies must take precedence over suicidal adherence to the dogma of free trade carried to extremes."
"Every country in the world, including the United States, has grasped this, but not the Europe of Brussels."
"Even though it has the merit of raising a number of issues, this report fails to address the issues of protection or retaliatory measures and to bring globalisation into question, and it consequently falls short of what is required."
". One could write a great deal on the question of relations, in particular trade relations, between the different countries comprising the EU and China, a country with a population of some 1.3 billion."
"The report does boast some balanced points, such as establishing ‘trade links with China in a spirit of cooperation and complementarity, while ensuring that the two parties can maintain and develop harmoniously their industrial, agricultural and service sectors in order to guarantee the best possible living standards for all their inhabitants’. Ultimately, however, it descends into a justification for capitalism and the liberalisation of trade relations within the framework of the World Trade Organisation."
"Hence the demands of ‘opening up the markets’, in particular the liberalisation of the ‘financial markets’, the reform of the ‘economic system’ – in other words, the installation of capitalism – and the ‘acceptance of the European legal and economic system’."
"Hence the acceptance of all of the EU’s duplicity – which enjoys the agreement of Portugal’s Socialist Party Government – when it comes to the textiles and clothing sector, pandering to the interests of the large distributors and importers."
"This is unacceptable."
"China is one of the world’s fastest growing economies."
"It is also the EU’s largest trading partner after the United States."
"It is therefore important for the EU to develop both trade and cooperation with this part of the world."
"Fundamentally, our attitude is that it is not to Europe’s advantage to alienate itself from this growing economy by means of customs duties and quotas."
"China’s economic strength is growing in most industries."
"Today’s ‘textile wars’ will therefore spread to other areas in time."
"Trying to protect unprofitable industry from international competition is therefore no permanent solution."
"Sweden has experienced such attempts for 30 years in both the shipbuilding industry and the textiles and ready-made clothing industry."
"In order to respond to growing international competition, the EU faces the choice either of implementing centrally controlled protectionism or of stimulating growth from below."
"Unfortunately, a number of the political groups are choosing the first method. We cannot, therefore, support the report."
"Otherwise, I support the proposal to set up a system for labelling products with their country of origin."
". It is naive to think that the EU Member States can build a wall around them to protect us from external economic threats."
"In the long run, free trade offers the most prospects for prosperity and world stability."
"Any attempt to protect our own economy would not bring any long-term solutions."
"The report gives little consideration to the developments that China has undergone and overlooks the fact that any further development will inevitably give more attention to the position of minorities and the environment."
"Pressure from Europe and finger-wagging will only have the opposite effect."
"The problems involving the textile imports are typical of the EU’s schizophrenic way of doing things."
"We first encourage free trade, only to introduce quotas later on that are unworkable for entrepreneurs."
"Moreover, it is unseemly to maintain the arms embargo and treat China in the same way as we do such rogue countries as North Korea and Iran."
"If Europe is serious about building sustainable trade relations with China, we will need to sit around the negotiating table as equal partners and set aside our self-importance."
". I welcome this timely report into the deepening trade relationship between the EU and China in the 21st Century."
"It is not often that Parliamentarians have the chance to consider the underlying trends in the development of international politics but this report does so."
"I fully endorse the focus given by the Rapporteur to the challenges posed to EU industry by the rapid growth of the Chinese economy in both unskilled labour-intensive industry as well as high-tech domains."
"The paragraphs which draw attention to the growing problem of declining labour standards and unfair trading practices are particularly important in the run-up to the Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting of the WTO in December."
"By highlighting these challenges MEPs have voted for a constructive dialogue with the Chinese in which broader questions of the social and environmental impact of rapid economic growth are taken into account."
". The issue of trade relations between China and the EU is one that must, as a matter of priority, be addressed head on."
"The idea that the flow of goods from China is somehow going to dwindle is an illusion."
"It is similarly fanciful to think that we can compete with this enormous producer on the basis of a similar economic model, characterised by low wages and unqualified labour."
"We must take action – without abandoning our industries, without stopping production, without leaving our citizens high and dry – mindful of forthcoming developments in this trade relationship and of the consequences of those developments for Europe’s economy."
"What is more, as this trade relationship develops, we must try to achieve one vital objective, namely the democratisation of China, a country in which respect for human rights is anything but praiseworthy and in which external policy is based entirely on a mindset of expanding its influence, while overlooking the objectives of expanding democracy and respect for human rights, which are our objectives and those of our allies."
"Let us therefore turn trade links into a platform for development."
"This ought to be our challenge."
". I should like to make two recommendations to the Commission."
"The first relates to internal matters."
"Globalisation is a new reality, the effects of which cannot be offset by protectionist measures."
"It has its positive aspects but there is also a side to it that should not be overlooked."
"We must act quickly and decisively to help the regions worst affected in social terms."
"I should like to recommend that the Commission draw up specific programmes to aid those regions."
"The second recommendation relates to matters outside the EU."
"Since it joined the World Trade Organisation, China has never played by the rules."
"The Chinese authorities continue to pursue policies of state aid for exports; they have artificially devalued their currency; they have breached environmental standards; they have failed to respect workers’ rights; they do not observe health and safety standards in the workplace; they use child labour and forced labour."
"In the textiles sector, they have on a number of occasions brazenly gone back on their commitments, and this with the EU’s tacit acceptance."
"I should therefore recommend that the Commission exert constant pressure on the Chinese authorities to introduce minimum social and environmental standards into trade agreements, together with a system for monitoring implementation."
"Globalisation produces winners and losers."
"Defeat is a bitter pill to swallow, but losing because your opponent has broken the most basic rules of the game is disgraceful and unacceptable."
"Mr President, I abstained on the resolution on Iran, and many of my British Conservative colleagues voted against, as Amendment l – making a referral to the United Nations Security Council a requirement – was rejected."
"This is very regrettable."
"I also did not like the fact that paragraph 7 was included in the report."
"That paragraph restricts the eventual options available to the West to prevent the development by Iran of a nuclear weapon."
"I fully support the condemnation of Iran in the resolution for its brutal human rights track record, including the execution of minors for sexual chastity offences."
"We certainly cannot support the position adopted by Iran, which promises ‘tougher measures’ in the event of the nuclear question being referred to the United Nations Security Council, and even a step backwards with regard to the commitments it has entered into on this delicate matter."
"Concerns about the use of nuclear weapons by a country that is a leading proponent of Islamic fundamentalism are certainly well-founded."
"However, that must not keep us from recognising the right of every people – including, therefore, the Iranian people – to develop as fully as possible their own economic and technological potential, and to defend their own territory."
"From this point of view, Europe cannot ignore the geopolitical facts of the situation, namely that, to the east of Iran, countries such as China, North Korea, Russia, India and, not least, Pakistan not only possess atomic weaponry, but also have the capability to use it at long distances."
". I support this resolution especially the references to the Human Rights situation in Iran which has further deteriorated since the presidential elections of June 2005."
"Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have increasingly reported human rights violations in Iran during the last few months, and there are increasing reports regarding executions and death sentences, especially against juvenile offenders and members of minorities, which violate internationally recognised criteria and standards."
"I am deeply concerned at Iran's lack of cooperation with regard to the EU-Iran Human Rights Dialogue and that there are no signs of the enforcement of Iran's commitment within this dialogue to strengthen respect for human rights and the rule of law."
"I therefore support the call on Iran to recommence the EU-Iran Human Rights Dialogue with the European Union and calls upon the Council and Commission to monitor developments in Iran and raise concrete cases of human rights abuses within the framework of the dialogue."
"The Commission must also make effective use of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights to intensify contacts and cooperation with Iranian civil society and independent media and to support democracy and respect for human rights in Iran."
". The European Parliamentary Labour Party strongly supports the resolution on Iran, particularly the recognition given to the efforts of the EU3 to reach a diplomatic solution, the affirmation that the only way to resolve the problem is through diplomatic pressure, with Iran returning to talks based on the Paris agreement, and the importance of the resumption of the Human Rights dialogue with Iran."
"However, it is unhelpful (in amendment 12) to use this resolution to criticise the review of the US security strategy at this stage, whilst the precise plans and intentions for the review remain unclear and as yet unpublished."
". The report in question highlights the fact that a working dialogue between the EU and Iran is of the utmost importance to both parties concerned."
"It is for this reason that I welcome the resolution whilst emphasising the fact that the EU should seek to be in good relations with Iran as it is a potentially important partner for the EU."
"I share the view that Iran should reingage in a human rights dialogue with the EU whilst agreeing with the need to resist nuclear proliferation."
"Furthermore, I urge the EU to treat Iran with the respect that such a significant and important country deserves."
". – The debate on Iran in the European Parliament, on the pretext of the nuclear problem and violation of human rights, relates to more general imperialist plans and the vying for control of the wealth-producing resources of Iran and the area as a whole."
"The positions of the ΕU and in the motion for a resolution have multiple objectives."
"They incriminate Iran and acquit the Bush administration, which called Iran a country of the 'axis of evil' and is threatening war."
"They cite nuclear risks but keep quiet about the existence of nuclear weapons in and the threat to use them by the USA and other imperialist powers."
"They present themselves as the protectors of human rights because they want to promote regimes which they will control."
"They pretend that they are intervening for a peaceful solution to the problem, in order to safeguard the interests of the European monopolies in Iran."
"The ΕU goes along with the US propaganda in order to accustom public opinion to the possibility of invasion and claim a share of the spoils."
"The nuclear problem in Iran cannot be addressed selectively; it must be addressed under a more general nuclear disarmament policy."
"The imperialist powers refuse and are promoting the production of nuclear weapons for use in regular wars."
"With problems of democratisation and human rights, every nation is responsible and competent to change the situation."
"We are voting against the motion for a resolution in an expression of solidarity with the people of Iran."
"The peoples in the area as a whole need to be mobilised against American and Euro-unifying imperialism."
". No more escalation in the nuclear dispute with Iran!"
"I oppose nuclear power as a matter of principle, but the agreement between Iran and the EU, as put before us, was a sham and could only been seen as escalating the dispute."
"The agreement expected Iran to renounce, once and for all, everything other than the operation of nuclear reactors for the generation of electricity, which would make impossible the conversion or enrichment of uranium, the production of fuel rods, and the planned heavy water reactor at Arak."
"Iran was to be required, as a matter of treaty obligation, to abandon the right to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"Never before has any state on this earth signed up to such a commitment to the unilateral renunciation of its own sovereignty."
"In return for this, the EU was willing to guarantee, among other things, that no EU Member State would attack Iran using nuclear weapons, but no mention was made of the USA."
"This appears to be a joint effort on the part of the USA and the EU3."
"One reason why the EU is a thoroughly poor choice as a broker is that it itself promotes the use of nuclear power, with France and the United Kingdom refusing to abandon their nuclear weapons and no attempt being made to abandon the enrichment of uranium in Germany."
"The peaceful resolution of the conflict surrounding the Iranian nuclear programme is the only possible option."
"The pressure being exerted upon Iran is a cause of profound concern to me. It reminds me of the preparation of the war against Iraq."
". The internal situation in Iran has for a number of years given considerable cause for concern."
"Iran and its policy of breaching human rights, of failing to uphold the values of freedom and democracy and, most crucially, of failing to respect human life – at world level, at regional level and in Iran itself – has been an alarmingly destabilising influence."
"Against this backdrop, Iran’s nuclear activities are further cause for concern."
"The EU has in recent years adopted the approach of an actively and openly cooperative diplomatic policy towards the Iranian authorities in the hope of achieving results."
"It could scarcely be said that this has been a success."
"The resolution adopted today is a further effort in this vein, but the time has come for questions to be asked as to whether this is the only way forward, and whether it is necessary to broaden the international alliance in order to force Iran, using the weapon of diplomacy, to honour its international obligations and to respect minimum standards at national level."
"We shall be keeping a close eye on matters."
". In its relations with the countries of the international community, and in particular with African countries, Europe must, once and for all, accept that, without democratisation, and all that that entails, all attempts at cooperation and aid will at best be unproductive and at worst counterproductive."
"In the case of Ethiopia, where the legitimate expectations of a population that has endured ten years of suffering were recently dashed, it is our duty to do all we can to make the road to democracy a viable one."
"Africa must not be a territory in which illegitimate governments are accepted as though this were an inevitability."
"In this context, the message that this resolution sends out to Ethiopia should be clearly understood."
"Lastly, let us take action, first and foremost, in the name of our principles and our populations. Let us also be clear, however, that we do so in the name of our own interests as well."
"Africa must not be a continent from which the have-nots understandably want to escape."
"We believe that the EU has an important task in strengthening democracy and human rights in its immediate surroundings."
"In the global work to promote peace, disarmament and human rights, we wish however to prioritise the UN, which is better suited than the EU to carrying out such tasks."
"We are therefore abstaining from voting on the resolutions on Iran and Ethiopia, even though we can in principle support quite a few of the demands made in them."
". I voted in favour of the Bono report on education as the cornerstone of the Lisbon process, for the following reasons."
"Firstly, in order to achieve the objectives laid down in the Lisbon Strategy, aimed at establishing a knowledge-based society, the Member States must make a clear commitment to lifelong education and training and in so doing help to create jobs in Europe."
"Secondly, this report highlights the need to place greater emphasis on education in European policy, by promoting reduced bureaucracy and mobility, by means of the mutual recognition of qualifications and through universal and non-discriminatory access to Europe’s universities."
". This report confirms a number of the objections that we have made, namely:"
"- the failure of the European project in its attempts at achieving the highest standards of education and the failure of the education system in various countries;"
"- the productivity crisis in the current economic and social fabric, which is reflected in employment and in inappropriate performance-related pressure in the education system."
"It does put forward some welcome measures, such as to ‘ensure a 15% increase in the number of science graduates between now and 2010’, which Portugal would do well to take on board."
"It also calls on the Member States to ‘increase the number of teachers and to put in place initial and continuous teacher training of quality’, which is a welcome measure."
"Furthermore, it highlights the financial bottleneck in most countries, which is a significant problem, especially given the situation in Portugal."
"It also stresses the need for the EU to ‘guarantee sufficient methods of funding for the new integrated action programme in the field of lifelong education and training’ and emphasises the need to ensure that the European Social Fund can continue to be available after 2006 in all Member States."
"Nevertheless, it promotes the neoliberal route, as laid down in the Lisbon agenda, with all of the detrimental consequences that that entails, not least for vocational education and training."
"Hence our abstention."
"We are voting against this resolution from the European Parliament."
"We completely agree with the decision of 7 November 2000 by the EU committee of the Swedish Parliament, commenting on the issue of increased EU coordination within the education field."
"The committee adopted a wording to the effect that care must be taken to ensure that the Member States’ exclusive responsibility for the organisation of education and for the content of education systems is fully respected."
"The following day, the EU’s education ministers met and adopted, among other things, the appendix from the EU committee of the Swedish Parliament, presented by Sweden’s then education minister."
"We see no reason to review the position it expresses."
". The increasingly globalised world of today faces new challenges to which European society must respond."
"The only solution is to support education and lifelong learning."
"This agenda must be considered a high priority for the European Union; without this support, it will not be possible to attain the Lisbon Strategy objective of becoming a competitive knowledge-based economy."
"I supported Mr Bono’s report stressing the importance of education not only at a young age, but also throughout life."
"I appreciate the views of the rapporteur on the role of universities in this process."
"By fostering cooperation and teacher and student exchanges, we contribute to synergies in the area of research as well as to the strengthening of a European identity."
"At the same time, we must realise that the creation of a knowledge-based economy and society will not be possible without adequate financial support."
"I see an opportunity for the EU to prove its resolve in this area at the European level."
"In the new financial climate, it will be necessary to negotiate the highest possible budget for education and for supporting the mobility of students, trainees, teachers and researchers."
"Only through mutual cooperation can we succeed in keeping pace with increasing international competition."
". What will make us more competitive, more effective and more productive is our ability to research, innovate and create."
"What will make Europe return to economic growth and development, and this is broadly acknowledged, is a commitment to placing greater value on human resources."
"To this end, investment in training is the most productive way forward, even if the fruits of this investment will only be seen in the medium to long term."
"Time is running out for anyone actually to believe that the Lisbon agenda will be fulfilled within the time limit laid down."
"Not only are we running against the clock, we are also running against logic, and if we insist on doing so, the consequences could be disastrous."
"Short-, medium- and long-term measures are required if we are to rectify this situation."
"As I said, investment in training is a medium/long-term measure, and this has the potential to be hugely effective."
"We must therefore invest in ensuring that we have qualified human resources, given that this is our development model."
"Mr President, the main thing to be said in response to the Portas Report is that it is only those who speak the language of their new host country who stand a chance of getting an education, protecting their own interests and being integrated into its society."
"It is for precisely this reason that those children belonging to the second or third generation of immigrants who do not have a command of the host country’s language continue to be denied opportunities, with the consequence that we increasingly face the creation of so-called parallel societies, in which they resort to violence and crime."
"We must not, however, tolerate the creation of such parallel societies, and so integration is dependent upon the learning of the national language of the state in question, and on that we must insist."
"Mr President, I have seen quite a bit in my time, but the Portas report must be one of the most Utopian and dangerous ever to have been put before this House, and that is saying something."
"In this report, the so-called multi-culturalism of the European countries is reinforced even further by encouraging second, third, or even fourth-generation immigrant children to develop their own language and culture on our territory and thus to make even less of an effort to integrate in our society or assimilate themselves to it."
"That is complete madness and flies in the face of the democratic will of the large majority of our citizens."
"It can only lead to even more problems, to the formation of even more ghettos, to apartheid and, ultimately and lamentably, to violence."
"Echoing the new German Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, let me tell this House that a multi-cultural society is unworkable and that immigrants residing in Europe legally must be encouraged to adapt as much as they can."
"Mr President, first of all, Europe should not meddle in the Member States’ internal educational matters."
"If there is one area in which the subsidiarity principle should apply in full, it is education policy."
"Secondly, this proposal accomplishes the precise opposite of what is officially intended."
"It is important that immigrants should learn the host country’s language."
"If they are unfamiliar with the language of their country of origin, or are no longer at home with it, that should not be an obstacle in the host country."
"This proposal will only promote the formation of ghettos."
"It is also absurd that our children should learn Arabic, for example."
"It is the world on its head."
"Equally far-fetched is the paragraph in the explanatory statement that states that immigrant parents should be encouraged to choose the language of origin in preference to European languages that they could use in their careers."
"This is an example of multi-cultural ideology prevailing over reality."
"One really has to be a Communist to dream up something as Utopian as this."
". Integration policy is more than a policy of tolerance."
"Integration is something proactive and inclusive; it facilitates communication, places value on difference and is based on equality in dignity."
"Tolerance is merely a matter of acknowledging others and accepting them for what they are."
"Kant rejected this notion of tolerance, which in fact does not allow for the perspective of putting ourselves in other people’s shoes, which is the perspective of justice."
"Perceived as ‘appealing and virtuous’, Europe is a haven of values, a crossroads of an identity based on cosmopolitan law and national identities based on strong traditions that recognise that law."
"Pluralism is its defining characteristic, not a potential factor in its downfall."
"This is why Europe offers the ideal political framework for cultural diversity."
"There should be a human response to the causes of immigration."
"Let us take the issue of language, for example."
"The teaching of language is the most basic prerequisite of human communication, of citizenship and of the awareness and exercise of rights."
"Without such communication, Europe’s plan for civilisation will have failed."
"In other words, it will be little more than a system of open doors through which people never pass."
". – As far as Mr Portas is concerned, immigration is an end in itself, regardless of whether or not there is any economic or social justification for it."
"There is a quasi-religious belief in the infinite benefits of immigration."
"This is the only possible explanation for his recommendation not only that we provide immigrant communities – and those born into such communities, up to the third generation at least – with teaching in their languages and cultures of origin, but also that this teaching be extended to indigenous communities, as part of a great multicultural melting pot, the aim being to create, and I quote, ‘a common cosmopolitan heritage’."
"What Mr Portas is proposing is tantamount to engineering the integration of immigrants by bringing about the disintegration of the host society and removing the culture of both the European and the immigrant communities."
"By refusing to impose their values, their rules, their languages and their culture on their own lands, European countries have for decades been contributing to the communitarisation of society, thereby sowing the seeds of the kind of inter-ethnic and inter-cultural confrontation that has been seen in a number of countries."
"At a time when the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Mellila are being bombarded by thousands of would-be migrants and when migratory pressure is intensifying, even though our countries are already bursting at the seams, this report is not just absurd; it is an attack on our identity."
"We have chosen to abstain from voting in the final vote on this report."
"This issue is an extremely important one – so important that political responsibility for it must remain at one or other level within the Member States."
"It is the Member States that have exclusive responsibility for the organisation of education and for the content of education systems."
"This particularly applies to the integration of immigrants and to the organisation both of mother-tongue teaching and of teaching in the languages of the immigrants’ new countries."
"."
"When it comes to immigration, the key word is integration; the shared desire to integrate and the shared ability to integrate."
"What the rapporteur is telling us is of great importance, but some priorities must be set out."
"I understand and share the rapporteur’s concerns, but I feel compelled to focus my attention on this idea of the ability to integrate, which entails strict controls on who enters a country and who stays."
"The reasons for this are twofold: firstly, and most importantly, because the rewards for breaking the law act as an incentive for illegal immigration and for the networks profiting from it; and secondly, because illegal immigration itself overstretches our ability to integrate."
"Nevertheless, on the issue of education, the active integration of immigrants and their children is of immediate concern."
"The arrival of new, different cultures is a positive phenomenon, but this must not stop us from wanting those who arrive to integrate, and integration means accepting the host culture."
"It is clear that schools are excellent places in which to do this."
"It is also clear that the more symbiotic this relationship, the better."
"Let us not lose sight, however, of the starting point of the relationship."
"I voted in favour of the Pack report on new challenges for the circus as part of European culture. I did so for the following reasons:"
"Firstly, the report highlights the cultural nature of circus activities. It plays an important role in art and culture in many countries, including Portugal."
"In this context, the Commission should draw up measures aimed at protecting the circus, in order to help ensure that it is recognised as part of European culture."
"This report contains quite a few proposals that we absolutely cannot support."
"The issue is that of why the European Parliament should call on the Member States and the Commission to recognise the circus as a part of European culture."
"The report also contains proposals to the effect that service points should be set up and information campaigns carried out, all designed to make life easier for circus companies."
"The report raises the issue of education for circus children."
"Freedom of movement and access to education are significant issues."
"All these matters must, however, be resolved in larger contexts than a report like this, taking in a wider range of sectors."
". I welcome the report concerning the new challenges for the circus as part of European culture."
"It is imperative that an adequate and non discriminatory education is provided to all children of travelling communities regardless of the Member State in which they temporarily reside."
"It is of equal importance that the welfare and mobility rights of circus workers are protected through the use of short-term residence permits."
"However, it is a source of deep concern that the report includes the presentation of animals as I strongly oppose the use of animals in the circus."
"It is now both the Commission and the Member States' responsibility to reflect on the point in question."
". – Mrs Pack’s excellent report finally addresses a cultural issue that is all too often seen as a minor art form, whereas in fact it is art in its purest form, as it mixes dream, travel, childhood, body patterns, music, tragedy and poetry in a blend of courage and sensitivity."
"The time has come for the political world, which likes to see itself as an arena of untamed beasts, to address the issue of the tamers’ circus; not least because - from the great names like Bouglione to the more humble ones, like those in ‘La Strada’ - circuses forge ties between generations and communities."
"The circus is a cultural river flowing across countries and crossing the borders of time, space and age."
"Consequently, Mrs Pack has turned her report into a political festival, a short-lived festival perhaps, but one that will live long in Parliament’s memory."
". The circus, with all the fantasy that it conjures up, is worthy of enormous respect and, if I may say so, affection."
"Some of the points raised by the rapporteur, not least those relating to labour, are highly pertinent."
"That being said, I cannot help but question whether this is the kind of debate expected of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I thank my fellow Members who have stayed to listen to my explanation of vote on the report on the urban dimension."
"I address the 20 million pensioners – former workers, hence pensioners – living in Italy, as well as the 150 million pensioners who have worked in Europe and who live in all 25 Member States of the European Union."
"I wish to reassure them of my intention to insist – through this explanation of vote – that the European Parliament call on the Member States to make travel on urban public transport completely free for pensioners, who deserve society’s recognition for the work they have done."
"In addition to giving up their seats, young people will be delighted to know that pensioners are being shown respect through the right to travel on public transport for free through our beautiful cities."
"The June List chooses to vote against this report because it is another example of how, through own-initiative reports, the European Parliament wishes to provide the EU with new areas of competence."
"According to the Treaty wording, the EU is not authorised to conduct a specific policy for towns, despite which Mr Beaupuy believes that the European Parliament must stand up for an urban policy at EU level."
"The report is a typical example of the way in which, through new ‘models’, ‘tools’, ‘dialogues’, ‘working parties’, various aid programmes and, as time goes on, new institutions, the EU gives rise to bureaucracy and supranationalism."
". The urban dimension should figure in regional development policy."
"The existence of small and medium-sized towns in interior, outlying and rural areas boosts development in these areas and helps to offset disparities between areas and combat the effects of agglomeration that the large urban centres have on the interior of a country."
"Whereas towns and cities are capable of stimulating development, they also bring a range of complex problems, such as congestion, accommodation requirements, pollution and social exclusion, owing to the economic, social and regional planning policies currently pursued."
"In this context, a policy of urban renewal and regeneration is vital."
"In this field, properly resourced cohesion policy can contribute with a Community initiative, as in the case of URBAN concept, with adequate financial resources."
"We might look into additional Community aid, for example, to support the building of affordable housing."
"Unfortunately, this is not happening."
"Making the urban dimension an across-the-board policy in a context of budget savings might pit objectives in competition with one another and this may jeopardise support for the least favoured regions."
"In spite of this, and our objections to the ‘role of towns and cities’ and the so-called ‘urban dimension’ being beholden to the neoliberal Lisbon agenda, we lend our overall backing to the report."
". The issue of towns and cities does not fall under the Union’s powers."
"Like so many other issues, however, such as tourism, it has been affected, directly or indirectly, by a succession of measures arising from Community policy."
"On a practical level, the urban issue is treated on the basis of the precautionary principle within regional policy, within the framework of the Structural and Cohesion Funds."
"I feel that the Union’s measures should play a complementary role, so that the measures taken by the Member States can be developed in full for the benefit of the citizens."
"Investment must, therefore, be made in programmes that have contributed towards a balanced relationship between the various levels of decision-making."
"Given that the differences between rural and urban areas are particularly marked in the ten new Member States, it is crucial that the urban networks of the 10 new Member States be integrated into the urban system throughout Community territory. One way to achieve this is to improve transport networks connecting the cities with their regions, and inter-city transport networks."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Beaupuy report."
"We voted in favour of Amendments 1, 3 and 5."
"We are well disposed towards a guaranteed reasonable standard of living."
"We are, however, opposed to introducing state-regulated minimum wages."
"We interpret the concept of ‘guaranteed income’, which appears in the above-mentioned amendments, as signifying not a certain guaranteed minimum wage but, rather, a guaranteed reasonable standard of living."
". We voted in favour of the report because it included some of our proposals, which improved upon the original text in the vote in plenary."
"Of our proposals that were adopted, I should like to highlight the following:"
"- calls for the promotion of access to high quality jobs, with, first and foremost, a decent wage, as a means of preventing and combating poverty;"
"- points out, at the same time, that part-time work and low-quality jobs, which mainly affect women, are a factor in the increased rates of women among poor workers, which is a factor in social exclusion."
"Some of its worst aspects, however, were removed."
"Consequently, although it is only partially satisfactory, failing, as it does, to address the causes of poverty in sufficient depth and to propose measures needed to put an end to it, the final resolution succeeds in raising awareness of the serious social problems that particularly affect women."
"The resolution on women and poverty in the EU contains quite a few demands to which it is important to attend, including equal access to health care and medical treatment for women and men and the combating of violence against women."
"It should be emphasised that these are the Member States’ areas of responsibility."
"We do not support the proposal for a ‘minimum guaranteed income’."
"According to the Swedish labour market model, wages are established through negotiations between unions and employers and not through legislation."
"Moreover, establishing a minimum wage could lead to wage reductions within many low-paid groups, something that is mainly in danger of affecting women."
"In the light of the above, we choose to abstain from voting in the final vote on the resolution."
". 51% of the EU’s population is at risk of poverty, for they are female."
"One reason for this is certainly our inability, despite our many good intentions, to make much of an improvement to equal opportunities for women in the workplace."
"The members of the ‘weaker sex’ continue to earn, on average, between 20% and 30% less for the same work, and their chances of making a career are minimal."
"Another reason is, without a doubt, that they spend more time on bringing up children, running households and social work, so that they do not have the time to go into full-time employment – even on the assumption that the opportunity to do so is available to them."
"In practice, then, women often work only part-time, and consequently have only small old-age pensions to look forward to."
"The result of McJobs or 1-Euro-jobs or call them what you will remains the same: even two or three such jobs are not enough to feed a family."
"More generous family allowances alone will not solve this problem; on the contrary, what is needed is a comprehensive programme with good opportunities for training and earning, equal pay, more flexible childcare options and better provision for old age – a phase of life in which single women, whether with or without children, are particularly at risk of poverty."
"We must, overall, give more attention to pro-birth family policy and be more generous in funding it, in order to offer women better opportunities for earning a living and providing for themselves, so that they do not end up collectively opting not to have children, with the consequence that our European population slowly dies out."
". The issue of combating poverty and social exclusion in the EU has been discussed at great length in the EU, both in terms of the Millennium Goals, and, especially, in terms of the objectives inherent in Europe’s ideals."
"This report is the new Europe’s first dealing specifically with poverty among women."
"Why women?"
"There is alarming data showing that women are at great risk of falling into extreme poverty and various kinds of exclusion."
"This is why Parliament deemed it important to look into the phenomenon and to propose the development of indicators and a methodology that may make a major contribution towards effectively combating the problem, by means of partnerships with the poorest women and especially through measures aimed at ensuring that our societies help to reconcile family life and working life in situations of extreme poverty."
"We can help to combat poverty, a phenomenon that must be seen today as a violation of human rights and as a situation that must be tackled as a matter of urgency."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Záborská report."
"The Minutes of this part-session will be put before the House at the beginning of the next."
"In the absence of any objections to them, I will forward the adopted text to the intended recipients."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament to be suspended."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 13 October 2005."
"Before going on to talk to you as usual about the events that have taken place between two part-sessions, I must remind you that today is the 60th anniversary of the creation of the United Nations."
"On this occasion, the European Parliament must consider what these years have taught us in terms of cooperation and dialogue and multilateral political action."
"The message of the Secretary-General has been distributed in full to all of the Members of the European Parliament."
"In that message, Kofi Annan reminds us in no uncertain terms that the United Nations must reflect the times and, as such, should adapt to the developments that have taken place in the world since 1945."
"I would also like to remind you that last September a meeting took place in New York of Heads of State or Government to draw up an inventory of reforms and to set concrete commitments with a view to their implementation."
"This Summit did not satisfy all of our expectations in this regard."
"We cannot say that the Resolution on it approved by the European Parliament has been taken fully into account."
"For this very reason, we must monitor the way this reform process progresses very closely."
"During our last plenary session we approved a third Resolution on the results of the September Summit and I would like to take advantage of this anniversary to express once again our determination that reforms such as the creation of a Human Rights Council or the Peace Consolidation Committee should become realities before the end of the 60th session of the General Assembly."
"On this date the European Parliament reiterates its support for the actions of the United Nations and for the fundamental principles that govern it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to have to inform you of the death on 15 October of the former Member of the European Parliament, Matti Wuori."
"Matti Wuori was a Member of our Parliament during the last term in office, he belonged to the Group of the Greens and was rapporteur on human rights."
"Parliament is remembering this fellow Member today."
"The final version of the draft agenda for the October II part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 20 October pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament requests that the debate on the Commission Statement on patents for biotechnological inventions not be concluded with a resolution, contrary to what was originally approved by the Conference of Presidents."
"Mr Schulz has the floor to explain his Group’s request."
"Mr President, it is indeed the case that our group had made a request to the Conference of Presidents that the debate on the Commission statement on patents for biotechnological inventions should go ahead, but that there should be no resolution."
"If we include today in the reckoning, there will be 48 hours between the debate and the adoption, and we do not believe that it is possible, in so short a time, to hammer out a common position on one of the most important and controversial issues in European political debate."
"I do not think we can be seriously expected to do that."
"We do believe that it makes sense to debate this now, but, when dealing with an area as problematic as this one, Parliament should be allowed more time to make a statement."
"We therefore ask that the debate should be allowed to go ahead, but without motions for resolutions being tabled, and that the order of business be amended accordingly."
"Debate without resolution!"
"Mr Liese has the floor to speak against."
"Mr President, I would like to oppose the motion from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and argue in favour of a resolution."
"The problem is that there are deadlines to be met in considering this issue."
"If we do not come up with a position on this matter in October, the decision will be taken elsewhere; the European Patent Office is, for example, considering a controversial patent, and there are contradictory interpretations of the directive that this House adopted on the patenting of human genes or of human body parts."
"If the House does not express its mind, the political message we will be sending is that we are not capable of making a contribution to the debate on this issue, even though it was this House that adopted the directive."
"I therefore ask that Mr Schulz’s motion be rejected."
"(1)"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Mr President, I would like to bring to the attention of this House the findings of a visit I made to Romania to look in particular at the situation of babies and young adults with handicaps in institutional care."
"This is an area where the European Union could perhaps be doing more to push the Romanian authorities to increase the pace of reform."
"For example, last year 4600 babies were abandoned in maternity hospitals."
"Some were reunited with their families but many remain there."
"I lifted up a little boy of 18 months who had never been outside a maternity hospital."
"This is not something we want to see."
"We need emergency fostering in Romania and we need the European Union to push for that."
"In relation to the institutional care of adults with handicaps, I visited an institution where 450 people were living in awful conditions, unacceptable to us here in the European Union."
"Some progress is being made but more could be done if we put greater pressure on the Romanian authorities."
"I would ask that we all do that."
"– Mr President, I wish to protest in the strongest terms at the way in which the Spanish Civil Guard treated a group of Portuguese people in Spain. On 15 October, 16 busloads of people went to Salamanca to demonstrate their solidarity with Cuba and Venezuela, on the occasion of the Ibero-American Summit taking place there."
"In spite of the cooperative behaviour of the hundreds of Portuguese people in the group, the Civil Guard used every trick in the book to delay the buses’ arrival in Salamanca, in an attempt to stop these hundreds of Portuguese people from taking part in the demonstration and displaying their solidarity with Cuba and Venezuela."
"This was an unacceptable act of political discrimination, as the only buses told to stop were those in this convoy, and all of the participants’ personal information was taken on a number of occasions."
"Mr President, the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was signed less than 18 months ago by all the Heads of State and Government."
"That Treaty retained the principle of a common agricultural policy agreed in 1957, including the article which states that EU policy is to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture."
"Yet, within two years, Commissioner Mandelson seems to be prepared to sacrifice the European model of agriculture in order to hammer out a deal at the WTO, by forcing farmers to bear a disproportionate share of the burden."
"At the same time we have Mr Barroso offering deals which undermine pledges given to farmers in the context of CAP reform, in order to move Prime Minister Blair on the budget."
"The EU demands traceability, cross-compliance and food security from its farmers, and rightly so, but in return it is threatening to break its promises, causing huge uncertainty in the agricultural community, and it is proposing to sell out its primary food producers for a quick-fix deal."
"Mr President, I would like to express the shame I feel as a Member of the European Parliament as a result of Mr Barroso having recently appointed three people even more reactionary than Mr Buttiglione to occupy the Commission’s vacant positions in the European Group on Ethics and New Technologies."
"I believe that this retrograde step is not just shameful in terms of its result, but also in view of the way the result has been achieved: since April, Mr Barroso has been consulting the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs — which is competent in this area and to which I belong ― entirely avoiding any debate and, furthermore, failing to comply with the applicable rules."
"Furthermore, it should be stressed that many other Members, including Presidents of this Parliament, have expressed their opposition in this regard."
"Appointing people who are even worse than Buttiglione for such a delicate matter, in which such good work is being done, will destroy the momentum and work against progress."
"Mr President, I wish to make just two short points concerning the avian flu situation."
"Dr David Nabarro, UN coordinator for avian and human influenza, has stressed that, to prevent a pandemic of human infection, the global response to the bird flu epidemic must be intensified."
"The United States has ordered approximately 100 million dollars’ worth of vaccine."
"The United Nations, by contrast, has a total budget of around USD 7 million to control animal outbreaks of avian flu, but requires USD 175 million for an effective programme."
"My second point is that, in addition to the evident problem of slow manufacturing processes, it appears unlikely that there will be enough flu shots available for all those who might need them."
"However, it might be possible to contain an H5N1 outbreak at its source, if the surrounding population were immediately vaccinated."
"I would like to raise the question of whether we in the European Union would be prepared to share the vaccines we already have in our possession with regions where an outbreak occurs, in an effort to contain it."
"It should not just be a matter of having vaccines in case it affects our own citizens: if there is an outbreak, we should target it wherever it occurs and try to ensure that it does not spread."
"Mr President, the issue of the European border with Russia is not peripheral or marginal; on the contrary, it is absolutely fundamental."
"Estonia is a full Member of the EU."
"This concerns the Union’s external border."
"What is at stake today, an alternative to our values, i.e. the Commission’s appeasement of Russia or the reliability of the EU for the new members."
"The danger that the EU could lose reliability was noticed at the London Summit, where the Russian-Estonian border issue, which is the subject of the commitments between Russia and the EU, became marginalised."
"The two governments were suggested to sort the problem out and the Commission would stand aside and wash its hands of the matter."
"Among these two was one big government and one small."
"The big and angry one dared to ask the Commission to take Russia’s side and bring smaller new Member States to order."
"They became disobedient to Russia, and that was bad."
"This was precisely the position expressed recently by the Russian Ambassador, Mr Chizhov, in Brussels."
"Our Parliament, as a more independent and conscious body, should debate this matter and issue a resolution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, according to reports in the French newspapers and , the human rights situation in Cuba is going from bad to worse."
"Marxism is becoming more barbaric the more the Marxist tyrant who introduced it is aware of his approaching end."
"I would like to give you a few examples to illustrate my point: the journalist Mario Henrique Mayo, who in 2003 was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment, has made two suicide attempts after having used a razor blade to etch the words ‘innocent’ and ‘freedom’ on his own body."
"On 4 October, the journalist Victor Arroyo who, for expressing an opinion that constituted an offence, was sentenced to 26 years in jail, ended his hunger strike at Cardinal Ortega’s request after having ended up in a delirium."
"For 100 other political prisoners, there is not a single prospect of liberation; quite the opposite is the case."
"The moderate opponent Manuel Cuesta Morua has been beaten up by a collection of regime supporters and has been at the receiving end of extreme racist abuse."
"I hope that this House will present a united front in denouncing the human rights violations in Cuba."
"It will send out a better message than that of a future European Commissioner who once, while smoking a Havana cigar, accepted a ride on a Harley Davidson with Fidel Castro, but has never breathed a word about it."
"Mr President, the threat of an avian influenza pandemic has plunged Europe and the world into a state of hysteria."
"While I was in Brussels, I made inquiries into the situation in what may be Europe’s future capital."
"It would appear that Tamiflu, which is the only antiviral drug effective against avian influenza and which is produced by the Swiss-based Roche, is not sold in pharmacies in Brussels, or in other words in Europe’s capital."
"The pharmaceutical companies are making hundreds of millions of euro by whipping the public into a frenzy."
"We are voicing our opinions on all the key European and global issues and other matters besides, but we are unable to provide minimum standards for our own citizens, even those living in the EU’s capital."
"Mr President, it is my belief that the European Commission should take decisive steps to deal with this matter."
"If it fails to do so, we will either be made to look like fools or face the risk of a potentially tragic pandemic."
"Mr President, there is a very good Sunday newspaper in Britain called ."
"Yesterday's edition was of particular interest."
"It reports that British economic growth forecasts for 2005 and 2006 are being revised downwards."
"A survey from Morgan Stanley reveals that Europe's largest companies are planning to make 40% of their investments outside the European Union."
"The reason for this is obvious."
"It is the brake on enterprise and business exerted by the ever-growing bonds of regulation and red tape from the European Union."
"A report from Open Europe and Oxford Economic Forecasting shows that the United Kingdom could increase its gross domestic product by 1.4% if it traded freely with the rest of the world, while maintaining a free trade agreement with the European Union."
"In other words, leave the European Union, but trade freely with Europe and the world."
"That, of course, is the policy of the United Kingdom Independence Party."
"Common sense may eventually prevail."
"Mr President, Ireland is the only country in Europe in which driftnet fishing of wild Atlantic salmon is allowed."
"What is happening is an absolute scandal."
"Wild Atlantic breeding stock salmon are being intercepted by driftnet fishermen as the salmon try to make their way to their natural habitat rivers."
"This applies not only to Irish rivers, but also to British, French, Spanish and Scandinavian rivers."
"As a result, the wild Atlantic salmon numbers have decreased dramatically."
"It is crystal clear that the species is under threat of extinction unless decisive action is taken."
"Unfortunately, the Irish Minister for the Marine and the Irish Government have chosen to ignore all the scientific evidence and continue to allow the scandal of driftnet fishing to continue."
"There are only 877 driftnet fishermen in Ireland."
"The Irish Government should compensate them by buying back or extinguishing their licences."
"The Commission’s DG Fisheries should insist that Ireland should do so."
"Mr President, recently, the President of the French Republic was attributing to Europe responsibilities which, legally speaking, it does not have, given that the matter in hand related to redundancies on French soil."
"We have firmly condemned a form of political irresponsibility."
"More recently, the Director-General for Economic and Financial Affairs at the Commission, Mr Klaus Regling, was claiming that the European Union should set itself the objective of reducing wages by 3.7% in order to gain 1% in growth."
"That statement, which is just as grotesque as the first example, must be condemned just as vigorously."
"The Commission would be better off making innovative proposals in order to boost consumption."
"Instead, it is choosing to go beyond its role of making proposals by truly entering into the realms of provocation."
"The code of ethics of European responsibility requires the Heads of State or Government to be clear about who does what, but it also requires the European Commission – and this is, indeed, the most basic requirement – to take its work seriously."
"Mr President, a revolution broke out in Hungary on 23 October 1956."
"The message of the revolution for posterity is threefold."
"The events of 1956 were profoundly democratic."
"The revolution involved the political participation of the entire society, it guaranteed equal human dignity for all, and proclaimed that suppressive dictatorial regimes cannot survive."
"On the other hand, it attempted to lay the foundations of a completely new political system."
"Thirdly, the revolution also had a message for Europe."
"It entered on the agenda of Europe the possibility of liquidating Communist tyranny."
"We, the Hungarian delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, declare the period up to the end of 2006 a Hungarian season, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the great Hungarian revolution."
"Mr President, poverty is silent."
"The silence of the poor can only be converted into a cry for help by those who have the necessary power and political influence."
"The sights are crying out, as well."
"The sight of hungry children on the street, of shabbily clothed elderly people and of those who sleep in the streets."
"The soundless wailing breaks the silence of St Michael’s church in Ghent, at the exhibition behind the altar."
"More than sixty-eight million people live under the poverty line in the Europe of the Twenty-five."
"However, the poverty in various Member States is not comparable."
"There is a wide gap between old and new Member States."
"The past and further extension of the EU makes this a particularly opportune time for the informal summit to also address the European social model."
"I agree that the most powerful weapon against poverty is the provision of more and better jobs."
"In a world of working adults the children would not inherit the damnation of poverty – they would inherit chances, and the elderly would be able to live in safety."
"However, this cannot be achieved without community expenditure."
"We, the Socialists, hope that the summit taking place this week will hear and amplify the voice of the poor."
"– Mr President, one of Europe's leading journalists wrote a few days ago that we are opening the gates to barbarity."
"Obviously he is right."
"He describes events in Turkey and the violence against intellectuals, journalists and so on."
"Just the other day, during the visit of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Turkey stopped the Greek MEP, Mr Varvitsiotis, from entering and held him hostage for three hours, refusing to recognise the passport which you have given us."
"Today, however, I shall speak of a different type of violence; the violence against Archbishop Okhrid, the Archbishop of FYROM."
"He has been imprisoned, his cassock has been taken away, his Bible has been taken away and he is prohibited from taking communion."
"We did not witness such barbarity even in the darkest Middle Ages."
"I therefore call on the European Parliament to send a mission to inspect the conditions under which the Archbishop is being held."
"FYROM, or whatever else it wants to call itself, cannot ask to enter here, in the European family, while its Archbishop is in prison."
"This has never happened before."
"I should therefore like, if we really want to talk about justice and human rights, for us to show that we respect human rights, for us to send a mission to examine this barbarity on the part of the country which is just a short way away from Brussels."
"– Mr President, Luxembourg, a founding Member State of the European Union, has never claimed the status of official EU language for its mother tongue, Luxemburgish."
"With the most recent enlargement, the number of official languages has increased."
"The Council of Ministers has just granted the status of official language to Irish, bringing to 21 the total number of official and working languages."
"In its conclusions of June 2005, the Council also gave its verdict on languages – I quote – whose status is recognised by the Constitution of a Member State on all or part of its territory or the use of which as a national language is authorised by law."
"With Luxemburgish having been our national language since 1984, I believe that the Council conclusions apply in this instance."
"However, Luxemburgish deserves to be given more recognition, because many people are not aware of the fact that we have our own language, in defence of which we suffered fierce repression during the Nazi occupation."
"I will be asking the European Parliament’s legal service to ascertain how this veiled recognition for the Luxemburgish language could be made public and visible in Community texts."
"Mr President, Lithuania has been a member of the European Union since 2004, which means that it should comply with the legal obligations arising under Community legislation."
"Unfortunately, this is not the case."
"One of the fundamental rights of every human being is the right to property and the right to inherit property, in particular land."
"The extent to which a country recognises this right is an indication of its level of democracy."
"After 1939, private property, and in particular land, was confiscated in Lithuania in line with Soviet law."
"After the country gained independence, the Lithuanian Constitutional Court ruled that all vacant and undeveloped land was to be returned in kind to the rightful owners or their heirs."
"Unfortunately, the Lithuanian executive and autonomous local authorities pay little attention to the sacred right to property."
"In defiance of court rulings, they have failed to return land that was seized many years ago."
"This primarily affects Poles living in Lithuania, who constitute a sizeable national minority."
"By acting in this way, Lithuania is not only violating the right to property, but also discriminating against national minorities, in this case the Polish minority."
"It is time that the relevant parliamentary committees looked into this matter."
"– Mr President, Members will know – and have been very concerned recently – that nine blind passengers were thrown off a Ryanair flight because the captain said that the limit to the number of disabled people was four per flight."
"Yet every major airline in the European Union has a completely different policy."
"This has made life for disabled passengers unbearable."
"Campaigners in my constituency have also spoken about access to goods and services; the fact that in each Member State, including in western Europe, the treatment is completely different for the owners of guide dogs, for example."
"While a lot of good work has been done in this place, we should be aware that these concerns are bubbling under the surface."
"Recent press stories have revealed many thousands of people involved in NGOs who want to see us do better."
"Finally, closer to home, we must ensure that we have inclusive design for our new Parliament buildings."
"Much good work has been done in this area, but we must emphasise it because it will come back to haunt us if we do not get it right."
"I hope we will."
"Mr President, I would like to bring to the attention of the House the problems faced by the rendering industry in the United Kingdom as a result of European Union legislation setting standards for incineration plants in the United Kingdom, namely the Waste Incineration Directive, which is now due to be implemented by the end of this year."
"I was totally amazed last week when I learned that only three of the 25 Member States are, in fact, going to implement the Directive as originally intended."
"The tallow that is being designated as a waste in these three Member States will not be considered a waste in the other Member States."
"I think this is wrong, it totally runs against the Lisbon Agenda and it is the type of thing we do badly in Europe."
"If we make a directive, and if we include a particular substance within a directive, then that directive should be implemented in all 25 Member States in the same way, together and simultaneously."
"There should not be different interpretations in different Member States."
"It is not enough to blame national governments."
"The blame starts here because we should not allow it to happen in the first place."
"Mr President, the European Commission has published a report revealing the extent of mental health problems, which affect 27% of EU citizens."
"The associated loss of productivity, together with increased health care costs, amount to around 4% of GDP."
"From a medical point of view, eradicating a disease involves both effective treatment and tackling the causes of the disease."
"In the case of neuroses and depression, the causes include both the stress induced by a relentless quest for money and the destructive liberalism currently practiced, which promotes a market that is free only in the case of monopolies and that deprives millions of people of jobs, a livelihood and an education."
"The main reason why people suffer from affective disorders, however, is because they lead a life without principles and without God."
"Such a life precludes personal growth, and makes life hell for the 60 000 people who commit suicide each year and for the countless masses of addicts dying by degrees."
"This is why it is pointless to pour billions of euro into preventive programmes unless the aim of such programmes is to safeguard genuine human dignity, the right to security in social and medical terms and growth within a healthy and loving family that lives by moral principles."
"Mr President, you reminded us that today is United Nations Day and that upholding human rights is a top priority."
"Recently, the British Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, current President of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, said there can be no negotiation about the re-creation of the caliphate; no negotiation about the imposition of Sharia law; no negotiation about the suppression of equality between the sexes or about the ending of free speech."
"He said that these values are fundamental to our civilisation and are simply not up for negotiation."
"This raises the question of why, in Iraq, the British and Americans have encouraged the adoption of a constitution which enshrines Sharia law and will severely curb the freedom of many women."
"We welcome the fact that over 70 women have been elected to the parliament in Afghanistan."
"However, the editor of a women’s rights magazine – a male editor, by the way – has been jailed for anti-Islamic articles."
"In both countries women face harassment, violent attacks, death threats and murder because they are women."
"So I hope that this Parliament will hold governments like Britain’s to their promises on sex equality, on free speech and on avoiding the imposition of Sharia law in Iraq and Afghanistan."
"Mr President, a few weeks ago, nine blind passengers, having taken their seats in London on a Ryanair aeroplane bound for Italy, were requested to take subsequent flights as there were already four disabled people checked in for the flight."
"Although the airline cites in its defence security considerations in the event of an emergency evacuation, it seems unacceptable to me to trivialise discriminatory practices of this kind."
"Among the founding values of the European Union is one in which we must take particular pride, and that is solidarity towards the weakest."
"Increased attention is being paid to disabled people and to their ability to access public buildings and services."
"It is therefore shocking that a European airline should hide behind the argument of security considerations in order to discriminate against blind passengers."
"The truth of the matter is that the excessive emphasis on keeping flight costs low no longer allows for special attention to be paid to passengers needing help: there are no staff to look after them."
"Profitability is the only goal in mind, regardless of any human feeling."
"That runs counter to humanitarian values, of which Europe can be proud."
"I wanted publicly to denounce this matter in this House."
"Mr President, the problem of inactivating pesticides, whether in Europe or in the rest of the world, has become less and less of a priority in recent years."
"International organisations active in this field are sounding the alarm bells, since the ecological time bombs that are ticking as a result of the improper storage of chemical waste represent an increasing threat."
"It is estimated that only somewhat more than 25 000 tonnes of pesticides are stockpiled in the eight Central European countries that joined the European Union in 2004."
"In the states of the former Soviet Union, however, or in other words our close and distant neighbours to the east and south, over 200 000 tonnes of obsolete and unprotected chemicals may be stockpiled, which are dispersed by the wind and washed away by rainwater."
"This means that no corner of the globe is safe from the threat."
"I would therefore call on Parliament to turn its attention to this issue, which is one that has been neglected to date."
"A detailed plan of action should be drawn up without delay, aimed at the stocktaking, identification and destruction of all stockpiles of obsolete pesticides and other hazardous chemicals."
"– I would like briefly to return to the subject of Croatia, which finally received a green light on 4 October, in the form of the positive decision to launch accession negotiations."
"With this decision, the European Union has highlighted the strategic importance of Croatia and its positive influence on the democratisation of the entire Balkans region."
"Agreement on this point was reached also by the representatives of fifteen Central and Eastern European countries at the 12th annual summit of Central and Eastern European heads of state, held in Zagreb on 14-15 October."
"The presidents expressed support for Croatia and agreed that the enlargement of the European Union must not be brought to a halt."
"Slovakia will be providing very active support to Croatia to help the country catch up with Romania and Bulgaria, which have now been conducting accession negotiations for several years."
"Slovakia will share with Croatia its experience from the pre-accession process during which it succeeded in catching up with the other accession countries, and achieved an excellent result."
"Only through an active approach to the struggle for peace in the Balkans can Europe achieve stability and security."
"Security in the Balkans means security in Europe."
"Mr President, I should like to call for measures to be taken in connection with the unjust witch-hunt conducted by the Danish media against Polish exporters of agricultural products to Denmark."
"Unsubstantiated accusations have been made public regarding the sale to Denmark of raspberries that were allegedly rotten and infected with a rare virus that causes food poisoning."
"The Danish media have set themselves up in judgment on the matter, claiming that five people have died and nearly one thousand have suffered food poisoning as a result of eating desserts containing raspberries."
"These accusations are quite clearly absurd, as proved by the fact that raspberries grown by the same companies were exported to Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Sweden, Russia and the USA, without any cases of food poisoning being reported in these countries."
"What is more, detailed checks carried out in the companies at the centre of the accusations have revealed that raspberries are grown there under model conditions."
"The Polish authorities suggested to the Danes that trade should be suspended if the raspberries were in fact found to cause food poisoning, but there has been no response from the Danish authorities."
"I fail to understand the tacit public consent of the latter."
"To date the authorities have taken no action whatsoever on this matter, and they have also failed to deny the false allegations."
"Mr President, in the course of the 20th century, Hungary wrote world history on two occasions, and played a role in world history twice."
"First in 1956, and then in 1989-90, when the country released the German refugees in the Central European transition period."
"The 1956 revolution was followed in Poland by the Solidarity movement and in 1968 by the Prague Spring."
"1956 marked a Hungarian uprising against Soviet occupation, a fight for freedom, a fight for national independence, and at the same time a fight against Communist dictatorship."
"Without the 1956 revolution there would not have been a negotiated revolution in 1989 or a peaceful regime change in Hungary, and Hungary would not be a member of the EU today."
"In the words of Albert Camus: ‘Hungary conquered and in chains has done more for freedom and justice than any other people in the world in the past twenty years.’"
"– Mr President, last week formations of Turkish fighter planes repeatedly and provocatively violated Cypriot airspace."
"At the same time, the Turkish army occupying Northern Cyprus has continued to strengthen its foothold on the island by increasing and enhancing its forces with more sophisticated American-made heavy weaponry."
"These grossly illegal actions are causing much concern to the civilian population, risk causing a dangerous confrontation with Cyprus’ defences and are seriously undermining efforts to achieve long-lasting peace in the region."
"Will the President of this Parliament have the determination to send a strong message to the Ankara Government, telling it in no uncertain terms to stop violating the integrity of an EU Member State and start making an effort to behave like a civilised nation at last?"
"Or, should we all just accept and resign ourselves to what many ordinary people in the street think, namely that the EU is just a big business, making more money for the big Member States, and does not give tuppence about the safety and wellbeing of the smaller Member States?"
"Mr President, at the last part-session our Parliament expressed its solidarity with the victims of the terrible earthquake that shook Pakistan and of the floods in Central America."
"This weekend, Hurricane Wilma, the most devastating Mexico has ever seen, struck that country leaving chaos, destruction and death in its wake."
"Mr President, I have spoken with the Chairperson of the Delegation to this Parliament’s EU-Mexico Joint Parliamentary Committee, Mrs Erika Mann and, although she is going to speak officially about this, we have agreed that it would be appropriate for you, on behalf of our House, to express our solidarity to the Mexican authorities at this difficult time and also to ask the European Commission to consider ― given that Mexico is a positive and active partner of the European Union — the possibility of contributing to the humanitarian aid tasks of reconstruction and rehabilitation that are needed in order to alleviate the effects of the floods in that country."
"My presentation is devoted to the activities and staffing of the European Parliament’s information office in Bratislava, Slovakia."
"In April 2004, the Directorate-General for Personnel and Administration announced open competitions for two posts, one in category A9 and the other in category A12."
"Unbelievably, these two positions were reduced to just one in the course of the proceedings, and the only position that was ultimately granted was that of category A9 for the head of the Information Office."
"In the meantime, the candidate for the category A12 position was successful."
"Both the selection method and the irresponsible manner in which the D-G for Personnel announced the result deserve criticism."
"Our candidate was notified of the result after a four-month delay."
"The second problem is as follows: at this time, the information office has only three permanent members of staff and one temporary member of staff."
"Why cannot the information office in Slovakia be staffed in the same way as in other Member States?"
"We urge that adequate conditions be created in Slovakia to better inform our citizens about the activities of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I wonder whether it would be appropriate at this time to congratulate Mr Lech Kaczyński, the Polish Law and Justice Party and the Polish people on the election of President Kaczyński in Poland on Sunday."
"I also take the opportunity to congratulate our own colleague in this House, Mr Michał Tomasz Kamiński, who I believe played a major role in both the successful parliamentary campaign and the successful presidential campaign in Poland."
"I urge you to pass our congratulations on to President Kaczyński."
"That concludes Question Time."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Doris Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an integrated action programme in the field of lifelong learning (COM(2004)0474 C6-0095/2004 2004/0153(COD)] (A6–0267/2005)."
". Mr President, may I express my warmest thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Pack; to the Committee on Culture and Education, and to all who contributed to this excellent report."
"I would like to thank Mrs Pack in particular for the commitment and expertise she has brought to the report."
"In the present political climate our policies need more than ever to be directly relevant to citizens’ real needs."
"Education and training is where the benefits of European integration are directly felt by millions of citizens."
"Therefore, I am very grateful also for Mr Böge’s report for the temporary committee on the financial perspective."
"It is an important statement of support in a difficult financial context."
"My thanks are due also to the rapporteurs of the other committees that contributed opinions on this Commission proposal."
"Let me comment briefly on the amendments proposed in this report."
"I am pleased to say that the Commission is able to accept, either word for word or in substance, 39 of the 79 amendments proposed by Parliament."
"These changes improve the text, either by introducing new elements and priorities or by clarifying existing ones."
"There are 16 amendments which, I regret, the Commission cannot accept because they either go beyond Community competence or are not compatible with the structure of the programme, four of which relate to the Parliament’s resolution."
"That leaves a further 20 amendments which raise some substantial issues on which I would like to comment."
"Regarding amendments which derogate from the Financial Regulation or its implementing rules, four amendments to the annex to the decision – amendments 67, 68, 69 and 71 – would derogate from the existing implementing rules for the European Union budget."
"They would introduce the sort of simplification identified as necessary by the Commission in its explanatory memorandum to the programme proposal, such as extending the use of lump sums or lump-sum grants, reducing the administrative requirements on applicants for small grants and so on. So we have no argument with the substance of these amendments."
"However, the Commission believes that such provisions should initially be sought by revising the Financial Regulation and its implementing rules themselves."
"Changing the Community financial framework in sectoral programmes makes this framework much harder to read and to understand."
"Therefore, the Commission believes it is too early to include such provisions in the decision on lifelong learning."
"On the named institutions: the new programme will support the operating costs of some institutions which do high-quality work in education and training at European level and which are important partners for the European Union."
"The prime criterion for their selection will be quality."
"This means using calls for proposals where the grounds for selection are set out in advance and every applicant can measure itself against these criteria."
"Exceptionally, the Commission has proposed four institutions as eligible for operating grant support without a call for proposals."
"These four involve Member State governments in their governance and funding."
"Government involvement guarantees an important degree of quality and of commitment to the objectives, purpose and future development of these designated institutions."
"Looking at the six institutions Parliament proposes for nomination, the Commission concludes that the European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education, which has intergovernmental funding and governance arrangements, is consistent with the logic of our original proposal."
"Therefore, we accept the amendment to this effect."
"Briefly, on the budgetary amendments: a group of amendments relate to the budget of the programme."
"I am most grateful, as I have said, for the rapporteur’s proposal to increase the budget to EUR 14 600 million, and I can fully subscribe to her underlying reasons."
"However, the Commission cannot, pending an agreement on the Financial Perspectives, amend its original proposal, so I must reserve the position on the 10 amendments concerned."
"Finally, in order for the programme to start on time, the decision needs to be made and adopted as soon as possible in 2006."
"I know this is a challenging timetable and depends very much on the timing of an agreement on the Financial Perspective, but I can assure you the Commission will do everything it can to help this Parliament and the Council reach agreement rapidly."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that the programme exists in its present form, having been influenced by all the experience we have had with the Socrates programme over the past ten years, and with the attempt having been made to avoid the old mistakes and go down new paths."
"Even so, as there are, proverbially, many roads that lead to Rome, this House has included even more new approaches, and we should try to take a good look at all of them at least once."
"Let me explain, for the sake of completeness, what sub-programmes we are dealing with here: the programme has to do, overall, with general and vocational education, and it is a good thing that vocational education is now included."
"The programme enables everyone to take part in educational programmes virtually from the cradle to the grave."
"The first programme open to all is ‘Comenius’."
"It is aimed at those who have to attend school in any case; to those for whom school attendance is mandatory, it gives the opportunity to discover at an early age what is meant by cultural differences, or a common approach, to particular issues in different countries."
"Next comes the Erasmus programme, which gives these pupils the opportunity, once they have become students, to spend part of their course in another European country and to take their achievements there back home with them."
"Running in parallel to that is the Leonardo programme, which enables apprentices and trainees to complete part of their training in the form of a work placement in another European country."
"The fourth programme, ‘Grundtvig’, deals with the education of adults, and the fifth, named after Jean Monnet, provides support."
"This involves the celebrated institutions to which you referred, and to which we want to add two more."
"I hope that Parliament will agree to this."
"We do, however, want to continue to support the Jean Monnet chairs and all those things for which your programme already makes provision."
"There are also the horizontal programmes in support of these activities, which overlap with the sectoral programmes that have already been mentioned, particularly in the development of material for language learning, learning and the dissemination of best practice in general and vocational education at national, regional and local level."
"We have made further improvements to your proposals and have, in particular, emphasised that the Comenius partnerships should enable one pupil in fifteen, rather than one in twenty, to spend a school year abroad, which would add up to a total of 6 million pupils in junior secondary school having the possibility of spending a year as guest students at a school in another EU country."
"Together with my fellow-members of the Committee for Culture and Education, I have also ensured that teachers’ European awareness can be enhanced through the new Comenius Regio programme."
"We have also proposed that the Erasmus programme’s mobility grant, which has remained unchanged since 1993, should be increased, for EUR 150 is an insufficient sum of money with which to go and live and study in another country, and makes support from parents, grandparents and relatives indispensable."
"We should, however, be enabling all students to take part in an exchange of this kind, and so we suggest that the monthly grant should be increased by rather more than the Commission has suggested."
"It is of course as important to me as it is to the Commission that there should be a decent reduction in the amount of red tape involved."
"Administrative and financial constraints on the award and payment of grants must be commensurate with the amount paid out."
"Let me briefly consider the issue of finance."
"Only indicative figures have been given for the financial resources we are talking about today."
"Nobody knows how much we will have at our disposal after 2007; that is why the figures – the Commission’s, the Böge Committee’s and our own Committee’s – are no more than indications."
"We have to wait and see what we will get from the next Presidency of the Council, and so the Culture Committee has taken the liberty of going beyond the figures proposed by the Commission, and also a bit beyond those agreed by the Böge Committee."
"We should put down a marker; education and training are a vital part of the Lisbon process."
"We need them, and in order to have them we need more money than the national governments in the European Union are prepared to make available."
"Many thanks, Commissioner, for the work your staff have done!"
"Mr President, I should like to discuss the report from the point of view of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on behalf of which I drew up an opinion."
"I argued that there should be a gradual opening-up of the various programmes to all of our neighbourhood policy countries."
"It has been proposed that they should be opened up to a number of neighbourhood countries but, given the very good work these programmes have done in encouraging the strengthening of people-to-people contacts, a general consensus should be reached on opening up these programmes more widely, where this can be done effectively."
"I am keen to ensure that the Erasmus Mundus programme will be continued under this heading post-2009, together with the inter-university programme set up last year, which aims to develop democracy and understanding between our various countries."
"One of the obvious failings of the current proposals, in my view, was the almost complete lack of any reference to developing democratic citizenship."
"Mention was made of citizenship, but I felt that there was a lack of emphasis on the democratic role."
"Given that the Commission and the Council had already accepted that this was a necessity and had already agreed to set up the inter-university programme in Venice, this should be supported."
"I am disappointed that there appears to be a dispute between two Commission DGs as to who should fund this programme in the future."
"I hope that the problem can be resolved as a matter of urgency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the opinion of the Committee on Budgets gives a welcome to the Commission’s proposed programme for lifelong learning, which encompasses the four great programmes – Erasmus, Comenius, Leonardo and Grundtvig – and it is founded upon the fundamental conviction that the value of these programmes in terms of structural change in Europe is not to be underestimated and that they play an essential part in European renewal."
"In our opinion, we welcome the proposal’s intention to simplify administration and financial procedures, while criticising the fact that they are still too burdensome and too slow."
"We have to point out that the budget figures are provisional, but the Committee on Budgets does take the view that the amounts proposed by the Commission for this vitally important priority area cannot be regarded as other than very modest."
"Formal comment on what the Commission has proposed is one thing, but the vote, which is a political matter, will be far more to do with the need to move on in this area and achieve Europe’s vital educational policy goals."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for whose opinion I am the draftsman, is in favour of the Commission’s initiative for the Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci programmes and, in particular, of integrating higher vocational training into the Erasmus programme."
"Bringing the two together in this way signals our desire not to single out students according to their field of study, be it academic and general, or vocational."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, on the quality of her report and thank her for having taken account of the greater part of the opinions of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in particular as regards lifelong education and training, which together are acknowledged as being one of the keys to growth and as guaranteeing the quality of jobs."
"Lifelong training should be a right and should be the specific responsibility of businesses, and these factors should be recognised at Community level as a fundamental social right."
"Thanks to these programmes, a European space for training and education is gradually being created, and we have a great need of this space to support the labour market."
"We need greater harmonisation and convergence of qualifications, and we need the skills of European employees to be guaranteed throughout the EU, and thus rewarded appropriately."
"This seems to us to be an effective guarantee against social dumping."
". Mr President, the Committee on Civil Liberties would also like to express its gratitude to the rapporteur who has been involved in the parliamentary works on this topic for years."
"Our committee believes that the right to education is one of the most important fundamental human rights, and no one should be prevented from exercising this right by financial status, poverty or discrimination; also, we must continue to demand equal treatment."
"Equal treatment for different generations, for the non-young, for women, and especially for single mothers, and in this respect we naturally expect an understanding attitude from employers, as well, who must treat life-long education as a strategic interest."
"We expect that ethnic discrimination will come to an end and those living with disabilities will be able to participate in the education process with full rights."
"For us this is a community programme that brings the EU closer to its citizens and the citizens closer to one another, which is the reason why we love this programme."
". Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Pack not only on her excellent report, but also on her personal commitment to promoting the mobility of young Europeans."
"The Erasmus programme owes a great deal to her tenacity, and the budget increase that she is calling for fully reflects her commitment."
"Furthermore, I should like to remind you of the speech made by Mr Barroso in Berlin and of the speeches made by all of the group leaders within Parliament as part of the 70 cents for culture campaign, all of whom promised an increase in the ‘culture’ budgets."
"Three remarks need to be made on the subject of the reform as it is presented to us."
"The internal market would be more competitive and businesses more mobile if young apprentices were better prepared for being mobile."
"The protectionist instincts of many small-scale businesses would be thwarted by the practical experience that the Leonardo da Vinci programme gives to young people by allowing them to carry out work placements in other countries."
"The budget estimate that has been made for 150 000 apprentices is insufficient."
"The Erasmus programme is too elitist, as the sums allocated to the recipients are not enough to fund the total cost of their mobility."
"The only people who are therefore eligible for this programme are students whose parents can pay the remaining sum, unless the Member States assume responsibility for doing so, which is not the case at present."
"Finally, university students would be more mobile if the Council tackled the real problems, namely those relating to the transferability of grants, students’ status, their social security and the right to work, which are all issues that could be addressed, given that they were mentioned in the Commission Green Paper of 1996."
"The Commissioner will perhaps be able to inform us as to how the work is progressing."
"Mr President, culture is priceless, but it does come at a cost."
"If we want to give Europe a soul, funding has to be granted."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be supporting Mrs Pack’s proposal."
". Mr President, Commissioner, we ought perhaps to rename the ‘lifelong learning’ programme ‘learning throughout life’, for ‘lifelong’ has the ring of punishment about it, and learning should, after all, be a joy."
"Although this programme is an educational one whose components – Comenius, Erasmus, Grundtvig and so on – address different priorities, the one thing these all have in common is that they promote mobility, and enhance quality, giving recognition for achievement and education, for multilingualism and knowledge of other countries."
"In so doing, they add value to Europe."
"These things are precisely what we need to achieve – or at least to get closer to – the Lisbon objective by 2010, that being to have 3 million Erasmus students and 150 000 Leonardo participants."
"While I agree with Mrs Pack that the grant for Erasmus students needs to be increased, that must not result in those Member States that top up scholarships from national funds – as Austria does, for example – reducing their contributions; on the contrary, they should adapt to the new requirements."
"In the EU, 25% of the population have a university degree, and 75% a certificate of completed secondary education."
"Many of the citizens have completed vocational training, although it is unfortunate – and something I wish to criticise now – that the Lisbon documents include no figures on them."
"Mobility at work or in the course of initial training involves many administrative and linguistic obstacles, and so the Leonardo programme urgently needs more support and promotion; what is needed is not a new Erasmus programme for trainees, but a Leonardo programme that works properly, and if it is to do that, more funding needs to be provided."
"We are waiting in eager anticipation for the individual Member States’ Lisbon action plans, while being no less eager to find out what is in the Financial Perspective and the budget proposals for all these programmes for 2007."
"What is clear is that it would be a disaster for the students, school pupils, teachers, and trainees, just as much as for cultural organisations, artists and young people if the beginning of the new generations of programmes were to be delayed; it would also be in flagrant contradiction to the Lisbon Strategy."
". Mr President, let me start by complementing Mrs Pack."
"If we want to bring Europe together, it is through education that we are most likely to be able to do so."
"We have here the most diverse range of educational initiatives, which promote the exchange of knowledge and skills between the European states, make it easier for citizens from different cultures to meet one another and provide them with support in learning languages, above all the languages of their neighbours."
"I particularly approve of the attempt to bring the various measures under one roof, am glad to see the Balkan states being made eligible for grants, and welcome the explicit intention to support initiatives for political education."
"I do think, though, that there is room for further improvement, in that more account needs to be taken of those who are socially disadvantaged and in that procedures need to be simplified – and let me observe that not all the difficulties are of the EU’s making."
"I have practical experience of running projects, in the course of which I discovered that the problems in the Member States themselves are often even worse than at EU level."
"What I do not agree with is the cuts made to the Leonardo programme."
"I am opposed to any reduction in funding for vocational education."
"The fact that practical training costs more than purely theoretical education cannot be a reason for cutting funding for it."
"It is both dishonest and inconsistent to announce 2006 as the European Year of Job Mobility while at the same time making funding cuts."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon Strategy, as formulated after the spring Council, subjects education to the needs of the market and emphasises lifelong learning and education solely as a means of promoting low-paid permanent jobs."
"Constant calls are being made for greater private investment in the sector of scientific research in order to serve the needs of big business."
"At the same time, innovation and novelty are not orientated towards promoting technology and the quality of life."
"The Lisbon Strategy formulated overlooks the increased need for public spending on and investment in education, for bursaries and for detailed programmes for lifelong learning supporting informal education which, at the same time, are not accessible to a large slice of the population."
"The extension of lifelong learning, in cooperation with the business element is one of the basic objectives set by Lisbon."
"With this programme, universities will open their doors for the purpose of specialising workers in new professions, who will then provide cheap manpower for businesses which invest their money in the university in question."
"This will create a vicious circle for young people, who will be dismissed and then, once they have been retrained, will be recruited as cheap workers in new professions."
"It proves that the Commission's objective is not lifelong learning; it is lifelong exploitation."
"To conclude, it is obvious that, if these policies are implemented, we shall basically start making education subject to the whims of enterprises and sacrificing it to competitiveness and profit."
"It will mean the subjection of research to the commands and needs of businesses and a reduction in the state's contribution."
"We consider that the Member States of the Union can develop education and lifelong learning without it being coloured by speculation and unilateral adherence to the so-called needs of the market and to competitiveness."
"That is why the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left cannot vote in favour of the proposal to establish a programme in the field of lifelong learning."
". – I welcome the Commission's efforts to integrate and simplify European educational programmes and would like to draw your attention to the amendments submitted by our rapporteur Doris Pack, which not only underline the necessity to ensure the continuity of life-long learning, but also the need for an increase in funding for European programmes, including Erasmus."
"This would, above all, take into account the number of participants in this programme, which has increased and continues to grow."
"In addition we cannot disagree with the proposal that the average grant be increased from 210 Euros to 300 Euros by 2007 at the end of the programme."
"Given the EU's changed national linguistic diversity, we cannot disagree with the proposal to create more flexible opportunities to study at least two languages."
"I also trust that you will take into account an amendment which I have submitted, stating that we would like the European Humanities University that was exiled from Belarus, but was reopened two weeks ago in Vilnius, to become a candidate for priority funding."
"The Union for Europe of the Nations approves Doris Pack's report."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in a time of important and fundamental changes at both European and global level, it is only natural for the Committee on Culture and Education and the European Parliament to also evince a great deal of interest in an integrated programme of action in the field of lifelong learning."
"The Lisbon Strategy reiterates the objectives of education adapted to new technologies, to multilingualism, to diversity and to reinforcing programmes."
"Within this framework, particular importance is also attached to the mobility of students, school exchanges and the cross-border mobility of teachers."
"Encouraging the teaching and learning of two foreign languages and increasing grants for participants with disabilities and the learning and use of sign language are fundamental proposals by the rapporteur, Doris Pack."
"However, over and above all this, I should also like to highlight the obligation of the European Parliament to support particular aspects of specific amendments, especially in the field of the budget for special programmes, so that, in this way, we can demonstrate our awareness of the need to defend the history of cultures with the need for knowledge and the education of citizens."
"Furthermore, we must not forget that nowadays the demands for highly trained manpower are a necessary precondition to the strengthening of competitiveness."
"Adapting the education policies of the Member States to the prospects of lifelong learning reiterates and confirms that education is the cornerstone of the Lisbon Strategy and also contributes to social and economic development."
"– Mr President, the Erasmus, Leonardo, Comenius, Gruntwig and other programmes have been crowned with real success and are, perhaps, the most popular and publicly known programmes of the European Union."
"They not only have contributed to the modernisation of education and training systems, but also are contributing more than anything else to the strengthening of exchanges between young people in particular, helping them to come into direct contact with the language, culture and education of other countries of Europe."
"That is why it is extremely important for these programmes to be extended to as many more young and, more importantly, less privileged people as possible."
"Pupil exchanges within the framework of the Comenius programme must cover at least one in fifteen pupils of the programme."
"At the same time, the amount of Erasmus grants needs to be doubled, given that it has remained stagnant since 1993 and is too low to meet the needs, mainly, of less well-off students, as our rapporteur, Mrs Pack, has quite rightly called for."
"It is therefore necessary for the budget to be increased, in order to respond to the aspirations of European citizens, and for us to put the ambitious objectives of the Lisbon Strategy into practice."
"There is increasing talk of a crisis in the European Union."
"Since we know that we will only be able to overcome the problems of the modern world and the challenges of globalisation with a strong Community, we must make constant efforts to preserve cohesion between the nations of this Community."
"We may be greatly assisted in this by the very programmes offered by the report on lifelong learning."
"Our future lies in the young people who will soon be making decisions on politics, economics and all the other aspects of our life."
"It is therefore all the more important that as many young people as possible are involved in international education programmes even at an early stage of their education."
"In this way they also become much more motivated to learn languages, to get to know other countries and to display greater tolerance towards other nations and cultures."
"At the same time, we have found that those countries that have invested greater funds in education have advanced more rapidly and now rank amongst the most highly-developed countries."
"I therefore support rapporteur Doris Pack in her efforts to secure more money than hitherto in the financial perspective for education."
"The rapporteur is also trying to secure support for people with special needs, who are important and equal members of our society."
"Given that we wish to be a community with social sensitivity, we must devote special attention to them."
"It is also equally important to involve as many small- and medium-sized enterprises as possible in these projects, as well as people with vocational education, in order to motivate them for lifelong learning and help them to acquire new and useful expertise."
"Since an additional benefit of the European Union is the fact that our nations can learn from each other, I support cooperation and mobility in the area of lifelong learning, which is becoming both a need and a reality for people in all walks of life."
"Mr President, every year, thousands of students from the whole of Europe are given the opportunity to study abroad, thanks to the programmes we are now talking about."
"For many students, these exchanges are, in actual fact, the most practical advantage of the whole EU project."
"By studying abroad, they not only gain new knowledge and new experiences of another culture, but also disseminate knowledge and in that way help increase the quality of European education which, in turn, is one of the cornerstones of the Lisbon process."
"Through tomorrow’s vote, we shall simplify the administrative routines, which may lead to quite a few schools and universities participating more actively in the programmes and encouraging more students to study abroad."
"I am also pleased that, during this process, we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have protested against the proposed cuts in vocational education and training desired by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and that we have also supported continuing to provide plenty of opportunities for people who have already completed their professional education to study abroad."
"Vocational education and training do in actual fact make a very important contribution to the EU economy and to the way in which the labour market operates."
"Thus, encouragement needs also to be given to people who have completed their professional education to move around more. It should not only be those at university who get to study abroad."
"Where funding is concerned, I should also be delighted to contribute money to these programmes but, at the same time, I think that all the budget issues should be dealt with simultaneously so that we really are forced to prioritise what is important."
"I shall therefore support those amendments that are in keeping with Parliament’s report on the budget as a whole, that is to say the Böge report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current debate centres on an initiative backed by representatives of all the relevant parliamentary committees, whatever their political persuasion."
"This is because most of us understand that the proposed integrated action programme is one of the steps that must be taken if the European Union is to become an advanced knowledge-based society with sustainable economic growth, more and better jobs, greater cohesion and stronger culture."
"I must stress, however, that in my opinion it is essential for each Member State to draw up its own national lifelong learning strategy if the lifelong learning system is to function effectively."
"The financial instruments under debate today are and will be necessary for the implementation of these strategies."
"It goes without saying that they are also indispensable for the successful implementation of the various components of the action programme, and I therefore fully support the rapporteur’s calls for more funding for this initiative."
"One of the many reasons why this proposal deserves our support is that it makes provision for the mobility of individual secondary school students and adult learners by introducing new types of mobility action into the Comenius and Grundtvig sub-programmes, and provides new opportunities to make contributions in kind to the implementation of projects."
"Those involved in organising lifelong learning programmes and applying for funding under the associated financial instruments will undoubtedly welcome any reduction in the red tape associated with these procedures."
"I therefore support the proposal to simplify administrative procedures according to the level of grant."
"Education is cited in key EU documents as a crucial component of future prosperity and growth."
"Without adequate funding, however, the latter goals will remain out of our reach, and will never make it off the drawing board, as is the case in a number of Member States."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur for her work."
"Mr President, allow me first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, on the work she has done on this subject, so important for the future of the European Union."
"I should just like to say a few words to point out that the vote within the Committee on Culture and Education has enabled significant progress to be made, in particular with regard to the mobility of apprentices."
"The specific conditions attaching to the status of apprentices are today preventing these apprentices from fully participating in the Community mobility plan."
"Only 0.15% of a given age group in France and 1% in Germany today benefit from the Leonardo da Vinci programme."
"The vote within the Committee on Culture and Education represents significant qualitative progress, as it has made eligible for this programme the support measures taken by all of the organisations involved in promoting the mobility of apprentices."
"Such progress should enable the objective set by the European Commission – that of securing at least 150 000 work placements by 2013 – to be achieved."
"We are hopeful that this progress will not be called into question."
"Mobility of young people – and particularly of apprentices – in vocational training constitutes one of the tools enabling a real spirit of enterprise and innovation to be created in Europe."
"This is one of the prerequisites for achieving the objectives set by the Heads of State or Government as part of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Mr President, the EU’s educational programmes have been reoriented."
"Erasmus, Comenius, Comenius Regio for secondary schools, Grundtvig and Leonardo are part of the integrated action programme called ‘Lifelong Learning’ ‘L L L’, which Mrs Prets will find easy to remember!"
"Although I congratulate Mrs Pack on her report, in which she attempts to strike a balance between the various sectoral sub-programmes rather than playing them off against each other, I have to say that the Committee on Culture’s proposal that only 23% of the lifelong learning programme be allocated to Leonardo, rather than the 25% as originally envisaged, is a cause of disquiet among trainees, chambers of crafts and stakeholders in vocational education."
"If the present 45 000 work placements per annum are to become 70 000 or even – as the institution represented by the Commissioner has proposed – rather more than 100 000, a solid financial foundation will be needed."
"Leonardo gives long-term support to vocational education, makes individuals more empowered and, as Mrs Pack pointed out, is fully in line with the objectives of the new Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment."
"The first all-clear signal is that students’ work placements are no longer to be run through Leonardo, but through Erasmus, so there alone – in a vitally important area – we are saving some EUR 600 million."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises are also to be more closely involved in Leonardo than they were before."
"As I have pointed out in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and also in conversations with businesses and interested parties, the fact is that the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 has not yet been adopted, and so it may well come to pass – and I can tell Commissioner Figeľ that I hope, for both our sakes, that it does – that there will be substantially more money available for Leonardo than was the case in the past."
"The reason why these EU education programmes are so effective is, after all, because those involved take to them immediately, and because the programmes make language, culture and different educational values visible and can therefore persuade the public of the added value that a European orientation can provide."
"I would like to reiterate my thanks not only for the support, but also for the truly constructive atmosphere during the discussions."
"This shows the kind of maturity that is needed in order for education and vocational training to be put at the centre of European Union policy and cooperation among Member States."
"There are some suggestions and remarks that I would like to make."
"We must realise that it is still premature to comment on budget figures, although the initial level of political support has been very strong."
"Thanks to the position adopted by Parliament, both the budget and the two budget-funded programmes for culture and youth are receiving strong support, and this is giving rise to the expectation that they will be successful areas for future cooperation within the enlarged Union."
"An appeal to launch programmes for third countries is also under way."
"The programme itself is expected to receive 1% of the total amount budgeted for cooperation with other countries."
"These countries are as yet unnamed, but I would like to stress that just as Erasmus Mundus has included and will continue to include cooperation with third countries, the Tempus and Tempus+ programmes will also provide for such cooperation."
"Several speakers referred to lifelong learning as a right."
"This represents a great change."
"We are striving to create the systems, conditions, strategies and programmes for lifelong education in the Member States, and to ensure participation and a real place for people within this system."
"By comparison, although there is considerable scepticism and apathy in Europe, there are continents where the debate is still focussed on the fundamental right to basic education, while we are now talking about the right to lifelong learning."
"This provides an excellent example of cooperation among the States."
"From the standpoint of vocational courses or training, the ‘Copenhagen’ process and the Bologna process are now much more visible."
"I am convinced that the current proposal to introduce the European Qualification Framework, which is the subject of consultations with the Member States, will give a great boost to mobility and to the recognition of qualifications."
"I would also like to reiterate what has been said by Mr Thomas Mann, that part of the quota for the placement of university students in companies will be shifted from the current Leonardo da Vinci programme to the Erasmus quota under the future programme."
"This is something that also deserves notice."
"I would like to conclude with a few words concerning the institutions mentioned by Mr Pavilionis – institutions earmarked for support."
"If the European Parliament and the Council reach a consensus, the Commission can support the inclusion of institutions in the list of nominees."
"In the European Inter-University Centre in Venice discussions are taking place on how to adapt the regulation on human rights, and we want to be prepared for the future and to find a solution that will enable the continuation of financing for this institution."
"This is basically all I wanted to discuss."
"I am pleased to note that education has become a matter of consensus between the committees, as well as between political groups and individuals."
"This is a sound premise for success."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The development towards a knowledge-based society makes high demands on the educational level of the labour force."
"Given the current economic climate, emergence of new economic competitors, investing in people becomes even more important."
"Lifelong learning has therefore a key role in developing an integrated strategy for employment and particularly for promoting a well-trained workforce which is able to adapt to the continuously changing market environment."
"If managed pragmatically, the integrated approach will result in economic growth, greater civic participation, higher welfare."
"The action programme has in itself more chances then pure economic benefits: it has also potential to fulfil the goals and ambitions of Member States to create tolerant and democratic societies, reduce inequalities and prevent marginalization, to participate in building a gender-balanced, better society."
"The comprehensive, and integrated programme of lifelong learning is vital for achieving the Lisbon objectives."
"The coherence and synergy makes it even more efficient."
"The success lies in ensuring the accessibility to the opportunities for all European citizen at all levels."
"The next item is the report by Mrs Gröner, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council creating the ‘Youth in Action’ programme for the period 2007-2013 (COM(2004)0471 – C6 0096/2004 – 2004/0152(COD)) (A6-0263/2005)."
". Mr President, the second of the programmes tonight and the third one later on show the special interest of the European Parliament in supporting areas where we believe that kind of new momentum is to be addressed for the future of Europe."
"The Commission adopted its proposal for the ‘Youth in Action’ programme in July last year."
"Parliament, and especially the Committee on Culture and Education, has always been supportive of initiatives in favour of youth."
"The negotiations which took place this year have confirmed this and today we are going to discuss an excellent report which is the result of fruitful cooperation."
"I would especially like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Gröner, for this cooperation and the leading position she has adopted in preparation for successful decisions."
"The ‘Youth in Action’ programme is designed to ensure continuity of current activities in the field of youth but also to develop them further."
"It is a programme of informal learning and mobility which will allow young people between the ages of 13 and 30 to get involved in projects developing solidarity and citizenship."
"These are the cement for European unity, mainly through youth exchanges, the European Voluntary Service and projects related to participative democracy."
"As you know the details of the programme, I shall not reflect on them but, rather, give the Commission’s view on some important amendments."
"I am pleased to say that after the good exchange of views and cooperation up until now, most of your proposed amendments can be supported without reserve by the Commission."
"Few amendments, mainly those seeking to introduce more detail into Article 8, cannot be supported."
"Article 8 is about the implementing provision and the establishment of national agencies which will be responsible for the management of the programme at national level."
"The Commission’s text sets out only general requirements in line with the principle of subsidiarity."
"It will be up to the Member States’ authorities to implement these requirements according to national situations."
"I would like to comment on some very important amendments on which the Commission agrees."
"Mrs Gröner’s report, while not suggesting changing the age brackets proposed by the Commission, insists on ensuring that the main target group of the programme will be 15- to 28-year-olds."
"I very much share any concern over the participation in the programme of young people with fewer opportunities and the prevention of discrimination in terms of access to the programme."
"This aspect may not have been sufficiently highlighted in our proposal."
"However, the implementation of the programme is flexible enough to accommodate the specific needs of young people with fewer opportunities."
"We also understand that Parliament would like to ensure that the different actions of the programme benefit from minimal financial allocation."
"This approach is fully compatible with the flexibility required for the implementation of the programme and the Commission is therefore prepared to take on board proposed distribution among different actions."
"The report’s proposal to increase the programme’s budget shows the European Parliament’s commitment once again to a programme that directly addresses young people and thus contributes to bringing younger generations closer to Europe."
"I must stress that the financial issues are all subject to the outcome of the negotiations relating to the financial perspectives."
"Finally, I wish to express my satisfaction at the proposed reference in the programme to the European Youth Week."
"I am also very pleased to see that, once more, the European Parliament will be directly involved in Youth Week, which includes the ‘The Youth takes the floor’ event in Brussels."
"Youth Week will take place in early December 2005 and I am particularly grateful for the participation of President Borrell and for the arrangements made for hearing young people in this Parliament."
"To conclude, I wish to thank Mrs Gröner once again for the quality of the report."
"I believe that the ‘Youth in Action’ programme is widely supported by this assembly, and I thank you for that."
"I hope that the next step will be the adoption of a partial political agreement in the next Council meeting in November."
". Mr President, Commissioner, there is much agreement in this House where your proposals are concerned."
"Cooperation has been excellent."
"We have heard what young people have been saying to us, first through the European elections and then through the referendums."
"If we want to make a success of European policy, it is with young people that we have to start."
"The new ‘Youth in Action’ programme gives pride of place to the promotion of active citizenship, and the 73 amendments that this House has put forward are intended to make some further improvements to your proposal."
"We want to respond to what young people themselves told us in the course of the consultation process, and in so doing we are taking the most important step, namely fostering solidarity and mutual understanding among young people, supporting the new neighbourhood policy and bringing together the various interested parties at national, regional and European level."
"As regards the five actions comprised in the new programme, and which you, Commissioner, have just outlined, we have proposed – in contrast to ‘Lifelong Learning’ – that minimum funding be provided for each individually, with at least 30% of the budget going to traditional youth exchange in Action 1, 23% to the European Voluntary Service, and 4% to the new ‘Youth for the World’ action, which does of course have a similar end in view, not to mention 15% for Action 4, ‘Youth workers and support systems’, and at least 4% for support for policy cooperation, which includes Youth Week."
"Those who are any good at mental arithmetic will have figured out that some 24% of the overall budget is left over, and this is in order to give the Commission flexibility and to make it possible for more to be set aside for Youth Week in one year and to do more for voluntary service or direct youth exchange in another."
"It is vitally important that flexibility should be built in."
"What we also require of the Commission, though, is that this programme be made less bureaucratic."
"We want the youth associations to be able to plan ahead with confidence, to be able to plan for periods of several years rather than for only one."
"We want them to get the money without delay and for no more than four months at the most to elapse between the application being made and the money being paid out."
"This sort of flexibility makes a positive impact on associations, particularly on the smaller youth associations, and enables us to achieve our objectives."
"As you have mentioned, we want, as before, to prioritise the original age group for participants."
"The focus should therefore not be on the borderline cases, the thirteen and thirty-year-olds, who might perhaps be able to take part under special circumstances, but should, as before, be on the core group of those aged between 15 and 18."
"We would like to see a rather larger budget; to give one example, I find it incredible that we, in the European Union, spend EUR 6.5 billion on subsidising sugar production, but, when it comes to learning throughout life, youth exchanges, and culture, our investment still amounts to peanuts."
"It is for that reason that Parliament advocates, for ‘Youth in Action’, an increase in funding and the relaxation of the constraints of the Böge report to EUR 1.128 billion."
"I regard that as modest enough, and we have to set down clear markers here."
"Anti-discrimination policy and youth seminars get a good reception from young people and our amendments are intended to put them centre stage, along with the involvement of disadvantaged young people and the opportunity for all young people to participate, not merely theoretically, but also in practice, irrespective of their nationality or race, of their gender or sexual identity, of where they live, of what they do for a living, or even of whether they are out of work."
"This is about the building up of intellectual activity, linguistic skills and intercultural learning and their implementation in practice."
"Ought young people not be at least as much worth to us as a fraction of what is spent on subsidising the cultivation of tobacco?"
"I intend to make a nuisance of myself, particularly to the Council, for as long as it takes for a change of mind to kick in."
"It is not enough to conclude a Youth Pact; it also has to be implemented!"
"That is the first step."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me say that the Committee on Budgets holds Mrs Gröner in high regard for her work and also for incorporating the figures from the Böge report in her own."
"We stand right behind these figures."
"It is because culture gains nothing from a weakened rapporteur or from an enfeebled parliament in which different figures are used virtually every month that we strongly urge that these figures be taken as a basis."
"What will happen when the Luxembourg figures come in?"
"If we were to adopt a policy other than that regarded as right and proper by the Bureau of this House and by the Conference of Committee Chairmen, the simple fact is that culture would have gained nothing."
"We are very happy about the ‘Youth in Action’ programme, because it takes on board a large number of suggestions made – not least in former years – by the Court of Auditors and has taken simplification as its watchword."
"This is a highly interesting approach, and one to which we wish to give our firm backing."
"Speaking as the rapporteur on the reform of the Financial Regulation, I have to say that I regard these items as very important and useful."
"I note with regret the way in which you have, in this programme, demanded a plethora of derogations from the Financial Regulation and have been given them."
"I personally would have set greater store by altering the Financial Regulation itself in such a way that one could work, under the ‘Youth in Action’ programme, with a large number of smaller organisations and smaller grants."
"The aspects of the programme that have been presented I regard as very important."
"We have submitted two more amendments that would bring about additional improvements in this area: one has to do with the establishment of a database to facilitate the notification of all those organisations that complain about the vast number of documents that they have to submit, and making it possible for all this data to be recorded once and for all, leaving only amendments to be done."
"This would both save the Commission administrative effort and make things easier for the recipients of grants, and that in turn would have a direct effect on the image of the European Union."
"If subsidies are more readily obtainable, the demand for them will rise, and that is something we regard as needed, particularly by small programmes."
"The same applies in the case of the amendment on the ‘proportionality of documents and grants’, which gives the Education and Culture Directorate-General every opportunity to act as it thinks right and proper in the implementing provisions."
"Mr President, recent events show that Europe’s younger generation is just as divided on the question of our continent’s future as their parents."
"On the one hand, the numbers of students and young jobseekers crossing EU borders in search of new experience and career prospects is constantly increasing."
"On the other hand, we can see how many young people feel disconnected from this new multinational reality."
"Indeed, young voters were instrumental in the French and Dutch rejections of the Constitution."
"Some on the political extremes, both left and right, celebrate this disaffection and claim vindication for their old-fashioned ideas."
"However, I think most would view this with concern, for, if the younger generations are not propping up the EU, making it more democratic and inclusive in the process, who is?"
"Mrs Gröner’s report therefore comes at a critical time."
"The Youth in Action programme is not merely an information campaign on the EU; it is something far more valuable."
"By increasing cross-border exchanges and getting young people involved in civic activities, the programme can help counter prejudice, broaden horizons and fight apathy."
"In the process it can influence and introduce them to the necessity and value of European cooperation, something all too many of their leaders are currently unable and unwilling to do."
"I would like to highlight a few points."
"The programme’s initiatives must build on existing grassroots locally-based youth organisations to the greatest extent possible."
"They should not be bureaucratically managed from Brussels."
"Second, people as young as 13 should be eligible as a rule, not as an exception, and, of course, gender balance should be upheld."
"Finally, the range of countries with which youth partnerships are struck should be the largest possible."
"The final related point, beyond today’s agenda but which we will eventually need to tackle, is how to improve conditions for young people to settle in another EU country."
"Too often an extended period of student exchange coupled with some work experience results in young people losing some of their national study and social entitlements."
"To avoid them being penalised in this way, we need to improve the transferability of some key social entitlements across the EU, especially for young people."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the ‘Youth in Action’ programme that the Commission has put forward, to which our committee’s rapporteur, in her even-handed report, has proposed various improvements for us to vote on, has demonstrated its suitability as a means of adding value to youth policy throughout Europe."
"The new youth programme has been made significantly simpler than its predecessor, with, for example, a flexible and less bureaucratic procedure for applying for funding, which is what this House has always argued for."
"Moreover, the programme is now funded by only one budget line rather than four, as was formerly the case."
"My group is at one with the rapporteur as regards the adjustment of age limits for participants, ensuring the exclusion of discrimination, and both the equal participation of disadvantaged young people and the involvement of young people in the evaluation and ongoing monitoring of the programme’s objectives."
"The extension of the programme to more countries, the greater importance of European cooperation in youth work and the more generous age limits make it necessary for the financial framework to be increased to – as has already been said – EUR 1.128 billion, but I would like to emphasise that in this we are being consistent with the Böge report."
"Turning to the weighting of the actions, my group endorses the proposed indicative levels for the minimum funding of Actions 1 to 5."
"As the Commissioner emphasised, the report entrenches the possibility of staging youth seminars and the European youth weeks, thereby making them a component of European youth policy."
"I congratulate the rapporteur and thank her for the good cooperation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the programme bears the name of ‘Youth in Action’, but the fact is that youth is always in action; the question is with which actions we can help them, where we can support them, and what sort of motivation we can offer them."
"This programme is certainly one possible option, and offers them a choice of ways in which to develop themselves or build networks at the European level."
"If they are to do that, though, there is an urgent need for real simplification where administration is concerned."
"Youth organisations need help not only with the submission of applications – the Youth Forum on its own cannot do it – but also with the disbursement of funds, which is quite crucial, as the young people are waiting for their money."
"Their activities are up and running and they need to be paid for."
"If they are not, the young people, who have no money of their own, find it difficult to repay their advances, and so I address an urgent appeal to the Commission that these payments should be made at least three months after they are agreed to."
"Youth Week is very important as a permanent component of this programme, in that it enables the young people – and us too – to engage in dialogue."
"By voicing their concerns here, young people get to know the institutions and are listened to by them."
"Rather than allowing what they say to us to go in one ear and out of the other, we should take it away with us and ponder it."
"That disadvantaged young people should be guaranteed participation on a basis of equality is something that goes – as it must, in this context – without saying, for it is only in this way that young people will be able to understand other people who are in a disadvantaged position and help work towards a shared and sympathetic Europe."
". – Mr President, through the continuing Youth in Action programme, the European Union is trying to nanny young people, to create the illusion that it is interested in their participation in policy and to turn them into passive recipients and applauders of its anti-grass roots policy, which also creates impasses for young people."
"In truth, when one third of young people are unemployed, when a large proportion are literally being crushed by flexible forms of employment, when the prevailing ideology is cultivating unbridled individualism, does the title of the Youth in Action programme not sound ironic and insulting?"
"When the entire philosophy of the policy of the European Union is to subject everything to the maximisation of the profits of big business, when for that purpose previous rights are abolished, exposing young people to wretched and cynical exploitation, is it not a mockery to make available a few million euros so that they can cash in on the miserable future which capitalism has in store for them?"
"Is it not hypocritical to state that it is cultivating the solidarity of young people when the imperialist policy of neo-colonialist wars sends hundreds of thousands of young people to death, hunger and poverty?"
"The programme finances actions which will promote the so-called values of the European Union; in other words, the creation of disenfranchised workers and scientists, so that maximum profit can be returned to big business."
"It promotes voluntary – in other words unpaid – labour and social consent."
"It proposes the creation of voluntary special qualifications for missions to countries outside the European Union, so as to create agencies for promoting its policy."
"At the same time, it is financing state-funded organisations which have nothing to do with the neo-grass roots movement and which, of course, fully accept the policy of the European Union, presenting them as allegedly representing the youth of the countries."
"The way to combat the problems of young people is in organised struggle, in quarrelling with the policy of the European Union and the European Union itself, in order to pave the way at national and international level for deep changes and reversals for the benefit of the peoples."
". One of the very important points of this renewed programme, which was raised by colleague Gröner, is the fostering of tolerance in young people towards other cultures and other languages."
"It is clear that the creation and promotion of a culture of tolerance among young people, as well as the encouragement of cooperation between the youth of different nations, is an important guarantee of the success of the entire European Union."
"It is also clear that education and expansion of young people's horizons have a special role to play in the process of fostering a culture of tolerance."
"Thus, the priority of learning and the accessibility of education regardless of race, nationality, gender, religion or social status must stand out in the whole philosophy of this programme's implementation."
"It is particularly important that this programme becomes accessible to the young in countries neighbouring the European Union, especially those countries in the grip of autocratic regimes."
"In this regard, the experience of Lithuania's youth of cooperating with young people in Belarus, particularly in an academic sense, may be a good example to the whole of Europe."
"We thus acquire one of the most effective instruments in the expansion of democracy and the spreading of European values."
"The Union for Europe of the Nations supports this report."
"Mr President, the 2000-2006 Youth programme resulted in a great number of developments."
"In many cases it brought considerable progress in the lives of youth communities in Hungary."
"However, the programme failed to achieve some of its objectives."
"For instance, it failed to reach young people living in rural areas."
"Disadvantaged youths living in small rural settlements have not been able to get involved in the programme easily."
"Therefore we must ensure that starting from 2007 as many rural youths as possible are able to get involved in the programme."
"It would be more helpful to youth communities of countries participating in the programme if the details, information material and some kind of a database were more accessible."
"We know that some progress has already been made in this direction, but it would be important to make more of the successful projects accessible, so that youths and youth organisations can get to know them."
"These projects will set their imagination in motion, and will help them acquire useful experience."
"Another positive step forward is that settlement-level and local government youth work is relied on to an ever-increasing extent."
"This is the right way forward, because the principle of subsidiarity must be implemented consistently in youth affairs."
"It is important that local youth work becomes an integral part of international youth cooperation."
"Please allow me to call your attention to the fact that the Hungarian Parliament concluded a cooperation agreement, a programme agreement with the Serbian Parliament involving a tolerance programme."
"Within this programme tolerance camps will be organised for young people, which may contribute to the prevention of nationality-based or ethnically motivated incidents involving Hungarian and Serbian youths."
"In the course of these events, young people will meet artists, politicians and sportspeople well-known in both countries."
"They will create a virtual parliament where they can deal with human rights and minority issues."
"I am certain that the Youth in Action programme will provide opportunities for youths in many countries to understand and get to know one another better, which will create a strong foundation for taking action against all forms of discrimination and will raise the tolerance levels of young people."
"Congratulations, Mrs Gröner!"
"Benjamin Disraeli said that almost everything great is created in youth."
"This is hyperbole, but there will never be too much attention paid to the young, the Europe of tomorrow."
"The youth programme for 2007-2013 is a step forward when compared with the current programme."
"We welcome the fact that the programme is more specific in its inclusion of the EU's new neighbours: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova and the North Caucasus."
"This will allow young people to become acquainted with European values and initiatives as well as enter into relations with partners from EU states."
"It is very good that the programme will not only include young people aged 15-25, but will be open to those aged 13-30."
"The simplified rules for the submission of projects means that we will see more initiatives and far more young people will take advantage of the fruits of the programme."
"However, this also demands greater funding."
"Lithuania's youth are taking an active part in the work of the current programme."
"It is hoped that the implementation of the new programme will further foster reciprocal knowledge, understanding and tolerance and will reduce social isolation."
"Thank you."
". I would like to thank the rapporteur, the various committees and also the political groups and individuals for their contributions and viewpoints."
"I realise that the times we live in are not easy, but there is hope."
"For young people, it started with the White Paper and continued with the Youth programme, which is continuing and remains popular."
"The proposal on the table reaffirms and extends existing options and financial support, and widens the spectrum of countries and geographical areas, as well as the age brackets."
"For the first time in our history, a summit of Heads of State or Government has adopted special conclusions in the form of the European Youth Pact."
"We have spoken with young people this year about youth issues and, later this week, I will discuss these matters in Cardiff with representatives of Member States and European youth."
"In response to some of the suggestions that have been put forward, I would like to state that the flexibility inherent in the programme should be very apparent during December Youth Week in Brussels."
"It can serve to link up various programmes, for instance those on culture and youth, sports and youth, and social inclusion and youth."
"On the subject of financial rules and regulations, I am a strong advocate of simpler, more transparent and speedier procedures."
"This is why we have incorporated more than one hundred proposals into the draft amendment on financial regulation for the European Union."
"The proposal is now in the hands of Parliament and the Council."
"I am confident that it will receive a very positive response in both bodies and that it will be beneficial for all areas concerned."
"I also would like to say that the European Commission supports the proposal put forward by Mrs Grässle on behalf of the Budget Committee, as well as many other amending motions."
"In conclusion, I would like to recommend strongly that the programme be implemented as complementary to and compatible with other programmes, such as the lifelong learning programme or the citizenship programme."
"These have great potential if they are coordinated, if they complement each other and if they are coherent."
"And my last remark: I would be very happy if next Thursday, following your vote, I could convey a message to the youth of Europe that the programme Youth in Action will be one of the first to receive support within the constraints imposed by the financial outlook, as an instrument for the future European Union in 2007 to 2013."
"Thank you for considering this approach."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report by Mr Graça Moura, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council creating the ‘Culture 2007’ programme (2007-2013) (COM(2004)0469 – C6-0094/2004 – 2004/0150(COD)) (A6-0269/2005)."
"Mr President, I should like to express my gratitude to the author of this report on Culture 2007, Mr Graça Moura, for his excellent work and for the sound cooperation between our two institutions."
"I am very pleased that the general line proposed by the Commission has been welcomed by Parliament and that the draft report agrees with the main objectives of our proposal."
"This focus on objectives will enable the programme to deliver more European added value."
"Although support for the projects is clearly a key component of the programme, the draft report also approves the Commission’s proposal to go beyond the mere ‘project approach’ and support organisations, studies and the collection and dissemination of information in the field of cultural cooperation."
"As you know, the Commission proposal does not mention any sector specifically."
"Our intention is to cover all fields of artistic and cultural life without any prejudice and to promote cross-sectoral activities."
"On the budget, I am very grateful that this programme has received a great deal of political support in the House, from both committees and groups, and I am glad to see that you propose even stronger financial backing for this cooperation."
"I agree that the increase to EUR 600 million proposed by Parliament would make it easier for the programme to attain its objectives and to reach a critical mass, but the Commission cannot amend its original proposal; we are waiting for the agreement on the financial perspective."
"I am pleased to say that the Commission is able to accept either word-for-word or in substance some of the other amendments contained in the report."
"The Commission can agree with the transfer the memorial action from the culture programme to the citizenship programme and will confirm that in a specific declaration."
"It is important to continue to support this action."
"I also agree with the proposal to extend this action to the victims of Stalinist regimes."
"On translation, as I said in my introduction, no sector is specifically mentioned."
"However, we understand Parliament’s request to include a reference to literary translation in the annex to the decision in order to take into account the specific conditions in this field of activity."
"Some of you very rightly stressed the importance of our European cultural heritage."
"That heritage needs to be understood in a broader sense so as to include the values and the ways of life that have defined our identities."
"We fully understand that concern."
"Indeed the preservation of cultural heritage is one of the aims of Article 151 of the Treaty."
"On the basis of this article, we succeeded last week in promoting cultural diversity in UNESCO through a special convention on this matter."
"That could be achieved in this programme by including appropriate references in the recitals to the decision."
"However, we cannot accept cultural heritage being mentioned as a specific objective of the programme, as this would clearly run counter to the non-sectoral, ‘open to all sectors’ approach of the original proposal."
"There are other amendments that the Commission is not prepared to accept."
"I will mention just a few of them, because they concern the question of access for small operators or small projects."
"For the Commission, it is essential to strike the right balance between small and large projects and between long-term and short- or medium-term projects."
"Therefore, the Commission cannot agree with the proposed lowering of the minimum level of grants for cooperation measures for shorter projects from EUR 60 000 to EUR 30 000, because this would lead to an avalanche of project proposals, which could not be co-funded owing to a lack of resources."
"Already the refusal rate is 70% to 75%."
"If such an amendment were adopted, it would be even higher."
"The Commission also disagrees with the proposal to increase the maximum level of Community cofinancing to 70%."
"We must not forget that our cultural policy is governed by the principles of complementarity and subsidiarity."
"Finally, the Commission cannot accept the proposal to decrease the minimum number of partners from four to three for shorter duration projects and to decrease the number of countries from six to four for longer duration projects."
"Should the number of partners or countries be lowered, it would diminish the visibility of the programme in an enlarged Europe."
"In spite of that, I hope that the excellent climate of cooperation that has characterised relations between our institutions up to now will continue to help find a mutually satisfying compromise."
"That is all the more necessary because the new programme should be adopted in time to allow for a timely and smooth implementation."
"In conclusion, I very much hope that the next meeting of the Ministers for Culture in November will be in a position to reach a political agreement, leaving aside all budget-related matters."
"I would like to stress once more the benefits expected from this new culture programme."
"The programme will actively contribute to the promotion of inter-cultural dialogue, raising awareness of a common European heritage, celebrating the richness and diversity of our cultures, and increasing openness to other cultures."
". – We see ourselves as Europeans, in spite of all our differences."
"This is down to European culture, which encompasses the shared, dynamic heritage formed by our specific characteristics and our linguistic diversity, elements that come together to form a complex tapestry in which the Greco-Latin, Judeo-Christian and Mediterranean-Muslim traditions are all brought to the fore, whilst ensuring that none of those traditions is able to dominate."
"Culture should be high on the agenda of promoting the European project, with a view to reviving our common heritage, while encouraging diversity, in such a way that a balance can be struck between the centralising and decentralising tendencies."
"In order words, we must take measures that acknowledge the value of our common heritage and must enable the 400 million-plus citizens of the Union to find out more about each other within their specific cultural and linguistic identities."
"It would clearly be wrong to speak of European cultural integration."
"One of the most fascinating aspects of our civilisation lies precisely in the idea of Europe accepting itself both as a common entity and as an entity formed and characterised by an openness to its fellow human beings and to the world."
"Culture 2007-2013 should, first and foremost, be a framework programme, not for integration, but for increased cultural communication between the citizens of Europe, and should be effected on a Europe-wide scale and built on the foundations of its values."
"Accordingly, European culture policy must always concentrate on providing a European added value. Otherwise, it will cease to have any meaning and will become indistinguishable from national policy on culture."
"What is more, cooperation is crucial between the European institutions, the Member States, the cultural players and participants from all Member States, as well as their transnational networks. The purpose of this is to make common cultural policy a reality."
"The 2007-2013 ‘Culture’ programme is a third generation programme."
"It takes on board the experience of the previous ones and seeks to adopt the most appropriate solutions on the basis of that experience."
"I must say that, personally, I would have preferred it to have been formed along the lines of the first generation – Raphael, Ariane and Kaleidoscope – with the areas of art, literature, the performing arts and cultural heritage properly marked out."
"Resources are scarce, yet the number of applications for aid continues to grow. In order for policy to be effective, it must be focused on a small number of clear, well-defined objectives, even if that means some projects falling by the wayside."
"In any event, let us hope that the new system leads to a more proactive contribution to culture."
"We have sought to improve upon the Commission’s proposal, by making a number of changes to it, so as to adapt it more effectively to the proposed aims, to frame the cultural dimension more clearly and to place the accent on the importance of our common cultural heritage, without undermining contemporary creativity."
"With the greatest respect, Mr Figel, I must say that it does not look good for the Commission to reject explicit reference to an aspect relating to cultural heritage, which is an enormous, living, breathing phenomenon, is manifested both tangibly and intangibly, has been accumulated over the centuries and has helped so much to define us as Europeans."
"This aspect does not simply boil down to sectoral concerns; what we are talking about is a shared matrix, a common dimension across all sectors, and this is of central importance."
"Furthermore, we feel that the provisions on preserving European memorials to the terrible memories of totalitarian violence, both Nazi and Stalinist, would be better placed under the heading of ‘Education for Citizenship’."
"This idea was formally set down in the minutes of the Committee, as was its acceptance by the Commission."
"Lastly, Mr President, I must refer to a most worrying point, namely the budget."
"The figures in the Böge report are merely indicative, yet they were taken into consideration."
"Whereas in his report the amount earmarked for this programme was EUR 566 million, we have earmarked EUR 600 million, because the Böge report itself provided for a reserve fund enabling us to do this."
"This is a paltry amount!"
"All those working for the European institutions – the Members of the Commission, including its President and Commissioner for Culture, the Members of Parliament, including the chairmen of the parliamentary groups, and countless other Members, and Members of the Council, including practically every Culture Minister – have long been calling for substantially increased funding in this area."
"The Union now has 25 Member States, rather than 15, hence the need for the European unit to be increasingly proactive in the area of culture."
"The Lisbon agenda will be no more than empty words if European cultural policy collapses without achieving its objectives on common cultural heritage and linguistic and cultural diversity within the Member States."
"There cannot be a Lisbon agenda unless we find out more about one another, in terms of our range of historical, cultural and linguistic identities."
"Failure to do this will render us incapable of cooperating properly with one another on our common goals."
"Such cooperation will only be possible if we pursue cultural policy that is focused on providing a European added value and is equipped with the necessary resources for that to take place."
"I therefore call for this report, which I had the honour of drafting, to be adopted. I also propose that we adopt all of the useful contributions made by Members of all political hues in the Committee on Culture."
". Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for his wonderful work."
"I am certain that he had invested a considerable amount of time in it."
"Globalisation is an irreversible fact."
"As a result, cultural supply and the system of relationships between people and other nations have expanded to an incredible extent."
"National particularities are relaxed in some areas, and as a result of the interaction between cultures, national identity has acquired a new significance."
"The new circumstances cast a different light on national and common European identity."
"In this context I would like to stress that in a globalised world culture is one of the most important means of strengthening, deepening and promoting common European identity, while preserving the multicultural diversity of nations."
"The evaluation conducted by the Committee, based on extensive consultation, pointed out that rationalisation and strengthening are a requirement in this area of community activities, as well."
"It is important to stress that in order to achieve effective results and avoid unnecessary duplication, community activities must be closely interconnected in the areas of culture and education, youth, sport, research and discrimination."
"Community activities must supplement one another and must be harmonised."
"In order to achieve higher efficiency, the extent of cooperation between Member States and regional programmes should be increased as much as possible."
"I trust that the proposed programme may contribute to a better coordination of community activities, focusing on the benefits provided by added European value."
"Finally, I would like to emphasise that the role of cultural foreign policy has acquired a new significance, and its objective is to facilitate the creation of nation states with higher levels of culture, standards, education and democracy."
"This would result in a community of European states that is fully able to renew itself, with a strong sense of self-knowledge and self-esteem."
"And as the Commissioner mentioned in his introduction, I hope that the proposals for amendment ..."
". Mr President, Parliament’s draft resolution on the Culture 2007 programme (2007-2013) is likely to promote creativity and strengthen mutual awareness of the culture and history of the nations of Europe, as well as boosting cooperation in this field."
"One of the most important steps we could take towards this goal would be to identify the protection of cultural heritage of European significance as one of the fundamental goals of the Culture 2007 programme."
"The Commission’s draft fails to offer clear support for projects relating to the European tradition or to the common roots that are an integral part of the identity of contemporary Europe."
"After all, it was the culture of our continent, that was centuries in the making, which shaped European identity, and continues to do so today."
"This culture also encourages the recognition of our common heritage and civilisation, as noted by John Paul II during a speech before the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe."
"As a member of the Association of European Capitals of Culture, I have had first-hand experience of the enthusiasm generated by the European Capital of Culture initiatives among the people of our continent."
"Such initiatives allow millions of citizens to participate in artistic, informative and instructive projects of enormous educational merit."
"This effort on the part of artists and cultural operators gives us good reason to be proud of the wealth of talent and the diversity of artistic inspiration founded on the achievements of our European tradition."
"We should not forget that Europe was divided for 50 years."
"The aim of this programme should be to raise awareness of the culture of the nations of Central and Eastern Europe across Western Europe."
"This culture, including those aspects of it inspired by Christian values, was stifled by Communist totalitarianism."
"In my opinion, the proposal to change the minimum budget for projects eligible for support is therefore very much to be welcomed, and this is a point upon which I disagree with the Commissioner."
"Reducing the minimum project budget from EUR 60 000 to EUR 30 000 per year would increase the number of cultural operators able to participate in the programme."
"This would be a significant change, particularly in the new Member States, where such operators face much greater problems in financial terms than operators in the old Member States."
"There is every justification for allowing a larger number of entities to benefit from the proposed funding, provided that they meet the programme’s substantive objectives."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this programme represents a challenge to what we call European cultural policy, for the absence of a real cultural policy puts at risk the idea that the European Union should unite not merely states but also peoples, particularly at a time when the European Union cannot be other than seriously concerned about its own future."
"Such a European cultural policy could well help to bring together the needs of the cultural world and those of the public, thereby addressing the soul of Europe as nothing else can, and with it, people’s hearts, for it is with their hearts, more than with their minds, that people will be prepared to vote ‘yes’ in a referendum."
"We take the view – although I note that the Commission does not – that the cultural actions should be biased towards the starting-up of small and medium-sized projects, for it is these that can help to make visible the cultural riches of the European Union’s individual regions and promote real public awareness of them."
"I hope that I will, for a change, find more sympathy for this idea from the Council than from the Commission."
"While ministers of culture, and even the President of the Commission, are wont to make pious utterances stressing the significance of culture, and to sing its praises as an agent of integration, cohesion and citizenship, they should also ensure that sufficient funding is available for it."
"Even with what we propose to add to it, the programme really is not adequately fitted out."
"I very much hope that pious sentiments will be backed up by actions!"
". Mr President, allow me first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, on the work he has done on such a crucial subject as the ‘culture’ programme."
"I should like quickly to go back over four points, which seem to me to be important and which I defended within the Committee on Culture and Education on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"Firstly, as regards the horizontal aspect of the programme, it must be noted that the Commission’s proposal reflects good intentions, which are along the right lines."
"No one need oppose strengthening the coherence of the programme in order to put a stop to the fragmentation, which for so long has characterised the EU’s action with regard to culture."
"However, there are the intentions, on the one hand, and the resources proposed, on the other."
"I therefore come to my second point: the matter of the budget."
"It is no use the European Union setting ambitious objectives, such as promoting cultural diversity and cultural cooperation, if the budget available is not adjusted."
"We have therefore called for a logical increase in the budget allocated to this programme so that it can fulfil the task assigned to culture, namely that of contributing to the development of a European culture and a European identity, both of which will enable countries to put a stop to their excessive national self-interest and, consequently, to come out of the crisis that the EU is currently going through."
"My third point concerns the commemoration sites."
"We have called for a clear distinction to be made between cultural organisations and the sites, not because we believed that these sites are not important, quite the opposite."
"As such, we would hope that the Commission will guarantee that the budget for the ‘citizenship’ programme, in which we have asked for the sites to be included, is increased accordingly."
"Finally – and this will be my final point – I was keen that the cultural industries, which provide so many jobs, should be mentioned in the recitals for this programme."
"This was particularly the case for Amendments 7, 11 and 13, adopted by the Committee on Culture and Education."
"A recent study by Eurostat showed that the cultural industry contributed significantly to the European economy."
"With this in mind, it would be desirable to carry out a study highlighting the importance of these industries for the European economy."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Graça Moura on the Culture 2007 programme for the period 2007-2013 wholly fulfils the expectations of culture professionals."
"It is balanced, consistent and demanding."
"It attaches great importance to the content of the proposals, it prioritises cultural diversity and it is committed to the development of European citizenship."
"I thank Mr Graça Moura for his listening skills and for the quality of the dialogue that we have been able to establish."
"I too am particularly delighted that it was possible for the cultural industries to be recognised in a recital of this report."
"I personally took a tough stand in calling for them to be included in this programme, and even if this result still falls far short of the mark, the progress made is by no means insignificant and deserves to be pointed out."
"I will continue to defend the position whereby the cultural industries contribute to promoting European culture: they generate employment and give economic added value to the cultural sector."
"There is even less reason to neglect the cultural industries inasmuch as they are the ideal vehicle for developing European culture and for underpinning its diversity."
"There is, unfortunately, a fly in this particular ointment."
"None of my colleagues in the Committee on Culture and Education will dispute the fact, because if there is, in truth, one point on which we are unanimously in agreement, it is that of the budget."
"I deplore the fact that culture should still be considered by the Commission as a luxury, secondary to the most crucial requirements."
"Is it really the case that culture is nothing but a luxury and that it is only secondary to the most crucial requirements?"
"Violence exists; it is aimed at destroying culture."
"One form of violence is to argue that culture is pointless."
"I am therefore profoundly shocked by the meagre sum in the budget package allocated to culture."
"However, there remains a glimmer of hope in my opinion, Commissioner."
"The Unesco Convention, which has just been approved by a huge majority a few days ago, is a great victory for Europe and demonstrates once again that, when Europe is united, it is strong."
"It is also a great victory for European culture."
"With its diversity finally recognised, it now remains for Europe to assert itself on the international stage."
"However, it will only be able to pursue its role of ambassador if you give it the financial resources to do so."
"I will conclude by simply saying to you, Commissioner, that it is up to you to act in order to obtain a decent and respectable budget for culture, one that does not remain below 1% of the overall budget."
". Mr President, Commissioner Figel', ladies and gentlemen, over recent months, this House has seen a campaign waged in support of culture, which called for a European cultural budget amounting to 70 cents per inhabitant per annum."
"At present, we allocate EUR 35 million to the overall European cultural budget, and that, being equivalent to the amount received by a major theatre in Germany, is a shameful figure."
"Now that the Wall has come down and we have 25 Member States, we really want Europeans to encounter each other anew; we really want cultural exchange and more information; we want Western and Eastern Europe to have a real opportunity to establish contact with each other, but the present budget makes that impossible."
"The reason why my group has raised the figures that the Commission proposed or that have now emerged from the Committee was that we need 10 times as much as we have at present."
"We now get no more than 7 cents, but we need 70 cents."
"With them, we would have a real chance of getting a cultural offensive for Europe moving."
"I can go along with the Commission’s basic approach, and its three great goals of transnational mobility, transnational exchange of cultural values and inter-cultural dialogue, for all of these tie in very well, not only with the fostering of contemporary culture, but also with the management of cultural heritage."
"I cannot agree to Mr Graça Moura’s proposal, in his additional amendment, for a fourth objective, for an exclusive emphasis on heritage upsets the good balance that we have worked to achieve between contemporary art and heritage management."
"It is for that reason that we shall not be supporting that additional amendment."
"I am glad to see that the narrowly sectoral approach has been done away with, and that there is a real desire for real interdisciplinary cooperation with our cultural projects."
"I, too, take the view that smaller projects should be given more opportunities."
". – For the Commission and the Council, culture is a matter of the EU’s visibility, which has been, and continues to be, the real aim of the ‘Culture’ programme."
"The first plus point of the Graça Moura report is that it distances itself from this view that cultural creations can be used for the purposes of political promotion."
"This is not the only plus point, in fact. The Commission and the Council want maximum visibility with minimum resources, and therefore channel aid into a few actions, bodies and initiatives."
"This is a bad move."
"In the name of visibility, there has been a shortfall in Europe of so many projects that rely on it."
"This is a further trend that the report seeks to rectify, on its own terms. It supports projects up to two years, simplifies procedures for obtaining financial support, makes a commitment to transparency in application processes and places value on heritage and linguistic diversity in the programme’s objectives."
"These are more than enough reasons to vote in favour of the report."
"The British Presidency continues to block the financial perspective."
"As we know, Mr Blair has his priorities elsewhere, but I feel that everyone present is agreed on one point; the proposal of EUR 600 million is the rock-bottom minimum if the Union wishes to present itself to cultural creators and producers as an institution that still gives some value to the words it says."
"I would like to think that the men and women of the Committee on Culture and Education will be up to the task of assessing the final proposal from the perspective of that value. I hope, too, that the Council understands the message."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur on his report."
"My criticisms are not, of course, directed at his report, but instead concern the mindset with which the matter of culture is addressed by the Council and by the Commission."
"The Constitution would have given us the foundation for tackling a common cultural policy, based on the diversity of cultures and on mutual acceptance of the principles of freedom and of human rights."
"However, the Constitution did not go so far as to grant culture the status of a real Community policy, which was an argument for not voting in favour of it."
"The objective that should be achieved by increasing our knowledge of others is precisely the objective sought by all of our countries."
"Doing away with the fear of others is a prerequisite for attaining a life led in peace in a society of genuine cultural pluralism."
"Learning about differences: that is the objective of a common cultural policy."
"Among the Commission’s objectives, the mobility of persons leads me once again, Commissioner – and I am well aware that you yourself are not the person with responsibility – to ask the following question: where, in all of this, is the work of the Council on problems related to social security, taxation and status, which prevent people from being truly mobile, not to mention its work on the lack of financial resources to support real exchanges between the new Member States and the old ones?"
"The Commission has held on to intercultural dialogue as an objective."
"It was high time this problem was highlighted."
"Greater synergy between education and culture was the subject of one of the amendments tabled by our Parliamentary committee."
"Greater synergy is necessary, and all the more so given that, since 1998, and under the UK Presidency, employability – a terrible term – has been part of European texts as a principle for education."
"It is a mistake to think that greater emphasis on culture in school curricula would be a waste of time."
"Creativity and a lively mind are qualities that are acquired through an appreciation of the arts, just as a culture of tolerance and the prevention of violence are founded on respect for artistic feeling and on the cultivation of the senses."
"As from now, the budget for 2006 has been revised downwards, to EUR 36 million instead of EUR 38 million."
"I note that, despite the fine speeches made by Mr Barroso and by all the group leaders in front of a small number of active contributors to the cultural sector, their words are not about to be followed up by actions."
"Point duly made."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the Culture 2007 programme is the main means for implementing Community action in the field of culture."
"It sets a series of important objectives, such as the cross-border mobility of cultural agencies in Europe, the transnational movement of artists and cultural works and cultural dialogue, objectives which cannot be implemented satisfactorily by the Member States due to their transnational character."
"However, we must not forget that the programme is also the means for financing these objectives."
"We cannot therefore set objectives for culture without at the same time proposing what the financial resources will be with which we shall achieve them."
"Consequently we, as the European Parliament, must propose a specific amount in the budget."
"However, when we talk about the objectives of the programme, we must emphasise that the maintenance and knowledge of cultural heritage must be expressly included in the objectives of this programme."
"Among these plans, prime position must continue to be given to actions which aim to rescue the architectural heritage of Europe."
"Another point which we must also keep an eye on is facilitating the participation of small agencies in the programme, which is often difficult."
"Our rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, who has done an excellent job, is well versed in this subject and his report takes account of the needs of small cultural agencies and, by extension, of small countries."
"– It is symbolic that in the same week when the leaders of Europe's countries will debate the challenges of globalisation, the Parliament is discussing the EU cultural programme."
"It is symbolic because in the future culture industries will probably become the European Union's main competitive advantage."
"We will be unable to compete in terms of labour costs or cost effectiveness."
"Therefore, it is very important to promote creativity and more attention must be devoted to this in the cultural programme."
"I disagree with the European Commission's opinion that the more participants in the cultural programme, the more visible it is."
"This is a grandiose view, whereas we must look towards cultural originality."
"This originality is certainly not achieved through the number of operators, and this should not be increased."
"Another important aspect, which is relevant to the promotion of culture and creativity, is namely the multilateral exchange process."
"Of course, it is very important for us to preserve our cultural heritage, but the cultural programme must put a clear emphasis on the future and the creative generation of new ideas."
"Thank you."
"– Mr President, as we face the financial perspective of Culture 2007 we are very worried about an issue that the European Union has not yet properly addressed: the promotion of marginalised languages and of minority languages within the EU."
"I would like to refer specifically to the budget problems for the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages, whose main goal is to maintain real language diversity in the European Union."
"According to the Charter for Regional and Minority Languages, each linguistic community has the right to maintain and develop its own language and pass it on to future generations."
"In the European Union we have official languages, minority languages and languages like Catalan that, being majority languages in their own country, are not in the first or second groups."
"The EU has to provide support for all these languages and for linguistic diversity in Europe."
"That means a budget is needed for minority languages and for the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages."
"I know that is against the Jacobinist language policy that is practised in some European states, but the EU will work to promote diversity, democracy and freedom and to maintain real equality between languages in the European Union."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, esteemed rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen."
"The ‘Culture 2007’ report that is presently before Parliament, after being accepted at the cultural commission, has lost all the amendments referring to the preservation of the memory of the crimes of Stalinism."
"In terms of total number of deaths, Stalinism was no less tragic than Nazism."
"Mass deportation and concentration camps were part of the arsenal of both regimes."
"In my homeland, Estonia, nearly 10% of the population was deported and killed under the leadership of Stalin."
"Elderly people and children represented more than half of the number of those deported."
"Even pregnant women were shown no mercy."
"Stalinism and Nazism are two sides of the same ideology."
"They were conceived together."
"They divided Europe through the Hitler-Stalin pact."
"After the expansion of the European Union, we cannot avoid passing judgment on the crimes of Stalinism, which were mainly committed in Eastern Europe."
"That judgment alone symbolises that we are members of one European family."
"The bearers of a misanthropic ideology remain a threat to us."
"Their face changes as necessary, but inside, Neo-Nazis, national Bolsheviks, neo-Stalinists and so on are nevertheless brothers in arms."
"In the name of Europe, we must not let the crimes of Nazism or Stalinism be forgotten."
"The Cultural Commission agreed to transfer the preservation of the memory of Nazism and Stalinism to the ‘Citizens for Europe’ programme."
"It is no secret that the ‘Citizens for Europe’ programme received even less funding than ‘Culture 2007’."
"Therefore, I would like to receive public and clear confirmation from Commissioner Figel’ that transferring the commemoration of the victims of terror to the ‘Citizens for Europe’ programme will result in the additional funding and attention that it deserves."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we European citizens must take pleasure from the approval of this programme: a cultural programme, renewed for 2007-2013."
"It demonstrates the importance that the European Union attaches to the citizens, adopting a programme aimed at improving the dissemination of the culture and history of all of the peoples of Europe, at conserving and protecting the cultural heritage of the Union and promoting artistic, literary and audiovisual creativity."
"This programme, furthermore, is essential for facing the challenge of enlargement and also in terms of developing an awareness of European citizenship, because only through the dissemination of our common cultural values can we illustrate the different foundations of our European identity."
"But this programme will also be open to many countries that are not Members of the European Union."
"Given, therefore, the programme’s very ambitious objectives, we must have a budget to match."
"In this regard, I believe that the needs defined by the European Cultural Foundation in July 2004, calling for an annual budget of EUR 315 million, quite reasonably pointed to the need for a more generous budget."
"I therefore support the rapporteur’s call for a budget greater than the EUR 408 million proposed by the Commission."
"I would like to end by expressing my satisfaction at the adoption of the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions; my satisfaction at its approval, but above all at the fact that the European Union has spoken with one voice and has demonstrated, once again, that when it acts together it achieves results."
"Please allow me, Mr President, to call on the Member States to ratify this instrument, and the sooner the better, since it represents significant progress in the recognition of cultural and linguistic diversity."
"Mr President, Commissioner, earlier this year, various cultural organisations mounted, with support from Parliament and the Commission, the action ‘70 cents per citizen’."
"It was clear to all how important this was in telling us all the things we could do with 70 cents and how much we ended up being left with."
"I must now join the ranks of those who keep coming back to money, but it is a fact that we cannot implement the demanding cultural programme with the budget that is available to us."
"The cultural programme as set out in the report ranges from the preservation of the cultural heritage to contemporary cultural events; it makes reference to linguistic diversity and to minority languages, and I believe that this is where there is a need for realistic thinking, for the allocation of realistic sums of money and for priorities to be set or, in the budget, to allow realism to take a back seat to vision and to be realistic about implementing the programme."
"While I agree with the honourable Member who said that it was essential to defend our cultural heritage, I do think we are very attached to contemporary art and must therefore attempt to find common ground."
". Thank you very much for your numerous expressions of encouragement and for your statements advocating European cultural cooperation."
"Let me remind you that only a few years ago, and certainly before Maastricht, many would have said that this is not an agenda for Parliament, the Union or the Commission."
"More, much more is needed today."
"There is also greater political will for this kind of cooperation, and I am confident that it will bear fruit, because it is necessary."
"The first reason for this is globalisation, and the risk it brings of losing our identity."
"The second is European integration itself, which does not mean the integration or harmonisation of cultures, but the shaping of a community of cultures, where diversity is an asset and where unity is based on common values."
"Never before have themes and phenomena like identity, citizenship and culture been so intensively discussed and elaborated on in European institutions."
"I see this as a sign of the times, a signal that we are moving from the very basic post-war, coal-and-steel agenda to more demanding themes that call for greater maturity."
"Regarding some of the suggestions concerning culture, for example those of Mr Bono and others, I think that the new reasoning within the proposal defines the space for the culture industry very well."
"As for little and large, we already have a high rate of rejection: 70-75%."
"This means that further fragmentation will not result in a higher success rate, but we do want to achieve higher rates in the case of bilateral and trilateral dimensions and projects."
"My preference would be to give very strong support to Member States, to help them generate so-called matching funds, or financing that is complementary to European funds, which would help small or medium-sized operators in the cultural space."
"And, I repeat, the main responsibility for cultural policy lies with the Member States."
"We are willing and able to support and complement this, but not to replace it."
"Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges’ remarks about using taxation and social insurance to promote the mobility of artists belong to the culture ministers’ agenda."
"Their next meeting is scheduled for November."
"I am convinced that it is in the wider interests of everyone, not just ministers, but also all players in the field of culture."
"Mr Joan i Marí, I recently met with the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages (EBLUL)."
"The EBLUL has enlarged its membership to 19 states, and I believe has a chance to develop its relationship with the European Union."
"May I remind you of the integrated lifelong learning programme that we discussed a few moments ago, which represents a new chance for the development of minority and regional languages."
"Today, we have many more official languages, and there is naturally more room for linguistic diversity."
"This is a value that calls for further investment."
"Mrs Mikko, Stalinist gulags will be included among our commemorative events."
"History is the teacher of life, but it is important that individual Member States also take steps to promote historical awareness."
"We should not expect the Union to take over a basic responsibility of the Member States – to remember their history and to promote an understanding of it in cooperation with their neighbours and with the entire European Union."
"I want to assure you that adequate attention and financing will be provided to this end, despite or perhaps because of the shift to the citizenship programme, since this is more a matter of civic maturity than of culture alone."
"In this context we have also financed special events such as the anniversary of Solidarity in Poland."
"There will also be other reasons."
"I am convinced that this can provide an impetus for such commemorations."
"These were the main points I deemed it necessary to comment on."
"I am also very grateful to you for supporting 70 instead of 7."
"On the one hand, the Commission welcomes it, and on the other hand, it is necessary that the Member States come to perceive culture as an integral component of European cooperation, because culture enables a better understanding of the present and future of a united Europe."
"A united Europe is much more about culture than about trade or geography."
"It is about the values that culture embodies."
"The next item is the report (A6-0278/2005) by Mrs Hieronymi, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the implementation of a programme of support for the European audiovisual sector (MEDIA 2007) [COM(2004)0470 C6-0093/2004 2004/0151(COD)]."
". Mr President, it was with a great deal of pleasure that I listened to the previous debates on projects very close to my heart, projects that I helped to move forward and to develop during the period in which I was responsible for culture."
"I am, moreover, very happy to continue to take an active part in the area of culture by taking charge, more specifically, of the audiovisual sector."
"In actual fact, the audiovisual sector fully participates in the programmes on cultural diversity, with cultural diversity being Europeans’ greatest asset."
"On this subject, rest assured that I was delighted, as were all the Members of the European Parliament, that Unesco adopted the universal declaration on cultural diversity."
"It should be known that it took a long fight to obtain this outcome."
"Moreover, it is the sign, as one Member said in the previous debate, that, if Europe has a sound unifying project, founded on a vision that gathers the world around Europe, and that if Europe speaks with a single voice, it can triumph."
"I believe that this needs to be a lesson for us all: no, cultural diversity is not exclusively European; it is a global phenomenon, and we are right to invest in our European cultures."
"It is along these lines, of course, that the MEDIA programme plays a dominant role."
"The MEDIA programme helps our cultural, and cinematographic, diversity to exist."
"Firstly, it helps future film-makers to find their way and to choose their vocational training."
"Then, during the period in which the film goes from being just a dream to becoming a screenplay – a period that is fraught with difficulties, in which no one yet believes in the project – it is Europe that helps the film-makers to find the financial resources they require."
"Then, at the production stage, full responsibility for supporting the production of the film is handed back to the Member States, which support their national film industries by means of the State aid that we, as the Commission, authorise."
"At the same time, we make the private sector aware of its responsibility to invest in the creative film industries."
"Finally, when the film is complete, Europe takes over once again because the film still needs to be distributed, not only in the country in which it was made, but also beyond the borders of that country."
"Cultural diversity, in actual fact, means that a film should be seen, and not only in the country in which it was made and in the language of that country, but also by the rest of Europe."
"What better way of understanding our neighbours’ cultures than of understanding them by means of a film?"
"I am proud to say that nine-tenths of European films exported for screening in another country are exported with the help of the MEDIA programme."
"I can also tell you just how proud the networks of film-makers, cinemas, film creators and film festivals are."
"All of these networks are doing, in actual fact, what Europe does best: uniting and joining forces to give expression to our cultures."
"Mr President, it is very important that we continue along this path because, even if we help our film industry and even if we are proud of our film-makers, European films are, and remain, in the minority on their own soil."
"It is therefore crucial that we continue, even more so than in the past, to make cinema more diverse and to distribute films."
"That is why the MEDIA programme, which was presented in July 2004, has been provided with a budget of over EUR 1 billion."
"The Commission recognises, in fact, the importance of this programme for the future of our creative output and of our audiovisual heritage."
"I hope with all of my heart, like all of you do, that the debates on finance in Europe will enable this investment in our film industry to materialise and that the budget will not be cut back."
"I know that you are anxious for this to be the outcome, and I would also like to thank the Committee on Culture and Education, as well as its rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, for the magnificent job they have both done."
"I would like to thank all of the other committees - the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy – which have, themselves, also studied the problem."
"They were right to do so because our films amount to a great deal more than culture: they involve trade, international relations and industry."
"Therefore, all MEPs, irrespective of their committee, need to take an interest in this cultural diversity, brought about by our cultural industries thanks to the talent of our film-makers."
"As regards the amendments, I would like to say to you that, as a general rule, I can accept almost all of them."
"There are 77 amendments."
"The Commission will accept 56 of them because, quite simply, Parliament has done some very positive, creative and constructive work, and I would like to thank it for having done this work, which markedly improves the project the Commission has put on the table."
"To come back to the amendments in more detail, I would like to say to you that I particularly welcome the amendments that enhance the importance of the new priorities given to MEDIA 2007 compared with the previous MEDIA programme."
"On the one hand, it is a matter of funding small and medium-sized enterprises, which are fragile and need our help and, on the other, of using digital technology."
"Digital technology is making great strides all around us, but it is still not perfect."
"We must help to improve digitisation."
"Those two points are crucial for strengthening the competitiveness of the sector."
"Furthermore, we also need to make sure that European films take advantage of the new prospects offered by digital technology such as, for example, the legal downloading of films from the Internet."
"Parliament knows that I am encouraging the directors of businesses in the telecommunications and Internet sector and content creators to sit down together around a table in order to resolve, among themselves, the problem of piracy and to distribute the revenues between the two branches of the industry."
"As regards the amendments that the Commission cannot accept – a very small minority of amendments, Mrs Hieronymi – I would like to explain why this is the case."
"This explanation will enable you to understand that we are not opposing one particular amendment or another."
"Rather, it is in consideration of their appropriateness, or otherwise, that we are not accepting them."
"There are three groups of amendments."
"The first concerns the amendments introducing actions and objectives that do not come under the MEDIA programme."
"For example, as commendable as the amendment concerned may be, the MEDIA programme is not designed to meet the needs of disabled citizens, which would require, for example, cinemas in certain Member States to be adapted."
"We simply do not have the resources to invest in this area."
"However, it is, of course, a policy that we support in moral terms."
"The second group of amendments concerns actions and objectives that are already covered by the programme."
"There is therefore no need to repeat them."
"For example, there is no point in adding a priority that is already one of the actual headings for action under the programme."
"The third group of amendments concerns one of the priorities of the programme – an absolute priority, in my view – and that is the need to reduce the imbalances, within the audiovisual market, between countries with a high audiovisual production capacity and those with a small geographical and linguistic area."
"That is a crucial priority for the MEDIA programme."
"However, the proposed amendments would have the effect – unintended, I am sure – of limiting the actions that have been proposed by the Commission in favour of the new Member States."
"They would not strengthen co-productions either, which, for me, like, I believe, for you, are one of the crucial factors for improving collaboration beyond borders."
"Therefore, if I reject certain amendments, it is to prevent them from hindering some of the core priorities of the new text."
"I would like to criticise two other amendments: one on the Constitutional Treaty and one on opening up the programme to third countries."
"With regard to the Constitutional Treaty, the Commission’s position is not to accept references of this kind as long as the Treaty has not been ratified."
"As for the second amendment, it is desirable to follow the approach that has already been established and to consider such cooperation in the appropriate context, namely that of adhering to the conclusions of the Thessaloniki European Council."
"That being the case, Mr President, Mrs Hieronymi, I would like to say that, in light of the very great majority, indeed of almost all, of the amendments proposed by Parliament, the Commission will be amending its proposal."
"I thank you once again for the work that Parliament has done."
". Mr President, Commissioner, MEDIA 2007 represents the third generation of the MEDIA programme of support for the European film industry, which has a great and twofold objective, in that we want to help promote European culture across all borders, while at the same time promoting the creation of jobs with a significant future in the audiovisual sector."
"MEDIA 2007 is a joint effort, and so I very warmly thank the Commission – and you, Commissioner Reding, in particular – for the excellent cooperation, and your staff as well."
"I also wish to thank the Luxembourg and British Presidencies for their good cooperation and particularly, of course, the members of the Committee on Culture and Education and all the committees that advised us."
"The first thing to be said about MEDIA 2007 is that the programme is as urgently needed as ever it was, for European films are still outnumbered in Europe, with an average of 70% of the films shown in our cinemas still being of American origin."
"There are three essential reasons why this is so; the first is that cultural and linguistic diversity in Europe, while being our great asset, also makes for highly fragmented audiovisual markets, which – and this is the second reason – are largely characterised by small and medium-sized enterprises, which – thirdly – suffer from chronic under-capitalisation."
"All these considerations means that the MEDIA programme will be urgently needed over the next seven years."
"At the same time, it is evident that MEDIA is a highly successful programme, in that nine out of ten films shown outside their country of origin were supported by it."
"What now remains to be done is to increase European cinema’s overall market share, and that is why this third programme is to have the same priorities as before: training, development, distribution and promotion."
"Production itself remains a matter for the Member States."
"What changes does the programme propose to make?"
"One is a substantial increase in funding."
"Let me say that I am particularly grateful to the Commissioner for having, from the very outset, been firm in demanding an increase to EUR 1.055 billion."
"You can be sure – as can the Council – that this House as a whole will not be prepared to go below that amount, which represents the minimum that is needed for the audiovisual sector over the next seven years."
"Apart from that, what else has changed?"
"In every area, digitalisation is a priority; it is the technology of the future, which must, over the coming years, be made use of and developed."
"Secondly, there is a need for more cooperation at every level."
"Among other things, the European Union’s participation in the European Audiovisual Observatory will be of value, as will closer cooperation with Eurimages, but there is also a need for the networks to be strengthened."
"Let me close by saying something about the amendments that remain to be considered, particularly the amendments on the protection of juveniles tabled by the Union for a Europe of the Nations Group."
"Protection of the young is something of which we are all in favour, but it is not something that the film programme primarily exists to do; there are other programmes to do that, and so, on this point, we cannot agree to what you ask."
"My warmest thanks, though, to the House as a whole; we have shared in putting this programme together, and that is the best foundation for its future success."
". Mr President, it is clear that the strength of European culture does not, indeed cannot, lie in its buildings and its cathedrals."
"It is the creative ability of its citizens, of the people who live in Europe – its dreams, as Mrs Reding was saying – that create Europe’s strength, including its cultural strength."
"Its audiovisual industry can be a perfect example of that, not only in terms of protecting Europe in this era of large-scale global homogenisation, but also in terms of reinforcing the sense of a collective identity composed of so very many different identities, which create cultural diversity."
"That is why the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and my group, in particular, have been totally in favour of this Media 2007 programme from the outset."
"The programme contributes to shaping these undefined elements of European citizenship."
"It is therefore crucial to support the text as it stands."
"I believe, Commissioner, that it will be a matter of reflecting upon some of the amendments that you do not want."
"I imagine that there will be an opportunity to discuss them."
"Be that as it may, I am delighted to see that you are satisfied by the amendments that somewhat improve the text."
"I have the feeling that, in the course of this part-session, we will be voting in favour of a very fine text, which will enhance this European cultural dimension of the future."
". – Mr President, the report by Mrs Hieronymi on the proposed programme of support for the European audiovisual sector provides an opportunity for a brief but systematic diagnosis of the state of the European audiovisual market, on which small companies on fragmented national markets prevail, with little cross-border movement."
"However, the brief round-up today of the new results of the MEDIA and ΜEDIA Plus programmes gives good cause to hope, Commissioner, that the MEDIA 2007 programme will help to further stabilise competition between European and foreign audiovisual producers and that it will result in the multiple application of each of the EUR 1 055 million in investments, education and development works."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, on the proposed improvements to the proposed programme."
"It gives cause to hope that, by strengthening new technologies and promoting the competitiveness of the European cinema industry, European diversity and the maintenance and dissemination of the cinematic cultural heritage will be supported and opportunities will be given for new quality works which will promote the European idea, human values, human dignity, mutual respect, equality between men and women and the protection of childhood and youth."
"At the same time, investments under the programme in the stage before and after production will help to overcome the weaknesses of small national markets, in order to maintain and strengthen the cultural wealth in small countries such as my homeland."
"However, as the rapporteur notes, this cannot be achieved with national companies alone and needs non-national European companies; they just need to be given access to specialist credit institutions."
"Let us hope, Commissioner, that under your inspired guidance, the ratio of European to foreign audiovisual productions will be at least 50/50 by 2013."
". Mr President, Commissioner, within her very comprehensive report, Mrs Hieronymi has emphasised the importance of the Media 2007 programme’s proposals."
"The programme reuses the structure and the mechanisms of the current programmes, which have proved to have had a very positive impact on the audiovisual sector."
"The overall objectives of the future programme have been successfully adapted to the structure of businesses in the sector and to their funding requirements as well as to the development of technology and of the market in a very competitive environment."
"I will therefore simply highlight the fact that, with a funding package that represents 15% of the sum dedicated to promoting culture and European citizenship in the financial perspectives, the audiovisual sector and thus cultural diversity will be enhanced in a way that is advantageous."
"In actual fact, by pointing out that this sector is not only of great political and cultural importance, but that it also has great social and economic potential, the Commission is proposing to allocate to Media 2007 a budget of EUR 1.055 billion over the period 2007-2013 to fund its actions and administrative costs."
"The future Media 2007 programme would thus see the current budget for the MEDIA Plus and MEDIA Training programmes increase by more than 50%."
"It is the first post-enlargement programme, and the increase in the budget should enable effective support to be provided to professionals in the new Member States, who still often have reduced investment capacities and reduced access to bank lending."
"In its proposal, the Commission also recommends simplifying Community intervention with regard to administrative and financial procedures."
"Taking into account the entire set of proposals designed to improve a programme that has already proved its worth, Media 2007 deserves to be positively received, even if the package of EUR 1.055 billion is only an indicative amount for the moment, until such time as the financial perspectives are adopted."
"In view of the important funding requirements of a sector that, while fast expanding, is fragmented into numerous SMEs in the 27 countries concerned, it is clear that these financial perspectives are eagerly awaited."
"The Committee on Budgets therefore supports this new programme, which takes account of enlargement and of the difficulties SMEs have in accessing Community actions and funding."
"Improving this programme, which aims to put in place more flexible procedures thanks to the proportionality of requirements for recipient businesses, is also a crucial point."
"Thus, Media 2007 should enable the film industry and the European audiovisual sector to continue to develop their activities by rising to the challenges of global competition."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Hieronymi on the quality of her report and to thank her for having integrated the greater part of the opinions and comments of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"I will therefore get on to the main point."
"In order to maintain the lever effect that the MEDIA programme is acknowledged as having today in a more intensely competitive market, it is imperative that we continue to make sure that the programme is adaptable, that we continue to meet the expectations of professionals and, furthermore, that we continue to rise to the challenges represented by the arrival and the prodigious development of new formats, such as digital technology, or of new supports, such as mobile telephones."
"To be still more effective, MEDIA should not therefore just be following technological developments, but anticipating them, if not encouraging them."
"Thus, complementarity between MEDIA and other related programmes in the area of innovation and research is crucial and still needs to be enhanced."
"MEDIA 2007 is the first post-enlargement programme."
"Safeguarding the film productions of the new Member States on its own justifies an increase in European support, with care being taken, in particular, to establish proportionality in favour of these countries."
"We also have to support the indirect costs linked to the private funding of production projects."
"Such action would enable a large number of businesses to have increased access to bank loans, as the risks would be reduced."
"This access to bank loans by SMEs is a crucial factor in the development of a strong audiovisual industry."
"In this geopolitical and technological context, the budget of EUR 1.055 billion, as proposed by the Commission, is the minimum threshold for seven years and 27 countries."
"While I welcome the initiatives taken on this matter for encouraging and facilitating national investments, which have become crucial to the success of MEDIA’s forthcoming objectives, I cannot agree to MEDIA being subjected to our whims when we debate the financial perspectives."
"Those are the conditions that will mean that MEDIA, which has a crucial bearing on the Lisbon objectives being met, can enable one of the most promising sectors in terms of job creation and economic growth to be developed and enhanced."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to congratulate rapporteur Ruth Hieronymi on the successful conclusion of our joint cooperation."
"Our Committee on Culture and Education considers it important to put digitisation and European catalogues at the centre of the ‘Media 2007’ programme."
"We see this as the key to surmounting the fragmentation of the European market."
"Whereas a large part of the programme is like giving a fish to a starving person, digitisation is equivalent to teaching a person to fish."
"The European Commission should become actively involved in finding the most suitable digitisation platform and in establishing standards."
"The addition of subtitles is closely linked to digitisation."
"Digital media make it possible to select a combination of languages and subtitles as necessary."
"The favouring of subtitles over dubbing promotes language learning, literacy and improved understanding between cultures."
"For people with hearing disabilities, however, the presence of subtitles is of the utmost importance."
"I sincerely regret that the programme does not devote sufficient attention to the needs of disabled people."
"As a representative of a small country, I am also glad that the quota system and other measures will support content producers from the smallest and poorest linguistic areas."
"The Estonian market is so small that international distribution is the only way to recoup the cost of the production of films."
"Some of our cartoon producers have achieved international recognition without using any text in their work."
"This is a case of resourcefulness by necessity, which has now become a distinctive tradition."
"For small producers, it is important that digitisation should significantly reduce distribution costs."
"Also, using subtitles instead of hiring actors offers a real opportunity to cut costs."
"I would be very glad if ‘Media 2007’ led to better utilisation of underused studios and other film-making resources."
"I would like to see the European Union play a more active role in the organisation of film distribution."
"The idea is that Europe should regain its position from American cinema."
"Thank you, and once again I would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to compliment Mrs Hieronymi on the excellent work that has been produced."
"Our audiovisual heritage is without doubt a valuable channel for consolidating our common historical identity and for understanding our diverse cultures, which form the basis for developing European citizenship."
"It is no accident that films are already recognised in law as a cultural asset in some countries."
"I endorse the rapporteur’s proposal in Amendment 71 to establish a network of databases encompassing the European audiovisual heritage."
"In that respect, Commissioner, I must point out that, during the debate in this Chamber on the Hegyi report on the preservation of our film heritage on 9 May 2005, I proposed setting up a European themed film archive to preserve a careful selection of films about historical events and episodes relating to the development of the Community project."
"Another sensitive issue is funding: we have to remedy the chronic undercapitalisation of the sector by providing better access to credit facilities for the audiovisual industry and enabling small and medium-sized enterprises to benefit from special financial services."
"I therefore welcome the rapporteur’s Amendments 10 and 59."
"Of course, in the EU’s current situation, I regard the proposal to commit financial resources amounting to EUR 1 005 million over the 2007-2013 period as the absolute minimum needed to achieve the programme’s goals."
"Next, it is important to encourage the development of new talent; that is why I shall vote for the rapporteur’s Amendment 56, which proposes establishing a scholarship named after Pier Paolo Pasolini for young talent."
"Lastly, with regard to the use of new technologies, as also suggested by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy I propose that the Commission should take charge of evaluating pilot projects that have been carried out and of disseminating them if they prove to be successful experiments."
". Mr President, I will be no exception in this debate in congratulating our rapporteur on this ambitious report, and I welcome also the Commission’s ideas tonight, which, I believe, demonstrate a unity of purpose between our two institutions."
"I have a vested interest in this debate: Scotland, as an English-speaking EU member nation, should be – could be – leading the audiovisual sector within Europe in building a bridge to our competitors in the US."
"Sadly, while ample means of support exists on the EU side, this area remains a cruelly untapped potential for Scotland, as for Europe."
"Fortunately, the solutions are at our hands."
"I believe there is broad agreement in this chamber tonight on the broad policy thrusts, though, for me, the key policy areas are digitisation and distribution, and how the EU side can facilitate internal EU dissemination of our own talent."
"Sadly, however, I suspect that, ultimately, the arguments will come down to money and the mean-spirited arguments put forward by my own UK Government."
"I hope colleagues will unite around this report and send as loud and as clear a message to the Council as we can."
"Mr President, this report observes that there is limited cultural diversity within quite a few of the EU Member States’ respective film industries."
"It is clear that European films have difficulty holding their own against their American competitors."
"Irrespective of whether we regard this fact as a problem or as something we have to accept, the question we should ask ourselves is the following: ought the EU to deal with political issues of this type or do such issues fall within the Member States’ area of responsibility?"
"The June List’s answer is clear: this is an issue for the Member States."
"If the Member States wish to invest resources of their own in promoting their national film industries, they of course have every right to do so."
"The EU should not, however, implement special programmes to benefit the European film industry."
"If a number of EU countries think it necessary to cooperate within this policy area, they can, moreover, do so without EU interference."
"Intergovernmental agreements or cooperation between film companies can take place outside the framework of the EU."
"Amendment 15 refers to the EU Constitution which, it stresses, emphasises the value of respecting cultural and linguistic diversity."
"However, that is no legitimate reason for supporting EU programmes like this."
"Members of this Chamber must accept that the populations of France and the Netherlands voted against the EU Constitution, which has thus been rejected and is no longer a relevant source of reference."
"The Committee on Culture and Education wishes to invest more than EUR 1 billion in this programme."
"The EU does not need further questionable and expensive projects."
"It should instead aim for limited cooperation on significant and genuinely cross-border issues."
"– The content of this programme and colleague Ruth Hieronymi's report entirely match the spirit of the Culture Convention adopted by the United Nations."
"It is realistic to hope that a particularly important goal of the programme will be achieved with the implementation of this programme – the strengthening of the European audio and visual sectors in their difficult and thus far losing competitive battle with low quality products, which are particularly poor in content and which today continue to flood the European market."
"Such low value cultural products do most damage to the new countries of the European Union, some of which are small."
"I might include my own country Lithuania."
"Such products not only destroy cultural consciousness, but also create the demand for a low value culture, which requires no intellectual effort."
"I therefore ask you to approve the proposal I have submitted, which takes the needs of specific new small European Union countries and their societies into account, to support countries, which do not have the capacity to create audio visual products of sufficient quality through grants."
"Thank you."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I think that we agree on the findings; we have debated them numerous times in our committee, the subject has now been exhausted and we agree on the conclusions."
"The European audiovisual sector is highly fragmented."
"European cinema productions are being made within the framework of one state, resulting of course in a cultural and linguistic diversity in cinema productions."
"Nonetheless, the immense wealth in terms of the linguistic and cultural diversity of Europe is, at the same time, the cause of the greatest structural problem on the audiovisual markets in Europe."
"It is because of this situation and numerous other reasons that transatlantic productions, as everyone has said, have a 70% and hence a dominant position on the European market, while the balance of trade deficit of the European Union to the United States totals USD eight billion."
"However, the problem is not one of numbers."
"It is primarily cultural."
"For example, has European culture been disseminated to Asia or Africa through the cinema over the last 20 years?"
"Of course not."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, on her report."
"The audiovisual industry is one of the most rapidly growing sectors in Europe."
"In the EU over one billion people went to the cinema in 2004, yet American films dominate the industry, holding 71% of the market."
"So far the European Union has failed to make effective use of its own audiovisual market."
"This ultimately means lost opportunities for growth and employment in Europe."
"Europe has tremendous linguistic and cultural diversity and this must be capitalised on through the audiovisual sector."
"I have seen the importance of this sector at first hand in my own region in the west of Ireland, where the Irish language is spoken."
"It has gone from strength to strength in recent years."
"People go to the cinema more often in Ireland than in any other EU country."
"The importance of a vibrant European-based audiovisual industry cannot be over-emphasised."
"It is a channel providing important opportunities for communicating the key values underlying Europe’s rich cultural heritage and it must therefore be supported in every possible way."
". Mr President, I should like to thank the Members for their very positive contribution."
"It is true that European cinema has several dimensions to it."
"It has an economic dimension."
"It is undoubtedly one of the cultural industries that makes a positive contribution to the important issue of industrial competitiveness featured in the Lisbon Strategy."
"However, it is not only a commercial industry, it is also a cultural industry, as it is enriched by cultural diversity."
"What we are talking about are the stories of Europeans, which must be told by Europeans; the dreams of Europeans, which must be put on film by Europeans; and cultural diversity in its entirety, which must find its way onto our cinema screens."
"That is why the Commission truly is keen to invest in cultural diversity and to help this diversity to function."
"I will not repeat here the comments made by Members, because I almost entirely agree with them."
"I would, however, like to come back to two points, which I did not mention in my introduction."
"Firstly, I agree with all those who said that digital technology is of the utmost importance: digital technology is an opportunity for diversity because, once the technology is installed, it will enable films to be distributed much more easily and at a lower cost."
"Secondly, it will be much easier to choose between languages than with today’s analogue system."
"Digital technology therefore represents, in my opinion, an opportunity for our film industries and an opportunity for us to learn about other cultures in Europe."
"Furthermore, that is one of the reasons why the MEDIA 2007 programme is seeking to make further progress along this path."
"I have been very alert to the comments made with regard to protecting young people."
"Rest assured that protecting young people in the audiovisual sector is one of my main priorities."
"It also features in the special recommendations and in the Television Without Frontiers Directive, which is currently being revised."
"Members’ demands concerning the protection of young people against any possible forms of abuse are therefore taken into account."
"I have also been very alert to the comments made by some Members about the new Member States and about countries with a lower audiovisual production capacity or a small linguistic area."
"I am not only addressing you here in my role as Commissioner, but also as someone who hails from Luxembourg."
"Each time a film is made in the Luxemburgish language – and such films do exist – I feel proud and moved."
"I would like all of the small linguistic areas to be able to produce films in their own language, even if the market for these films is, it must be acknowledged, very small."
"Thus, there is all the more reason to help these small linguistic areas, and we are doing so in the MEDIA programme."
"There is another point which, I believe, I put forward within the Committee on Culture and Education, but which I should like to reiterate here, in plenary: my proposal for positive discrimination in favour of the new Member States, which are in need of more clearly targeted help, enabling them unquestionably to take advantage of the MEDIA programme, was unanimously agreed upon at the Council of Ministers."
"All of the ministers, even those who had to give up a slice of their cake in order to help the others, were in agreement."
"This is the Europe that we cherish."
"This is the Europe of solidarity, and I am pleased that the Members have further enhanced this aspect of solidarity through their amendments."
"We need film production to be diverse, including in those territories with a low audiovisual production capacity and a small linguistic area, because those fragments of our Europe also contribute to the European patchwork of cultures."
"We need everyone; we need widely spoken languages and large countries, lesser spoken languages and small countries, because there is no such thing as the large, and important, and the small, and unimportant, in all of this."
"There are only great cultures, be they large or small, and I am proud to be able to contribute to this patchwork of diversity."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.30 a.m."
"The Commission designated 2007 as the Year of Equal Opportunities."
"Disadvantaged groups must be given a more significant role in the media in order to facilitate their integration."
"The largest ethnic minority in Europe are the approximately 15 million Roma people, who form one of the most disadvantaged social groups of the Member States."
"At the same time, the culture of the Roma enriches and fertilises the social and cultural life of European countries and makes it more colourful."
"The media has a prominent role in the equal opportunity society."
"Disadvantaged groups, including the Roma, must be given more opportunities to appear in the media, to an extent that reflects their significance; new media suitable for this purpose must be created and used, and all of this must be supported by EU financial assistance."
"We must encourage public media to promote understanding between cultures."
"The Roma minority, present in all European countries, must be effectively supported in their media appearances, in their integration process and in the preservation of their cultural values."
"The formulation and implementation of European and local strategies required to achieve this must support the recent steps taken to set up the Pan-European Roma TV."
"– The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0287/2005), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on shipments of waste [15311/4/2004 – C6-0223/2005 – 2003/0139(COD)] (rapporteur: Johannes Blokland)."
". Mr President, as rapporteur, I am pleased to be able to say that Parliament has, at second reading, reached agreement with the Council on the waste shipments regulation."
"Of the 90 amendments that were adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Council has accepted 50 in full; 17 amendments have been replaced by 12 compromise amendments and the other 23 amendments lapsed as a result of the overall compromise."
"It is a result to be proud of, in my view, certainly if we bear in mind the fact that the Commission’s position on the legal basis means that unanimity is required in the Council."
"I would like to thank the Council, and the British Presidency in particular, for the constructive and pleasant working relationship."
"That certainly also applies to the shadow rapporteurs of the other groups."
"I am delighted that a compromise package has been achieved in such a short space of time which enjoys such broad support from the groups."
"In the latter stages of the negotiations, we mainly talked about the two key components, namely the enforcement of the regulation and the dismantling of decommissioned ships, on which two topics I should like to expand."
"With regard to enforcement, since 1993, there has been a regulation in place for the shipment of waste."
"It appears, though, that this regulation is not being observed properly, as many illegal waste shipments take place."
"You are probably familiar with the example of the British undertaking which, in March of this year, was caught illegally exporting no fewer than 60 sea containers full of rotting and foul-smelling household waste to China."
"The forged documents indicated that the shipment concerned waste paper recovery."
"Last week, the British Environmental Agency admitted that following the inspection of sea containers, 75% of the waste shipments appear to be illegal."
"In June 2005, it even transpired in France that 100% of the inspected waste shipments were irregular."
"From this, we can conclude that, instead of the odd enforcement campaign, clear rules on waste transports are absolutely vital and that they need to be enforced in a structurally sound manner."
"The compromise package now stipulates that Member States are required to inspect the paperwork and the physical shipments."
"They must also work in tandem with each other in order to prevent and trace illegal waste shipments."
"Moreover, the Council agreed that personnel from the Member States should be deployed permanently in order to ensure that this cooperation actually takes place."
"With this, arrangements are put in place in order to back up regular physical inspections of the actual shipments."
"I would like to ask the Commission to continue the enforcement campaigns in the framework of the IMPEL network and to embed them structurally in the organisation."
"I would also like to say a few words about decommissioned ships. All groups have expressed their concern about the way in which these are dismantled."
"Since, in the next few years, an unusually high number of ships will be decommissioned as a result of single-hulled tankers being phased out, global measures to prevent dumping in places such as Asia are of paramount importance."
"Sadly, the strict measures taken unilaterally by the European Union to ensure the safe and environmentally-responsible dismantling of ships can be circumvented simply by, at the end of a ship’s life, changing the flag over to that of a country outside the European Union."
"Consequently, the ILO and IMO must set to work in order to draft compulsory conditions that provide an effective solution to the problem of decommissioned ships."
"The Council has declared it will extend the capacity for dismantling ships in the European Union. Moreover, the Council has pledged its 100% commitment to concluding the previously mentioned global agreement on the dismantling of ships."
"Although I have a great deal of sympathy for a number of amendments by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, as rapporteur, I must advise against their adoption in the light of the agreement that has been reached with the Council."
"Finally, I should like to make an urgent appeal to the Commission not to resort to legal action again on account of the legal basis."
"I do not believe that a legal battle between the European institutions would benefit the environment; it would hamper the progress of the implementation of this regulation."
"I hope that the Commission also realises that the review of this directive serves a greater purpose and I am relying on the support of the Commissioner for the Environment, Mr Dimas, in this."
". Mr President, I should like to thank the European Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, for the work which they have done on the present report at second reading."
"One of the main objectives of the proposed new regulation on shipments of waste is to ensure that the European Union aligns with international requirements for shipments of waste, both at OECD and United Nations level, in other words with the Basel Convention."
"The other main objective is to address the problems which arise during the application and administrative management of and the imposition of compliance with the existing regulation."
"Consequently, the new regulation also seeks to contribute to greater clarity and better lawmaking on shipments of waste."
"The relevant discussions in the Council were held during the Italian and Irish Presidencies."
"At first reading, the Commission amended the proposal and approved 43 of the 103 amendments proposed by the European Parliament in full, in part or in principle."
"The Council's common position incorporated 41 of the amendments of the European Parliament."
"The common position is an important step forwards, as far as improving the clarity of the regulation and its provisions is concerned, in keeping always with the objectives set."
"I should like to point out that our aim is to close this particular dossier as quickly as possible."
"We need this new regulation in order to improve the clarity and application of the rules governing shipments of waste and in order to achieve compliance with the European Union's international commitments."
"However, the Commission did not accept the common position as regards three specific issues, which it reasoned in a statement through an announcement to the European Parliament on 1 July 2005."
"These issues are the legal basis for the regulation, the objections of the Member States on shipments of waste intended for recovery and a provision on the exemption of animal by-products from the scope of the regulation."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety voted in favour of 90 amendments to the common position."
"The Commission considers that 74 of these are acceptable in full or in principle, but is unable to accept 16 of the amendments."
"Maintaining the internal market is a question of fundamental importance to the Commission."
"Today, waste for recovery is moved freely between the Member States, provided that it adheres to strict environmental protection rules and the principle of proportionality."
"A robust European recycling market helps to reduce the environmental impact caused by the use of natural resources."
"The free movement of waste for recovery has already been established in the existing regulation on shipments of waste, the provisions of the Treaty of the European Communities on the free movement of goods and the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"The changes which the Council's common position proposes would create serious obstacles to the internal recycling market and are not acceptable to the Commission."
"Amendment 35 might prevent possible problems on the internal market."
"It makes provision for maximum deadlines for formulating objections to shipments of waste for recovery on the basis of national standards."
"Such objections can only be raised up to the day on which specific Community legislation enters into force and no later than four years after the present regulation enters into force."
"If the proposed amendment is approved, it will address the concerns expressed by the Commission about the recycling market."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by saying that, in general terms, the proposal from the Commission has been a good one."
"And I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on the great effort he has made, which has enabled us to achieve certain compromise amendments which have been accepted by the majority of the political groups, and this is going to enable us to reach an agreement at second reading."
"Nevertheless, I would like to point out that though we have accepted the compromise amendments, we have certain reservations with regard to the change of legal basis."
"We preferred the Commission’s proposal, which did not eliminate the legal basis of international trade policy, Article 133."
"Whether we like it or not, waste is merchandise, and that is how we must treat it."
"Furthermore, more than 50% of the text relates to the transport of waste outside of the European Union."
"That does not prevent us from also taking account of the issue of the environment, since that is a very important issue."
"Neither do we agree on removing our proposal on tacit consent."
"I believe that we must give the administrations reasonable time to respond to requests for shipments of waste or, otherwise, to apply what is known as ‘administrative silence’ or ‘tacit consent’."
"The European Parliament has expressed its concern about the problem of ships which are exported for scrapping and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is pleased that the Council is going to make a statement indicating that it is the Member States with a voice in the International Maritime Organisation that must promote the adoption of rules at international level."
"I would like to point out that my political group cannot accept any of the amendments presented by the Verts/ALE Group and, in particular, the one which refers to animal by-products."
"We already have a regulation that deals with them and that, furthermore, is much stricter than this regulation; we cannot therefore increase the bureaucracy gratuitously."
"Finally, I would like to say to the European Commission that, within the framework of better legislation, it is important, in a future modification of the framework Directive on waste, to revise all of the definitions, such as that of recycling, for example."
"We cannot carry on relying on the judgments of the Court of Justice in order to interpret your own directives."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to express my appreciation and congratulations to Mr Blokland who has immersed himself in the waste issue and has shown himself to be a single-minded defender of environmental quality."
"Waste must be shipped for processing and for recovery purposes."
"If things go well, we will end up with ever-decreasing quantities of waste."
"More and more components of what we throw out and discard are given a second, or third, lease of life."
"Large quantities are needed to make the processing of waste worthwhile and a certain quantity is needed in order to process it profitably."
"As a result, waste markets have started to transcend borders and that is why common rules are desperately needed."
"The first question is: what legal basis we choose?"
"As I see it, it is clear that what matters most here is the protection of the environment."
"It is not the intention to strengthen the internal market, and I am pleased that the Council has adopted Parliament’s opinion."
"I am also pleased that the Council recognises that there is a problem with the dismantling of ships."
"It would be all too easy to abandon ships for scrapping in countries where the environmental rules do not amount to much."
"It is unfortunate that waste processing is still a sector that is, right or wrongly, known for its illegal practices."
"In the interest of the waste sector, illegal practices must be tackled."
"Waste processing is a normal and respected activity, and of vital importance to society, the economy and the environment."
"We should therefore treat it with the utmost care, and while Member States must stand united in banning illegal transports and practices, there is, of course, nothing to be gained from raising the bar too high."
"No complex procedures are needed for minor waste shipments, such as waste that originates during travel."
"Moreover, it must be possible for entrepreneurs, in the framework of manufacturer responsibility, to recover components without having to negotiate a mountain of paperwork first."
"On this we can all readily agree."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports the compromise package that was tabled by Mr Blokland and we will not in any event be backing the amendments of the Group of the Greens/European Free alliance on animal waste."
"Finally, there are still many areas in the waste sector that lack clarity."
"European legislation is still fragmented."
"We need framework legislation that promotes waste prevention, reuse and recycling."
"Legislation that gives clear guidelines to entrepreneurs and spells out the long-term goals."
"Legislation that also provides clear definitions and, above all, promotes innovation in all the Member States."
"Legislation that will also promote employment in the waste sector, for we need that as a matter of urgency."
"Let us hope that the proposals for framework legislation will not be too long in coming."
". Mr President, I left Cyprus at 7 a.m. and have spent most of the day in aeroplanes, buses and cars in order to be here this evening."
"That, I can assure you, is not very conducive to engaging in long debates, especially since the House – understandably so – is almost empty."
"I will therefore confine myself to making the following brief comments and I hope I will not be testing your patience too much."
"A regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on shipments of waste is a very important piece of legislation which is much needed and is, unfortunately, long overdue."
"The subject-matter is always controversial: it is very often in the public eye and is close to the heart of the ordinary citizen because it matters so much."
"Consequently, it is the paramount responsibility of Parliament, the Council and the Commission to get things right."
"It is noteworthy that the European Parliament has put a lot of effort into working through and streamlining this regulation."
"This is evident from the fact that, at first reading, the European Parliament adopted no less than 103 amendments, and, on this occasion, 90 amendments have been adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"In dealing with the Council’s common position, the rapporteur of this recommendation for second reading, Mr Blokland, has shown much wisdom and determination, for which he is to be congratulated and supported."
"In my view, the most important item in the common position and recommendation for second reading is the choice of environment as the single legal base, thus highlighting that the main aim of the Council is the environment, not – as some wanted and tried hard to achieve – the enhancement of trade in waste material."
"This is what I am hoping for, and I would like to add my voice to those who urged the Commission not to challenge this in court."
"A point of difference with the Council has been the total exclusion of animal by-products from the scope of the regulation."
"I feel this is unjustified."
"I agree with the rapporteur that animal by-product waste should be included in order to ensure that such waste is shipped in an environmentally and hygienically correct and responsible fashion."
"In conclusion, I, along with most members of the Committee on the Environment, I am sure, hope that the Commission will facilitate this regulation by coming forward in due course with sensible and stringent proposals on the waste framework directive and with a strategy on waste prevention and recycling."
"I also hope, as the rapporteur just mentioned, that ways will be found to deal effectively with the ever-present problem of application and implementation."
". Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Blokland for his good work on this piece of legislation, but my Group is disappointed with the compromise package and we have therefore submitted a number of amendments."
"For example, waste should only be shipped where truly necessary and unfortunately the proposed regulation is not as strong as it should be on this."
"A particularly important case here is that of persistent organic pollutants."
"The regulation implementing the Stockholm Convention does not deal with a shipment of POPs as or contained in waste, so the waste shipment regulation urgently needs to do so."
"This would help to avoid shipments of POPs in waste from countries that could and should deal with the waste themselves."
"If this provision had been in place two years ago, the export of the so-called ‘ghost fleet’ – dilapidated US navy ships full of PCBs sailing from the US to the UK – could have been stopped on legal grounds."
"Regrettably, the compromise does not cover this issue."
"Neither does it properly address dismantling of ships."
"Large numbers of EU ships will soon need to be scrapped following the recent and welcome decision to accelerate the phase-out of single-hull tankers, but there is a very real danger that they will be dumped on Asian beaches to be dealt with under very poor conditions."
"For these reasons my Group will be abstaining and not voting in favour of this package."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, for the sound and very extensive work he has done on this report."
"Obviously, we should also have liked to have got more out of the compromise with the Council."
"We have chosen not to put our names to it because we should have liked it to have had still more force to it but, at the same time, it is extremely doubtful whether a conciliation really would have been enough in order to achieve a result better than that achieved in these negotiations."
"When it comes to the legal base, we definitely want to defend treating these matters as environmental."
"The aim must be to deal with the serious environmental problems that arise in connection with the trade in waste."
"We think that it is quite absurd to view dangerous waste as a commodity like any other, and we therefore believe that Article 175 should be the sole legal base."
"In his introduction, the rapporteur discussed the lack of compliance with the existing rules."
"We can no doubt anticipate the new rules too being broken to some extent."
"Everything should therefore be done to ensure that they really are complied with."
"In that respect, the regulations before us could have had more bite to them, but the fact that they do not means that the Commission has that much more responsibility for really ensuring that these rules are implemented in practice."
"We must hope that you will apply yourselves to this matter instead of bringing the legal base into question."
"I also agree that, where the scrapping of ships is concerned, significantly stricter international regulations are required, and that is an issue to which we need to return as quickly as possible."
"I must agree with rapporteur Mr Blokland that, regarding the legal text in question, Article 175 provides the most appropriate legal basis."
"The aim of the directive is primarily to protect the environment, rather than to facilitate trade in waste or to support ‘waste tourism’, whereby waste businesses export waste to countries with the most lenient legal regulations."
"This directive is of special importance for smaller Member States and, in particular, for new Member States that often lack the resources and facilities for handling dangerous waste."
"We must prevent them from becoming “dumpsites” for larger states."
"What is needed is the harmonisation of rules governing the interstate transport of waste, because waste knows no borders, and in case of accidents or disasters it can be dangerous not only for the country of final destination, but also for the transit country."
"It is equally important to require the consent of the country of destination and to apply a system of notification in writing."
"I believe that we need strict, clear and transparent rules that will enable control and monitoring of the types and locations of waste."
"The country of destination must be notified in writing of the transport of waste in sufficient time to be able to decide whether it will accept the waste or not."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I think Mr Blokland has done a very good job, and the final compromise amendments demonstrate his willingness to compromise, which augurs well for waste management."
"There are, however, a number of things in this proposal to which I would like to return."
"Not only is the proposal that waste law should also cover animal by-products lacking in any kind of logic, but it is also dangerous."
"Regulation 1774/2002/EC already contains stringent rules on animal by-products; it is a s prescribing in very precise form the manner in which animal by-products are to be collected, transported, processed and used, specifying, for example, the way in which vehicles and containers are to be disinfected and cleaned."
"That makes this regulation more stringent than the legislation on waste."
"As is required in the Council’s Common Position, animal by-products must generally be excluded for the sake of legal clarity."
"This attempt at including them is also dangerous."
"The fact is that we overlooked something in Regulation 1774/2002/EC. One of the exceptions provided for in it is that dead animals may also be buried as waste."
"One consequence of that was that officialdom, in several places, banned animal cemeteries and required people to bury their dead animals – covered as they were by waste legislation – in landfill sites."
"The fact is that this sort of confusion is quite unacceptable, and so it is vitally important that this should be removed from this regulation."
"I have just a couple more points on shipment."
"A compromise has, to be sure, been reached, and we have yet to see how it can be implemented, but, before it is, we must ensure that waste management is not removed from the internal market and that the shipment of waste is not excluded from it."
"To do so would be wrong."
"One consequence of it that we must prevent – and this is my second point – is something for which there may be some enthusiasm in some countries, namely waste management becoming, again, something for municipalities to deal with, thereby using their own plant to the utmost and preventing waste from being shipped."
"Rules must be enacted to prevent such a thing."
"If they are, the compromise will be a good one."
"Mr President, I should also like to thank the rapporteur for his very efficient and effective work on this report."
"However, as has been said, the Verts/ALE Group has tabled amendments that reflect our position on a number of specific issues that we needed to reiterate."
"Waste, and particularly hazardous waste, should only be transported where there is no alternative; the legislation has to be effective and enforceable to that end."
"Waste should include all types of waste, including animal by-products, and we should be very clear as to our definition of waste ships."
"As other Members have already said, since the EU decided to phase out single hull tankers, this issue has become more important."
"We know that we do not have the capacity within the EU to treat the waste ships ourselves, but it is urgent that we stop the dismantling of European ships in Asia under terrible social and environmental conditions."
"We already have international agreements governing aspects of waste policy."
"It is very important that there be consistency between those agreements and new European legislation so that the very highest standards are adopted."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a well-known and long-established fact that waste is exported to countries where, because of their economic or political dependence, they merely collect rather than actually dispose of the leftovers from what richer societies consume."
"The more developed countries’ inability to recycle has also produced paradoxical situations of economic dependence on certain resources."
"One example is ferrous metals."
"It first happened in relation to eastern Europe and then in relation to developing countries."
"These countries have learnt to create new wealth from the waste, although often at the expense of serious harm to the environment."
"The Blokland report is – quite rightly – concerned about the environmental soundness of transporting waste, which is an operation that cannot and must not be managed according to free trade principles."
"Water tables, river basins and the atmosphere know no administrative or state boundaries, because the planet does not function in closed compartments."
"The report marks a step forwards in limiting, if not eliminating, environmental fraud; in improving notification of the hazards of transported waste; in improving environmentally sound disposal processes; and in upholding the principle of the sovereignty of individual countries, guaranteeing each one the right to accept waste or not."
"Mr President, the intention was that the new proposal on the monitoring of trade in waste would be drafted in line with the principle of better regulation."
"The latter was adopted by Parliament, the Commission and the Council in 2001, and aims to ensure that the best possible legislation is produced and that the regulations adopted are beneficial and clear."
"In my opinion, however, the draft report contains superfluous provisions that impose unnecessary restrictions on this sector of the economy and hinder its development, instead of improving the transport of waste."
"This is yet another example of overregulation and the production of legislation that fails to take account of the actual state of affairs."
"In order to limit the movement of waste, the rapporteur has proposed banning the export of any waste that can be dealt with at the point of its generation."
"It would be impossible for the new Member States to implement this provision, since it is hardly likely that thousands of new plants would be built at locations where waste is stored and generated."
"I am in favour of unrestricted trade in waste within the common market."
"Some of the provisions that have been drafted are evidence of a worrying trend, since they bear the hallmarks of overregulation and unnecessary legislative duplication."
"Relevant examples of this include the addition of ships and aeroplanes to the list of hazardous wastes, and the ban on the export of ships and aircraft intended for scrap."
"I would note that such issues are regulated under conventions adopted by the International Maritime Organisation and the International Civil Aviation Organisation."
"Both the Member States and the European Union are signatories to these conventions."
"I also fail to understand why it is necessary to tighten up regulations on the export of household waste."
"Once again, this issue is regulated under the 1999 Landfill Directive."
"The same applies to trade in animal by-products, which is covered by the Veterinary Directive currently in force."
"In my opinion, the regulations should be harmonised and made more detailed in the light of international conventions."
"This proposal should not serve as an excuse to lay down new standards and to move the goalposts where environmental protection is concerned."
". Mr President, I have listened carefully to Members’ comments and I would like to give you my further reactions to the proposed amendments."
"The Commission was very pleased to see the importance which the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment attaches to the environmental consequences of end-of-life ships and ship recycling and we fully share the concerns expressed by the committee."
"However, the proposed amendments would, in our view, not be the right way forward for the following reasons. Work is currently being done to address these issues within the fora of the International Maritime Organization, the International Labour Organization and the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste."
"Progress has been made within the IMO towards an international agreement on the subject."
"It would therefore be appropriate to agree at international level on the solutions to these important problems before changing our internal European Union regulation."
"On the other hand, we would support a recital referring to the work of the relevant international fora, in line with the Council’s conclusions on ship dismantling of 24 June 2005."
"We could therefore fully support the compromise proposal on this point."
"In addition, there are a number of amendments concerning further restrictions on the free movement of waste for recovery which would, in the Commission’s view, not correspond to the objective of creating clearer and better regulation."
"The Commission, on this basis, could not accept the proposed amendments 4, 27, 30, 31, 33, 37, 54, 56 and 68."
"The Commission maintains its statement with regard to Article 12(1)(c) in the common position to which Amendment 31 is linked."
"However, we could support the compromise proposal on other points."
"The question has been raised of coherence between the waste shipment regulation and the waste framework directive, which is now coming up for review."
"We can confirm that we will ensure that full coherence is maintained between this regulation and the planned revision of the waste framework directive and, of course, we will ensure consistency with regard to definitions in the thematic strategy on waste."
"With regard to animal by-products, the Commission’s proposal fulfils the same environmental objectives as Amendment 91."
"Our objective is to ensure that the necessary environmental safeguards are in place for the shipment of animal by-products."
"Therefore, our proposal says that the stricter of the two regulations should apply."
"However, the Commission does not want both regulations to apply at the same time to the same shipment and therefore we cannot accept Amendment 91."
"In conclusion, I am pleased to say that the Commission can accept 87 of the 113 proposed amendments, fully or in principle."
"These proposed amendments include strengthening the enforcement of the regulation, clarification of its provisions and further alignment with the Basel Convention."
"I will provide Parliament’s Secretariat with a complete list of the Commission’s positions on the amendments."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.30 a.m."
"Annex – Position of the Commission"
"The Commission can accept the following amendments in full: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 32, 34, 35, 36, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 55, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 82, 84, 85, 90, 100."
"The following amendments are acceptable in principle: 3, 39, 46, 67, 69, 83, 89."
"The Commission cannot accept the following amendments: 4, 5, 9, 11, 27, 30, 31, 33, 37, 54, 56, 68, 81, 86, 87, 88, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 101."
"Should the compromise package be adopted, the Commission could also accept new amendments 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113."
"– The next item is the recommendation (A6-0301/2005), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases [16056/5/2004 – C6-0221/2005 – 2003/0189A(COD)] (rapporteur: Avril Doyle); and"
"the recommendation (A6-0294/2005), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to emissions from air-conditioning systems in motor vehicles and amending Council Directive 70/156/EEC [16056/5/2004 – C6-0221/2005 – 2003/0189A(COD)] (rapporteur: Avril Doyle)."
". Mr President, this is a package of two pieces of legislation and I am rapporteur for both; hence the time allocated to me."
"I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues in the PPE-DE Group and all the political groups for a wide-ranging discussion and debates."
"We did not agree on everything but we have had a lot of discussion on the very interesting issues contained in both these pieces of legislation."
"The background is that the fluorinated gases were introduced in the nineties to replace the ozone-depleting CFCs and HCFCs."
"They are used in all sorts of applications, some essential, others less so: in insulating foams, aerosols, refrigeration and air conditioning systems, in fire protection equipment and even in the soles of air technology jogging shoes."
"As the debate on climate change developed following the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the harmful impact of these fluorinated gases, owing to their high global warming potential or GWP, became recognised as a major contributor – 5% and rising – to the ‘greenhouse effect’."
"Of the six greenhouse gases listed in the annex to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, three are fluorinated gases."
"The aim of this legislation is to enable Member States to meet their Kyoto targets by containing the leakage and restricting the use of fluorinated gases."
"Whereas the original Commission proposal to Parliament was in the form of one regulation with a single market legal base – Article 95 – the Council reached a common position which took the form of two separate texts: a directive based on Article 95 and a regulation based on a dual legal base consisting of Articles 175 and 95."
"The rationale for the split of the Commission proposal into two different texts was to move all the requirements relating to emissions from air conditioning in motor vehicles from the proposed regulation to the framework directive for type-approval of motor vehicles, Directive 70/156/EEC."
"The proposed regulation would then focus on the remaining stationary applications."
"As far as the mobile air conditioning or MAC Directive is concerned, I am of the opinion that a balance has to be struck between, on the one hand, being technology-prescriptive in relation to the global warming potential of the gases to be allowed according to the directive and, on the other hand, promoting the development of alternative environmental technologies."
"As it now stands, the ban in the directive applies to gases with a global warming potential higher than 150, meaning that HFC-152a – which has a global warming potential of about 120 – can still be used."
"This will allow further innovation and development of alternative technologies with regard to air conditioning systems."
"Reducing the GWP threshold in mobile air conditioning will effectively mean that the development of CO2 technology is the only option for European car manufacturers at the present time."
"While I recognise that European industry is a world leader in this technology and I commend its achievements, the current state-of-the-art CO2 systems have a number of disadvantages which make them unsuitable for export outside the EU."
"First of all, they involve very high pressure equipment, which would present health and safety risks to mechanics who do not have the expertise to service them."
"Outside the EU, where F-gas technology will remain mainstream, the service networks for such systems will simply not exist."
"Secondly, CO2 technology is not suitable for use in certain extreme temperatures, in very hot climates for instance."
"Setting the threshold at 150 GWP does not exclude the further refinement of CO2 technology, but it would allow our car manufacturers to maintain market penetration in all areas of the world."
"By coming down from the present position to 150 GWP, there is at least a ten-fold decrease – 1000% – in emissions and there would be negligible extra benefit – about 2.6% – in setting a GWP threshold at 50."
"I know some colleagues are attached to this proposal, but it would be hard to defend it at world trade level because of this insignificant extra environmental benefit and because of this it could be perceived as a technical trade barrier."
"To reiterate, what is important is that, by adopting this directive, we are blocking the use of HFC-134a, which has a global warming potential 10 times higher than HFC 152a."
"With regard to the phase-out dates proposed by various Members, our aim should be for this legislation to enter into force as soon as possible, so that industry can begin to get rid of the gases with very high global warming potential, while maintaining the six-year type-approval timeframe."
"I am therefore in favour of approving the common position on the directive as it is, without further amendments."
"On the regulation on certain fluorinated gases, there has been serious debate over the legal base: whether the legal base of the regulation should be the environment (Article 175 of the Treaty) or the single market (Article 95 of the Treaty) or whether the dual legal base proposed in the common position (Articles 175 and 95) should be maintained."
"We as a Parliament have a duty to settle this issue; above all, industry needs legal certainty."
"As rapporteur, I have consulted widely on this issue and examined every option from one end of the spectrum to the other."
"My main priority has been to achieve legal certainty for industry."
"After considered deliberation, I have come to the firm conclusion that the only logical and legally watertight option in the spirit of the aims and scopes of the regulation – I would advise colleagues and others interested to read the recitals – is to opt for a single legal base that corresponds to the preponderant purpose or the ‘centre of gravity’ of the legislation."
"In this case, as in the ozone depleting substances regulation to which this proposal is related, that is environmental protection. It is clearly explained in the recitals to the regulation that the main aim is to contribute to global warming reduction targets."
"The scope of the regulation is absolutely clear on that as well: global warming reduction targets, air quality improvement."
"The European Parliament’s legal opinion stated categorically that an unevenly weighted dual legal base, as in the common position, is legally unsound and will be struck down by the ECJ."
"All the precedent case-law confirms that the Court will quash the reference to the subordinate legal base – Article 95 in this case – and interpret the whole regulation as founded on the main legal base – Article 175."
"However, this outcome will only come about after years of wrangling and protracted uncertainty for industry."
"We should keep control of legislative decisions in this political arena – even if it means conciliation it is still political control – rather than letting the courts decide on legislation for us."
"Article 175 will also allow those Member States which already have more ambitious legislation in force as part of their Kyoto strategy to keep that legislation where it is appropriate for the functioning of the internal market and not, as would be the case with the current common position, force them to bring their environmental standards down to lower EU levels."
"It is important to remember, however, that Articles 175 and 176 do not give Member States a free hand to introduce whatever measures they want."
"The internal market will still be protected from unjustified trade barriers under the environment legal base, Article 175, which is predicated on protection of the single market."
"It is clearly stated in Article 176 that no stricter measures can be taken by a Member State unless they are compatible with the Treaty, i.e. unless they are proportionate, non-discriminatory and do not create unjustified barriers to the single market."
"The effect of the environment legal base is substantively the same as the single market (Article 95) base, which also allows Member States to take stricter measures."
"It is only the burden of proof – on the Commission under Article 175, on the Member State under Article 95 – and the enforcement procedures which are different."
"In this respect, I call on the Commission to make a declaration, on the record, that it will be assiduous in pursuing its obligations as enforcer of the Treaty in relation to this regulation and that it will take particular care to police and monitor any stricter measures that are proposed by Member States, in the interests of furthering the internal market within the bounds of Article 175."
"While the Commission may not have been proactive enough to date in using its infringement powers, I hope that its recent case against Denmark will be a sign of things to come and will assuage the worst case scenario fears of industry with regard to the single market."
"As a further safeguard, and to assist SMEs, I have proposed an amendment to introduce an online register where any stricter measures that are compatible with the single market under Article 176 would be recorded in an easily accessible single document."
"I urge colleagues to support this proposal."
"In an enlarged Europe of 25 – soon to be 27 – Member States, the Council may well resort to more frequent use of a dual legal base in order to try and satisfy various national interests."
"This will result in fragmentation of the purpose and focus of legislation."
"This trend towards cobbling together sloppy compromises at the Council negotiating table when Member States cannot reach an acceptable political agreement is extremely worrying."
"I believe that the European Parliament is uniquely placed to overcome the constraints of national positions and to provide policy coherence in areas where Community-level action is required."
"We as a Parliament must resist the dilution and emasculation of legislation."
"The bottom line is that, if the common position on the dual legal base is maintained, this regulation will end up with a single Article 175 legal base after the ECJ has examined it and struck down the subordinate legal base, Article 95."
"I would prefer this Parliament’s decision to prevail and I cannot put my name to a regulation that is not legally sound and will not withstand legal scrutiny."
"One key argument that has received little acknowledgement in the heated debates so far is the competitiveness case of employing Article 175 to achieve our Lisbon targets of becoming the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, with sustainable growth as an integral part of that objective."
"The proposal to use a single market legal base and also impose additional bans in the annex is a blunt instrument that industry, the Commission and the Council cannot accept."
"At present, none of the proposals to include additional bans on the use of F-gases in certain applications have been subjected to impact assessments or comprehensive health and safety or even cost-benefit analysis by the Commission."
"I do not believe we should use them without prior technical examination."
"I believe in containment and recovery as very sensible and effective means of mitigating emissions of greenhouse gases."
"However, I also see the need for promoting the development of alternative technologies which are more environmentally benign than the existing ones."
"By allowing more ambitious legislation in some Member States, subject to the close scrutiny of the Commission, and by restricting the marketing of certain products where better alternatives exist, the objectives just mentioned will be given impetus."
"Industry must be given long-term certainty."
"It is our duty to lay out the directions for the future and it is for us as politicians, together with the Council and the Commission, to decide on legislation and not allow the ECJ to direct it all."
". Mr President, to start with I wish to thank the European Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mrs Doyle, for her excellent work on the present report at second reading."
"The proposals we are debating today are an important part of Community policy on climate change."
"Fluorinated gases are very strong greenhouse gases."
"In the European programme on climate change, legislation which limits emissions of fluorinated gases has been called one of the measures of crucial importance in order for the European Union to achieve its objective within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol."
"The draft proposals being debated today will help considerably in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in the European Union."
"This reduction is calculated at approximately 21 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year up to 2010 and at 40 to 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year after 2020, once the proposed measures have been fully applied."
"The Commission proposal on fluorinated gases was debated in the Council during the Irish and Dutch Presidencies and it soon became clear that it would have to be reformulated to some degree."
"The Council decided, in the end, to change the form of the Commission proposal, but kept it as a package of measures, with a directive especially on the question of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in vehicle mobile air-conditioning systems (MACs) and a regulation covering the remaining issues in the original proposal."
"The Council also agreed that the directive should be based on Article 95 alone, in that it would come under the type approval system, and that the regulation should have as its legal basis Article 175, in conjunction with Article 95 as far as Articles 7, 8 and 9 of the regulation are concerned."
"The Commission agreed to this change, given that the two elements qualify as an overall package which safeguards the environmental aims of the original proposal."
"The change in form also reflects Parliament's wish to address the question of MAC systems through type approval legislation."
"I should like to emphasise here that I shall be closely monitoring developments with certain outstanding issues in Parliament and in the Council, especially the very serious issue of the legal basis, it being the wish of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety that the regulation on fluorinated gases be based solely on Article 175."
"The outcome of the vote on this question in plenary will be especially important."
"I should also like to add that the Commission welcomes measures which have been taken by various Member States to reduce greenhouse gases."
"Recent reports show that several Member States will need additional measures to achieve the objectives to which they have committed."
"Consequently, actions to restrict fluorinated gases are one effective means towards this objective."
"The Commission merely wishes to ensure that these measures and these actions do not infringe other obligations in the Treaties which the Member States must honour, especially with regard, for example, to the internal market."
"As regards the amendments proposing additional bans on the placing on the market, the Commission has always maintained that, before a decision is taken as to the extent to which a product or item of equipment containing fluorinated gases must be banned, a full technical and economic evaluation is required."
"However, this has not been done for the new bans proposed by the Committee on the Environment."
"It is worth noting that, within the framework of the review, four years after the regulation entered into force, provision is made for examining possible additional bans."
"The Commission considers many of the remaining changes incorporated into the common position and the amendments proposed in Parliament to be improvements to its original proposal."
"They do indeed improve the definitions and clarify the text; at the same time, they strengthen transparency and accountability."
"The Commission has also accepted certain amendments in the common position, such as the new article on labelling, which goes far beyond its original proposal, and such as the article on the review of the regulation, which has been considerably strengthened and is now more specific."
"As far as the directive on emissions from MAC systems is concerned, the Commission supports Parliament's proposal for the gradual abolition of fluorinated greenhouse gases from MACs, using the type approval procedure, rather than a system of transferable quotas."
"There is convergence of opinions between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on this issue."
"The Commission is willing to look positively at every possibility for compromise which may arise in relation to the amendments voted by Parliament."
"I hope that we shall manage to complete the procedure on the present matter as quickly as possible."
"We need the new regulation and the new directive without delay, so that they can start to contribute towards the limitation of emissions of fluorinated gases."
"They will thus make it easier for us to honour our commitments within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol and beyond."
"In addition, it is clear that this will send a real positive and timely message as we set in motion – today to be precise – the second stage of the European programme on climate change."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Doyle has done a splendid job and considerably helped our imminent and major improvement in the protection of the environment in Europe."
"It has to be said, though, that it is becoming more and more difficult to get people to show any sympathy for environmental protection measures when Article 175, the legal basis for them, is transposed in different ways in different countries, thereby endangering the smooth functioning of the internal market."
"The fact is that things are not the way the Council would like them to be; there are indeed differences between countries, and the internal market does get disrupted."
"All I can do, then, is urge that we accept Articles 175 and 95 as a dual legal basis, which is necessary in this instance; in any other, I would be in favour of a single legal basis, although I would then have to argue the case for Article 95, which does not fit the bill exactly."
"We in this House have always defended the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises, and it is particularly with regard to air-conditioning units that our objective gives rise to concern and criticism on their part."
"While the goal – an ambitious one, and important in terms of environmental policy – of changing air-conditioning units over to non-fluorinated gases by 2011 is to be welcomed, it has to be said that it does create problems for small and medium-sized enterprises, and that is why, at first reading, this House adopted a derogation, according to which, if the number of units produced is less than 50 000 per annum, the new arrangements can be introduced two years later – that is, in 2013."
"It is regrettable that the Council did not see fit to take this on board, but, as I regard it as necessary that flexibility in transposition be guaranteed if the changeover is to be successful, I have tabled an amendment, which enjoys support from all the groups."
"What is this amendment about?"
"The intention is simply to make it possible for small-volume manufacturers, after 1 January 2013, to be given type-approval for vehicles operating in accordance with the old regime."
"We should give small businesses this opportunity, and not only the manufacturers of vehicles, but also the suppliers."
"I therefore ask you to support this amendment."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are debating an important topic this evening, namely greenhouse gases, and f-gases, to be precise."
"Everyone is agreed that measures must be taken urgently in order to reduce the quantity of greenhouse gases."
"First of all, though, I should like to thank Mrs Doyle who, as rapporteur, has taken a number of important initiatives in order to safeguard the environmental quality of these proposals, and has shown much commitment in this."
"She has opted to change the legal basis from the internal market to the environment, which I believe to be of the utmost importance and which enjoys the warm support of the majority of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"The common position is disappointing."
"A number of countries in the Council have voted against it because they have already more far-reaching measures in place."
"With the internal market legal basis, Austria and Denmark would have to withdraw their more far-reaching measures, which is really unacceptable."
"The internal market must provide a high level of environmental protection."
"If that is not the case, the environmental legal basis is more suitable because it allows the Member States to introduce more far-reaching measures themselves."
"Europe is not there to impose changes for the worse on the Member States or to deny Member States the opportunity of adopting proper environmental policy."
"Europe is there to improve the conditions under which all of us live."
"The environmental legal basis is also clearly less complicated and as such, fits in with the better regulation project, which we all want."
"For the record, the environmental legal basis is not a licence to start issuing all kinds of bans arbitrarily; it goes without saying that any ban should be underpinned by a sound environmental reason."
"In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, an overwhelming majority were in favour of reducing the use of f-gases."
"Many companies work with f-gases and a large number of companies have sent lobbyists in order to get this House round to their way of thinking."
"The army of lobbyists claims that there is no alternative to using of f-gases, that their use is either not that harmful or negligible relatively speaking."
"Although, needless to say, I can appreciate all these arguments, I think that innovation is necessary and that we should really phase out the use of the most harmful greenhouse gases as soon as possible."
"We must, of course, carefully consider the environmental impact bans have and we must ensure that the restrictions to market access are proportionate; we would be happy to do this in consultation with the Council."
"There is broad consensus in this House about the need for adopting an ambitious climate policy."
"Sadly, it appears that a broad consensus for a strong climate policy is not equal to the automotive industry."
"The Socialists would have liked to push car manufacturers into replacing f-gases in air-conditioning systems more quickly. Unfortunately, they were unable to do so."
"By way of compromise, our group proposes putting the latest date of introduction forward by one year, from 2017 to 2016."
"This is not a shocking change, but sufficient for the car industry to launch a strong lobby to make it clear to MEPs that that is really unacceptable."
"The production cycle of a car model is six years, but I would ask the car industry out there whether that attitude is not too defensive."
"Innovation is of paramount importance if the car industry wants to survive the competition from China, and it is then inappropriate to put innovation on the backburner."
"If we continue to do this, the Lisbon agenda will not come to anything either. As for Mr Schnellhardt’s proposed exemption for small volumes, we regard that as unnecessary."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to thank Mrs Doyle for drawing up the report and also for having overseen the debate."
"We have to oppose global warming because of the enormous impact that it has on the environment."
"I should just like to mention the fact – as we can see in the newspapers every day – that extreme events are getting worse: heavier rains and longer droughts."
"The European Union regards this problem as central to the issue of sustainable development, which, in turn, is one of the fundamental principles for the Union: solidarity with future generations, on a par with the dignity of the individual and democracy."
"The more complex the molecule, the more intense is the greenhouse effect."
"Organofluorines belong to this category and must be taken into serious consideration."
"There is all the more reason, then, to think systematically – that is, looking at the whole system – that the impact has to be minimised in relation to the global greenhouse effect, and thus we should not be concerned just with the gas in question but also with the way in which it is used."
"Therefore, it is essential to minimise its overall global warming potential: that of the gas and that of the equipment."
"If the emissions trading method works – as it does – I believe we should first of all apply a kind of internal emissions trading to the systems where the method is being used, reducing the effects of the gas and equipment to a minimum in the first place and analysing the costs and benefits."
"The systems I am referring to are, for instance, mobile air conditioners, fixed air conditioners, and the system comprising the gas plus the energy needed to make the equipment work."
"Gas is used to extinguish fires and, like fire, is a source of greenhouse gas, so the effects of both the gas and the emissions from the fire must be evaluated."
"It is therefore important not to be prescriptive and over-attentive to detail, but to aim at minimising the greenhouse effect as a whole."
"There are gases, such as sulphur hexafluoride, for which there are no alternatives and which thus constitute exceptions, because vital equipment depends on such gases."
". Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Doyle for her excellent work on this issue."
"My Group fully supports the change in the regulation's legal basis to Article 175."
"The sole objective of this regulation is, clearly, climate protection."
"It should be remembered that these gases were already included, in 1997, in the basket of gases to be controlled under the Kyoto Protocol and that this regulation emerged from a specific programme called the European Climate Change programme."
"So we should not be fooled by the pro-F-gas lobbyists who argue both for avoiding a change of legal basis and for maintenance of the status quo for their climate-destructive products."
"Climate-friendly alternatives exist for almost all applications, or are in development."
"None of the phase-outs and bans proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is unrealistic, as some would claim, since they all take into consideration exemptions where safety standards require."
"I would also point out that f-gases were pushed onto the market as replacements for CFCs, which cause ozone depletion and skin cancers, precisely by the same big chemical companies – like DuPont or, in my own country, Ineos, as ICI is now known – that were, themselves, major producers of ozone-destroying substances."
"This Parliament should stand firm and put the environment and the well-being of Europe’s citizens before the narrow corporate interests of those chemical giants."
"Mr President, when we debate climate issues in this House, we are usually in complete agreement."
"We usually agree that they are the greatest environmental problem of our time, and we usually agree that we must do more."
"Now, we are here; now, we can do more; now, we can ensure that some of the most damaging greenhouse gases disappear or are phased out, or at least have restrictions placed on them."
"We know that there are alternatives, so it is a question of coming up with the goods."
"I fully support the rapporteur’s demand that Article 175 should be the legal base."
"This is an environmental issue."
"It would be absurd if we wanted to reduce the environmental requirements that already exist in some of the EU Member States when the requirements should in actual fact be made stricter."
"Not to let countries take the lead prevents invention and innovation."
"It may be objected that allowing them to do so might interfere with the internal market."
"Certainly, that is possible, but my political group believes that democratic countries’ right to tighten up environmental requirements if doing so is good for the environment - as, indeed, it is – should take precedence over companies’ right to sell exactly the same product across a particular market."
"We have seen shameless and unprecedented lobbying on this issue by a range of different companies."
"Quite a few of these companies attack the Member States’ democratic right to tighten up their legislation."
"The same companies often wish to call themselves friends of the environment, or they maintain that they have modern environmental policies."
"This attitude can be summarised in a single word: hypocrisy."
". Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Doyle for her excellent report."
"While she has moved a reasoned proposal particularly where the legal basis is concerned, my group would like to see the Member States’ right to take additional measures made more explicit in the directive."
"That is why we have tabled Amendment 45. I hope that the rapporteur can endorse this in addition to the change to the legal basis."
"As for the bans that are added to Annex 2, especially Amendments 34 to 36, I can tell you that I do not support them."
"In time, I would like to see the use of fluorinated gases phased out in those applications, but we do not know whether the alternatives are actually more energy-efficient."
"It is therefore too premature to impose a ban at present."
"In future, a ban could be instituted when this directive is reviewed, but only if research were to prove that this is really more energy-efficient."
"I would be interested to hear what view the Commission takes of these product bans."
"The last thing I would like to say has to do with Amendment 19."
"We have just discussed my own report on cross-border waste shipments."
"Like many other substances, used fluorinated gases are waste substances that may be processed more effectively in a different country."
"Fluorinated gases are therefore not as unusual as this amendment gives us to believe, and so we should not make an exception to the normal licensing procedure for waste shipments."
"It would be very strange indeed if during tomorrow’s vote, we first demonstrated our allegiance to a more coherent approach to waste shipments, only to shoot this uniform approach to tatters the next day."
"I would therefore ask the rapporteur, and the House, not to back Amendment 19."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the rapporteur on the work she has done, which above all has the merit of bringing the intent of our legislation closer to the criteria that we promised to fulfil at Kyoto."
"Even in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I felt it necessary to distance myself from certain positions that appear only to favour sectional objectives and are likely to produce a much more disastrous outcome both for the environment and for many Member States’ economies."
"First of all, on the issue of the legal basis, the shift to Article 175 may result in a distortion of the single market concept, since it allows individual Member States to introduce more restrictive requirements and measures."
"Choosing Article 175 as the legal basis might lead to a paradox whereby some countries may decide to prohibit the use of SF6 but then resort to current alternatives that are more polluting and less safe than fluorinated gases."
"We must not forget that the purpose of the regulation is to contain fluorinated gas emissions and not to ban them."
"Any ban – I am referring to Articles 7 and 8 in particular – should be preceded by a study assessing both the economic impact and the environmental benefit."
"I must emphasise that it is pointless to cause serious economic damage to countries that base part of their economies on the responsible use of those gases when there is no likelihood of gaining appreciable environmental benefits, while even causing greater harm in some cases."
"It is pointless to resort to bans that cannot offer any feasible scientific alternatives, when at the moment it would be enough to reduce emissions."
"It is pointless to hinder harmonisation, when this move puts even safety at work at risk."
"Fluorinated gases have high energy efficiency, are non-flammable and non-toxic, and can be handled and managed by workers in total safety."
"Statistics show that the alternative solutions have caused many deaths in the workplace."
"An approach based on responsible use, with the same rules for all the Member States, has the clear advantage of being a win-win solution."
"It provides a reduction in the energy costs associated with a guaranteed high degree of safety, and the environment benefits as greenhouse gas emissions are cut to the absolute minimum."
"– In my contribution, I would like to express my appreciation for the fine and undoubtedly demanding job performed by the rapporteur Mrs Doyle in preparing and debating the legislative proposal in question."
"I agree with her that we must do our utmost to protect the environment."
"We must give serious consideration to the ominous progression of global warming and recognise our responsibility also for the fate of future generations."
"To this end, we should strive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to a minimum."
"If there are substitutes for fluorinated industrial gases that offer more advantages in terms of environmental protection, energy efficiency or health and safety, we should not hesitate to replace such gases with the more environmentally friendly substances."
"Let me stress, however, that this should apply only in those cases where a substitute is available."
"I believe that in the automotive industry, for instance, there will be no problem finding such substitutes by 2010."
"I would like to point out, however, that there are also plans to ban the use of sulphur hexafluoride SF6, which would have negative consequences for the treatment of cancer, since this substance is used in radiotherapy and no substitute is available."
"Should it be banned, many patients in Europe would lose a highly effective form of treatment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking my colleague Mrs Doyle for doing such an outstanding job."
"I am in complete agreement with the line she has taken."
"That the Kyoto Protocol was able to enter into force was primarily a result of the efforts of the European Union."
"Three of the six gases listed in it are f-gases, the use of which has been prohibited outright by both Austria and Denmark."
"It is abundantly clear, not only from experience in these countries, but also from innovations in other Member States, that technically and economically workable alternatives to fluorinated gases are available, and that they do less damage to the environment."
"Alternatives to a wide range of products and installations are available, and are capable of bringing about a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions; some of them even reduce energy consumption at the same time."
"A large number of European manufacturers are capable of putting alternatives on the market."
"Consumers are already able to shop in supermarkets in which the refrigerators use alternatives to f-gases."
"The German Federal Office for the Environment has produced a comprehensive study of the availability and efficiency of the alternatives showing that alternatives are indeed available for many important applications."
"Something else that needs to be mentioned is the lack of ambition apparent from the Common Position."
"The proposal for a regulation on certain f-gases takes insufficient account of tried, tested and already available developments."
"The imposition of bans and restrictions that can simply be neglected not only stifles ecological innovation in this area, but also robs the Community of any credibility where the development of eco-efficient solutions is concerned."
"Moreover, the Council’s Common Position on the Regulation does not allow the Member States to do anything ambitious and of their own free will and accord about seeking technical alternatives."
"The EU’s burden-sharing agreement commits different Member States to very diverse targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases, and so individual Member States need to take different measures to achieve them."
"That is why it is absolutely crucial that Article 175 should be the legal basis for the whole Regulation."
"Mr President, I should like to say thank you very much to Mrs Doyle who, I think, has done some very creditable work on this report."
"I see it as our duty as legislators to encourage and facilitate the development of new and more environmentally friendly technology."
"When there is new, environmentally friendly technology at a reasonable cost, there is no reason for us to permit older, environmentally polluting technology."
"In the legislation, we must also, if possible, avoid confining ourselves to a particular technical solution just because, at precisely the time we legislate, it is the best in environmental terms."
"Instead, we must lay down requirements regarding upper limits for emissions and for other environmental pollution."
"In the light of this, I am in actual fact quite satisfied with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety’s proposals for limiting the use of greenhouse gases, even though I should obviously have liked some of my own amendments – which went a little further, for example regarding the use of fluorohydrocarbons – also to have been sanctioned by the majority of the committee. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has, however, decided, despite everything, to demand that more substances be phased out than those put forward by the Council for such treatment."
"I am, in actual fact, particularly glad that the Committee has supported having Article 175 as the legal base, something that quite a few speakers have already mentioned."
"It is important that the Committee wishes to make it possible for countries that have stricter rules for the use of greenhouse gases to be able to retain these rules and for those that want to introduce such rules to be able to do so."
"Environmental requirements within the EU must not be harmonised downwards, but upwards."
"When it comes to air-conditioning in cars, we are not convinced that there is at present good reason for requiring that the gas used should not be permitted to have a warming potential higher than 50, partly because the climate benefits of such a reduction would be extremely small and, at the same time, very expensive but mainly because the technology involving carbon dioxide has not yet been tested sufficiently for us to commit ourselves irrevocably to it."
"We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament therefore support the rapporteur on this specific issue."
"Finally, I wish to call on everyone to support the changes proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in tomorrow’s vote and, at the same time of course, the amendments tabled by the PSE Group, for example those about introducing the stricter rules for air-conditioning in cars at a time earlier than that proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in voting on the directive on mobile air-conditioning systems, my group, like the majority of this House, will follow the rapporteur’s sensible path and adopt the Common Position without major amendment, for it represents a good compromise."
"A GWP threshold value of 150 reduces emissions by 90%."
"The deadlines – 2011 for new types and 2017 for new models – are ambitious enough, and it will also be possible for the manufacturers to meet them."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has already voted to reject the demand for the reintroduction of GWP 50."
"Compared with a threshold value of 150, a GWP threshold value of 50 has no significant impact on the greenhouse effect; that is confirmed, not by the car industry, but by the British impact assessment, the Commission and the Swedish Environment Ministry."
"Setting the GWP at 50 would exclude all the alternatives to CO2 as refrigerants for mobile air-conditioning systems, but it is not for the legislator to prescribe one single technology to the industry."
"We should instead leave that to the engineers and promote competition between environmentally-friendly alternatives."
"The core issue with the f-gas Regulation is its legal basis."
"There is no apparent reason why we should have different legal bases for stationary air-conditioning systems on the one hand and for mobile ones on the other."
"In both instances, we are dealing with product-oriented legislation for the internal market."
"If the confidence to plan ahead, legal certainty and common standards in the internal market are to be guaranteed, then the legal basis should be Article 95."
"This expresses a clear commitment to both high environmental standards and a functioning internal market in which all are subject to the same ground rules."
"At a time when we frequently find ourselves discussing better regulation, I would, in this specific instance, remind the House of the problems involved in transposing the electronic waste directive, which is based on Article 175."
"Mr President, I should first like to thank Mrs Doyle for the splendid job she has done."
"When you consider what we are up against and the way in which the fluorinated gas industry is lobbying us at the moment, it is simply hair-raising."
"They misinform us when they, for example, talk about its being more energy-efficient to use their poisonous gases."
"The fact is, just about all energy-efficient refrigerators, that is to say those rated AA+ and A++, use natural coolants rather than these gases."
"Nor is it the case that there are no alternatives."
"By virtue of tough legislation and industry that is up-to-date and well disposed towards the environment, we in Denmark have in actual fact developed alternatives, and we can say that, in general, we are in a position to comply with the most stringent requirements. It would be completely scandalous if we were knocked back again by an old-fashioned sunset industry that thinks only of itself."
"Let me just say a word, finally, about mobile gases."
"When you consider how few countries in the world actually need air conditioning in cars, I do not see that there is any reason at all for there to be so much environmental pollution from this source."
"It is ludicrous that we cannot get something done about this too."
"Mr President, fluorinated gases can destroy the ozone layer, and it is therefore important for all countries to be called on to make an extra effort to get rid of them."
"A direct ban, as has been implemented in Denmark, would be best."
"As Mrs Auken said, Danish industry has got used to the ban and is developing environmentally friendly alternatives."
"However, neither the Commission’s nor Mrs Doyle’s proposal refers explicitly to this viable ban."
"Mrs Doyle deserves praise for using the minimum provisions of Article 175 instead of the internal market’s total harmonisation."
"We know that she has been under heavy pressure, but Mrs Doyle’s proposal is scarcely enough to preserve the Danish ban."
"Together with Mr Blokland, I have therefore tabled Amendment 45, which specifies that all countries should be permitted to go further in protecting the ozone layer against fluorinated gases."
"I want to be satisfied that we can keep our ban and thus the incentive to create sustainable alternatives."
"We know that the Commission administers Article 175 very strictly and always wants to see uniform rules instead of supporting those countries that wish to lead the way."
"The Commission represents total harmonisation rather than promotion of the environment, the hole in the ozone layer rather than the ozone layer itself and the past rather than our common future."
"I would therefore call on all my fellow Members to support Amendment 45."
"It reads: ‘This Regulation shall not prevent Member States from maintaining or introducing stricter protective measures’."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is often considerable confusion, as well as demagogy, about the deleterious effects of human activities on the environment: either people deny that we bear any responsibility, or there is a mad rush to declare that we do, so far with the support of scientific arguments that are not universally accepted."
"In any case, we can definitely be more certain that the gases that we are talking about have destructive effects on ozone molecules than we can be about the supposed increase in mean atmospheric temperature, which is blamed on higher carbon dioxide levels."
"Overall, therefore, I can support the Doyle report, although there are some points on which I cannot agree."
"One of these is Amendment 38, which proposes banning fluorocarbons in the semiconductor industry, although this industry so far does not seem to have used them to any great extent, thus adhering to the targets set by the Kyoto protocol."
"I shall therefore vote against this amendment."
"I also harbour some doubts about Amendments 34, 35 and 36, which propose introducing bans on the use of fluorinated gases in professional equipment; I shall abstain on these."
"I intend to vote for Amendment 45 instead."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I ought really, according to the German working time directive, to have been on a rest break for the past six hours and 26 minutes, but the debate is nevertheless a very interesting one."
"As a fellow-Member of the same group, I would like to thank the rapporteur most warmly for the outstanding work she has done."
"The message that this Common Position carries from us to the world at large is a positive one."
"We are showing ourselves to be taking the Kyoto Protocol’s targets seriously, and endeavouring to be an example to the rest of the world in this respect – an example of how to pursue ambitious climate targets and make less use of f-gases."
"I would, however, have been glad if this House’s Legal Affairs Committee had done as it needed to do and produced its opinion in good time, in order that we might have a few pointers on the legal position."
"I am myself in favour of the dual legal basis using Articles 95 and 175, as described in the Common Position – not, I have to say, out of any antipathy towards the environment, but because I would like to see the whole of the European market, and Europe’s environment too, maintained and developed in accordance with the same high standards."
"If we are to have a common legal basis, I see Article 95 as a good starting point, for it enables us to find more common ground than we would if we followed Article 175 and left too many options open to the individual Member States."
"I also think it problematic that the derogation in Article 175 gives the public the impression that we are not acting together in this area."
"Mr President, three of the six gases listed in the Kyoto Protocol are fluorinated greenhouse gases, and it is these that this legislation is intended to regulate."
"If we are to achieve the Kyoto goals and move towards sustainable development, it is desirable that the regulation we are discussing today should enter into force without delay."
"In his speech, Commissioner Dimas said that the intention was that the adoption of this piece of legislation should send out a positive signal, but that is possible only if either Community-wide targets are ambitious and stringent enough – and we know that that cannot be said of this proposal – or if we take Article 175 as our legal basis and thereby offer those Member States that have already gone further the opportunity to implement a more rigorous and more environmentally-friendly policy that will be beneficial to the climate."
"It has already been pointed out that both Austria and Denmark have adopted general bans on the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases, and it is clear from the experiences of both these countries that alternatives to such gases exist."
"Reference was also made to a comprehensive study by the German Federal Office for the Environment, which shows that there is potential for reducing both greenhouse gas emissions and the use of energy."
"We must use this legislation to ensure that more rigorous regulations can be retained."
"That is important if the Member States are to be enabled to meet the obligations imposed on them by the Kyoto Protocol."
"This option also reflects a legal opinion given by Parliament’s legal service, according to which Article 175 is the right and proper legal basis."
"It would also, in effect, send a positive political signal if we were to refrain from bringing back into line those countries that are already taking action that is more likely to prevent damage to the environment and to the climate."
"Mr President, Commissioner, fluorinated gases are a grave threat to our environment."
"It seems that the world is warming up; we are aware that significant measures must be taken to combat activities that contribute to this problem."
"We must also be firm in our commitment to honour the Kyoto Treaty and to go beyond the rhetoric of environmental protection."
"We must replace fluorinated gases with safer alternatives and take real action towards stopping their release into the environment."
"However, it would be counterproductive to ban these gases in such a way that we simply destroy European companies, while simply moving manufactured products that use F-gases to countries that do not ban them, countries that may even see an EU ban on fluorinated gases as an opportunity to capture the refrigeration and other related markets."
"The whole globe shares the same ozone layer."
"Phasing out the use of fluorinated gases in favour of competitive alternatives is an important step towards making real environmental progress."
"However, in phasing out substances, we must also ensure that existing F-gases are not simply released into the environment."
"Regulation of F-gases has led to toxic graveyards of leaking fridges in some countries."
"We have to ask ourselves the question: what is the best way to keep F-gases from being released into the environment?"
"More focus must be put upon controlling the gases that have already been produced."
"We must ensure that a mechanism is put in place to effect the safe elimination of existing fluorinated gases as well."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, important though this regulation undoubtedly is in how we approach climate change, since it will in any event lead to a reduction in the use of f-gases, it is only a first step. That is why I think it is best if it is taken with caution."
"The Commission will need to table an assessment report in a few years’ time, and the important measures that are now being proposed must also have the chance of being implemented in the sector."
"As science and technology develops, it will become evident whether additional restrictions are viable, and more analyses are required for this purpose."
"After all, the sector involved is a global industry, and since goods must be able to circulate freely in and out of the EU, it is impossible for each country to impose its own rules."
"We must prevent disparity between the different legislations from leading to different playing fields for the market operators."
"That is why it is also important to state that a happy balance should be struck between solid environmental progress and not too many restrictions for the internal market."
"This is best accommodated, in my view, by the mixed legal basis proposed by the Council."
"That is also the ideal approach in the framework of which research and development can be stimulated on a large scale."
"The EU sets out the guidelines that guarantee the responsible use of the f-gases and the sector can further develop research in a creative manner."
"Consequently, it is wholly unacceptable to us if at present, more unviable restrictions were to be imposed on the sector unilaterally, without consultation, on applications for which there are insufficient alternatives available or for which alternatives are not more energy efficient, taking into consideration the environmental cost as a whole, if possible within the provisions of Article 175."
"I would like to hear what the Commission has to say on the matter."
"Mr President, on the directive on mobile air-conditioning, I think we have a sensible compromise in Parliament."
"My only reservation concerns the amendment from Mr Liese and others about low-volume cars."
"It seems to me that low-volume cars are often high-spec cars with all kinds of features and I wonder what the Commission thinks about the amendment to somehow exempt them from the requirement of having sound technology for mobile air-conditioning."
"On the regulation, I think you have heard that the consensus view in Parliament is going to be in favour of Mrs Doyle’s approach, and I am very loathe to use EU legislation to reduce environment standards in different Member States."
"We have heard from colleagues from different countries who have said they feared this would happen."
"We need the Council, the Commission and Parliament to bang their heads together to get a resolution on this issue."
"By the same token, I am also loathe to agree, when we come to vote, on a series of prohibitions on the use of F gases, which have not been tested or assessed for their health and safety, nor for their economic or environmental impact."
"Although many of the letters from lobbyists on both sides of the argument may well be valid, before we ban things, we ought to have proper assessments."
"Therefore, Commissioner, I agree with what you said when you spoke about the prohibitions and the need for them to be examined and to come forward in the review."
"I thank Mrs Doyle for her work."
"Mr President, I should like to thank my colleagues."
"It has been a very interesting debate."
"I also thank Commissioner Dimas."
"As I came here to speak tonight, the Committee on Legal Affairs was only beginning to consider – as is its duty – the proposed change in the legal base in the common position."
"I should like to put on record that it was considered, but without much debate at all, and the Members of the Legal Affairs Committee were never even advised that Parliament's legal opinion to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was that the dual legal base would not withstand a challenge before the ECJ."
"They agreed that the dual legal base, as proposed in the common position, should remain."
"But our clear legal advice is that this will not withstand a challenge before the European Court."
"On that basis and according to what everyone else has said, I appeal to colleagues for support for the legal base of Article 175 tomorrow, with the proper Commission policing – please – of the internal market, as required of them under Article 176."
"That is most important."
"Under the better regulation announcement by President Barroso some weeks ago, the F-gases were mentioned in terms of impact assessment and analysis."
"The four-month time frame that we have in Parliament at second reading did not allow a proper teasing-out of exactly what was in the Commission's mind."
"It is unacceptable to ask us to pass this legislation – but we have no choice, because of the time frame – without a proper and full impact analysis, as many colleagues have requested, particularly in relation to bans."
"I do not, generally speaking, support the extra bans, particularly on SF6 and others."
"I am generally in favour of Article 175 but against extra bans."
"It is not acceptable at this point for that industry to bear that particular burden."
"The political reality is that if we do not get a qualified majority for legal base Article 175 tomorrow – and we need a qualified majority for a second reading – the common position will remain: the dual legal base."
"That will be challenged before the European Court of Justice, as we have been told, and we know the countries that are going to do it."
"All legal advice tells us that they will find in favour of Article 175 as the legal base."
"So for those who do not want that to happen, ironically, they should support Article 175 tomorrow so that we go into conciliation and politically we decide the shape, which will not be purely Article 175 because there will have to be compromises."
"We should decide in conciliation and not let the ECJ decide, even though I would be very optimistic that my personal opinion will come out of the ECJ."
"We are politicians; we want to decide it ourselves."
"Thank you for your support."
". Mr President, I have listened carefully to the speeches of the distinguished parliamentarians and I should like to make some comments on the specific amendments."
"Amendments relating to the legal base of the regulation are of particular importance."
"Amendments 1, 4, 5 (first part) and 45 concern the establishment of Article 175, and Amendments 33 and 40 concern the establishment of Article 95 as the sole legal base."
"The Commission has accepted, as part of the compromise, that the directive should be based on Article 95 alone and that the regulation should have a legal base of Article 175 and Article 95 in relation to Articles 8, 9 and 10."
"However, the Commission will closely follow further developments on this issue in both Parliament and the Council."
"I have most certainly taken note of your concerns on this issue."
"Amendments 2 and 7 specify in Article 1, with a corresponding change to the recital, that specific actions are needed in order for Member States to reach their individual Kyoto emission targets."
"As I have already said, the Commission can support these amendments provided that the Member States do not infringe other Treaty obligations."
"Likewise, it can support Amendments 6 and 31 on the promotion of alternative technologies, provided there is a change to the text."
"There are a number of amendments of a technical nature specifically addressing containment."
"The Commission can support most of those amendments, provided that in some cases there is a change in language to reflect the technical realities."
"We can also agree in principle to Amendment 25, as regards the need to indicate the global warming potential on labels for the applications covered in this regulation, although we believe the issue of labelling would be best resolved by the Commission through the committee, after careful preparation."
"The review provision is very important since the regulation is only a first step."
"In this context, we can be positive on some of the amendments that strengthen this review process."
"However, the Commission cannot accept Amendments 27 and 30, which would require the Commission to provide a proposal by a specific date, irrespective of the findings of its review."
"This would undermine the Commission’s right of initiative with respect to legislative proposals and cannot be accepted."
"The Commission cannot support Amendments 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 41, which introduce new ‘placing on the market bans’."
"The Commission has always stated that a full technical and economic evaluation is needed before establishing whether a product or equipment containing fluorinated gases should be prohibited."
"The review provides for this four years after the entry into force of the regulation."
"Amendment 26, which requires the use of HFCs only where safe, technically feasible, cost-effective and more environmentally sound alternatives do not exist, is also unacceptable."
"In practice, this would allow any Member State to do as it wished with respect to products containing fluorinated greenhouse gases, because there are no established criteria to determine that alternatives are safe, technically feasible and environmentally sound, etc."
"A number of other amendments that improve some of the general provisions of the regulation can be accepted."
"However, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 12, which provides a new definition of placing on the market."
"Although it supports the principle of Amendment 19 on the need to facilitate the shipment of recovered fluorinated greenhouse gases in the Community, the Commission believes it is unnecessary here since this matter is covered by the new waste shipment regulation."
"As regards the directive, the Commission believes that Amendment 1 on fiscal incentives does not provide any new value added to the proposal."
"Member States are already allowed to grant fiscal incentives, provided that they comply with state aid rules, particularly the guidelines on state aid for environmental protection, as well as on Commission notice on the application of the state aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation."
"The same goes for Amendment 2, as the 1999 directive already requires Member States to ensure that the label indicating carbon dioxide emissions is affixed on all new cars for sale in the European Union."
"However, as part of its review of this directive, with a view to making an amending proposal in 2006, if necessary, the Commission will also investigate the possibility of including on the label information on the greenhouse gas effect of mobile air conditioners."
"This will cover information regarding both the refrigerant used and the impact on fuel consumption."
"I believe this will satisfy all concerns."
"Many of the new amendments that have been tabled seeking to shift the final date in the common position from 2017 to 2016 will not be supported by the Commission, since we believe that the existing dates achieve our environmental ambition and would allow industry sufficient time for compliance."
"It is important that the phase-out is achieved in a smooth, effective and technologically sound manner."
"In summary, the Commission believes that, given the relatively small environmental gain that would result from advancing the deadline for the phase-out, the case for a change is not justified."
"Likewise, we cannot support amendments that change the threshold for the global warming potential from 150 to 50, since this would in our view be determining the technology that the industry has to apply for little environmental gain."
"We also believe that the proposed exemption for small car producers is not compatible with the type-approval system."
"In conclusion, out of 45 proposed amendments to the regulation, the Commission can accept five fully, and a further 18 in principle or in part."
"For the directive, the Commission cannot support the 10 amendments proposed."
"I shall give a complete list of the Commission’s position on the amendments to Parliament’s Secretariat."
"Finally, I would just like to add that, in a letter from the Director-General to Mr Florenz, the Commission has given details of the discussion we had in the college regarding the proposals pending before the legislator."
"This is just to provide Parliament with the existing available information, but no further economic studies are necessary."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday 26 October."
"Annex – Position of the Commission"
"Regulation (2003/0189A (COD))"
"The Commission can accept 5 amendments in full: 10, 13, 24, 28 and 29."
"The Commission can accept 18 amendments in principle or in part: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 31, 43 and 44."
"The Commission rejects 22 amendments in full: 1, 4, 9, 12, 14, 18, 19, 26, 27, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 45."
"Directive (2003/0189B (COD))"
"The Commission rejects 10 amendments in full: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10."
"The next item is the debate on the statements by Mr Barroso and Mr McCreevy on the latest statements by Mr McCreevy on the Vaxholm case."
". Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to exchange views with Parliament on issues that are at the forefront of our concerns."
"On 12 October, when Parliament expressed its wish to have this debate, I made myself available on the very same day and I was ready to go to Parliament the same evening."
"Unfortunately it was not possible to make a suitable agenda arrangement."
"I am glad that it is now possible to have this discussion."
"This debate was triggered by a case pending in the Swedish and European courts."
"It concerns what is known as the Laval case."
"I realise that there are strong political sensitivities on all sides and difficult issues to be dealt with."
"I have personally discussed this case with the Prime Ministers of Sweden and Latvia and I am fully aware of the importance that is attached to it."
"The Commission is still waiting for the European Court to forward to us the question referred for a preliminary ruling."
"We will then examine the case carefully and submit our views in an brief to the Court, as we do in all proceedings of this kind."
"Obviously, once the Court has given its judgment the Commission is at the disposal of all parties to analyse the situation and possible solutions as required."
"Given that it was possible to find equitable solutions in other situations, of which the posting of workers directive is but one example, the Commission remains convinced that it is possible to reconcile the four freedoms under the European Treaties with the different social models chosen by the Member States."
"The role of the Commission is to ensure that both the social and the internal market legislation are respected and fully implemented in all Member States, without discrimination."
"As a matter of principle, the Commission respects the different social models chosen by the Member States."
"It recognises that the Swedish model has a successful record of combining high employment with flexibility for companies and also with social justice."
"The Swedish system is clearly a model which provides adaptability in a globalised society."
"In particular the Commission acknowledges that, in view of its successful record, Sweden did not feel it necessary to request transitional periods for the access of workers from the new Member States to the Swedish labour market."
"The issues raised must also be seen in their broader economic and political context."
"They demonstrate the need to advance our agenda for growth and jobs in order to achieve stronger social and economic cohesion."
"As I said at the beginning, this debate was triggered by a court case."
"First and foremost we should wait for the court to deliver its judgment."
"Let me make it clear: this Parliament is not a court, it is a political body and a political debate is needed."
"This is a matter of substance, not just of legal interpretation."
"The essential questions are clear."
"Are we for or against solidarity in an enlarged Union?"
"Are we for or against economic and social cohesion to reduce imbalances in a Union of 25 members?"
"Are we for or against the free movement of workers, with full respect for the national legislation and social frameworks of the Member States?"
"Are we for or against a European budget capable of effectively promoting economic and social cohesion?"
"Those are the questions that lie behind this debate and on which we need to express our views."
"We have to be prepared for cases like this in the future."
"In an enlarged Union, these problems might well arise."
"It is interesting to recall that in 1986, when Spain and Portugal became members of the European Community, Spanish and Portuguese workers were seen as a threat by many of the existing European Community members."
"The solution was not protection within each market but the promotion of economic and social cohesion."
"The general issue, therefore, is how we reduce imbalances and actively promote prosperity, so that our Union is really united and has no artificial divisions."
"I hope that all those who are for social solidarity, social cohesion and economic cohesion will fight for the ambitious financial perspectives and active social and economic cohesion policy we need in an enlarged Europe."
"We need to promote union, not artificial boundaries."
"Let me now give the floor to Commissioner McCreevy."
"As you know, as the Commissioner for the Internal Market he has special responsibility for defending the internal market principles that are enshrined in our Treaties."
". Mr President, let me confirm that the Commission does not call into question the organisation of labour relations and the system of collective agreements in Sweden or indeed any other Member State."
"It is entirely a matter for each Member State to determine how labour relations are organised and whether or not its system includes collective bargaining."
"The Commission recognises the important role that collective agreements play in bringing stability and predictability to economic and social relations in the many Member States that utilise these methods."
"At the opening of the Brussels sitting earlier this month, reference was made to the fact that I had recently stated that the Scandinavian model of collective agreements was not compatible with the EC Treaty."
"Those who know me will be very much aware that I have vigorously supported collective agreements in the Member State I know best."
"In my home country, I have been directly involved in more national partnership negotiations than any previous Irish Minister for Finance."
"In my time in that office, I was regarded, together with my Prime Minister, as the leading government defender of the of Irish social partnership."
"During a recent visit to a number of Member States, including Latvia and Sweden, the press asked me about the ongoing investigation in what is known as the Laval case."
"It is a case involving a Latvian construction company, Laval, that won a tender to build a school in Vaxholm in Sweden."
"As a result of a dispute on whether Laval had to sign up to the Swedish collective agreement and whether it had to pay the average Swedish wage in the construction sector, the Swedish construction trade union blocked the construction site."
"The action taken by the Swedish construction trade union eventually led Laval to terminate the contract and the company ultimately went bankrupt."
"The matter was brought before the Swedish Labour Court, which in turn referred the matter to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling."
"The fact that the Swedish Labour Court referred the matter to the European Court of Justice demonstrates that the legal situation is complicated."
"Whether the Swedish authorities and the trade union were right in how they handled this case will be determined by the Swedish Labour Court in the light of the ruling that will be given by the European Court of Justice."
"The Commission will be invited to present its analysis of the situation and all the legal elements, including Article 49 of the Treaty on the freedom to provide services and the application of the posted workers directive."
"This analysis is complex and will take some time."
"The Commission has not yet formed a view on this."
"Those are the facts of the matter."
"As to the broader question of how the Commission sees the development of the internal market and the European social model, let me stress that, for the Commission, the development of the internal market and the preservation of the European social model go hand in hand."
"They are not mutually exclusive; they reinforce each other."
"The internal market creates new opportunities for businesses, consumers and workers."
"This allows the preservation and further development of social rights, in accordance with the collective preferences of each individual Member State."
"The Commission has an onerous duty in making sure that the basic rights and freedoms set down in the Treaty are respected throughout the Union."
"As guardian of the internal market, I exercise my responsibilities in an even-handed manner."
"To be credible, there is no alternative."
"I find it extraordinary that I should have to justify remarks I made on an incident that raise questions about its compatibility with Article 49 of the Treaty."
"I was not the first to raise this question."
"It was the Swedish Labour court that asked whether there is incompatibility with Community law, in particular the posting of workers directive, Article 49 on the free movement of services and Article 12 on non-discrimination."
"This happens to be a ‘sensitive’ issue in a Member State."
"But does the mere fact that an issue is sensitive deprive me of my right to express a view or carry out my duty?"
"I believe in the necessity for the Commission to be impartial and fair in the exercise of its duties."
"I will continue to voice my opinions loud and clear."
"I do not care if it means upsetting some people."
"I passionately believe in the primary role of the Commission to ensure the rules of the Treaty are applied and I will vigorously defend that role."
"I have sworn to do so."
"There are 25 Member States in the Union."
"I make no distinction between them."
"Just because Latvia is a new Member State and one of the smallest, that does not mean its complaints are less important."
"Latvian trade union members are entitled to have their interests defended as much as Swedish trade union members."
"Neither I nor the Commission call into question the social model of any Member State or the way in which it organises labour relations."
"One of the strengths of the Union is its diversity."
"I have my views about what is good for the economy."
"I have never hidden these views."
"I also have my views about how the challenges and opportunities arising from globalisation should be addressed and I do not believe it is an option to maintain barriers and try to pretend that competition does not exist, or can be kept outside the borders."
"However, I have never said that there is a single recipe for running every economy."
"There is no single recipe for organising labour relations and there is no single recipe for a social model."
"What works in one country might not work for another."
"I will therefore not express any view on whether the social model of one Member State is better or worse than that of another."
"That is a matter for political choice in each country and I know that every system will find supporters and critics."
"The truth lies, most of the time, in the middle."
"No single system has only advantages."
"Every system and every choice has downsides."
"Choices and preferences may also change."
"What is good now may not necessarily be so in five years’ time."
"The subject being discussed today is not whether the social system of a country is under threat or whether that system is an example to others."
"The real issue for me is what we mean by an internal market."
"What do Article 49 of the Treaty and the freedom to provide services mean?"
"What do Article 12 and the principle of non-discrimination mean?"
"No one has questioned the enormous benefits the internal market brings, the extra growth and the extra jobs it has created."
"We should not be afraid of the internal market."
"We should embrace it."
"We have a Union of 25 Member States."
"The world is not waiting for us to take advantage of the internal market we live in."
"Others will do it for us if we do not wake up."
"I will defend the rights laid down in the Treaty."
"I will continue to apply its provisions in an even-handed way."
"But if members of this House expect me to creep around quietly and not upset some Member States and some Members of the European Parliament, then I am afraid that they are going to be disappointed."
". – Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, our group takes the view that this House possesses the self-evident right to call Members of the Commission – including its President – before it and to ask for their opinions."
"The President of the Commission has indicated that he was very much prepared to appear in Brussels, as, indeed, he is obliged to do when Parliament demands it."
"That he did not has something to do with those who were asking him to do so, and nothing whatever with him, so we thank him for doing his duty and being here today."
"Commissioner McCreevy’s statements in Stockholm were not intended to call into question the Swedish social model, or to attack the Swedish social partners’ right to determine wages."
"The EU Services Directive was not a point at issue, nor was he talking about any decision to be taken by Parliament, the Council or the Commission; on the contrary, he was referring to a case before the European Court of Justice."
"When Commissioner McCreevy, at the beginning of October, told an audience in Stockholm that the Commission supported a Latvian building firm in its dispute with a Swedish building workers’ trade union, he was doing what the Commission is obliged to do by the Treaties, that being to act as the guardian of the law and of rights – in this instance, the right to the freedom to provide services."
"In so doing, far from calling into question Sweden’s traditional system of collective agreements, he was trying to make it clear that this system, like all others, has to respond to the establishment of the internal market."
"Let me take this opportunity to point out that other countries – for example, the country from which Mr Schulz comes – have already responded by availing themselves of the provisions made by the Posting of Workers Directive for the building sector, or of the option provided for in the accession negotiations, namely of enacting transitional regulations for workers from the states that most recently joined the EU."
"It is evident that the Swedish Government is trying to draw attention away from its own failings."
"There is no other explanation for the attempt by the Swedish Minister for the Economy to exert pressure on the European institutions by threatening to withdraw his country’s support for the Services Directive."
"His motives are transparent and his actions unacceptable to us."
"The Services Directive has nothing whatever to do with the case under consideration."
"What is at issue is the interpretation of the law as it stands, which nobody wants to change."
"I would like to say, on behalf of my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that nobody in our ranks has any desire to use the Services Directive to alter labour law or the laws on collective bargaining, and certainly not to impose restrictions upon them."
"Those who make assertions to the contrary are trying to frighten people and whip up anti-European sentiment."
"We must, of course, be very sensitive and take people’s concerns seriously."
"That was brought home to us by the two failed referendums earlier this year."
"There is nothing clever, though, about politicians who keep trying to shift blame towards Brussels and get it to carry the can."
"If statements by a Member of the Commission are used as a pretext for covering up one’s own mistakes and omissions, then that is something of which this House cannot approve."
"The people of Central and Eastern Europe have stood up for freedom, democracy and self-determination, and have done so with great success."
"In so doing, they have won for themselves the right to become members of the community that is the European Union."
"As we see it, there is no doubt whatever that they can therefore lay claim to all the rights associated with that status, and must not be treated as second-class Europeans."
"That is what this is about."
"By that shall we be judged."
"We will not allow this European Community to be divided up, with citizens and states allotted to first or second class within it; on the contrary, we are one single common European Union, and, as such, we practise solidarity."
"We defend our social model, and the internal market forms part of it, for it offers us the only opportunity to make ourselves competitive on a global scale."
"These are the principles by which our group stands."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a helpful debate, in that it is clear even from the applause where this Commission stands."
"Far from it standing in the centre, in the middle ground of European politics, it has become apparent this morning that it – not all its Members, but Commissioner McCreevy and President Barroso – have taken up an unequivocal stance and set a right-wing, neo-liberal course, against which my Group campaigns – today, tomorrow and every other day."
"Yes, it is true to say that we welcome all the new states of the European Union – all of them."
"We Social Democrats are fighting for Romania and Bulgaria as well, and we urge you to do likewise, with the same dedication, but the one reason why we welcome them is that we want social progress in Europe and we want the social standards we have achieved to be secured."
"We do not want Swedish workers to be played off against their Latvian counterparts, but you do; that is how you go about destroying Europe."
"In preparing us for today’s debate, the chairman of the European Socialist Party, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, recast this topic in the form of three simple questions."
"Those three questions I shall now put to you, and I want clear answers to them from you."
"Here comes the first question, Mr President of the Commission: does the Commission take the view that trade unions – those in Sweden, for example – have the right to campaign in defence of collective agreements, which may involve them taking strike action?"
"Secondly, does the Commission take the view that the Nordic version of the social model is compatible with the rules of the internal market?"
"I put this question to you, Mr Barroso, for to judge by what I hear Commissioner McCreevy saying, it is apparently not."
"The message we get from Commissioner McCreevy is that, in the event of his interpretation of Article 49 becoming accepted, there is no longer any room in Europe for the Swedish model."
"Our response to that, Mr McCreevy, is that your interpretation of Article 49 will not prevail in Europe, at any rate not while the Social Democrats in this House have any say in the matter."
"The third question we want to put to you, Mr Barroso, is this: we need an unequivocal statement as to what the Commission’s position is in relation to the European Court of Justice in the Vaxholm case."
"Where, in fact, do you stand on that?"
"The reason why we have demanded the President of the Commission’s and the Commissioner’s presence here is that this debate is about nothing more and nothing less than the question of in which direction we want to develop this European Union of ours, of what this European Union’s purpose is."
"Europe’s citizens have their own worries and their own aspirations; these they address not only to us in this House, but also to the Commission."
"The people of Europe want employment, but not at the price of Chinese wages and Asian working conditions."
"They want living wages from secure jobs, an income with which they can achieve some sort of workable and secure future for themselves and for their children."
"That is what the European social model is, and that is what we want to defend."
"What I hear from you, though, Mr McCreevy, is that the free market in Europe means that the lowest standards for incomes, the lowest standards for social security and the lowest standards for workers’ rights are the best way of promoting competition and growth and that they must prevail."
"No, that is the wrong way to go about it."
"The European social model, which involves partnership between capital and labour, is a recipe for success."
"Let me repeat that we want to put our Latvian and Czech comrades in a stronger position; my colleague Mr Falbr, who is a Czech trade unionist, will shortly have something to say about that."
"European social policy cannot have the driving down of wages as its objective."
"Far from it: one of the effects of the EU’s structural policy is to unleash progress and economic growth in the new Member States, in the Baltic states, in Slovakia or Slovenia, and this technical advance, this process of economic growth, must be inseparable from the workers’ sharing in this growth, and what that means is higher wages and more trade union rights for the workers in those countries, rather than fewer rights in Sweden and lower and lower standards."
"That would be a system after Mr McCreevy’s heart, and we will not have it."
"What we expect of you, Mr President of the Commission, is that you should now come out and say, once and for all, where you stand."
"Last week, you delivered a speech on social policy, in which you proposed, indeed demanded, the establishment of an intervention fund."
"That is something we support, with the proviso that such an intervention fund must not be used for the victims of Commissioner McCreevy’s policies."
"To that we are opposed."
"I urge you to say once and for all what your Commission stands for; if you want to put your commitment to the European social model beyond doubt, then you must, at last, put the brakes on Charlie McCreevy, Neelie Kroes, and other members of your Commission."
"You have the means to do so, and if you do it, you can count on our support, but if your system is about continuing the downgrading of mobility and social standards in Europe, then your Commission will have to contend with the opposition of the Socialist Group in this House."
". – Mr President, on Thursday our national leaders convene in London to discuss what sort of Europe we want to build."
"A Europe that is open to the world, dynamic and competitive, or one which seeks to shelter its industry and workforce from globalisation?"
"A Europe which can offer security, prosperity and opportunity to its citizens, or one which, enslaved to the precepts of the past, slides further into recession?"
"This debate is fundamental to Europeans; it must be conducted honestly, rationally and directly."
"It is therefore disappointing that those who have brought Commissioner McCreevy and President Barroso here today seem more interested in stalling debate than furthering it, perhaps for the sake of a few more votes in the upcoming Swedish election."
"They accuse the Commission of being off-centre."
"Have they not noticed that the centre of opinion has shifted?"
"Their political manoeuvring aims not only to derail the Services Directive; it is aimed at one of the fundamental pillars of the Treaty: the free movement of persons and freedom of establishment."
"Mr McCreevy should not be made the scapegoat for their scepticism."
"As Commissioner for the Internal Market, he has a duty to defend it against its detractors."
"Nor should his comments be seen as an attack on the Swedish social model, which Liberals have defended for its ability to balance the brutality of the marketplace with a sizeable social safety net."
"They should be seen as an attack on the Swedish Builders Federation’s hypocrisy, xenophobia and protectionism."
"Laval bid in a fair and open competition for that contract, fulfilling public procurement criteria."
"The company has a collective agreement with its workers, just as Swedish employers have with theirs."
"What is more, when challenged by the unions over labour rates, Laval offered to raise its wages to the level agreed by the Swedish collective agreement."
"However, that was not good enough for the union."
"It demanded that the rates should be the Stockholm average, rather than the Swedish national average."
"Finally, in a breathtaking lack of worker solidarity, that union prevented work from going ahead, which led to the company withdrawing from the contract and filing for bankruptcy."
"Now Latvian workers are out of a job thanks to the Swedish trade unions."
"Is that situation the fault of Laval, or is it the fault of a syndicate which puts protecting Swedish jobs ahead of the common market principles we have signed up to?"
"It is not by turning inwards and embracing protectionism that we will overcome sluggish economic growth and compete with China and India."
"The British historian James Anthony Froude once wrote that the practical effect of a belief is the test of its soundness."
"What better rebuke to the defenders of protectionism than this sorry affair?"
"Perhaps we should not be surprised that Liberal economic and social thought is in the ascendant."
"One reason is that more and more people are so painfully aware of the alternatives."
"– Mr President, Commissioner McCreevy, you have made a frontal attack on the Swedish right to strike, which is protected by the Swedish Constitution."
"You maintain that you accept the Nordic model’s collective agreements but, at the same time, you wish to undermine them with your legislation."
"You must realise that our legislative objective is to protect each worker against unfair working conditions, not Swedish workers against Latvian workers."
"You are making the most common mistake of all among EU politicians."
"You believe that something that worked in your own country for a certain period – your one-sided policy on growth and the internal market, through which Irish finance ministers succeeded for a time in reducing unemployment and increasing income – has to operate in the EU for evermore."
"That policy depended, however, on certain temporary, national and accidental circumstances."
"Progress was made not because of, but in spite of, deficient social protection."
"In Sweden, we have managed to make some tough adjustments because of the security provided to us by forms of social protection."
"The Nordic model too is based, however, on unique basic conditions that cannot be exported to the EU as a whole with the help of legislation."
"The right thing is to learn from each other but to allow the legislation to permit adjustments according to the basic conditions that prevail in each region."
"Otherwise, we shall end up with a centrally administered form of ‘eurosclerosis’."
"The EU is like a football team."
"As coach, you see that you have a good player in Zlatan Ibrahimovic, so you come to the conclusion that all players should wear shoes his size and that you need to have 11 attackers in your team."
"With tactics like that, our football team would lose against both India and China."
"Instead, you need to see each player’s potential for development and what each can give to the team and to do so without crushing players’ individual creativity as long as they follow the basic rules of the game."
"Only then will there be a chance of winning the World Cup."
". – Mr President, my group naturally supports the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in the dispute that has brought it into conflict with Mr McCreevy and with the Commission in general."
"How could we, on the left, accept a concept of Europe founded on creating competition among workers and on organising social dumping?"
"It is exactly this kind of policy that we have in mind when we say ‘no’ to liberal Europe."
"What really grates is the fact that that brutal agitator, Mr McCreevy, and all those who share his opinions unfortunately can rely on rules in force in the EU in giving their support to a Latvian business claiming not to know about Sweden’s system of collective agreements and in applying more restrictive social standards."
"The provision to which, in this case, the Latvian service provider and its promoters in Brussels are referring is called mutual recognition, which was introduced into Community law, via the case law of the Court of Justice, in 1979 for the free circulation of goods and was then expanded to incorporate services around 15 years ago."
"This is a strategic choice."
"Instead of legislating on upwards social harmonisation, the market and competition are being allowed to pull the social downwards: in Community jargon, this is what is known as better regulation."
"Moreover, the Commission issued in 1999 a communication to Parliament and to the Council that was extremely explicit on this matter."
"I quote: ‘The application of mutual recognition is fully consistent with the Single Market philosophy according to which the rules of the Member State of origin normally prevail, and the Member State of destination can only derogate from that rule under very strict conditions challenging the overriding requirements of general public importance, such as health care, consumer protection or the environment.’"
"With the most recent enlargement, this rule has become explosive: the more social disparities increase among Member States, the more they reveal the diabolical consequences of this rule."
"From now on, everything will depend on what the Court considers to come under the ‘overriding requirements of general public importance’."
"It is therefore not only a question of attacking Mr McCreevy’s zeal, but also of opposing the harmful provisions themselves of the ."
"From now on, let us consider this matter from the perspective of the forthcoming votes on the draft Bolkestein Directive, whatever Mr Poettering might have to say about it, and let us use this experience more generally to enhance our collective thoughts on the future of Europe."
"– Mr President, the Vaxholm case is another example of the great risks we run when we in this way allow our pluralistic Europe slowly to be squeezed out in our efforts to standardise."
"In Sweden, we have a special tradition which has been very successful and which is based on collective agreements. This is now under severe threat."
"All I want to observe right now in this Chamber is that the June List asserts in no uncertain terms that the Member States’ own legislation must apply in these areas."
"Their own traditions and collective agreements etc must apply and should not be exposed to threat from action taken in Brussels."
"We therefore absolutely reject any action that might be taken whereby it is the country of origin principle that is applied to these issues."
". – Mr President, I welcome President Barroso and Commissioner McCreevy to the Chamber today."
"It is unfortunate that we have not been able to utilise our time with them to discuss the document which they presented to the Conference of Presidents last week with regard to the future European social model."
"The reason why we are not discussing upcoming events, where we can have influence with regard to decisions that will be taken by the 25 Member States, is because certain Members of this House want to re-run previous battles, previous elections, and to try to insist in future elections."
"These arguments and this debate are predicated not on real divergence of opinion with regard to a better form of social model, but merely on maintaining an archaic, protectionist system."
"When you fail to win the argument, you then attack the man: you carry out a personal attack because of his accent, because of the way in which he expresses himself."
"That is the most despicable form of political discourse or activity that I have ever come across."
"Let us look at the clear facts before us."
"We have a statement by the Commission that the social model of each Member State is its own business."
"Questions concerning collective bargaining or collective agreements are a matter for the Member States themselves and not for anyone else."
"The Commission has reiterated what we have known since 1969: the Commission’s role is to defend the European Treaties, whether it be Article 49, Article 21, Article 95 or Article 99."
"We also have a new document from the Commission, agreed by the College, which puts forward the best parts of the social models that are available to us within the European Union and states that this should be our minimum standard, our starting point."
"But what do we see happening?"
"We see Member State governments – the Swedish Government in particular – utilising an opportunity given to it by the Socialist Group in this Parliament to express its opposition to the Services Directive when, for three years, it has been in favour of that directive."
"We now have a situation where Members are standing up in this House to say that they are defending workers’ rights in Latvia as well as in Sweden, despite the fact that the only exact information we have is that Latvian workers have lost their jobs because of the actions of some Swedish governments and trade unions."
"It does not behove the future negotiations and discussions on behalf of Europe that, within this House, we cannot even set down proper debating time to discuss real issues rather than abstract principles."
"– Mr President, I rarely say that it is a function of mine to defend the Commission, but Commissioners have the right to freedom of expression and, just occasionally, they may even say eminently sensible things, like President Barroso when he accepted that the Constitution is unenforceable and that we need to move on."
"So, Commissioner McCreevy had the right to express his opinion."
"If that opinion was that, in some way, a ‘one size fits all’ approach to the social model is required, then that opinion is wrong."
"The European social model cannot be defined with singularity; it must take account of diversity and respect the various traditions across Europe."
"What is right for Sweden is not the choice of others."
"Social policy must be tailored to the needs of the individual countries."
"Subjecting social policy to the same regulation as business will not work."
"Save us from the oppressive uniformity that some would impose upon us and let the needs of each rule the day."
"– Mr President, when the Commissioner spoke, the Swedish Laval Case was still pending in court, and still is."
"If a case is pending, politicians such as ourselves, and certainly the Commission, should refrain from passing judgment. That is my first observation."
"Secondly, it was imprudent of the Commissioner to decide to give the free movement of services precedence over the collective agreement."
"Why?"
"Because that self-same Commissioner also has to defend the services directive here in this House, in which we do not want to put those very values at risk."
"Thirdly, as a Christian Democrat, I regard the socially-oriented market economy as the principle on which politics, my politics, our politics, are based."
"In this social market economy, we give our social partners the responsibility of concluding their own collective agreements."
"This is the value of delegating and sharing responsibility."
"That means that if you do that, you can accommodate issues such as globalisation and the problems involving an ageing population that you have in that society."
"Only by giving and sharing that responsibility can this be done."
"As for the social debate, which everyone refers to as the social model, I am in favour of it, as long as the social values prevail."
"I am in favour of a debate in which we, on the basis of those social values, can demonstrate that we are capable of providing answers, because they need to be given."
"This is where I would beg to differ from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"I do not want a liberal market economy, but a socially-oriented market economy in which the social values are used as a basis, in which we find the answers to globalisation together, secure jobs, and ensure that the social security systems will be set up in such a way as to allow people to contribute to prosperity and thus employment."
"On a final note, although I do not expect any initiatives that will defy the judges’ rights, I do expect some that will have that effect on Parliament and the Council."
"– Mr President, what was it really that Mr McCreevy said in Stockholm?"
"He said that the Swedish Government is offending against the internal market and that he intended to take action against the Swedish Government when the case was dealt with by the Court."
"He is saying the same thing today."
"If that is not bringing the Swedish collective agreement model into question, then I do not know what, in fact, is."
"Mr Watson, who is not in the Chamber, says that the Latvian company paid its employees under the Swedish collective agreement model, but that is untrue."
"It paid just over half of the amount payable under the Swedish collective agreements in the Stockholm area, namely SEK 78 instead of SEK 140 per hour."
"Mr McCreevy recommends that there should be 25 different collective agreements: one for each country."
"That is a race to the bottom, not a race to the top."
"So is the Swedish model less successful than other models?"
"No. If we look at the Lisbon process, we see that it is perhaps the most successful."
"Is it more protectionist?"
"No, Mr Poettering, Sweden has no transitional rules like Germany’s. On the contrary, it is open to labour from around the EU coming in."
"Is it discriminatory? The answer is no."
"All companies are treated equally, irrespective of whether they are Swedish or Latvian. Collective agreements are drawn up on the basis of the existing collective agreements."
"You talked about Spain and Portugal, Mr Barroso."
"Spain and Portugal have got themselves up to the same levels as other Member States."
"What is it you are advocating now?"
"Yes, a race to the bottom."
"You should think carefully."
"You have launched this debate on the social model by recommending that we have a race to the bottom by having different collective agreements in different countries, that is to say 25 different collective agreements."
"This will not create a European social model."
"I therefore advise you to launch the debate in some other way. Otherwise, there will be a war regarding the debate on the social model."
"– Mr President, the work on improving and clarifying the incredibly important Services Directive is now well under way in Parliament and the Council of Ministers."
"It is therefore odd and quite tragic that, in country after country, the directive is now being used as a weapon in what is basically a debate characterised by protectionism and nationalism."
"Instead of standing up for the proposal and constructively trying to improve it, ministers in, for example, Sweden have shamelessly exploited people’s anxiety about globalisation and jobs by portraying the Services Directive as a great threat."
"The words ‘social dumping’ are hissed like an evil incantation, denoting one more wicked stratagem from Brussels."
"No one wants to see social dumping, but the Services Directive does not lead to social dumping. Nor does it threaten the Swedish model or the Swedish collective agreements."
"The all but hysterical tone adopted by Social Democratic unions and politicians in Sweden is irresponsible."
"The Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr Östros, has completely lost the plot when he accuses the Commission of intervening against a Member State on behalf of a ‘foreign company’."
"It cannot have escaped Mr Östros that the foreign company is Latvian, that Latvia is a member of the European Union and that freedom of movement is one of the cornerstones of EU cooperation."
"How is it that there are no problems when Swedish construction workers travel to Germany and work for higher wages than in Sweden but for lower wages than those earned by German construction workers?"
"That being said, there is an election campaign in Sweden, so that is the way things are."
"Free trade, competition and mobility of services are good for Europe and good for Sweden."
"Sweden is one of those countries that has most to gain from obstacles to the knowledge-intensive services being removed."
"To oppose the Services Directive for reasons to do with election tactics and to threaten to block it in the Council is an historic act of folly."
"– Mr President, with all due respect to Commissioner McCreevy, I have to say that his claims that Swedish collective bargaining practice was contrary to the European Treaty and the freedom to provide services show that he has been led astray."
"Not only has he pre-empted a court ruling, but he has also, and above all, put a question mark against the protection of workers as an element in the European internal market."
"In the past, the freedom to provide services has always – not least in the Posting of Workers Directive – been seen as compatible with workers’ protection."
"The freedom to provide services must continue, in future, to include protection for workers if ‘social Europe’ is to be something we actually want to establish rather than a mere form of words."
"The reason why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has stated that the Services Directive, which Commissioner McCreevy defends, is compatible neither with the Treaty nor with the Charter of Fundamental Rights is that it calls into question the protection of workers."
"It was for that reason that we, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, struck out those very parts of the Services Directive by which the protection of workers was eroded."
"If Europe is to be competitive, it needs a social dimension."
"Competitiveness also demands that working conditions be fair and that workers should enjoy equal rights."
"As Commissioner for the Internal Market, Mr McCreevy is bound to pursue a policy of worker protection and not just one that defends one party’s interests."
"– Mr President, the Vaxholm conflict is a matter for the European Court of Justice."
"Parliament is no court, but nor is the Commission or any individual Commissioners."
"On 5 October, you succeeded, Commissioner McCreevy, in using a couple of sentences to challenge the whole of the Swedish trade union movement, the Scandinavian model of labour law, the European trade union movement, Member States and citizens. Does your statement reflect thoughts and ideas that really are discussed behind the Commission’s closed doors?"
"In that case, it is good that we citizens, the Left and the trade union movement have now obtained proof that all the fine talk about social dialogue and the social dimension is just fancy words."
"The Commission has shown which side it is on when it comes to working conditions etc. You need to know, however, that you have issued a challenge to the whole of the Left and of the trade union movement."
"We in Sweden have the EU’s lowest share of working days lost to labour market disputes."
"We are a country that welcomes workers and service companies from other countries, but we can never accept discrimination and situations in which workers are pitted against workers."
"We refuse to accept discrimination in the labour market too."
"Employees’ rights are not for sale, not even in the EU’s internal market."
"Employees are not commodities. We are flesh and blood people, and we shall defend our rights."
"We on the Left and in the trade union movement have embraced the struggle before, and we are fully prepared to do so again and to take up the fight for solidarity and justice."
"– Mr McCreevy, you did not need to say anything in Sweden."
"In fact, I am surprised that your words about social models have caused such a stir."
"Being Irish I have long known – but perhaps others have not – of your opposition to the so-called European social model."
"You became Finance Minister just as Ireland’s Celtic Tiger was transforming the country from one of the EU’s poorest nations to its financial summit."
"Despite our wealth, when you left office last year, we still had one of the lowest social spends in the EU."
"You had more money at your disposal than anyone in Irish history, yet the Irish health system remained an under-funded disgrace, with long waiting lists for the simplest operations and patients crammed into hospital hallways every weekend."
"Special needs children were regularly denied appropriate education and therapy, and you left public housing lists to grow and grow."
"Your budgets denied rights and services to the most vulnerable in Irish society."
"Therefore, the opposition you express to Sweden’s social model is not news to me."
"However, here is my question: Mr McCreevy, what is the point of a society that does not serve its people?"
"What is the money we create for?"
"– Ladies and gentlemen, I am surprised that the European Parliament is spending its time and that of the President of the Commission and Commissioner McCreevy on political demagogy."
"I am from Latvia, a country that long before its accession to the European Union considered all four basic freedoms of the European Union to be important and fulfilled them."
"Many of those who have today expressed their indignation are political representatives of people who profiteered in my country and other new Member States, since it was possible to buy cheap property, cheap shares in businesses, because they could pay our workers 10 or more times less than theirs for the same work."
"Social model advocates – where were you then?"
"I am convinced that only competition which is based on the four fundamental values of the European Union will enable the companies and workers of the new Member States to escape their permanent poverty, and competition will also be the only chance to preserve, to some extent, the high social standards of the so-called ‘rich’ European Union Member States."
"– Mr President, my fellow Member Mr Andersson from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament emphasised just a few minutes ago that Sweden did not introduce any transitional rules when the new Member States entered the European Union. It was good that he said that, as what he was boasting about had in fact been a defeat for him."
"He and his party had taken the lead in combating freedom of movement and had wanted to introduce transitional rules. They lost, however."
"As a result, Sweden is the country that now has freedom of movement."
"He and his party conducted a scare campaign about social tourism."
"We know the outcome: last year, the social tourism about which Mr Andersson and other Social Democrats were scaring people cost Sweden EUR 18 000."
"That is almost nothing, but we have acquired a host of people who have been able to contribute tax income and labour to our country."
"We should be pleased that you lost, for Europe was the winner."
"This is not about the Services Directive."
"We are now seeing a scare campaign of the same kind as that we heard a year ago."
"This is about neither the Services Directive nor Chinese wages. Scaring people by saying that the freedom and opportunity to work in Europe will lead to Chinese wages is a downright piece of insolence directed against our new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe."
"Nor is it about placing a question mark over Sweden’s collective agreements, for we are not concerned here with the country of origin principle at all."
"What it is about is people from Europe with collective agreements being able to work in a country in which the laws and rules applicable in that country are also complied with."
"This is the matter about which you are conducting an outright scare campaign, and one directed not only at the Services Directive but also, ultimately, at our new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe which have made the European Union richer."
"I can state one thing, namely that we Swedish Conservatives will defend and safeguard our being able in Sweden to make decisions about our labour market and our rules, but we shall also defend openness."
"To the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, which uses the European Union to legislate on the Swedish labour market or working time directives and ‘sunshine directives’, I want to point out the following:. we will safeguard the Swedish labour market and Swedish freedom, but we will also safeguard the European Union’s freedom."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, previous speakers have focused mainly on the political aspects of this whole issue."
"If I may, I should therefore like to make a few comments from the point of view of a trade union member from a new Member State."
"I should like to start by using a phrase coined by Mr Chirac, the French President; Commissioner McCreevy missed a good opportunity to keep quiet, and is therefore merely reaping what he sowed."
"Do trade unions have a right to take action if they believe the interests of their members to be at risk?"
"They most certainly do."
"Much uncertainty surrounds the case as a whole."
"While on the one hand there has been talk of starvation wages of SEK 35-45 per hour, on the other hand it has been reported that the Swedish minimum wage of SEK 109 per hour was paid."
"There have been claims that certain articles of the Treaty establishing the European Community have been violated, and criticism has also been levelled at the Swedish labour model."
"Questions also need to be asked with regard to whether the Swedish labour inspectorate took any action."
"All EU Member States are members of the International Labour Organisation, and have ratified treaties that grant far-reaching powers to trade unions."
"Workers not only have the right to form trade unions and to negotiate collectively, but also to defend themselves if their jobs are at risk."
"Sweden is one of only three countries to have allowed citizens of the new Member States to work within its territory almost immediately after the latter joined the European Union, without imposing any transitional measures."
"The only demand the country makes is that its rules and customs be observed."
"It is quite absurd to accuse Sweden of attempting to seal off its labour market, and it would be regrettable if the whole incident were interpreted as a Swedish attack on workers from the new Member States."
"Czech trade union members have also always taken the view that foreigners working in the Czech Republic must receive the same wages and have the same status as Czech citizens, as well as being subject to the attendant obligations."
"Unfortunately, we have not always managed to stand up in the face of blatant violations of Czech rules."
"Whenever the Commission talks of the need to adopt a directive on services, it assures us that the Posting of Workers Directive, the provisions of which are intended to prevent social dumping, will continue to apply."
"We should therefore ensure that the Posting of Workers Directive becomes more than just a piece of paper in our Member States."
"In conclusion, I would note that sit-ins are one of the most effective weapons in the trade unions’ arsenal."
"I am quite sure that our Swedish counterparts only resorted to this weapon after much thought."
"– Mr President, in my country we have spent more than 100 years developing an efficient labour market."
"Employees and employers enter into voluntary agreements on wages and working conditions."
"The idea is that everyone is welcome to work on agreed conditions."
"We have also developed a Nordic welfare model with social rights for all citizens, financed by high taxes."
"It has given us a flexible labour market in which it is easy to fire, and still easier to hire, people. Moreover, we are creating more jobs than we are losing through globalisation."
"The Commission should therefore say: ‘What we have here is a recipe for social protection, giving us the necessary flexibility."
"That is what we all need."
"Let us study this remarkable model.’"
"Instead, the Commission says: ‘Let us deem the Nordic social welfare model and agreement-based model to be unlawful.’"
"Mr Mc Creevy, I am not saying that you should adopt our model, but the Commission should understand and respect the fact that we have chosen that model, and we are never going to give it up. Moreover, I would ask Mr Barosso to withdraw his support for the Latvian firm in the Vaxholm case."
"Thank you, Mr President, even though I have nothing to say thank you for."
"– Mr President, what we have heard here this morning is, regrettably, vintage McCreevy."
"Commissioner, you have to recognise that vintage McCreevy does not work at European level."
"You have to build consensus here or you fail."
"Commissioner, you have done it again: having given the Commission the ‘two fingers’ when you were an Irish minister, you have now outraged the Swedish population with a similar gesture towards their social partnership model as well as the European Parliament today."
"You will not achieve market reform with those bulldozer tactics."
"The Celtic Tiger, for which you claim credit in Ireland, has given us 150 000 children living in poverty in Ireland."
"A man died last week because he could not have simple surgery in our hospital system."
"Sweden spends EUR 200 per person as a proportion of GDP, compared to EUR 100 in Ireland, yet Sweden is the third most competitive economy in the world, compared to Ireland’s position at 26th."
"We need a high-quality European social model which uses social infrastructure as a building block for a prosperous and fair society."
"Setting Latvian workers against Swedish workers will destroy the Union, Commissioner."
"That is the nub of the debate on the deeply flawed Services Directive."
"Take note or fail."
". Mr President, I believe that we have already set out very clearly our position."
"Nevertheless, I should like to respond more precisely to the questions posed, in particular by Mr Schulz, who cited questions by Mr Rasmussen."
"On the first question, concerning trade unions."
"Do they have the right to strike?"
"Of course, it is a fundamental right and a fundamental freedom, in accordance with our European principles."
"We entirely respect the right to strike of all trade unions in Europe."
"On the second question: is the internal market compatible with the Scandinavian social model?"
"There is no doubt about it."
"On the third question: if that is the case, what will the Commission’s response be?"
"First and foremost, we need to know what the Court of Justice requires from us."
"Until I have been consulted by the Court, I am unable to tell you what our position will be, legally speaking."
"On the other hand, I am able to tell you what our position will not be and what it will be in essence."
"We will never attack the Scandinavian or Swedish social model, but we will fight tooth and nail for the Treaties, because the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties."
"We must strictly abide by the Treaties."
"We will therefore be issuing a response that is compatible with the Treaties and with the ."
"I believe that the core issue, Mr President, Mr McCreevy, is preventing the dichotomy between the internal market and social rights."
"In the debate, this at times seems to be a contradiction in terms: those who are in favour of the internal market, on the one hand, and those who are in favour of a social Europe, on the other."
"I will say to you frankly that the role of the Commission is to try to combine these two principles."
"The key to the growth that we require in order to strengthen our social ambitions is an internal market that is truly active and operational."
"We are therefore issuing a communication for consultation by this week’s Informal Summit, and I am delighted that it has been positively received by all of the political forces."
"We are proposing, for example, to create a Globalisation Adjustment Fund by attempting to bring together two elements: an open internal market free from artificial protectionism in our Community, on the one hand, and a stronger social ambition, on the other."
"In this respect, I should like it if certain parties, which are in favour in this House of a more social Europe, gave their support within their governments to a European budget drawing greater inspiration from these very values."
"We are not going to resolve the problem currently facing an enlarged Europe through the use of artificial barriers between our countries. Rather, we will do so by harmonising upwards, which means using a more active economic and social cohesion policy that promotes the development of all of the regions of our Union."
"In fact, there are 25 of us now."
"We have to carry out a more ambitious policy, aimed at social redistribution at EU level but, in doing so, we must avoid raising artificial barriers between our countries."
"That is the issue at stake."
"I can assure you that the European Commission will continue to work along these lines in order to see an internal market put in place, of course, but also in order to see economic and social cohesion occur in a Europe in which we want not only more prosperity, but also more fairness."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the strategy against an influenza pandemic (O-0089/2005 – B6-0334/2005)."
". – Mr President, the World Health Organisation and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have issued extremely serious warnings, based on scientific data, of a possible influenza pandemic in the future."
"We are therefore debating a topical issue which relates directly to public health and, of course, from our debate today, in the presence of the Commissioner, I expect us to draw conclusions and commit to action."
"The possible source of the pandemic – I shall be brief on this because everyone knows this – is the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 which, following recombination with the human seasonal influenza virus, may produce a highly aggressive influenza which is not covered by existing vaccines, which is precisely why there is the risk of a pandemic."
"I should like to say here that the Commissioner has already told us that he has initiated certain discussions and plans for us to produce the new vaccine needed and to produce it as quickly as possible, not in the usual six to eight months required, but much earlier."
"Consequently, as the influenza virus – this pandemic – could spread from one continent to another within a few days, it is obvious that, in order to combat this pandemic, a series of measures, vaccines and medicinal products are needed; in other words, a proper master plan."
"How many of these does the European Union have today?"
"The Commissioner is here to tell us exactly what provisions have been made to date for these plans against a possible pandemic."
"Of course, it is a question which we also need to answer in relation to the recommendations of the World Health Organisation."
"These plans must seek to:"
"- secure the necessary coordination between the Member States, and this will be done by the European Commission;"
"- avoid panic among the general public;"
"- combat any speculation, if larger quantities of vaccines and medicinal products are required;"
"- determine the areas in which movements have to be restricted somewhat, because of course the virus travels with people;"
"- ensure fair and universal distribution of anti-epidemic products;"
"- identify the population groups to be vaccinated as a priority; here, for example, I would say that we should have started vaccinating with the seasonal influenza virus people working with poultry, in order to minimise the possibility of one person carrying both viruses at the same time, which would be exceptionally dangerous, and consequently to reduce the risk of a pandemic."
"Consequently, we need to strengthen the Union's ability to react to an influenza virus, including with a network of laboratories, mechanisms and public health resources."
"The key element in efficient preparedness is the timely development and quantitatively adequate production of vaccines and antivirals."
"For example, the World Health Organisation says that we should have stocks of about 25% of the quantity of these medicinal products."
"Do we have 25%?"
"I greatly fear that we are below this threshold and will suddenly find that we need to produce huge quantities."
"I hope, and the Commissioner has already told us at another meeting, that he has been holding talks so that we can bridge this gap somewhat."
"In addition, we may need – as I believe the Council has also said – some sort of solidarity fund, so that we can cover urgent requirements."
"All this has to be done."
"Another question – which you can answer, Commissioner – is how efficiently the early warning and response system of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is operating and if it is connected to other Community warning systems relating to the health of animals, food, feedingstuffs and civil protection."
"The Commission must basically strengthen its coordinating role and we are here, Commissioner, to give you effective support in that role."
"You must be ruthless with the Member States which do not submit plans or which have submitted unsatisfactory plans."
"We must help them, of course, but you must be exceptionally strict with them because, as we have said, the pandemic is something we need to avoid or, at least if it happens, to deal with correctly."
"We need a comprehensive communication strategy."
"It is very important for there to be no panic and for there to be a constant exchange of information with neighbouring countries, inspections and random sampling of animals and, finally, we need to regulate everything needed in relation to restricting the mobility of citizens, especially in countries in which this influenza may emerge."
"Consequently, Commissioner, we shall wait for you to tell us what you have done so far, and we know that you have done a great deal, and what needs to be done in the future."
"We shall support you in this procedure so that we can have a comprehensive and effective plan so that, if – God forbid – this pandemic happens, we deal with it correctly, without panic and with good results for the citizens of Europe."
". Mr President, I should like to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Members for today's debate, both for the question and for the motion for a resolution."
"It is indeed very, very important and I welcome it, because I see that we and Parliament are on the same wavelength, we have the same priorities and, of course, the same concerns."
"As time is limited, I should like today to cover the most basic issues referred to in the motion for a resolution and the question and to add that I shall send Mr Florenz, the chairman of the Committee on the Environment and Public Health, a detailed memorandum on the various issues raised today, so that the House also has some of the technical details at its disposal."
"First – and I feel obliged to do this after everything I have heard recently – I should like to clarify the difference between avian influenza, which is the veterinary issue concerning birds and animals, and the possible influenza pandemic, which is a possibility which has been identified by the World Health Organisation, as Mr Trakatellis said, and for which we need to make intensive preparations, because we do not know exactly when it will strike."
"The presence of avian influenza in Europe – and I shall emphasise this so that European citizens hear it too – does not affect the probability of a possible pandemic."
"That is why there is no need for panic, but there is need for concern, so that we make the necessary preparations."
"I also wish to emphasise that the European Union and the Member States have the best and the highest levels of preparedness in the world."
"Of course this does not mean that, because we compare favourably with other countries or other areas on the planet, we can feel satisfied or that we have reached the point of preparedness needed in order for our citizens to feel safe."
"There is still plenty of room for improvement and further preparation, even though I acknowledge that, since we last debated this subject in the relevant committee, progress has been made on the part of the Member States and I need to emphasise that."
"Of course, there are different levels of preparedness between the Member States and what is important for us is not to grade or categorise the Member States, but to put pressure on them – and my thanks to Parliament for precisely this support for me – so that all the Member States have a satisfactory level of preparedness."
"Today I am in the welcome position of being able to tell you that we have in our possession all 25 national preparedness plans from all the Member States, which was not the case when we held the debate in committee."
"Of course, I must accept that some of these are still in the form of preliminary drafts, but that does not matter; they exist and they are being examined today, in Copenhagen, with the European Disease Prevention and Control Centre and the World Health Organisation."
"At the same time, we are in the process of revising our Community preparedness plan, which was adopted in March 2004 and will also take account of the national plans and the preparedness exercise which we shall carry out in a few weeks, when we shall test these plans to see how effective and efficient they are and to examine how they mesh with each other and with the relevant Community plan."
"As far as the question of drugs – the question of antivirals – is concerned, they are not a panacea and do not resolve all the problems; they are the first defensive weapon which we have at our disposal."
"We have today at least 20 Member States that have ordered or started stocking the relevant drug and, according to my information, the remaining Member States are also moving in this direction."
"Without doubt, there are problems because the industry cannot respond at the moment to the orders which have been placed."
"I shall be in contact shortly – now that I have a full picture of the situation in the Member States – and shall be holding new meetings with the industry, so that we can examine how they intend to resolve the production and supply problem."
"During the informal Council in England two days ago, the idea was also mooted of a Community stock of antivirals."
"Of course, on the basis of the Treaty, we do not have the competence for that, but if we are instructed by the Council, we are willing to discuss it so that – just as the World Health Organisation has stocks in the event of crisis or emergency – there is something similar at Community level."
"However, it is important that we advise citizens that these drugs are not preventive, that they are not vaccines and that they have to be taken on prescription and that individual citizens cannot treat themselves."
"As far as the pandemic vaccine is concerned, and this is my last point, we need first of all to distinguish – as Mr Trakatellis quite rightly did – between the seasonal influenza vaccine and the pandemic vaccine, which does not yet exist."
"We are encouraging the Member States to increase seasonal influenza inoculation among high-risk groups, and we shall most probably examine this issue with the experts as regards workers on farms and in danger areas, but not – I repeat – for the whole of Europe."
"The Member States must define the high-risk groups, so that inoculation against seasonal influenza can be increased – I repeat – among the high-risk groups only."
"This will help in the way which Mr Trakatellis indicated earlier and it will also help cooperation with industry, by giving financial incentive – that is how the system works – to increase production and meet requirements in the event of a pandemic."
"Of course, the vaccine also needs to be created in the event of a pandemic once the virus appears; this is not possible now."
"However, as Mr Trakatellis rightly said, this takes six to eight months and certainly no less than six."
"We are working together with the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and the industry and making all the relevant preparations and we are confident that all this will cut the time needed by three months, which is a fairly considerable timesaving."
"I wish we could achieve more, but this will cut the time needed from when the virus is recognised by the World Health Organisation to when it will be possible to produce the corresponding vaccine by about half."
"Four companies have already expressed an interest in commencing cooperation with the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and I am confident that others will follow."
"However, what is important – and I shall discuss this when I meet them – is the finding that: firstly, shortages are starting to emerge even for seasonal influenza vaccines, and I want them to tell me how they intend to resolve this problem and, secondly, that in research for the production of the vaccine, we want the companies to coordinate with each other so that they do not do the same work, so that there is no overlap, so that they move in different directions at the same time and we can cover all eventualities."
"I shall therefore be meeting with the industry and I shall, of course, update the House accordingly, as soon as I have some results."
"I shall close here."
"Thank you for your attention; I shall, of course, listen to the debate with a great deal of interest and I am always ready to update Parliament fully because, as you know, you are the strongest allies I have in this endeavour."
". – Mr President, the theme of this debate is, I believe, that we want a sense of urgency, not a sense of panic."
"That applies to the Commission and to Member States."
"I was pleased to hear that we have had a simulation exercise."
"As I understand it, one of the problems found was the overload of information."
"I would be interested to hear how that is being managed."
"What we really need for the public, who are beginning to panic, is clarity."
"They need to be informed and reassured."
"They need to understand the difference between winter flu – which is not what this debate is about – and avian flu – which is not what this debate is about, even though 67 people have died from it, all working or living with birds and poultry in Asia."
"It is the combination of those factors which could lead to a pandemic flu, because it mutates from human to human."
"It has not happened yet, but our resolution must be to ‘prepare, prepare, prepare’!"
"The key is clearly vaccines, and it is the new vaccines we will need, once we know the strain."
"We need capacity and speed."
"Last week we heard from the WHO that world capacity for producing vaccines is only 300 million doses a year."
"My own country – the United Kingdom – is going to place an order for 120 million doses."
"If it does, then where are the vaccines for everyone else?"
"It is not possible without a dramatic expansion of production capacity."
"As for speed, six to eight months under the egg-based vaccines is not good enough."
"We need to look at the cell-based vaccines of one month and even the possibility of DNA vaccines, which could be as low as one month, but still need a lot of development."
"We need that central supply to which the Commissioner referred, because it must be said that no Member State is going to give up its own supplies when the pandemic hits a less-prepared country inside or just outside the European Union."
"I believe we need central supplies under the Solidarity Fund which he and the ECDC can then direct swiftly to where they are needed, so that we can smother the outbreak and prevent it hitting the rest of us even more seriously."
"Lastly, we need that information from all Member States in complete form – the stocks, antivirals, vaccines, masks, the health checks at ports and the quarantine facilities – in order to know that we are genuinely prepared against this threat throughout the European Union."
". – Mr President, I agree that Commissioner Kyprianou commendably treads the narrow line between effective prevention and pressing the panic button."
"Our populations need to know that influenza always has been a global disease, and nowadays, of course, there are additional means by which it can be spread."
"They need to know that the HN51 virus has been present in some states now for several years."
"We need to know that the pace of spread has not actually accelerated in the way that the wilder speculation about pandemics would lead us to believe."
"Could the Commissioner tell us, firstly, what we now know about the incubation period in the bird population, and whether there is any sign that the virus has spread to other species?"
"It is not yet obviously affecting humankind."
"What will the lead time for an effective monovalent vaccine stockpile be?"
"The industry has communicated to us that it may take four years to produce an effective stockpile of everything we need to deal with the virus if it mutates in the way that is predicted."
"In his statement of 12 October 2005, the Commissioner did not mention the importation and trafficking of wild birds."
"We have seen in the recent case in the United Kingdom that the enormous number of birds now imported into the European Union – some legally, some illegally – is a potent source of further infection."
"We have seen that."
"What can we do throughout all the Member States to have an effective control on these imports and, indeed, their ban?"
". – Mr President, according to the Commission’s latest action plan on health and consumer protection, the EU must protect the public from risks and threats which are beyond the control of individuals and cannot be effectively and completely tackled by Member States on their own."
"We have been warned that the world is facing the real threat of a dangerous influenza pandemic."
"Effective preparedness planning includes the stockpiling of appropriate antivirals, as well as implementation by Member States of the existing WHO vaccination recommendations during seasonal flu, in order to protect the public and at the same time increase the vaccine production capacity of the European vaccine industry."
"Additional investment is needed for the development of prototype influenza pandemic vaccines, as a key intermediate step towards establishing a manufacturing process and the characteristics of future pandemic vaccines."
"Last week, the EU Health Ministers recognised that no country can solve these problems alone."
"Bearing in mind that the Member States have very different financial resources for stockpiling vaccines and antivirals, as well as for the national advance purchase commitment to establish national pandemic vaccine needs, we have to suggest an early mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund as a precautionary instrument, allowing for pre-emptive action to be taken in preparing for an influenza pandemic."
"It is our belief that the Solidarity Fund envelope must be used now for the Community’s centralised activities, including the strengthening of the European Centre for Disease Control, as well as for Member States that apply."
"The stakes are high and time might be short."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at present avian flu is an animal disease which is not easily transmitted to humans."
"The major potential danger lies in the fact that the killer virus may mutate into a pandemic virus that spreads from person to person."
"This risk can be lessened by controlling the bird epidemic and reducing the chances of the virus spreading from birds to humans."
"EU-internal solidarity and the help we give to our neighbouring countries, and to those countries in Asia where the avian disease has become an epidemic, will have an important role to play here."
"The EU and its Member States constitute the world’s largest supplier of developmental aid."
"Now it is important that we help the poorer countries take action to conquer the epidemic among poultry, and it is also important that people in direct contact with birds are vaccinated against normal human flu, so that the bird virus does not get a chance to form hybrids with the human virus."
"We must help the poorer countries do this."
"We have to guarantee that the necessary drugs and vaccines will be where they are needed first, in order to control any pandemic."
"Through solidarity, we can help both ourselves and others."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a doctor I consider that prevention is the key element of the strategy."
"Preventive measures, therefore, such as frequent periodic inspections of migratory birds and of poultry farms are of vital importance in this instance and I welcome all the efforts made to date to detect cases immediately in different countries."
"Another point which I also consider important is proper information for the general public, especially poultry farmers, and measures to prevent panic, which we have already caused, without there being sufficient indication, Commissioner, with the result that we keep telling people to get inoculated with a vaccine which we know in advance has nothing to do with the new virus which will emerge."
"The only thing we shall achieve by inoculating the populace in general and not the high-risk groups such as poultry farmers will be to reduce the levels of common influenza which strikes Europe every year."
"Antivirals are also important, although I doubt if they could combat a new virus."
"That is why, Commissioner, I think that there should be cooperation and solidarity between countries, given that this sort of epidemic has no frontiers."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, first we need to ask ourselves if there is a pandemic."
"There is no pandemic."
"Is there an epidemic?"
"Perhaps there is no epidemic either."
"We have 60 recorded deaths; in other words, as many as from road traffic accidents throughout the world in ten minutes."
"Has the virus attacked man?"
"Yes it has."
"There was the case in Thailand two months ago where the poultry farmer died, while his son fell ill but survived."
"Is there a vaccine?"
"If we accept what was said by the Hungarian Ministry for Health, Mr Jenö Rácz, yes the vaccine exists and he personally has been inoculated."
"So if, according to an institutional agent, the Minister for Health of a European country, the vaccine exists, then why do we not take the vaccine and distribute it to the entire world?"
"Many industrialists earned a great deal of money from each drug, but the poultry farms lost."
"So what are we doing for these poultry farmers who have lost so much money?"
"My country is killing 25 million chickens."
"So will we give them all an allowance?"
"Tomorrow we debate the budget."
"Is there a heading for this sort of pandemic?"
"We need to look at things from the other side as well, Commissioner."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in managing the risk of a pandemic, we need to monitor the current situation, coordinate the response and, above all, avoid creating panic, while ensuring that antiviral drugs are distributed widely and fairly."
"That is why we have proposed some amendments designed to promote monitoring, using all resources available."
"The European Union must have an active role in managing the possible risk of the H5N1 virus spreading among animals."
"We therefore need to act in advance with preventive measures."
"We also need to give priority to reassuring consumers and thereby avoiding a pointless panic, which would be harmful both to the population itself and to the poultry industry."
"Our proposal to introduce the compulsory labelling of white meat, as already applies in the case of beef, aims at achieving precisely that objective."
"We also consider that a timely campaign of information would be useful, advising consumers of the true risks, the possibility of prevention and the availability of drugs."
"Finally, we need to ensure there is a strategy to enable all Member States to produce antiviral drugs in sufficient quantities, with the direct involvement of pharmaceutical companies, and to devote our available resources also to that end."
"– It has been repeatedly stated here that the question concerning the next flu pandemic is not ‘if’, but ‘when’."
"Although we all know that the risk of flu pandemics is and will continue to be present, I have the impression that, in spite of the timely warning, the European Union as a whole is not as well prepared as it should be."
"We have heard that the 25 Member States have their national action plans and programmes."
"However, the European Union needs a common plan, and I feel that we have erred in not having prepared such a plan."
"I would like a clear answer as to who will be in charge of coordination."
"Will it be the WHO, the ECDC or the European Commission?"
"Every day, the media bring information about new cases and about the countries where new discoveries of dead or infected birds have been made."
"I believe, however, that it is much more important to protect the population as a whole against influenza and to prepare a joint plan of action that the European Union can apply in case of pandemics."
"Some countries have adopted rigorous veterinary measures, restricted open-air poultry farming and banned trade fairs."
"The problem is that such measures have not been adopted by all 25 Member States."
"Infectious diseases do not respect borders, especially where there are high rates of migration."
"It needs to be emphasised that not all Member States will have sufficient resources to purchase vaccines."
"I therefore propose that besides defining high-risk groups, we should also allow those that can afford to do so to purchase vaccine."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, what our fellow citizens require is high quality information and they are waiting for us to take the initiative and to tell them clearly how things stand."
"Firstly, it emerged from last week’s informal meeting held by the ‘Health’ Council that some Member States still do not have any real emergency plan."
"We ought to be aware of this, Commissioner."
"We need to be aware of it!"
"There needs to be transparency, because it is up to us to make these governments acknowledge their responsibilities."
"The European Commission has to show that it is taking a firm stance on the matter, and I would even say that, on behalf of the general public, it has to go beyond some of its prerogatives in order to make sure that the emergency plans are coordinated flawlessly."
"We have to break away from this European schizophrenia, which says that the Member States’ prerogatives should not be infringed."
"What will people say when a pandemic occurs?"
"Commissioner, no one will ever criticise you for having saved lives, but they will condemn you, and severely too, for having been overcautious."
"Then, in the context of researching a new vaccine, the European Union needs to provide its financial support in order both to help develop the vaccines and to make sure that studies related to them are well coordinated, and to encourage mass production of these vaccines."
"I understand that this research also includes a section on paediatrics."
"As we proposed in our resolution, it therefore seems crucial to use the Solidarity Fund, in particular to ensure that the Member States carry out these tasks in full."
"Commissioner, I know that this matter is now Mr Verheugen’s responsibility but, when the pharmaceutical legislation was revised, we adopted a measure conditionally authorising products to be placed on the market, making it possible to save time."
"What will have become of this important procedure in the event of a pandemic occurring?"
"I get the impression that it has been left behind in a drawer somewhere."
"We must not wait until the epidemic arrives before we deal with it."
"I am counting on you to shake Mr Verheugen into action and to put in place an effective system for authorising products to be placed on the market more quickly."
"– Mr President, I will keep this very brief in my one and a half minute’s speaking time."
"I should like first of all to ask the Commission how it intends to publish the plans due to be drawn up by each of the Member States."
"Have any deadlines been set to enable all Europeans to read all of the plans made by each country, as well as the concrete guidelines that should be laid down everywhere?"
"Exchanging good practices and decisions needs to be encouraged."
"Finally, in the event of a pandemic, who will have the say on which decisions need to be taken in order to ensure that the combined efforts are focused in the right direction, that is to say focused on prevention?"
"What will the EU’s powers be, and how can we prevent the buck from being passed between the Member States and the EU in the event of a pandemic occurring?"
"Secondly, the Commission has not seen fit to publish the amount of antivirals currently available in each of the Member States."
"I do not believe that this lack of transparency is reassuring for people."
"We need both to know what stocks each of the Member States has and to create a fund of the kind that will enable each of the Member States to have access to as large a stock of antivirals as possible."
"What do you intend to do in this regard?"
"Thirdly, we do not have a clear strategy as regards employees and other people who come into direct contact with animals and, in particular, with farms on which birds are bred."
"It would seem to us to be a requirement to have a specific strategy for these employees and other people."
"Next, do you not consider that it would be useful to coordinate the role of the agencies in order to form a kind of group of experts at EU level who would provide reliable scientific information or, at any rate, come up with a consensus of opinion?"
"Finally, the WHO has just launched an appeal: before we think about a pandemic, let us prevent epizootic disease from spreading!"
"Money is therefore required."
"Is the European Union ready to give money at international level in order to limit the spread of epizootic disease?"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, we discussed this problem as long ago as 12 April, when it was clear to this House that ministers were dragging their feet in putting protective measures in place against a possible flu pandemic."
"I have to admit that some progress has been made since then, and that may well be down to you pounding the table very hard."
"In any case, a number of Member States have taken the right sort of action."
"You told us a moment ago that all Member States have now presented plans."
"Whether those Member States have presented those plans, but have not disclosed what it is they have done, or have presented sound plans, is, of course, a different matter, and I would like to hear more about this."
"The ministers discussed this last week as well, of course, when they concluded that stockpiling vaccines and antiviral drugs was a matter for the national level alone."
"This is, to my mind, an unwise decision, since bird flu is a cross-border problem ."
"In the event of a pandemic outbreak, there is no time for extensive consultation with countries that have done too little, to persuade them to take the necessary measures while there is yet time, while we cannot expect countries that are sufficiently prepared to suddenly make their supplies available."
"There is therefore a need for common action, and that, Commissioner, is where you come in."
"First of all, we need emergency measures."
"At the moment, there is no public health risk, but if there was, you would need to be able to take action immediately, for example, in the shape of measures with regard to disinfection and quarantine at airports for flights from the affected areas or travel restrictions."
"I am not confident that all 25 Member States will be taking those measures."
"Finally, I think that there is a need, not only for national action, but also for common action, and I hope that the ministers will approve your proposals for a common fund."
"Mr Mulder, who is rapporteur for this in the Committee on Budgets, has suggested setting aside funds from the Solidarity Fund for this purpose, and I think that that is a sensible suggestion."
"Commissioner, if you pound the table even harder, then we will in any case be right behind you."
"– Mr President, it is absolutely essential that the EU is fully prepared for an influenza pandemic and that we learn the lessons from the past, for example, from the foot-and-mouth crisis in Europe, so that contingency plans are well-known, communication lines are clear and coordination properly planned."
"The current threat of the mutation of avian flu demonstrates the role industry must play."
"Patent holders must allow the production of generic alternatives in poorer countries."
"We must also take urgent practical steps: an immediate ban on imports of wild birds into the EU, and improved bio-security, particularly in the international poultry industry."
"In our amendments, we are also proposing that, as a priority, poultry farmers be offered common, seasonal influenza vaccination, in order to reduce the chances of recombination between human and avian influenza viruses at one of the most important potential interfaces, as Mr Trakatellis has said."
"Since international travel is likely to form the key mode of transmission, we are proposing that there should be systematic virological screenings of air filters from flights originating in countries affected by the virus."
"Lastly, a question to the Commissioner: will he rule out a mass cull of wild birds, since evidence suggests it is likely to be counter-productive, dispersing infected individuals and making healthy birds more prone to disease due to stress?"
"I would be very grateful for an answer to that question."
"– Mr President, today’s debate on the strategy against an avian influenza pandemic is a good opportunity to ask questions both about where the responsibility lies for public health, which is one of the European Union’s main priorities, and about security and truth in public life."
"We must ask ourselves whether predictions asserting that the disease will cause massive loss of life, and claim between 50 and 150 million victims, are based on scientific knowledge, or are instead the result of an economy overheated by industry, and in particular by the insatiable pharmaceutical companies, which suffer losses if their drugs are not used."
"Conflicting opinions, a quasi-conspiracy of silence and a lack of reliable scientific data all point to such conclusions."
"This would amount to entirely despicable and truly diabolic manipulation, aimed at provoking panic and chaos instead of creating a feeling of security and public solidarity."
"The latter should be defining features of large communities whose goal is to achieve noble goals, such as those to be found in countless EU documents."
"Further key questions surround the reasons for the spread of the epidemic."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with an emblematic case of avian flu, or, to put it another way, an outbreak of foolishness and stupidity."
"The pandemic threat of seasonal flu, which afflicts primates and humans alike, from the runny nose of at Cro-Magnon to insalubrious Napoleonic sneezing, is being met by the deadly virus of those bent on creating panic for the benefit of speculators and scoundrels."
"A vast gravy train sucking billions of euros from plucked chickens and terrified consumers, to swell the coffers of the multinational drug companies."
"There is a perfectly simple answer to the question – and I apologise for my frankness to my fellow Member and to the ingenuous Commission (whose good intentions I have no desire to call into question): if the risk of a pandemic with millions of working hours lost and vast numbers of human victims were a real one, those humans, the Union, the Member States and the Governments would not only have the ethical duty but also every economic justification for distributing vaccine free of charge."
"Let us block the import of chickens, but above all let us take action against the hacks and charlatans peddling terror, who are responsible both for the pandemic of neurosis and for the criminal speculation which is ruining hundreds of poultry farmers and risking the jobs of thousands of workers."
"If I catch this deadly virus, I hope to take with me to the grave as many as possible of these fools and scoundrels who are inflicting this suffering on mankind."
"– Mr President, various speakers have made the point this morning that it is time not to panic, but rather to plan."
"While this resolution is very much about human health, we have to remember that we have to control avian influenza in the world."
"It is not just a case of Europe closing its doors and it will not happen."
"All the Member States must go out and help those countries that have avian influenza at the moment, and I know the Commission is doing that."
"The key is to stamp it out in the world if at all possible."
"That is why I would urge more help for countries outside the European Union to stop this disease coming in."
"I would also like to say quite clearly, as other speakers have done, that importing wild birds into the European Union at the moment is crazy and needs to be stopped, at least for the time being, because there is no point in bringing in disease."
"Contingency planning is also very important because, as Mrs Lucas said, during the foot-and-mouth outbreak there was a total lack of contingency planning."
"We have to make sure we are ready and have vaccines available."
"I also think that at the moment not enough information is going out in the Member States to the poultry industry and to those who are actually running our poultry farms, to ensure that, firstly, there is increased biosecurity and, secondly, that they have protection from the disease if it comes into the European Union."
"We have to be ready."
"We have to look at vaccines that are available, because it must not be forgotten that this disease can mutate into several different viruses."
"At the moment we are talking very much about the H5 vaccine, but we have to be ready with other forms of vaccine should the disease mutate into another strain."
"So let us prepare, let us try to stamp it out of the poultry industry and stop it mutating into a human form of the disease, because then the citizens of Europe will be protected."
"I wish you well in getting all Member States together and in getting a proper contingency plan in place, Commissioner."
"– Commissioner, thank you for your introduction."
"I am still left with three questions about avian flu."
"Last week, you communicated that you would advise Member States to have people who work in the poultry sector vaccinated with the flu vaccine."
"Whilst this is in itself a useful measure, because that way, it is possible to reduce the risk of mutation of H5N1 into a form that is transmitted from one human being to another, what causes me anxiety, though, is the excessively non-committal tone of a suggestion to Member States that they might make a recommendation to poultry farmers."
"I think that the European Union should learn from the previous health crises with SARS and BSE."
"In both cases, the Member States adopted their own policies, sometimes with opposite effects."
"My first question is whether the Commission can shed light on this as quickly as possible."
"I would also like to hear from the Commission what priority it gives to support for flu vaccination campaigns in the poultry sector in Turkey and Romania and what support is in place for similar vaccination campaigns in Asia."
"My second question concerns the availability of medicines."
"According to experts, EUR 150 million would be sufficient for the preliminary development of new medicines to stave off the pandemic."
"Which products exactly will you be making available?"
"My third and final question has to do with the capacity for producing medicines and their affordability."
"Are you prepared, in the event of a pandemic, to suspend the relevant patent rights and data exclusivity?"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, if we in Europe want to protect ourselves, we should have acted years ago to provide aid to Asia, and by that I mean technical aid to address the problem that much of our meat is already produced there from animals kept in breeding establishments."
"The problem is that these animals, which have been intensively bred with the aid of technology, come into contact with regional breeds or wild animals, which carry the virus without becoming ill in clinical terms."
"If the virus is then passed on to animals kept in breeding establishments, there is the potential for mutations and variations that can present a danger to human beings."
"This is where the provision of technical aid would certainly make sense."
"What is, of course, nonsensical about this whole debate is the idea that we might be able to gain technical mastery over nature by doing away with it and resorting to banning the entry of geese or the keeping of animals under extensive farming conditions in an attempt to get on top of all this."
"This strikes me as reflecting the interests of the cage industry more than anyone else’s."
"– Mr President, as well as World War I, Europe experienced another disaster in 1918, namely the Spanish Influenza."
"The latter claimed 20 million victims, and resembled avian influenza in some respects."
"Europe today is not fully prepared for another epidemic of this kind. It may well be the case that the pharmaceutical companies are better prepared than the Commission and the governments of the EU Member States."
"It would be preferable, however, to prevent these companies from profiting from the circumstances, and to avoid a scandalous situation in which millions of people cannot be vaccinated because they cannot afford the expensive vaccines."
"Preventive medicine should be made available to everyone, no matter how much money they have."
"Warnings should also be issued to those Member States that are completely unprepared for this potential disaster, and that are waiting for the European Commission to solve the problem for them."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to stress that we in the Socialist Group believe that both the European Commission and the Council must commit themselves to cooperating economically and scientifically with the countries of South-East Asia, since, so far, they have been the main focus of bird flu infection, and it is crucial that it be eradicated at origin."
"We also believe that the pharmaceutical industry should cooperate closely with the European Commission, and with the Member States and the World Health Organisation, in a coordinated fashion and involving a communication strategy, without alarming the population, but with significant levels of information and transparency."
"A final question, or rather an appeal: the slaughter of birds, provided that the health authorities consider it necessary, should not be turned into a deplorable spectacle, such as those we have seen in the media, and furthermore it should be carried out in accordance with proper guidelines."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, flu pandemics in Europe have been documented for more than a century and we know that the three A virus sub-types we have had originated from birds: the H1 in 1918, the H2 in 1957 and the H3 in 1968."
"All of them originated amongst birds and all of them mutated."
"We have known since 1997 that the H5 sub-type is highly contagious, that it is capable of being transmitted to man and producing a form of influenza with a high death rate, but that so far transmission is only possible through contact with diseased birds and their excrement."
"The H5 virus has spread amongst wild and domestic birds, and migratory birds are spreading it all over the place."
"Furthermore, it has been communicated to mammals such as pigs and cats."
"For all of these reasons, there is broad consensus amongst health experts and bodies about the possibility that the A virus H5 may adapt to human transmission and create a new pandemic."
"I believe that the executive Commission has so far acted responsibly and transparently within the framework of its competences."
"Perhaps its powers should be increased if a period of emergency and a pandemic begin."
"I would like to insist that it is important to lay down relevant rules that the Member States can follow, and to coordinate and monitor compliance with them, and also to urge the media to report rigorously but without creating unnecessary social alarm."
"I believe that we must strengthen the wildlife monitoring network, which is closely related to the majority of emerging diseases."
"Finally, I believe that we must enhance R+D resources within the European Union with a view to responding in a medical and scientific fashion as quickly as possible, should the need arise."
"– Mr President, I should like to start by thanking and congratulating the Commission on the speed of its reaction to public health issues, a policy which does not come quite within its competence, and I think that the motion for a resolution, which attempts to coordinate the public authorities on this important issue, is also within this framework."
"Within the framework, however, of a comprehensive policy at national and Community level and in conjunction with the confirmed lack of a fundamental communication policy to inform citizens at national and Community level, the poultry market has been shaken, with plummeting levels of consumption."
"The Commission, in cooperation with all the competent Commissioners, including Mrs Fischer Boel, will need to mobilise, firstly, the political safeguarding of farmers' incomes from market crises."
"The Council of Ministers for Agriculture will need, at long last, to take a decision on this matter."
"Secondly, fundamental Community financing for the problems of poultry farms and, thirdly, the necessary marking of poultry for consumption, to the effect that they are from inspected farms."
"This marking will help to intensify inspections of poultry farms and restore consumer confidence in this sector."
"– Mr President, over the past 300 years, 10 influenza pandemics have occurred among humans."
"The most recent came in 1968-69, and the most deadly in 1918-19: the so-called Spanish flu pandemic."
"Scientists have been predicting a lethal cyclical resurgence of influenza for some time, one that will be more deadly because of our low levels of resistance."
"Now, with avian influenza, they are recognising the hallmarks of such a virus."
"The medical histories of those who have died of H5N1 influenza to date are disturbingly similar to accounts of sufferers of the 1918-19 outbreak."
"Since scientists first started saving flu virus samples in the early 20th century, an H5N1 influenza has never spread among human beings, so population vulnerability to an H5N1-like pandemic virus would be universal."
"The influenza virus is an RNA virus containing eight genes."
"Like most RNA viruses, it reproduces sloppily, its genes readily fall apart, and it can absorb different genetic material which recombines in a process called reassortment."
"When influenza successfully infects a new species, it can reassort, and may switch from being an avian to a mammalian one."
"When that occurs, a human epidemic can result."
"Since it was first recorded in 1997, avian flu strain H5N1 has undergone multiple reassortments – more than 17 mutations – and evolved at high speed to the point where, in January 2003, the ‘z’ virus emerged."
"In late 2004, there was one documented case of human-to-human transmission of the ‘z’ strain of H5N1."
"By April 2005, the H5N1 virus had also moved to pigs."
"It is this rapid evolution of the virus that makes it such a potential threat."
"We cannot prepare a vaccine in advance or stockpile it."
"The total number of companies willing and able to produce influenza vaccines has plummeted in recent years from more than two dozen in 1980 to just a handful in 2004."
"There is serious questioning in the scientific community about the possibility of speeding up vaccine production because of contamination risks."
"While it is important for us to be prepared and vigilant and to take precautionary action, with responsible risk assessment and forward planning, a lot will depend on the availability and effectiveness of anti-virals and vaccines and hospital bed capacity, which has been seriously reduced in all EU countries in the last decade."
"– Mr President, I agree with everybody who has said that we are facing a veterinary crisis which must be tackled urgently."
"I particularly want to see measures on movements of wild birds, and we must prepare in case there is a mutation of the virus into a human pandemic."
"I agree with everything that has been said about preparing the European Union, stockpiling vaccines and antivirals, and developing a vaccine."
"I want to ask the Commissioner the same question I asked him last time we debated this issue, and that concerns the rest of the world."
"What discussions is he having with his colleagues in the Development DG of the European Commission?"
"This pandemic could hit the poorest countries hard as well."
"We should be talking to the WHO about not just a possible European reserve fund or stock but also a worldwide reserve stock of vaccines and drugs and possibly some kind of solidarity fund."
"– Europe has found itself truly at the threshold of a global crisis."
"We must prepare ourselves for a pandemic, and we must not be taken by surprise."
"It has been shown that during the ‘Spanish flu’ pandemic of 1918, the disease claimed at least 20 million victims."
"According to the World Health Organisation, we can now expect a pandemic to cause the loss of 2 to 7 million lives."
"This is not panic-mongering."
"The WHO admits that the number may even rise as high as 150 million."
"In the event of a pandemic, the production of a vaccine after mutation occurs will be complicated, and we will be racing against time to save lives."
"Not all European Union countries pay equal attention to the problem."
"There are countries that allocate national resources in a responsible manner, but there are also countries that clearly underestimate the threat of the disease and, in particular, its possible consequences."
"I therefore call for coordinated action at the European level."
"National plans for prevention and immunisation should be drawn up in cooperation with European institutions and Member States."
"Every Member State should have a highly effective pandemic plan."
"We know that the effectiveness and level of these plans vary."
"I urgently call on the Union to mobilise and release more substantial financial, technical and material resources."
"Many findings suggest that European countries are not adequately prepared; half of the Member States do not have a sufficient stock of antiviral medicines."
"Cooperation with pharmaceuticals companies must be strengthened in order to secure the necessary quantity of antiviral drugs."
"The Senior United Nations System Coordinator for Avian and Human Influenza, Dr David Nabarro, underlined huge differences in the amount of funds allocated for prevention and treatment."
"Thus, while the UN has only allocated 7 million dollars for this purpose, the United States alone has already released one hundred million dollars."
"According to Dr Nabarro, the UN would need at least USD 175 million for an effective programme."
"In case a flu epidemic breaks out, I am asking whether such countries as Japan, the United States or the European Union will be ready to put their resources and vaccines at the disposal of developing countries to help localise a pandemic or epidemic wherever it occurs."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the threatened spread of the epidemic of avian influenza and its possible development into a pandemic are a visible and hideous prospect for both birds and man."
"The Commission and the Council must lay down measures."
"The epidemic must be prevented from spreading to domestic and wild birds."
"Care must be taken to ensure the virus does not spread beyond commercial and domestic poultry installations in which cases of the virus have already been confirmed by laboratory analysis."
"The populations of birds living in wetlands must be protected both from the spread and from the teams of self-styled saviours exterminating them."
"The rules of sensitivity must be adhered to where cases have been identified, as must the rules of hygienic burial."
"The profession must be compensated, as must the citizens to whom we owe protection from misleading information and speculation and planned support."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with warm thanks to the Commissioner for the clarity of his statement, from which it would appear that the EU and its Member States are relatively well prepared."
"Your statement is a calm and matter-of-fact one, and, in that you focus on the protection of poultry generally and not just on the possibility of a pandemic, that will help us all to make progress."
"I myself worked for 15 years as a veterinarian, specialising in the poultry industry, with the Organisation of Animal Health, and could well have something to say about a lot of things, not least the vaccination of poultry."
"Not having enough time available to me, though, I do not propose to do so."
"On Monday, a number of Members of this House visited the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin."
"It has to be said that its 160 experts, who are active around the world, are doing an excellent job of advising you and the Member States."
"There is, admittedly, as yet insufficient provision for worldwide cooperation, but the first steps are rightly being taken in that direction; there is a conference being held in Canada today, and the WHO has met in South-East Asia."
"Much more needs to be done to address this problem at the point where it starts and takes root."
"Secondly, Mr Bowis and others have already pointed out that a system of inoculation will not be enough to contain the pandemic that threatens us."
"Reference has also been made to the Spanish flu of 1918, which cost 50 million people their lives."
"What that means is that there is an urgent need for a change of approach where the production of vaccines is concerned, and it also goes without saying that we can work much more quickly with cell cultures such as MPS."
"Thirdly, what about anti-flu vaccines – who is to order them, who is to store them, who is to pay for them?"
"As these medicines keep for five years, there certainly needs to be a plan drawn up."
"My fourth point is that no reference has been made in this debate to Africa."
"What will happen when migratory birds reach Africa?"
"The people in Africa, like those in South-East Asia, live cheek by jowl with their birds, and they are at risk of infection."
"Who has responsibility for this?"
"I am quite sure that we share it."
"Fifthly, I would like to thank those conservationists, ornithologists and hunters, along with all non-governmental organisations, who have assumed a heavy responsibility for monitoring migratory birds and have passed on their knowledge."
"The ultimate question is not whether a pandemic is on the way, but when."
"That is what should be the focus of our attention."
". Mr President, I will try to reply to most of the questions."
"It is true that we had a simulation exercise last week for smallpox."
"It was mostly focused on the possibility of a bioterrorist attack."
"However, the reaction is more or less the same."
"We will be able to see, from the results of that exercise, what the weaknesses are in the whole system and, hopefully, correct them in time for the influenza exercise in a few weeks’ time."
"The purpose of the exercises is to detect mistakes and weaknesses and correct them."
"I did not mention much on the veterinary side because that is to do with the pandemic stage."
"However, I should give some information regarding wild birds."
"Today the Commission is proposing to discuss with the standing committee the ban on imports of wild captive birds to the European Union."
"We feel that is a precautionary measure that we need to take today for a temporary period."
"Our experts will then review it and decide if it needs to remain in place."
"On the solidarity front, the regulation has not been adopted yet by either Parliament or Council."
"The idea of that regulation is to reimburse the cost of use of antivirals or vaccines in the event of a pandemic."
"If the Council and Parliament decide that it has to be readjusted to deal with purchases and precautionary measures, then that is something we can discuss."
"The international aspect is very important."
"I mentioned that last time."
"I will be travelling to South-East Asia – the most affected area – to talk to the authorities there."
"Nevertheless, there have been some developments."
"In November we will have the Geneva meeting with support from the WHO, FAO, OIE and the World Bank."
"There is no reason for duplication, but we must support the international initiatives that have been started by those organisations."
"The Geneva conference will assess the needs – financing and other technical needs – to meet this challenge and will be followed by a pledging conference early next year."
"That is the important conference, where funds should be pledged to support the most affected countries in this effort."
"Seasonal vaccination is the correct approach, but it involves an investment towards increasing the manufacturing capacity and will at the same time help the groups at risk to deal with this problem."
"On the issue of communication, it is very important that we maintain transparency; it is very important that we inform our citizens about the exact situation."
"Sometimes the media exaggerate."
"That is a risk we have to take."
"However, any suspicion of a cover-up or of hiding information will have the worst results and that will cause panic."
"I admit that there was some panic, but it was not the Commission, nor any European institution, nor any European government that linked avian flu last summer, almost as a certainty, to a pandemic."
"At the same time – as mentioned in your resolution – the WHO believes that the influenza pandemic will happen in the near future."
"It is therefore natural that people are worried."
"The only way to deal with that panic is not by not giving information but by explaining what we are doing to deal with this issue."
"We need both national and Community plans."
"Each country has its own peculiarities, so each country needs to have its own plan, but we have a Community plan."
"Last year we established such a plan, which coordinates and links the national plans with the Community in order to achieve coordination."
"As to avian flu, we will have more outbreaks."
"We have to be realistic about that."
"We should not panic or transmit panic every time there is a dead wild bird found on a farm with signs of the virus."
"That will happen."
"We have the system and the legislation in place, and we will use them."
"The CVOs meet regularly, contact farmers and advise them about what they should do."
"On culling, that is something we wish to avoid, but we have to take account of the safety issue."
"We advise that this be done through animal welfare measures regarding poultry."
"However, unless we have strong scientific evidence for such a measure, I would not support the culling of wild birds."
"The daily warning system works very well."
"The European Centre for Disease Control is very active in this effort."
"Member States and the Commission are linked together in an effective way with an early warning system and are in contact and cooperation with the WHO."
"Yesterday in the Council we also discussed the issue of compensation for farmers."
"Eradication measures are financed or co-financed by the Commission, but the compensation for loss of profit or market is a matter being discussed in the Agriculture Council."
"There has been a reference to Spanish flu, but we are much better prepared now."
"We have antibiotics, we have the health care system, we have doctors and other measures that we can take."
"I therefore believe that, with the right effort, we can minimise the number of deaths in the event of a pandemic."
"I will inform Parliament whenever we have anything new to report."
"I have received a proposal for a resolution(1) submitted in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"– Despite the recent alarmist statements, it remains difficult today to grasp what health risks there are and to put a figure on the probability of the H5N1 virus mutating into a form that can be transmitted to, and between, human beings."
"The threat of a pandemic is real."
"Until now, this virus has caused 112 cases of human influenza, including 57 deaths, all of which were confined to South-East Asia."
"Therefore, all measures for preventing the pandemic need to be implemented by all parties concerned in the area, from farmers to veterinary surgeons and, in particular, by hunters of migratory birds."
"In order to minimise the risk, international coordination efforts and the implementation of a European preparation plan are crucial."
"The European preparation plan is already up and running and it will have to be carefully structured around the various national plans."
"Strengthening coordination and transparency between Member States, and protecting Europe’s borders at the same time as assuming our duty of solidarity towards third countries, are principles that must guide our actions."
"However, a problem arises when private laboratories produce prototype vaccines against an emerging virus, because this is a matter of health and public safety."
"Specific allocations of European money will have to be dedicated to this area of research."
"It is in these tragic circumstances that Europe finds its"
"The next item is voting time."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment on which we are about to vote concerns the inclusion of the prestigious European College of Parma in the list; if it were excluded, it would be in danger of closure."
"That would be damaging not only for Parma but for the entire European Union and for its training."
"Mr President of the Republic of Chile, Presidents of the Chilean Congress and Senate, ladies and gentlemen, it is our privilege today to receive the President of the Republic of Chile, don Ricardo Lagos Escobar, who is accompanied also by the Presidents of the two Chilean parliamentary houses."
"Don Ricardo Lagos is an exceptionally important person on the Latin American political scene."
"Mr President, please allow me, on behalf of the European Parliament, to welcome you most warmly."
"When Ricardo Lagos was 45 years old, he left a quiet and comfortable life in the United Nations to rent a small office in Santiago de Chile and to begin to work for democracy in his country, which was then in the grip of a military dictatorship."
"He worked, he fought and he travelled throughout Chile; he was arrested, but he went back to fighting to put an end to General Pinochet’s regime."
"He has worked tirelessly to repeal the authoritarian aspects of a Constitution signed by a dictator, and a month ago he succeeded in reforming that Constitution, which has now been signed by a democratic president."
"In the collective memory of the Chileans and of all of the world’s democrats, it is with emotion that we remember the image of Ricardo Lagos on a television programme that has made history, looking at the camera and pointing his finger, confronting Pinochet and opening up the path that would lead millions of Chileans to vote ‘no’ in the 1988 referendum, through which Pinochet hoped to remain in power."
"I believe that that is the most symbolic image of Chile’s transition to democratic openness."
"Through his faith in Chile and in democracy, he supported a Christian Democrat, Patricio Aylwin, as President of Chile, and in that government he was Minister for Education and carried out an in-depth reform of education in his country."
"It was then with another Christian Democrat, President Frei, who had previously been his opponent in the presidential elections, that he was Minister for Public Works; this is a good example of cooperation amongst Christian Democrats and Socialists, at a time when the country needed it in order to achieve the transition towards democracy."
"It was then that I had the opportunity to meet him: he, Minister for Public Works in his country, and I in mine."
"Under your guidance, my dear friend, I began to get to know your wonderful country, from the volcanic deserts of the north to the alpine landscapes of the south, and to the southernmost parts of the country."
"Finally, in March 2000, he was elected President of the Republic of Chile, a country which, back in 1812, at the dawn of its independence, drew up its Provisional Constitutional Regulation, which read:"
"Apply these words to Ceuta, to Melilla or to Lampedusa, and we can see what a horrendous situation we have in Europe at the moment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the Aymara language, Chile means ‘the place where the world ends’ and sure enough, at the border of the Bio-Bio river, the world ended, because the Spanish conquest came to an end there in the face of fierce Araucanian resistance."
"Today, however, Chile is fully integrated into the world, an open, dynamic and democratic country that has signed the most complete association agreement that the European Union has ever signed with any other country not aspiring to join the Union."
"Since then, Chilean exports into the Union have increased by 35% and globally our exchanges have multiplied practically by three."
"That demonstrates the mutual benefit we derive from our association."
"On welcoming you, Mr President, I would like to acknowledge that it is a privilege for this Parliament that you have wanted to come here, when you are about to end your presidential term; a term, incidentally, that you are ending with a public approval rating of over 65%, which is remarkably positive, not only in Latin America, but also in Europe."
"Please believe me, therefore, Mr President, that we are all very happy to hear from you the lessons we can learn from Chile’s great journey towards democracy."
"Thank you very much, Mr President, for your kind presentation. Ladies and gentlemen, good friends all: fifteen years ago, I came here to speak with your group presidents as one of the leaders of the opposition to the Chilean dictatorship."
"Today, I stand before you as the President of a democratic country, in which a broad political and social coalition has successfully remained in government for fifteen years."
"Chile has changed a great deal since those dark days."
"We have succeeded in recovering our citizenship and our democratic institutions."
"We have doubled production and globalised our economy."
"At the same time, we have reduced poverty by half, we have reformed education, health and justice, and, with public and private resources, we have carried out the most ambitious infrastructure and housing plan: today, one in every four homes in Chile has been built over the last fifteen years."
"I believe that we have a high level of social cohesion today because of these developments, and our integration with global society is supported by our own society."
"We have also looked to Europe’s experience."
"For more than half a century, you have managed to combine democracy, a market economy and a high level of social cohesion, compatible with macroeconomic balances and with a welfare State or, better, with a social protection network."
"We have a common cultural heritage and historical links which unite us."
"We Chileans vividly remember this assembly’s support of Chile’s return to democracy."
"During difficult moments in our country, members of Parliament at that time travelled to Chile, participated in meetings, supported our civil society and expressed their solidarity with the democratic cause."
"We remember these events with nothing but gratitude."
"And I would ask you to appreciate the significance of what we have accomplished."
"Europe’s role was, is and always will be invaluable."
"History, our history, would have been different without you."
"The truth about human rights violations is now public and acknowledged."
"Our brilliant journey to discover the truth began with the Rettig report, on the disappeared, and has continued until today with the Valech report, on prison and torture during those dark years."
"I do not know of any other country in the world that has dared to form a commission to listen to the statements of 35 000 people, who were detained and tortured, of which the commission recognised that 29 000 were victims."
"We have been able to recognise the moral conscience of our society."
"We have faced the task of obtaining truth and justice with regard to violations of human rights."
"As President Borrell said, Chile now has a strong and robust democracy."
"The authoritarian Constitution has been amended."
"The workers have been given back their rights."
"Chile now has unemployment benefits, labour reforms and new, more effective labour laws."
"The role of women is increasingly recognised; there is significant and complete legislation on family duties and rights."
"The protection of the environment is now part of the collective imagination and it has been enshrined in important public policies that were recently analysed by the OECD."
"Today in Chile, new generations that have grown up and been educated in a democracy, are broadening their horizons and are displaying creativity in every field."
"Today, seven out of every ten people in higher education are the first generation in their families to receive a university education."
"That is the enormity of the change we have made in Chile: it is a more libertarian country, with more solidarity, which is more progressive, more open to a world on which we want to leave our mark."
"It is true that we reduced poverty from 40% to 18%, and extreme poverty from 12.9% to 4%."
"We have a competitive economy, low levels of corruption and satisfactory human development indicators."
"We are not satisfied, however; there is still much to do."
"We have to modify the social security programme to make it more fair and equitable."
"There are still chronic inequalities in the distribution of labour income."
"The wages of the richest quintile of the population are, on average, fourteen times higher than the wages of the poorest quintile."
"If we introduce what we offer in social welfare into the equation, however, that difference is reduced to seven times."
"We must find a just balance between social protection and the conditions for maintaining competitiveness."
"We therefore look at Europe in a different way to yourselves."
"The European debate is sometimes our debate — I am aware of the situation that this Parliament is currently undergoing and I do not want to get into issues that are part of your debate — but I would, however, like to point out that, although Chile has often been presented as a neo-liberal model, the reality could not be more different."
"We believe that the so-called ‘Washington Consensus’, which talks about liberalising markets, privatising certain companies, deregulation and balanced budgets is something that Chile applied, and in a timely fashion."
"What does not appear in the ‘Washington Consensus’, however, is the need for concrete public policy in the midst of growth, aimed at the poorest sectors of society in order to create a social welfare net. No country can compete in the world without such a net."
"Countries which are not able to create a minimum degree of social cohesion within their societies will, in the long term, be faced with an internal conflict in their society, which hinders their competition with the outside."
"We have therefore made an enormous effort to grow and we have grown."
"But this growth has been converted into social policies, in education; we have carried out the most in-depth reform of health and I must say to you, ‘my word, it is difficult!’, because reforming health means battling with a whole range of diverse interests."
"I told our doctor friends in Chile, ‘My friends, you are all socialists during the morning, when you are working in a public hospital, but you are all capitalists in the afternoon, when you are treating your private patients’."
"And when they threatened me with strikes, I said, ‘Alright, but go on strike in the morning and in the afternoon’."
"I am sure you understand what I am saying!"
"It is therefore difficult to carry out a health reform, because the only people who are not organised are the patients in the hospitals and the only people on whose behalf we must speak are them."
"Reform therefore involves an enormous change in favour of primary healthcare."
"Today in Chile, with regard to 25 pathologies — there will soon be 56 pathologies, which represent 80% of medical interventions in hospitals — we can guarantee three things: a high-quality institution, a time limit for consultation and, if the person has no resources, the resources are provided by the fifteen million Chileans."
"This was a long reform process, but it is part of social cohesion, which is essential."
"We understand your debate, in the field of health, in the field of welfare;"
"I would like to point out that the average age in Chile is very similar to the average age here in Europe, there are just a few months difference, and the need to provide social welfare for an ageing population is very important for us."
"At the same time, we have been able to create a good macroeconomic situation and I would like to point out that Chile conforms to all of the Maastricht requirements."
"In other words, your debate is sometimes our debate."
"And we therefore follow it closely and we also want to learn from what you have done."
"Why not say it?"
"In many respects, Europe offers an important example to the world today and sometimes, tied up in your own debates, you do not realise that you are an example of the type of society that is wanted in the world today."
"We know that, in order to continue growing in an equitable manner in the future and not remain trapped in a pattern of exporting raw materials and low job creation and welfare, we must invest heavily in innovation, science and technology."
"We have quadrupled our efforts, but we are creating a fund for innovation funded by a very small part of the income produced by copper."
"Copper is a non-renewable source, which generates a large amount of income for Chile."
"This immense income will provide a basis for the future by means of science and technology."
"In this regard, therefore, we are counting on European cooperation."
"The agreement we have with Europe is one that will enable us also to access your resources in this field."
"We also want to enhance our integration into the world economy."
"We are convinced that countries progress when they see the whole planet as a possibility."
"We must not be afraid of globalisation."
"In our case, globalisation has opened up new possibilities, including for small economies that are far from the main international centres."
"Of course, no automatic mechanism is going to be able to reduce the inequalities, instability and crises that globalisation brings with it."
"But we must have rules and institutions that are able to govern the globalisation process."
"If we want to achieve them, we must affirm the capacity for a currently emerging global politics to guide society."
"I want to say here that we are frankly worried about the incredibly fast advance of globalisation, amid multilateral institutions that are unable to keep up the regulation of this process."
"Here in Europe, we see an essential agent in the establishment of fairer trade rules, the creation of global public goods, the reorganisation of international organisations and macroeconomic coordination among the most important economic powers on the planet."
"To whom should I turn when in the far south of Chile, the ozone layer is deteriorating and solar rays are stronger as a result of emissions of gases in the northern hemisphere?"
"Some people do not like the Kyoto agreements;"
"I have said to the leaders of those countries, ‘that is all very well, but tell me then where I should go to complain about what is happening in the world?’."
"Because what is happening in my country is a problem coming from the outside."
"I would therefore like to share with you something that we consider to be central: for a country like Chile, the multilateral ends up being local."
"That is why we believe in the United Nations, of which we are founding members."
"That is why we believe that the Security Council is the only body with the legitimacy to use force on behalf of the human race."
"At a time, therefore, when our country was on the Security Council, we said no to an invasion of Iraq if the decision was taken outside of the Security Council."
"Because we were consistent, we said yes and within seventy-two hours made an effort and deployed our armed forces in Haiti, because we believed that, as Latin Americans, we had the obligation to do our duty when the Security Council asked us to, in a country in the region of Latin America and Caribbean that was facing enormous difficulties."
"I am convinced, therefore, that the problems of Europe and of the under-developed world are going to be resolved jointly."
"As a European professor pointed out, if we insist on enclosing ourselves behind walls, we will perish at the hands of assailants from inside and from out."
"These shared values and objectives form the basis of the Association Agreement signed by Chile with the European Union on 18 November 2002."
"The European Parliament approved this agreement unanimously, in a political gesture that Chile acknowledges and is grateful for."
"With me today at this formal occasion, therefore, are the Presidents of the Senate and of the House of Deputies of Chile, one of whom is a distinguished member of the opposition to my government in Chile, but in these areas there is a State policy which unites all Chileans."
"This is the broadest and most comprehensive Agreement signed by Chile to date and it may also be the European Union’s most ambitious."
"We are building our partnership."
"We are strengthening links in all of the areas and fields contained in the Association Agreement."
"Our exchange is increasingly dynamic, as President Borrell has pointed out."
"The European Union has increased its importance as the largest external investor in our economy, now representing 42% of total foreign investments in Chile."
"Our trade is very balanced geographically: 30% Europe, 25% Asia, 18% United States, the rest, Latin America."
"We have signed a Horizontal Agreement on Air Transport, which we hope soon to turn into a Single Skies Agreement between Chile and Europe."
"Within the framework of the Agreement we have held a frank and intense dialogue with Europe, a dialogue of true allies, although on occasions we may differ with regard to certain policies — I do not wish to talk about agricultural subsidies here — but we have common approaches."
"Within this context, we are participating in the European Union’s ALTHEA operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina: Chilean troops are contributing to peace in a European country."
"Because we are aware of these responsibilities, we are participating in Haiti, as I said, and we hope to cooperate more closely with the European Union in the new phase following the elections in that country."
"We are cooperating actively in the modernisation of our public institutions; we want to enhance our cooperation on environmental issues; we want to exchange experiences and good practices in order further to strengthen social cohesion in Chile."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we Latin Americans are not unfamiliar with the diversity being seen in Europe today."
"Some of our brothers and sisters are making the opposite journey to the one centuries ago that brought mass European migration towards our continent."
"Not just Spaniards."
"In the middle of the 19th century many of the countries here which were having difficulties growing exported a huge amount of workforce to America."
"Some people are now making the return journey towards here."
"We are firmly committed to the consolidation of a strategic association between Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean."
"We want Europe to have greater presence over there."
"We see our Association Agreement as a significant step."
"We are following the European Union’s negotiations with our brothers and sisters in Mercosur with interest and hope."
"We hope to hold more in-depth association negotiations soon, and I hope that the next Euro-Latin American Summit, which will take place in Vienna next year, will lead to the creation of an inter-regional strategic partnership with concrete tasks and measures."
"We Latin Americans sometimes use too much rhetoric; in these agreements we want concrete facts."
"More than once I have told the different European leaders of the need to understand the Colombia process, the efforts being made there to find peace."
"We must all be sure to support Colombia in its present efforts to promote national co-existence."
"Because we are united by our past, what we are and what we aspire to be, we want to do much more with Europe."
"With a strong Europe, united in its external action, determined to play its rightful role in the world."
"A Europe committed to free trade that contributes to the success of the Doha Round."
"A Europe that seeks social cohesion internally and also at global level."
"A Europe that is in favour of multilateralism and seeks to give globalisation a human face."
"A Europe that promotes dialogue and agreement amongst the different cultural, religious and secular traditions within the framework of what has been called an alliance of civilisations."
"Ladies and gentlemen, 3 500 years ago, a European said in the , ‘Tell me, O muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide."
"Many cities did he visit, and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted … ’"
"I have come to this Parliament today to ask you to tell us that story, because this journey of 3 500 years is also our journey."
"At times we have taken different directions."
"Many times."
"There is always the possibility that we will do so again in the future."
"By becoming acquainted with the manners and customs of others, however, and by appreciating the variety of their cities, we must reach a successful common destiny."
"You supported us during difficult times."
"We are now proud to come together again as partners and we will always see ourselves as friends, united not just by interests, but also by common ideals and shared identities."
"That is the essential value that we want to continue to preserve and it is for that reason that I have come here to speak to you."
"Thank you very much for inviting me."
"Thank you very much, Mr President, for reminding us of the importance of Europe."
"Thank you for telling us that sometimes, wrapped up in our own problems, we lose sight of the importance of our project."
"In fact, Europe is not just a project for its own sake, but also responds to a need in the world."
"Thank you for saying that here in the European Parliament, which is honoured to have you here."
"– Mr President, on a point or order, I just wish to say that, to avoid any potential conflict of financial interest, I shall be present but not voting on the Hieronymi report."
"That concludes voting time."
"We have voted in favour of the aviation agreement between the EC and Azerbaijan, but that does not mean that we express approval of Azerbaijan’s having opened an air link between the northern, Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus and Baku."
"We do not think that the opening of this air link is a reason for voting against this aviation agreement."
"These are two different issues, and negotiations with Azerbaijan concerning the above-mentioned air link must be conducted in another context."
", . In July, Azerbaijan began operating flights between its capital and Northern Cyprus, which is under Turkish military occupation."
"As Cypriot Members of this House – and in particular Members of our parliamentary group – have said, these flights are in breach of the principles of civil aviation and international law."
"I wish to point out that this is not the only example of attempts at imposing recognition, on a practical level, of the Turkish military occupation of part of Cyprus, the so-called ‘Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus’, which is not recognised by the United Nations."
"Parliament recently decided to set up a ‘contact group for relations with the Northern part of Cyprus’, a move condemned by our parliamentary group. There have also been initiatives on the part of the Commission, such as the one aimed at establishing direct trade relations with the occupied part of Cypress – currently blocked by the Council on account of opposition among various Member States – which rides roughshod over United Nations resolutions."
"Hence our vote against the report."
"I voted in favour of the Blokland recommendation for a second reading on ‘Shipments of waste’. This regulation is needed so that shipments of waste can be conducted in complete safety, or, in other words, in such a way that they pose no risk to the environment."
". Only a few of the amendments not accepted by the Council were taken up at this second reading."
"I wish to point out that of the 103 amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading, the common position has adopted only 41, and some of those only in part."
"Among the rejected proposals were issues as important as information and transparency, which have since been taken up."
"Proposals aimed at retaining animal by-products and other waste under the scope of the directive have also been taken up."
"In this way, Parliament is seeking to ensure that the transfer of such waste is conducted in a sound and responsible manner."
"That being said, the majorities required to prevent derogations and to adopt some equally important proposals, some of which were tabled by the Greens, were not formed."
"Examples of this include ship decommissioning and the need to ensure that this is done safely and in compliance with environmental requirements, with a view to protecting human and environmental health."
"Efforts must be channelled into ensuring greater coordination on the issue of ships, especially those transporting dangerous or polluting goods, in order to prevent further tragedies."
"This report involves weighing up internal market issues against environmental issues."
"On the basis purely of principle, we believe that the EU Member States should decide for themselves whether or not they wish to allow domestic companies to import waste from other countries."
"One basic condition of such imports is, however, that agreements entered into on an international basis should be complied with and that the transported waste should not constitute an environmental risk for other Member States."
"Obviously, environmentally hazardous chemicals should not be carried on international waterways if there are alternative ways of transporting them."
"Because it constitutes a sensible compromise between environmental considerations and compliance with the rules of the internal market, we have chosen to support the line taken by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"We believe, then, that international shipments of waste should be permitted provided that the waste as such does not constitute a significant environmental risk."
"In line with the above-mentioned thinking, we have opposed the rapporteur’s position on a number of key issues, for example his position that waste should not be allowed to be transported if said waste can be treated in the country in which it was produced."
". The fact that Waste has become a tradeable and even valuable commodity, brings with it a need for careful regulation in relation to movement of shipments of Waste, both within and across member state boundaries."
"Protection of the environment must be a top priority, and I hope that both Council and Parliament will agree."
"I also believe there is a need to limit movements by preventing unjustified shipments, dealing with Waste disposal and recycling as near as possible to point of production of the Waste, and ensuring that enforcement of Waste shipment regulations is improved."
"in writing. I support this report which aims to update existing EU rules on cross border shipments of waste and bring them into line with international agreements."
"I regret that this is being dealt with under a legal base that requires unanimity in Council. I hope that this does not prove to be an impediment to the adoption of strong rules."
"I voted in favour of excluding animal by products from the waste shipment rules as they are adequately covered by other legislation."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Pack report in spite of the unfortunate rejection of Mr Tajani’s amendment, which I viewed as extremely important."
"It is really most regrettable that Parliament did not approve it."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to remind Parliament that, notwithstanding my report on language learning during the last legislature, there has unfortunately been no further discussion of the document which the Commission was to prepare on the basis of Parliament's decisions in that area."
"I hope this will occur without delay in order to progress the above-mentioned report, which also constitutes a basis for the Pack report, since, for lifelong learning to be possible, the citizens of the European Union must have a knowledge of languages, with particular incentives also to learn the minority and regional languages."
". We welcome the fact that the rapporteur acknowledges the continuing great disparity in the performance of education systems in the different Member States, as referred to in the Project for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2003 report; this in spite of all the Community initiatives intended to promote greater equality."
"We also agree that precedence must be given to promoting the teaching and learning of languages and cultural diversity in education and training."
"That being said, we still have a number of objections to the content of the Commission’s proposal, and although the report seeks to alleviate the problems, it fails to provide an effective response. Rather, it retains a tendency to favour the neoliberal policies that are increasingly being felt in the area of education and training."
"The proposal is to set up an integrated programme for 2007/2013, subdivided into six separate sub-programmes (Comenius, Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci, Grundtvig, Transversal and Jean Monnet), the overall budget for which falls short of what is required, in light of the scope and the range of situations covered."
"As such, even with the modest increases in grants, young people and other people on low incomes are still unable to take part."
"Because the financial perspective for 2007-2013 has been rejected by the European Council, we cannot now debate the action programme and its six sub-programmes for the aforesaid period."
"We are certainly supporters of, for example, the Erasmus programme, but there are other parts of the proposed sub-programmes that must be examined carefully in order for us to see whether they are justified on the basis of each Member State having responsibility under the Treaty for the organisation of education and vocational training systems and for the content of these."
"We have therefore voted against the report today, since we think that the financial perspective for 2007-2013 needs first to be clear."
". I voted in favour of this report, which I hope will continue, and extend, the opportunities which are available for all age-groups to take part in trans-national education programmes."
"Many Scots have participated in EU programmes over the years, and it is important to build upon successful schemes."
"In particular I welcome proposals to simplify procedures, and to decentralise administration."
"I note and welcome the fact that amendments from my group led to the inclusion of lesser-used languages, as well as inter-cultural dialogue."
". The Community’s four education and vocational training programmes – Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci, the ‘Action programme to promote bodies active at European level and support specific activities in the field of education and training’ and the e-learning programme – are set to expire at the end of 2006."
"Given the importance of education and training in creating a competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in Europe, and the effectiveness and added value of the European cooperation programmes in this field, the Commission is proposing to set up an integrated action programme in the field of lifelong learning, divided into six separate sub-programmes, by way of preparation for the new generation of programmes for 2007-2013."
"These will mainly be extensions of current actions and programmes."
"This report has my wholehearted support."
"It is indicative of the high quality of the Commission’s proposal, which, on the back of past results, has set more ambitious objectives for the new programme. As such, a substantial increase in funding is required."
"The E.U. has been involved in financing education and vocational programmes for a considerable period of time – this is an involvement I very much welcome."
"However, it is equally clear that there have been too many programmes, the administration has been cumbersome and the budget too low."
"An integrated action programme for lifelong learning to bring under a single framework after 2006 – Socrates, Leonardo, Erasmus, Comenius, 'Grundtvig', Jean Monnet – is very welcome and should help address some of the existing shortcomings."
". – The integration of existing education and training programmes financed by the European Union into a single 'lifelong learning’ programme is no accident."
"It aims to shift the responsibility of the state to provide systematic and scientifically organised education to each individual, so that they will somehow acquire fragmentary knowledge and skills which can be easily adapted to market requirements, as a precondition to the possibility of employment (employability) and an alibi for unemployment."
"That is why the term 'learning' was chosen instead of schooling or education."
"The objective of 'lifelong learning' is to satisfy the demand of big business for flexible workers moulded for even greater exploitation."
"It is the greatest symbol of the 'European ideal'; in other words the competitiveness of the European monopolies."
"Moreover, the first to show an interest in 'lifelong learning' were the major industrialists, who have been calling on the Member States since 1995 to address education as a process which will extend from the cradle to the grave."
"The programme implements this demand, which is why there is no need for pseudo-humanitarian bombast about improving national systems, combating discrimination and so on. The negative experience from the application of similar measures to higher education shows that the integrated programme is here to ram through all levels of education in every Member State."
". The importance of education and training in creating a competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in Europe is widely acknowledged."
"Mrs Pack’s report is based primarily on much-needed simplification measures in the context of the Community’s education and vocational training programmes."
"The Community’s measures in this area have helped to define quality indicators in education and has encouraged the spread of good practice."
"The existing Community instruments naturally complement the measures taken by the Member States and the Commission’s proposal is to streamline the existing instruments in the field."
"This is a well thought-out proposal, which rationalises Community instruments, increasing their coherence and synergy and making them more effective."
"The Commission has therefore tabled more ambitious proposals requiring a substantial increase in funding."
"I voted in favour of this report, as I believe that these programmes will also help to improve education and training systems throughout the EU."
". I'm delighted to see that the Parliament continues to back the ERASMUS exchange programme, which is I believe one of the most vital ways the EU can demonstrate relevance to the people of Europe."
"I believe that this budget, almost uniquely amonst other budget lines, should be increased, at the expense of others if need be, and voted accordingly."
"I took advantage of the ERASMUS programme myself as a student, and strongly believe it to be the most useful, long term, EU programme of all."
". This report improves significantly upon the programme entitled ‘Youth in Action’ for the period 2007-2013 and seeks to take on board some of the criticisms of the previous youth programme made in the interim review and the consultation process, with particular regard to the way in which the procedure for applying for funding has become more flexible and less hampered by red tape."
"The financial framework proposed by the Commission, however, is extremely limited. We therefore back the report’s call for a substantial increase in the funds made available, and welcome its clarification of the fundamental values that we want to promote among young people, such as respect for human dignity, equality, respect for human rights, tolerance and non-discrimination."
"Furthermore, we welcome the amendments intended to place greater emphasis on the following aspects: equality between men and women and the fight against discrimination; and the fight against all forms of exclusion and discrimination including those on grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, in accordance with Article 13 of the Treaty."
"Hence our vote in favour, in spite of some of the programme’s shortcomings."
"Because the financial perspective for 2007-2013 has been rejected by the European Council, we think it too early now to debate the setting up of the ‘Active Youth’ programme."
"To express support in the present situation for a total appropriation to this programme of EUR 915 million (or EUR 1,128 million, depending on which proposal wins the vote) would be absurd."
"The content of the programme may also be called into question."
"The rapporteur writes in her justification that it ‘will make an important contribution to the active citizenship of young people in society and thus enhance their feeling of being part of Europe, so that it is likely to deliver substantial European added value’."
"We question whether the programme really would go any substantial way towards achieving this objective."
"International youth exchanges are a good thing but need to be provided for financially through the efforts of civil society or through the agency of the Member States."
"We do not believe that the EU should contribute money from its budget in this area."
"We have therefore voted against the report today, since we think that the financial perspective for 2007-2013 needs first to be clear."
". It is very important to offer, to our young people, opportunities such as envisaged in this proposal."
"Developing active citizenship, solidarity, and mutual understanding between peoples must be encouraged and I support proposals to increase the budget for ""Youth in Action""."
"The involvement and active participation of young people in the proposed Youth Week is desirable, and I supported amendments by my Group which sought to underline this."
". – This report concerns the ‘development of European citizenship’."
"Here we have the essence of what makes this European cultural programme ambiguous, for what is it about: subscribing to Europe?"
"It goes without saying that we subscribe to Europe, because we all are Europeans."
"Subscribing to European integration as it is being carried out at present?"
"Well, that is propaganda."
"Let us therefore affirm that we are obviously in favour of protecting Europe’s cultural heritage but that the culture budget should not become an annex to the EU communication budget."
"Europe’s young people are faced with problems, including suicide, drugs and unemployment. Let us therefore work more practically on the causes of these problems rather than call upon vague and muddled measures relating to mobility, commitment, citizenship, etc."
"It is not the EU’s responsibility to engage young people ‘in action’ – young people can think for themselves – but its policy can consist in averting the dangers – drugs, in particular – something which, at the moment, it is doing with only limited success."
". I wish to give my wholehearted support to the ‘Youth in Action’ Community programme."
"The rapporteur broadly supports the Commission’s proposal, although she does put forward some amendments dealing with the following areas: the inadequate nature of the financial framework for implementing the ‘Youth in Action’ programme in the period in question; support for the interactive and innovative youth seminars; establishing European Youth week as a regular fixture; and lastly the need to ensure that young people with disadvantages can participate in the programme on an equal footing, thus excluding any discrimination."
"The ‘Youth in Action’ programme will be a substantially simplified successor to the current ‘Youth’ programme."
"There was a broad-ranging consultation process before the proposal was drawn up, as provided for in the White Paper on youth policy. To some degree, the proposal thus reflects the initiative of the Heads of State or Government to form a ‘European Youth Pact’."
"The ‘Youth in Action’ programme covers five measures and will cost EUR 915 million. It will enter into force in January 2007 and will be managed on a decentralised basis, with some centralised measures managed by an executive agency."
"I welcomed this report."
"The current YOUTH programme will come to an end in 2006 and this proposal is for a successor programme – YOUTH in Action – which will cover the period 2007-2013."
"If the recommendations are carried out, the new programme will be simpler, less bureaucratic and easier to access."
"The programme will now be funded from one heading rather than four and projects will be managed on a decentralised basis."
"The programme also takes into consideration the requirements of the Lisbon Process."
"I support programmes for voluntary service and youth in/for the world, especially involving cooperation with non-EU countries."
"These create genuine solidarity with, and understanding of, the world around us."
"I cannot, however, vote in favour of the increase of EUR 200 million, proposed mainly because the share for Youth for Europe is being increased."
"Youth for Europe is aimed at creating a new form of Euronationalism, something that history should have taught us to avoid."
"I am therefore abstaining from voting, since the proposal has negative as well as positive aspects."
". The purpose of this report is to improve on some aspects of the new programme for culture proposed by the Commission for 2007/2013."
"When taken as a whole, this document, like others in the field of culture, is highly ambivalent and could produce inconsistent results."
"On the one hand, it could represent an opportunity to foster not only cultural (artistic and scientific) creativity, research and dissemination, but also the democratisation (and not only the expansion) of access to cultural fulfilment and production."
"On the other hand, even if some positive results ensure – because of or in spite of the programme – this could prove to be a form of mass cultural subjugation, an attempt to engender an obedient culture, or a new step on the road to the establishment of a cultural and ideological hegemony."
"I feel, however, that much will be decided on the ground."
"Whilst the objective of promoting the transnational mobility of cultural players could reflect a desire to promote a more international perspective, and could be indicative of the element of cultural output that aspires to dialogue and more universal aims, it could also serve other less cultural and more financial interests."
"We welcome the amendments referring to the importance of preserving, researching and accessing cultural heritage, the diversity of language and culture, together with the amendments, however inadequate ..."
"Cultural issues are, of course, very important."
"The June List is of the view that cultural policy should in principle be taken care of by the Member States."
"When it comes to the European cultural heritage, there may, however, be justification for dealing with certain issues at Community level."
"Individual items of expenditure should not, however, be debated until the EU’s long-term budget has been adopted."
"The June List has therefore chosen to vote against this report."
". – The aim of Culture 2007 is to modify the procedures used for awarding grants so that they are simpler than those used in the context of Culture 2000."
"In actual fact, one of the criticisms made of this programme concerns the poor way in which the system is managed."
"The ‘pull factor’ the system has on cultural operators creates a flood of projects, which are then selected in a seemingly arbitrary way: 80% of the projects presented are said to be rejected on procedural grounds!"
"Yet, are we really sure that Culture 2007 is going to improve matters in that area?"
"Rather, is it not the case that European bureaucracy itself is the issue?"
"In response to the famous words of Jean Monnet, who said: ‘if it were to be done again, I would begin with culture’, two remarks can be made:"
"- that is a stupid thing to say, since European culture already existed, and had always existed; it is precisely for that reason that we talk about Europe!"
"- thank goodness the technocrats in Brussels are not in charge of culture; otherwise it would be in a sad state today; one only need look at what happened to agriculture and the steel industry."
"I have chosen to abstain in the final vote on the Culture programme 2007-2013."
"Certainly, it is important to promote intercultural dialogue, cross-border cultural projects and cultural exchanges that increase understanding of different cultures in Europe and that help give European citizenship some practical content."
"The most practical feature of the European Parliament’s report is, however, a very large increase in the budget appropriations compared with what is proposed by the Commission."
"Since I cannot support this budget increase, I have chosen to abstain from voting on the report."
"I believe that the Commission’s proposal as to how much money should be budgeted for the culture programme is perfectly adequate."
"I welcomed this report which establishes a new programme for cultural cooperation across Europe from 2007-2013."
"It aims to foster a common cultural area through the development of cultural cooperation in Europe."
"The funding this programme makes available to support arts and cultural organisations which undertake cooperative projects with organisations in other Member States will be warmly welcome by many organisations which often struggle to obtain funding for cross border events."
"I also welcome the boost this programme will give to the transnational mobility of people working in the cultural sector."
". The Culture programme is primarily aimed at promoting the transnational mobility of cultural players, the transnational circulation of artistic and cultural works and products, and intercultural dialogue."
"In the new programme for the period 2007-2013, measures are put forward with a view to promoting dialogue and mutual knowledge of European culture."
"I feel that the amendments that were tabled have been a key factor in achieving greater flexibility with regard to the duration of projects and in ensuring simplified procedures for participation."
"I should also like to stress the need to strike a consistent balance between the principles of complementarity and subsidiarity in the drafting of new Community action programmes."
"Law-making should be results-orientated. This is particularly true when we are addressing issues such as improving the knowledge and dissemination of the culture and history of the people of Europe and conserving and safeguarding cultural heritage of European significance."
"I should therefore like to stress the importance of exchanging good practice in the area of Europe’s cultural heritage, the mobility of artists and new forms of cultural expression."
"I voted in favour of the Graça Moura report."
"I have always spoken up for culture, but this programme removes resources from national culture budgets."
"Even the proposal of EUR 408 million is an increase of 72%. When the European Parliament then increases the figure to EUR 600 million, it is too much."
"Amendment 29, about strengthening a sense of European citizenship, is an example of the negative Euronationalism that is constantly prevalent in the Committee on Culture and Education."
"Moreover, the programme is far too burdensome to administer, a factor that cultural workers in all countries are agreed is an obstacle to creative development."
"I am therefore voting against this proposal."
"I support this report and the need for a MEDIA 2007 programme to follow up on the MEDIA (1996-2000) and MEDIA Plus (2001-2006)."
"The E.U. currently has a trade deficit with the U.S. of over USD 8 billion per year in the audiovisual sector."
"We have to intensify our efforts to make the European industry more competitive and better able to rival that of the U.S. industry."
"The audiovisual sector in Europe is going through a difficult period."
"The previous MEDIA programmes produced good results."
"Now, that programme is setting itself more ambitious goals, such as full cultural integration of the enlarged Europe."
"Here, I believe it is appropriate to give support to the archives of the European film and audiovisual heritage, which may even contain works which would not deserve to go down in history."
"There is no doubt, however, that every creative work bears enduring witness to a period in time and therefore helps posterity to understand the values and tastes of a generation."
"Understanding one’s past should also help to define one’s future better."
"Finally, I should like to emphasise one aspect which does not appear in Mr Hieronymi’s report and which I believe is fundamental for the audiovisual sector, which should be based on accurate information concerning its contents."
"I refer to the need to protect minors, who are among the largest users of audiovisual works and, as such, worthy of respect and consideration."
"I have therefore proposed amendments to fill those gaps."
"In the debate, these amendments gained the support of many Members and were mentioned by the Commissioner, whom I would ask to take account …"
". The MEDIA 2007 programme is primarily aimed at promoting a European audiovisual market against a backdrop of strong competition from the US market."
"This EU programme could make a major contribution to economic growth and jobs in the EU, given that audiovisual works are cultural and economic goods and services."
"We must help to integrate creative and cultural aspects into industrial production, particularly in a Europe replete with SMEs."
"I therefore feel it is essential that we speed up the funding procedure and encourage close cooperation in order to meet the challenge laid down by digitalisation."
"This will help to reduce the imbalance between countries with high and low production capacities and will contribute towards the increased circulation of European audiovisual works both within and outside the EU."
"In so doing, we will also be strengthening the competitiveness of the European film industry."
"I voted in favour of the Hieronymi report."
"– Madam President, I have a request to make of you and of this House; it is that we send a letter to the people of Mexico expressing our sympathy."
"In view of the fact that we have a free trade agreement with that country, and also a special agreement, we should write a letter to the Mexican Government to the effect that we have the utmost sympathy with the Mexican people as they face up to the damage that the hurricane has caused."
"We should also join with the Commission and the Council in considering the options available under that agreement for providing aid in special circumstances, by which I do not, in this instance, mean financial aid, but aid in its widest sense."
"I would be most appreciative, Madam President, if you could give me an assurance that such a letter will be written."
"I will pass that on to the President of Parliament."
"I am sure that Mr Borrell will be grateful for that suggestion and will write the letter to which you refer."
"I am equally persuaded that you will assist him with your expertise and can suggest some forms of words that he might use."
"What I actually wanted to do now was to announce as the next item the Commission statement on progress towards accession by Bulgaria and Romania."
"I will indeed do that, but I will wait for a moment in the hope that the Commissioner can manage to get out of the Commission meeting and come to us, as it would make sense to wait until we have heard what Commissioner Rehn has to say about the Commission statement on Bulgaria’s and Romania’s progress towards accession before discussing it."
"Otherwise we would go straight into the debate."
"I assume that honourable Members will want to hear the Commissioner before they make their own contributions."
"Much obliged though I am to the various groups for their suggestions, I will nonetheless wait a moment more."
"I am looking at the Commission benches, which are not entirely vacant, and will try to find out whether someone there can give me an idea when we can expect Commissioner Rehn to turn up."
"The next item is the debate on the Commission statement on progress towards accession by Bulgaria and Romania."
". Madam President, Strasbourg is not an ideal place to deal with such important reports in Commission meetings."
"There is a Commission meeting still going on, while we also have other important issues to deal with, such as avian flu."
"I therefore apologise for being somewhat late."
"First of all, I welcome the opportunity of presenting the results of our intensive monitoring of Bulgaria’s and Romania’s preparations for accession and also holding an exchange of views with you on this important issue."
"Let me also thank Parliament, especially its Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the rapporteurs, Messrs Van Orden and Moscovici, for their contribution to this exercise."
"When we opened accession negotiations in early 2000 with an additional six candidate countries, we could not know how long the accession negotiations with each of them would finally take."
"Quite clearly, all six countries were part of the fifth enlargement round."
"The accession of Bulgaria and Romania will therefore complete this fifth round of enlargement, encompassing 12 countries in total."
"Overall, the reports on the two countries show that both have continued to make progress in fulfilling their accession requirements."
"Bulgaria, having rather lost momentum after the conclusion of the negotiations in summer 2004, has now worked energetically to make up for lost time after the parliamentary elections of June 2005."
"Romania has caught up impressively in the fields of justice reform, competition policy and the state aids regime, as well as the overall level of alignment with EU legislation."
"Both countries continue to fulfil the political criteria, which are, as you know, related to the rule of law, human rights and democracy."
"While much has been done, there is a need for further progress."
"In particular, efforts are needed to pursue the reform of public administration, to implement effectively the reform of the justice system and to step up the fight against corruption, particularly high-level corruption."
"In the area of human rights and the protection of minorities and vulnerable groups, further efforts are needed by Bulgaria and Romania."
"As for the economic criteria, both countries should be able to comply with them by accession, provided that they continue and intensify their efforts."
"Both registered robust economic growth last year: 5.6% in Bulgaria and 8.3% in Romania."
"Both have also pursued structural reforms to their economies."
"In the case of Bulgaria, particular attention has to be paid to the widening current account deficit."
"Labour market reforms also need to be enhanced."
"In Romania, the external balance, wage policy and strengthening of the government’s revenue base call for continued attention."
"As regards alignment with the EU legal order – the – we have screened in detail legislative and administrative preparations across 140 separate areas within all 29 chapters."
"Over 50% of all areas monitored are non-problematic."
"That does not mean that everything is perfect in those areas, but it means that no real problems are expected, provided that the current pace of preparations is maintained."
"In the second category, there are areas where the state of preparations calls for increased efforts."
"Here, both countries’ authorities are encouraged to target their reform efforts better, so as to come into line with EU requirements in the period leading up to accession."
"This covers around a third of the areas."
"We have also identified a limited number of issues of serious concern, covering approximately 10% of the areas covered by the ."
"These are areas where, unless the countries take immediate and decisive corrective action, they will not be ready by the envisaged date of accession."
"Some of these areas require a technical solution."
"For instance, Bulgaria must reduce the high proportion of uninsured vehicles on the roads; for its part, Romania must fulfil EU requirements in the field of taxation."
"With regard to these areas of serious concern, I would like to make three particular points."
"The first relates to Bulgaria’s and Romania’s ability to reap fully the benefits from EU funds upon accession."
"To manage EU funds, an overall reinforcement of the administrative structures in both countries is required."
"This includes the setting-up of paying agencies for agricultural funds and the required structures in the field of regional policy."
"Secondly, we are also seriously concerned about areas linked to the functioning of the internal market and to the internal security of the European Union."
"These include, for example, shortcomings identified in the veterinary sector, which could put at risk the sustainability of food safety in the enlarged EU, and the control of external borders in both countries."
"The third area of particular concern is the fight against corruption, where too limited progress has been made so far."
"The failure to obtain even a single significant conviction for high-level corruption in recent years, despite commonly available information on its scale, is a cause for serious concern."
"Urgent efforts are needed here by the judiciaries of both countries."
"With regard to these shortcomings, the authorities in both countries are strongly encouraged to take decisive and immediate action."
"This would show that both countries can be relied on to play their parts as future members of the European Union."
"The Commission will continue to support Bulgaria’s and Romania’s efforts to prepare for accession to the European Union."
"Our financial contribution will focus on measures to tackle the shortcomings identified."
"The total volume of pre-accession assistance available is substantial."
"The EU budget in 2006 for Bulgaria is around EUR 545 million and for Romania EUR 1 155 million, in other words more than EUR 1.1 billion for Romania."
"The Commission will also pursue its intensive monitoring of Bulgaria’s and Romania’s preparations."
"Next spring, we shall review the situation and may, if necessary, recommend postponing accession by one year."
"We hope that steps undertaken by both countries will lead us to conclude that such a recommendation is not necessary."
"As formally confirmed by President Barroso to President Borrell before the summer break, I will also seriously consider your views on the matter before issuing a recommendation on whether or not to postpone the accession of either one or both of the countries."
"As I have clearly stated before, should there be serious shortcomings, we would not hesitate to make use of all our remedial tools."
"This includes not only the possibility of postponing accession by one year, but also all other available safeguard clauses."
"I trust that honourable Members of Parliament can agree to this approach."
"Now is not the time to speculate on the Commission’s recommendation, but for the acceding countries to concentrate all their energy on the outstanding shortcomings identified in our reports."
"The possibility of being ready in 2007 has not been lost, but it will require plenty of work from both countries."
"The present report is not the final assessment; that will be provided next spring, in April or May."
"Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the constant interest and support of the European Parliament for Bulgaria’s and Romania’s accession process."
"I look forward to a continued dialogue with you on the implementation of Bulgaria’s and Romania’s commitments."
"I trust that the newly-arrived observers from the two countries will contribute positively, so as to influence the perceptions of Bulgaria and Romania within the EU."
"The European Parliament has played a decisive role in ensuring that the fifth round of enlargement is well prepared."
"I am grateful for the cooperation received since I have been in office and look forward to discussing the challenges ahead."
"– Madam President, on a point of order, I think my point has already been made."
"We are supposed to start at 3 p.m. but you do not seem able to get here for 3 p.m. and nor does the Commissioner."
"I am sorry, that is not a point of order."
"I have cut off your microphone."
"You can make a point order if you wish, but please tell me the Rule."
"Just simply asking the Commission to be on time is all very well but not very polite, especially when the Commissioner told you that he left the Commission meeting."
"We are not going to have a discussion about that."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a subject on which the Commissioner and I do not always agree, but I have to say, in my capacity as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, that he is taking a very cooperative line with the House and is also available to the Committee whenever necessary."
"I would like to thank him for that, and also for what he has said about the procedure agreed with this House at the time of the ratification last spring, according to which Parliament is again consulted on the accession date before the Commission puts its decision to the Council."
"We have to consider the progress these countries have made; they belong to the Group of Twelve, of which 10 have already become Member States, and so their eventual accession to the European Union is not a matter of doubt."
"The question is whether this is to happen, as the Treaties require, on 1 January 2007, or a year later, although there is the possibility of whole chapters being annulled up to three years after their accession if they are not implemented as they need to be."
"I am sure that our rapporteurs, and also the Committee on Foreign Affairs, will, acting on this plenary’s behalf and in partnership with the Commission, apply the most exact judgment in determining whether the conditions are right for accession to take place on 1 January 2007."
"Today’s statement by the Commission is what I would describe as a ‘yellow card’."
"These countries are being given the chance to make up the time they lost as a result of their internal political circumstances, but reference has been made to desperately serious matters that give rise to grave cause for concern, such as, among others, these countries’ absorption capacity and the capacity of the internal market to operate."
"There are also questions touching upon the justice system, such as the fight against corruption, and also on the development of administration to enable the internal market to function, which is in these countries’ interests and also in the interests of the European Union."
"Although accession is not conditional upon the Constitution being in place, the failure to ratify it has meant that there are problems with the constitutional process."
"These are additional problems that we cannot burden ourselves with if the conditions are not fulfilled, and, at any rate, issues that we will have to examine with a critical eye."
"There are also issues that have to do with corruption and organised crime, issues of internal security, the problems to which the Commission has referred in relation to the external borders, and these are issues that are very important indeed, not least in the eyes of the public."
"If the European Union’s citizens are to see it as being capable of further development, it must be clear that there is nothing automatic about these things, but that, on the contrary, we are taking the examination of the conditions seriously and will act only after having done so, rather than out of political compliance."
"It is for this reason that we will, over the coming months, be addressing this issue with a very great deal of seriousness indeed."
"While we do want these countries to become Member States of the European Union, we also have to create the conditions under which that can be a workable proposition, and it is for that reason that I, on behalf of my group, and perhaps also on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, would like to accept the Commission’s invitation to work very closely with it in order that the decision we take early next year may be the right one."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Wiersma, who has given up his turn to speak, as I cannot be present for the entire debate."
"I should also like to pay tribute to the work carried out by the Commission, which is, I believe, entirely in accordance both with the conclusions of the European Council and with the resolutions voted in favour of by our Parliament."
"In December 2004, we decided to close negotiations."
"The main areas of reform in which progress needed to be made with regard to the – I am referring to justice, internal affairs, competition and the environment – were identified, and it was also decided, at that time, that these reforms would be monitored by the Commission, with the possibility – the assumption – that a safeguard clause would be introduced, which could postpone membership by one year."
"The work presented to us today is rigorous and objective."
"I believe that it successfully marks the progress made, that it highlights what limits exist and that it points out what efforts remain to be made, and, as Mr Brok has just said, this approach has, I believe, our full support."
"I should like, however, to draw four conclusions of a more political nature from my reading of the reports."
"The first is that we have a common objective, and that objective is the simultaneous accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the European Union."
"This is the culmination of the great liberation movement that took place in Eastern Europe."
"Holding debates on one particular country or another’s relation to the EU’s borders is all very well, but such debates obviously do not apply to Romania and Bulgaria, as the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs has just said."
"It is not a question of if, but of when Romania and Bulgaria join the EU."
"My second conclusion: the Commission’s report highlights both the progress and the efforts that need to be made."
"A great deal of progress is required."
"I, for my part, am not sure that the report should be shown the yellow card, for when I see what is said about freedom of expression, justice, the integration of minorities, the protection of minors and competition, I say to myself that there are no grounds to draw negative conclusions about the report, because what has been addressed is not without significance. At the same time, the report highlights substantial efforts that need to be made, and even points of concern that still remain."
"Firstly, one such point of concern is high-level corruption, to tackle which clearly defined institutions and all-out determination are required. A further point of concern is external borders, which need to be secure and controlled, while other points include trafficking in human beings, the environment and the integration of the Roma community."
"Dealing with these issues is no small task, either."
"My third conclusion: I agree with the procedure now proposed by the Commission."
"Today is not the time to give a definitive opinion on the safeguard clause; it would be premature to do so."
"The monitoring exercise has to be pursued extremely strictly, and, in this respect, it is relevant to arrange for a meeting to be held in April or May."
"I would remind the Commissioner that the European Parliament wants to be fully involved in making the final decision."
"Today, we have stopped in midstream: the safeguard clause is not desirable for Romania, for Bulgaria or for the EU, but the idea of it cannot be brushed aside."
"I will conclude by reaffirming a desire, which I know is shared on all, or almost all, sides of this Chamber: we want Romania and Bulgaria to join the EU, and we want them to do so on 1 January 2007."
"This desire has not been brought into question."
"It remains intact after the reports have been read but, as the Commission’s report highlights, Romania and Bulgaria hold the key to their membership."
"The spirit in which we will support the Commission will remain unchanged, and that spirit is one of not only offering friendship and trust but also of making demands."
". – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I really am very glad indeed that we are able to have this first debate on this subject with our observers present."
"I think that is quite tremendous."
"I would like to join in thanking the Commission for the outstanding work it has done."
"My group joins with the others in welcoming the choice of procedure, which involves – as Mr Moscovici has just said – the consultation of Parliament on the recommendation next spring."
"There are a few things I would like to say about Bulgaria."
"As the country has come through an election and the formation of a government, it is not surprising that the latest progress report by the Commission takes a more critical line than its predecessors."
"For that reason, I want to start by saying that, while my group supports Bulgaria as it moves towards becoming a Member State of the European Union, we do expect the necessary reforms to be carried out with more discipline and purposefulness than they were last year."
"Results matter, for it is on the basis of the results achieved that the national parliaments will evaluate the accession treaties."
"Bulgaria has made progress to an enormous degree."
"In terms of economic performance, the country is definitely in the overtaking lane."
"Its dynamism and 6.2% growth rate – the sort of growth I wish my own country could produce – gives confidence to the foreign investors who are discovering Bulgaria as a place in which to put their money."
"Bulgaria owes its considerable economic success mainly to the previous government’s far-sighted policies."
"The fact is, though, that the finest of roses are invisible if they are obscured by weeds."
"The successes that have been achieved cannot make their impact felt when corruption is unchecked, the law is unstable, and long overdue reforms are not carried out."
"So let us consider the justice system."
"On 15 October, the Bulgarian parliament passed a new Code of Criminal Procedure; while this is an important step in the right direction, it is one that has taken too long."
"The reforms must now be put into practice without delay."
"Moving on to corruption and the fight against it, one has to acknowledge that progress has been made in combating small-scale corruption."
"What is now vital is that attention should be focussed on corruption in the upper echelons of politics, business and the administration, and that there should be a sustained campaign against it."
"Paradoxically enough, the fact that Bulgaria is at number 55 on Transparency International’s Index seems, at first sight, to be a poor performance, but then one notes that Turkey is placed at number 65, Croatia at 70 and Romania at 85, so Bulgaria has already achieved a certain amount on this front."
"Let me make it perfectly clear that neither the Commission – I am sure of that, Commissioner – nor this House expect Bulgaria to produce miracles."
"Everyone present in this Chamber is well aware that progress demands painful reforms and cannot be achieved overnight."
"What we want is for the Bulgarian Government to make progress where it is in its power to do so."
"That brings me to consider policy in relation to minorities, something that my group regards as particularly important."
"To this day, the Bulgarian authorities have not succeeded in finding the 15 experts of which the National Council for Co-Operation on Ethnic and Demographic Issues is meant to consist, and that does not augur well for the prospect of integrating the Roma into Bulgarian society."
"Precisely how the framework programme for this purpose is to be implemented remains vague and unclear."
"Paper is patient, but we are not; a lack of ambition is not something that Bulgaria can afford at this decisive point in its history."
"Let me conclude by saying that the Commission’s, and my group’s, critical observations are not intended to discourage the Bulgarian Government – on the contrary, they should be understood as an encouragement to go down the last stretch on the way towards accession with the sense of purpose and earnestness that this demands."
"I might add that I believe we should be holding this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg."
". – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, earlier this year, my group had its own doubts about the new government, but we were very much in favour of giving it the opportunity to address a large number of serious problems."
"The moment of truth has now arrived."
"Has the new government succeeded or failed?"
"If we listen to the Commissioner and read the report, we can, in fact, discern a picture emerging that is in keeping with recent Amnesty International reports – a combination of progress in some areas, but ongoing problems in a number of others."
"It is up to this House – and I am also addressing the Romanian and Bulgarian representatives when I say this – to focus on the existing problems that still need addressing, which you may or may not like, because I share Mr Brok’s view that there is no automatism that could solve all the problems."
"Allow me to single out two of them."
"One of them is the fight against corruption, and this is where we have to be honest. The image we in the Netherlands, but also in many other Member States, have of Romania is determined in the public mind by the notion that that country suffers greatly from corruption, whether that be at low level or the highest level."
"It is particularly at this highest level of bureaucracy and politics that something must be done, and that is why it is a good thing – I would like to say this here – that, for example, an old case that was closed in 2003 against Mrs Puwak, the former EU minister in Romania, has been reopened, because there was something fishy about that case, to put it bluntly."
"Something must be done about this, and I would urge the Romanian authorities to really give this priority."
"You cannot afford to leave this matter to be dealt with by a handful of public prosecutors and judges alone."
"I would urge you to do what you can in order to remove that image many European citizens have."
"Secondly, with regard to the environment and food safety, the Commission has turned its attention to another issue that is a sensitive one for many members of the European public, that being food safety."
"I think that accession should be out of the question if a country does not regulate that properly."
"The Commission is right to focus on this."
"What is missing, though, is attention to genetically modified organisms."
"According to the Commission’s very brief statement on this subject, there are no real concerns there."
"This is inconsistent with reports issued by Greenpeace, among others, which are far more alarming."
"Romania is Europe’s largest area for genetically modified organisms."
"It grows crops that would be unlawful in the EU, and because of a lack of knowledge on the part of the Romanian authorities, there is very little in the way of information to the Romanian public and it is impossible to check whether European guidelines are adhered to."
"That is unacceptable."
"A country such as this cannot join the European Union just like that."
"Those problems, namely corruption and GMOs, must be resolved by the beginning of next year."
"In the unlikely event of this not being done, then it should be possible to defer accession by one year."
"To the Commissioner, who is a football fan, I would say the following."
"We have often mentioned yellow cards."
"If at the end of regular match time, neither of the teams has scored, then extra time can be granted."
"That too, is part and parcel of the rules."
". – Madam President, for more than 30 years, first the European Communities and then the European Union have been involved in enlarging the number of Member States and have swallowed up other cooperatives."
"Since the great enlargement of 2004, when all of a sudden more new Member States joined than in the 70s, 80s and 90s combined, something has changed."
"Previous to that, each enlargement was a success, but many people nowadays regard enlargement as a threat."
"It is unlikely that the example of Spain and Ireland, which quickly made up the shortfall with the help of generous financial contributions from the EU, will be followed."
"Many newcomers become dependent on the exports of cheap agricultural products, cheap mining products and, above all, cheap labour, while they have to import expensive new technology."
"The old Member States expect they will need to make increasing payments to the newcomers and, above all, they expect increasing levels of unemployment, possibly by low-wage competition."
"Despite this, the new Member States are still lagging behind."
"With regard to Romania and Bulgaria, a decision was taken in April to the effect that they are allowed to join as the rearguard of the 10 newcomers of 2004."
"I now hear comments, even in this House, about tracing a final external border for Europe, about restricting the solidarity contribution from the rich to the poor Member States, about the use of national referendums as a means whereby current Member States can reject newcomers and even about suspending any enlargement until such time as the people in France and the Netherlands get round to rubberstamping the Constitution that they emphatically rejected."
"Although my group does not condone the economic and military choices in that Constitution, or the democratic deficit that the text reinforces, our criticism is not levelled at the new Member States, with a lower standard of living, that seek to join the EU."
"Indeed, the contrary is the case; their admission could help the European Union focus more on common, large-scale and cross-border issues and less on unnecessary interference in matters that could be better evaluated and ordered on a smaller scale."
"Croatia and Macedonia are, in principle, welcome, as is Turkey, provided that it becomes more democratic and respects human rights."
"My group is opposed to making unworkable demands on newcomers."
"Financial and economic demands that impoverish large sections of their people and deprive them of social security do not contribute to progress, but to the corruption of society."
"If, however, the European Union wants to contribute to the quality of society, we must be tough on the environment, human rights and good governance."
"Are we now absolutely certain that near Rosia Montana, or elsewhere in Romania, no gold is being mined with dangerous chemical substances that result in streams of toxic water in that country and in neighbouring countries?"
"Are we certain that the Kresna gorge in Bulgaria, being a vulnerable nature reserve, is protected against the increasing freight traffic by road?"
"Are the new laws that are copied and translated from the actually implemented?"
"Are the equal rights of the substantial Roma population guaranteed?"
"What about the orphans and food safety?"
"Sadly, we have not had adequate responses to those questions from either candidate country, which means that we cannot give our verdict about what should happen next until next year."
". – Madam President, in this speech, I am going to confine myself to the candidacy of Romania, a country that has had a very difficult year, having endured three destructive flood disasters that claimed 66 lives, with material damage amounting to EUR 1.5 billion."
"In a situation such as this, one would expect the highest authorities to display national harmony, but nothing could be further from the truth."
"The President and Prime Minister were at loggerheads in public over new elections."
"Commissioner Rehn’s efforts made it possible for this danger to the country’s political stability to be averted in good time, but for how long?"
"All of this is taking place at a critical stage of Romania’s accession to the European Union."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner what he thinks of President Basescu’s political sense of responsibility in this matter."
"The so-called super safeguard clause applied by the Council to Romania’s accession date and to no other country’s identifies 11 specific problem areas, and I should like to touch on some of them."
"What, Commissioner, is the latest news on the tax benefits that the Romanian state promised the buyer of the steel magnet Ispat Sidex?"
"Does the Commission regard Prime Minister Tariceanu’s concession to give Romanian farmers financial help with the purchase of tractors from the factory in Brasov as an infringement of the EU’s competition directives?"
"A second difficulty concerns solid border control by the Romanian authorities."
"That goes without saying, because once Romania has joined, no less than 1 457 km of the total national borders of 2 508 km will form part of the EU’s external border, quite apart from the issue of the control of the Romanian Black Sea coast."
"We are, after all, dealing with a corridor for smuggling people, drugs and arms to Europe."
"In short, the fact that training and funding problems are hampering the necessary recruitment drive of 4 000 Romanian border guards should be of major concern to the Commission."
"Will it take action?"
"Almost inevitably, the third difficulty will touch upon the sense of urgency with which the government gets the menace of corruption under control."
"What action does the Commission intend to take, though, when that fight against corruption at the highest level becomes more and more a political instrument within the governing coalition and within the executive?"
"The new government should, in any event, be measured against its moral claims."
"That is something that the Romanian coalition should take seriously."
"It is then unacceptable to refuse to be open about what one possesses."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, firstly, to extend a warm and affectionate welcome to our Bulgarian and Romanian parliamentary colleagues, as observers."
"Commissioner, our group is particularly appreciative not only of your speech but also of the systematic dialogue and discussion between Parliament and the Commission."
"With regard to the accession of Bulgaria and Romania into the European Union, I should like to remind our observers that there is a very substantial majority in this Parliament in favour of their two countries."
"For us, it is not so much an enlargement as a reunification with countries of an unquestionably European tradition."
"Here in Parliament there is even a majority in favour of the accession of Turkey, so it is hardly surprising that there is also a majority favourable and attentive to your membership."
"However, the Commissioner's report highlighted real grounds for concern: to put it light-heartedly, I hope that the lateness of the Commissioner’s arrival here today (albeit amply justified) is not a foretaste of delays in the accession of our two brother counties to the European Union."
"However, problems do exist."
"There is no doubt – as already emphasised and now reiterated by us in this Chamber – that progress, even substantial progress, has been made."
"We are fully aware of the state and condition your countries were in after years of an oppressive leftist regime."
"We know the problems you have had to face in the past and therefore are highly appreciative of the progress you have made, although there are still serious problems which have to be solved – and solved quickly – if we are to avoid forcing the European Union into something I hope does not occur, namely a deferral of entry by one year or possibly more."
"Our wish is for both Bulgaria and Romania to join the European Union in 2007."
"However, some problems have to be solved – and solved by you."
"The observers at today’s session should take away with them Parliament's goodwill but also its concerns."
"There is much you can do in your own countries to move the reform process further forward."
"The delays that still exist must be eliminated, particularly in the areas of corruption and internal security."
"The events of recent days give us all cause for great concern in the areas of the environment and health, and there are worries on the conditions of the external borders."
"We therefore invite you to take up this great challenge, because we want to have you here with us in 2007."
"– Madam President, on 25 April the Treaty concerning the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the European Union was signed in Luxembourg."
"I remember well the debate and vote that took place at the time, as well as the general mood in the House."
"In spite of the many criticisms voiced, no one disputed the fact that Romania and Bulgaria are part of the European family."
"This continues to be the case today, and in fact the opposite is true."
"Everyone, or nearly everyone, is delighted at the decision that has been taken."
"Previous speakers have already underlined the fact that shortcomings still exist in the fields of public administration, the judiciary and respect for human rights, in particular the rights of the mentally ill, as reported by Amnesty International."
"In spite of this, we welcome the efforts made by Romania and Bulgaria and their achievements to date."
"Corruption is one of the most difficult problems to overcome, since it is deeply ingrained in the psyche of people raised for generations in poverty, oppression and injustice under Communist rule."
"As a Pole, I understand this well, and I would encourage Romanians and Bulgarians to fight this scourge from within and without."
"The two countries should take today’s criticism as an incentive to undertake further efforts to ensure that accession can take place on 1 January 2007."
"I am quite sure that Romania and Bulgaria too want a strong and just Europe that is capable of making demands of itself and of others."
"– Madam President, I speak as the rapporteur for Bulgaria."
"First of all I would like to thank Commissioner Rehn for his statement and for his continuing strong commitment to successful enlargement of the European Union."
"We should all be conscious that the eyes of Bulgaria are on us today and both the tone and content of our message will be significant."
"Overall I see the Commission’s report as positive, while focusing attention on the importance and urgency of outstanding commitments still to be fulfilled."
"I hope I do not detect from the Commissioner’s remarks any dampening of enthusiasm for the timely accession of Bulgaria."
"At this final stage it should not, in a way, be surprising if the Commission has been even more rigorous in its comments."
"But we now seem to be in a situation where the wedding has taken place, the marriage register has been signed and presents have been received, but the bridge and groom have been told they cannot walk out of the church together just yet, partly because we are not sure what the situation is like outside."
"Progress has continued in Bulgaria."
"It needs to be faster, but there has been a change in the external political environment."
"It would be quite wrong if Bulgaria were to suffer at all from any of this negative background noise."
"Certainly urgent action by Bulgaria is required in some key areas."
"It is insufficient merely to pass laws."
"I do not underestimate the political energy and commitment required to do even this, but legislation has to be robustly implemented and the results clear for all to see."
"The people of Bulgaria gave a mixed message in their general election on 25 June."
"They were not sure of the best way ahead."
"What is clear is that they must be able to have confidence in their authorities at all levels."
"The rule of law and therefore judicial reform, combating corruption and organised crime are the prerequisites for everything else, including economic performance."
"This is just one area of particular concern; there are, of course, others."
"I see that the Commission is calling for improvements in the business environment including labour market flexibility."
"Forgive me if I remark that perhaps the Commission needs to put its own house in order and stop introducing new regulations which add to the costs and burdens of business and reduce competitiveness and growth."
"In its report today the Commission has sounded a warning bell, without making a recommendation either way concerning the date of accession."
"It will, however, do so in April and this will influence the decision of the Council and of this Parliament, which must of course be consulted."
"That means that we have a precious six months for Bulgaria to demonstrate solid progress and real results, so that the goal of accession on 1 January 2007 can be achieved."
"On the basis of today’s report, I see no reason why that date should be missed."
"– Madam President, in recent years, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has shown itself to be a consistent advocate of the EU’s enlargement through the accession of countries from Central and Eastern Europe."
"When those countries join, we can finally put an end to the division of Europe that has lasted dozens of years, and to the major inequality this has caused between East and West."
"That is why on 13 April of this year, the Socialist Group, by an overwhelming majority, voted to endorse the accession treaties with Bulgaria and Romania."
"Since there was a 20-month interval between the time of approval by the European Parliament and the planned date of accession, namely 1 January 2007, this approval was given in the full knowledge that in both Romania and Bulgaria, further progress should be made in a number of important areas before they can fully comply with the EU’s membership requirements."
"In my group, though, there was also the confidence that both countries should be deemed capable of taking the necessary steps prior to the ultimate accession and of actually implementing those."
"It should be noted that the inclusion of a safeguard clause which makes it possible to defer the date of accession by one year, along with the firm promise by both the Commission and the Council to involve the European Parliament fully in a decision about a possible application of this safeguard clause has played a major part in our giving consent."
"The Socialist Group is consistent in its policy on the enlargement of the European Union."
"As was the case when the 10 new Member States joined last year, we want the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to be a success for the people of both countries, of course, without them presenting an unacceptable burden to the present European Union."
"Consequently, we will not be using a fine-tooth comb to go through the reports presented by the Commission today about progress made in the preparation to accession in order to find arguments to wait for another year."
"As we see it, the areas of concern and criticism mentioned in the reports are mainly a guideline for the governments and parliaments of both Bulgaria and Romania to take the necessary measures in the time that remains."
"At the same time, these reports also identify the areas where both countries could use further support from the European Union in order to be able to achieve the intended objective of full membership of the European Union in 2007."
"It is totally irrelevant, for that matter, to our group’s support for the enlargement or our criticism of progress of the accession process, who and which parties are in power in either country."
"The only thing that matters is what those in power do in order to meet the predetermined conditions for full accession."
"We hope – obviously in the interest of the people of Bulgaria and Romania – that this opinion is shared by the other groups in this House."
"The reports presented by the Commission today do not fill us with the confidence that is needed to conclude at this stage that both Romania and Bulgaria will meet the conditions for accession on 1 January 2007 to a sufficient degree."
"There is no need yet."
"We can, however, see a reason for moderate optimism that both countries will be able to meet the set requirements at the next assessment, the one that really counts, in April of next year."
"Much will need to be done though, both in the decision-making process about, and the introduction of, missing legislation, as well as on the score of practical implementation; especially the fight against corruption and organised crime deserve most attention in this."
"On a personal level – because I have much experience in dealing with this problem – I should like to add that both reports are right to express the Commission’s concern about the situation of the Roma in both countries, and the fact the governments in both countries still have no adequate and effective way of addressing this problem."
"I think that this issue should carry a lot of weight in our final verdict."
"It is an important point to us, but also to the Roma in both countries."
"Following a period of stagnation and delays in connection with parliamentary elections and the problems involving the forming of government, the Bulgarian Government seems to have picked up where it left off with renewed energy and decisiveness."
"It is reassuring to establish that that country’s key political parties have joined forces in order to guide their country into the European Union together."
"I would like to urge the key political parties in Romania, the Romanian Government and the country’s President, to demonstrate that same level of unanimity where the accession is concerned and not waste valuable time on political wrangling."
"Finally, I should like to announce that my group, the Socialist Group, obviously in cooperation with the Commission, will, in the coming months, be carrying out its own analysis of progress made in the accession process."
"In that way, this spring, we will be able to take the decision whether both countries are really ready to take on all responsibilities of EU membership in a well-considered fashion and according to agreements made."
"– Madam President, I warmly congratulate Commissioner Rehn and his expert team in Brussels, as well as Mr Jonathan Scheele and his expert team in Bucharest."
"The Commission’s work becomes ever more vital in the final months which bring to a conclusion the long and arduous trek that both nations – Romania and Bulgaria – have undertaken in their search for the promised land of EU membership."
"This is the best report yet for Romania."
"It is a matter of pride to me that this comes out now, under the British Presidency."
"I want to congratulate not just Mr Quinton Quayle, the British Ambassador in Bucharest, but the entire diplomatic corps of all EU Member States who have put such time, effort and energy into assisting Romania in achieving her goal."
"We have the enlargement minister from Romania in the diplomatic gallery with us today, as well as the minister for child protection and the minister for child adoption, Mrs Teodora Bertzi."
"Perhaps, therefore, I could comment most warmly on the triumph of the reform of child protection that has taken place during the period under discussion, since 1999. That year, at the Council of Ministers in Helsinki, three challenges were placed in front of Romania: children, corruption and the civil service."
"The first challenge was tackled powerfully by successive governments, presidents and prime ministers."
"The result now is that Romania offers a model that has been widely acclaimed and applauded as providing, in some ways, even better services and better protection for her six-and-a-half million children than some EU Member States, and certainly other countries in the wider neighbourhood."
"I believe we shall learn more about that model as it becomes replicated elsewhere in the coming months and years."
"Overall, Romania has undergone a complete transformation from a country in 1990 that was dark, slow, tired, exhausted, with almost no life, no light, no fun, no laughter and little trade."
"Today it has been transformed into a nation that is once more alive and vibrant."
"Now we have to look at measures that will assist the public, particularly as regards public health – which is at a very low ebb, livelihoods and poverty reduction."
"Entering the European Union is indeed the long-term answer to achieving a rapid rise in levels of prosperity."
"However, there remains one Achilles’ heel clearly identified in the Commission’s report today: corruption."
"Corruption is enemy number one of the people; it is enemy number one when you seek to reduce poverty; enemy number one when you are trying to improve health, livelihoods and futures of a population."
"Much must be done to fight this enemy, but I believe and know that it can be tackled and that in Romania it can be conquered."
"This has already happened in some sectors."
"Now the same effort and energy must continue in the other sectors, particularly in justice, which is so critical for the Romanian people."
"I seek no time delay."
"I hope and believe that at some time in 2007 we will be able to say: welcome, Romania, you are now one of us."
"– Madam President, on a point of order, I apologise for disturbing the natural process of this debate, but many of us here present – colleagues, press and public – will have spotted that the UK Presidency is, unavoidably, not able to take its seat in the Chamber because, obviously, there are many other pressing matters."
"However, would you undertake, on behalf of the President of Parliament, to convey the message coming loud and clear from this debate that 1 January 2007 is not negotiable?"
"Mr Beazley, that was not a point of order."
"Nevertheless, I will pass on the message to the President of Parliament and he can tell the UK Presidency that we always appreciate its presence in the Chamber."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, absent Presidency, it was only to be expected that the progress report put before us today would confirm that Bulgaria and Romania do not yet meet the Copenhagen criteria."
"The criticism of them is justified."
"My own experience of the problems that the Visegrad states have with accession to the EU and my own knowledge of the Romanian and Bulgarian accession agenda lead me to be very sceptical about 1 January 2007 as a deadline."
"You may well ask why this is so."
"I was recently one of a delegation from the Human Rights Sub-Committee that went to Bucharest, and I regret to have to say that the talks we had there confirmed me in my views."
"We had the opportunity for discussions with representatives of the institutions of state, and also with various NGOs."
"These encounters reminded me of my experiences with regimes in the aftermath of totalitarianism."
"The government representatives were highly self-critical, but, in the final analysis, said little of any substance."
"It was in meetings with NGOs, particularly in private conversations, that the state of play in the various areas under negotiation was described much more clearly, and in terms at once more sober and more dramatic."
"The same was true, in varying degrees, of our conversations with these representatives’ Bulgarian counterparts."
"We are dealing here with a reality that is not entirely what it seems to be."
"There is little point in signing documents if they are not implemented."
"There is no evading the conclusions with which these problems present us: the legal system is lacking in transparency, there is organised crime, problems with minorities and the Roma, corruption, and problems with agriculture and the environment."
"Even taking into account the natural disasters with which both countries have been afflicted, it is, regrettably, to be expected that they will find it difficult to make the grade in the short time available; they will have to make a very considerable effort to make it even by 2008."
"– I find it hard to know whether Mr Horáček was talking about the situation in the old EU Member States, or that in Romania and Bulgaria."
"The European Union is supposedly founded upon certain basic principles."
"These include the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital, and, perhaps even more importantly, the European social model, non-interference in the domestic affairs of Member States and solidarity."
"Last but not least, they also include the environment as a priority issue."
"The basic question that needs to be asked about the accession of Romania and Bulgaria is whether we really want to accept these countries into an EU of 27 as equals."
"Quite apart from whether the citizens of these new Member States will enjoy genuinely equal treatment – and it emerges from the reports that have been tabled that this is a far-off prospect, rather than a given from the date of accession to the European Union – one of the EU’s most important values, albeit one that is now frequently called into question, is the European social model."
"In my opinion, any attempts to liberalise social values along the lines of the Bolkestein directive on services are entirely inappropriate."
"I am not alone in this view, as proven by today’s reactions to Commissioner McCreevy’s speech in Sweden."
"We must not allow the low social standards in some of the new Member States to be used as a battering ram to reverse the social achievements of more advanced Member States."
"We should be aware that the welfare state and respect for environmental standards are among the most important of the European Union’s values."
"These values, and the resulting strength of the Community’s social foundations, ensure its superiority over models in which such values are not recognised, and which allow unrestrained liberalism to prevail over social cohesion."
"It is our duty to help the new Member States to achieve the best possible conditions and to negotiate appropriate transitional periods when Romania and Bulgaria join the Community, instead of harping on about problems in these new Member States that we ourselves face in our own countries."
"The Czech people enjoy particularly close and friendly relations with Romania and Bulgaria, and these relations date back many years."
"We are in favour of the two countries joining us on 1 January 2007, and we would like to congratulate them on moving another step closer to the European Union."
"– Mr President, the choices facing Romania and Bulgaria are quite simple: will they compete with the economies of Western Europe on the basis of skills, or with Turkey on price?"
"A practical example would be the steel industry."
"In Ireland, the state-owned Irish Steel was sold to Europe’s favourite steel producer Mr Mittal for one pound."
"Five years later, just weeks after he collapsed Irish Steel with debts of GBP 50 million and no word of complaint from the then Irish Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy, we had Mr Blair writing to the Romanian Prime Minister recommending Mittal as a suitable custodian of Romania’s steel industry."
"No doubt Mr Mittal’s donation to Mr Blair of GBP 125 000 was coincidental."
"The donations to Labour have continued, and again, coincidentally under the British Presidency, anti-dumping tariffs on steel produced by Mittal outside the EU have continued to be reduced by Commissioner Mandelson."
"But what will happen once Romania and Bulgaria are on the inside?"
"They hope, of course, for an increase in their standard of living, but with that comes an increase in the costs of production."
"Just as Mittal moved production from Ireland to Romania, where will Romania’s production go in due course?"
"Would it be Kazakhstan or Algeria, Serbia, Bosnia?"
"All of these countries’ steel industries have been bought with aid from loans from the EBRD and the World Bank"
"In other words, European taxpayers are subsidising the export of their own heavy industries."
"The sale of Sidex was seen to have helped Romania’s bid for EU membership."
"What will be the price for the next wave of candidate countries?"
"Are the Romanian and Bulgarian governments happy to pay for EU membership with the jobs of their steel industries?"
"What other industries have similar deals hidden away?"
"If Mr Mittal is successful in his rumoured takeover of Corus/British Steel, no doubt they will follow MG Rover into Blair-sponsored oblivion."
"– Mr President, I, too, am glad to be able to welcome observers from Romania and Bulgaria to this House today."
"They, as representatives of their peoples, need to know that the Romanian and Bulgarian people must, of course, after 50 years of Communist tyranny and servitude, have the prospect of membership of the European Union, and that it is self-evident that they are part of Europe – in utter contrast to Turkey, in my opinion."
"Neither Romania and Bulgaria, though, nor indeed the European Union, will be able to cope with an over-hasty enlargement."
"If we bear in mind that last year’s eastward enlargement, involving the accession of 10 states, stretched the European Union’s financial viability to the very limit, and that the accession of Bulgaria and Romania can be expected to entail costs amounting to some EUR 44 billion, then we will know just how knotty this problem is."
"It is because of financial problems such as these and, above all, the ongoing predominance of the as yet incompletely resolved problems that both these countries have with such things as burgeoning corruption, organised crime, unemployment and poverty, but particularly the outstanding deficiencies in the monitoring and control of their borders that this project of continued enlargement really does need thorough preparation."
"What the European public expect of the applicants for accession is demonstrable progress in fighting crime, in making themselves better locations for economic activity and in creating jobs."
"Quite apart from that, the people in Romania and Bulgaria, too, have a right to see those problems resolved before any enlargement, particularly if it is to be a precipitate one."
"– Mr President, I am grateful for the information Commissioner Rehn has given us on the progress towards accession by Rumania and Bulgaria; an historic process for these two countries, completing the fifth enlargement, which is supported by this Parliament and also by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"I shall focus on Rumania."
"We all know that the work done by this country to fulfil the commitments it has made and to be ready to join the European Union on the scheduled date did not end on the day the Treaty was signed, but that the Rumanian authorities had to continue to make great efforts."
"The report that you are presenting to us today is therefore very important, Commissioner Rehn."
"I welcome the generally positive tone, the good progress of the economy and all the specific advances that you have mentioned and which demonstrate the Rumanian Government’s determination to fulfil its commitments."
"The information provided today also makes it clear that there are areas of concern in which efforts must continue or, better still, intensify; for example, in the fight against corruption, rigorously applying the legislation in force."
"This is one of the most serious problems afflicting Rumania, and on which this Parliament, and my political group as well, incidentally, have repeatedly insisted."
"I know that the Rumanian authorities are also aware of this serious problem, since President Basescu made the fight against corruption one of the key issues during last year’s presidential elections."
"Another important area, and one to which the Rumanian authorities must apply more energy, as the Commissioner has told us, is the proper operation of the control of borders through enhancing personnel and providing them with better training; the Accession Treaty also stresses the importance of this area."
"In fact, this is a key point since it relates to participation in a single space and a single market which, furthermore, must face serious and heavy migratory pressures at its external borders."
"Very notable progress has also been made, however, as Mr Rehn has stressed."
"I do not have time to go into specific areas, but I would like to stress that the priority attention paid by the Rumanian authorities to the issue of competition and State aid has yielded very good results."
"This is an area to which the Treaty attaches very great importance, as well as the effective date of accession."
"I am also pleased that progress is being made, as you have said, Commissioner, on the reform of the judicial administration, a particularly important area, to which attention must continue to be paid."
"Ladies and gentlemen, during the months between now and the final report that the Commission will produce next spring, the Rumanian Government must attach absolute priority to compliance with the three outstanding tasks; during this year, the new government has made much progress, but there is still work to be done."
"The progress made must serve as a stimulus."
"The report presented to us today by the Commissioner will be read carefully, in a constructive but vigilant and demanding spirit."
"We must all be aware that the decisive moment for this process will be the report that the Commission has promised for April, including the possible presentation of the safeguard clause."
"In any event, the document being presented to us today is very important."
"I trust that the Bucharest authorities will react quickly and positively to the warnings that it contains."
"They will have our full support in this task."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if I may remain with Mr Lagendijk’s footballing analogy, the Commission may well have shown both Romania and Bulgaria the yellow card, but that certainly does not prevent the Romanian and Bulgarian teams from having a chance of completing accession in 2007, provided that they play well enough and fairly enough."
"The Commission was quite right to point out that they have made progress in many areas, but that a number of issues are still outstanding."
"Further to what Mr Wiersma said about Romania, I hope that political debate in that country will tend more towards a common European position and that the temptation to divide the country will be resisted."
"This is where the opposition, the government and the President need to be singing from the same hymn sheet."
"Turning to Bulgaria, I am persuaded that past omissions will be made good in the course of the process of forming a government."
"Some of this has already been done and some remains to be."
"We will, quite obviously, be carefully observing what the two countries and their governments do to remedy the deficiencies that remain, including not only the major problem of corruption, but also the issue of the situation of the Roma, to which reference has already been made, and to which we, not only in this House, have returned time and time again, with – as I see it – progress being made."
"There are, of course, anxieties on this score about the possibility that it will not be security being exported to these countries, but rather problems imported from them, if great strides are not made in helping this disadvantaged group of people in the country itself."
"All these things will need to be monitored if it is to be possible eventually, in 2007 or 2008, to come to a decision, and one that must take into account these countries’ well-being, for what matters, after all, is that they be enabled to take the right steps."
"I would like to invite you, Commissioner, to work with this House over the coming months, not only in the countries themselves, but also by improving the way in which the enlargement issue is communicated generally within the European Union."
"People are, of course, to some extent, weary of enlargement, and that is hardly surprising in view of the past debates and disappointments, but we cannot simply give in to weariness and say that we are not interested."
"This debate is about how to persuade people of how important this enlargement is."
"I would like to see the Commission give us an assessment of the 2004 enlargement, for it might well have been said today that it took us to the limits of what was feasible, but I am convinced that it went very well."
"That is not to say that there were no problems, but it does, in fact, have the potential to make the European Union stronger, if we work through it together."
"That too must be debated."
"Something else we, of course, expect of the new Member States is a strong commitment to Europe."
"When the newly-elected President of Poland says that his first two visits must be to the USA and the Vatican, that is something I have to accept, for I am certainly not going to interfere in his travel arrangements, but it is not surprising that there are those who wonder whether Europe, the unity that Poland joined, is not actually more important."
"This morning, we had a debate on social standards and social models in Europe, and it is in that area that there are fears that the standards that we have established with a great deal of effort will simply be broken asunder."
"It is surely not acceptable – and, in saying this, I know that I have my group’s unreserved backing – that we should, now that we are in a process of enlargement and integration, cut ourselves off again and leave our neighbours’ workers, capital or interests standing, so to speak, at the gate."
"We have to be reasonable about the way we plan the transitional process and try together, in so far as possible, to come up with a new social standard, rather than leaving the door wide open to social dumping."
"Presupposing that we succeed in persuading our people of how important this enlargement is to the European Union, I hope that we will take the right decision early next year and that we will be able to set 2007 as the date of enlargement."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although last year, Romania and Bulgaria once again took the necessary and important steps, there is a great deal left to be done by both countries in the short time that remains, namely until 1 January 2007."
"With regard to Romania, on the basis of the progress reports over the past six months, reports I have received from Romania and my own observations, I have to admit in all honesty that there are still a good deal of major concerns left, many of which have been mentioned by other Members."
"I should like to touch on three of those."
"Firstly, there is the independence of the judiciary, which, according to the Commission’s progress report of September 2005, is put at risk by the major budget restrictions imposed by the Finance Ministry."
"I would like to know what the latest is on this score."
"Secondly, as has been stated before, there is every evidence to suggest that corruption is still rife among the police, in the justice system and in the corridors of power."
"To what extent does the Commission think it can solve this by introducing more rules and regulations?"
"Is it not, above all, a question of awareness, mentality, and therefore time?"
"Finally, there are serious shortcomings in psychiatric care, which is not considered a priority, or at least that is what I gather from the recent developments in Romania."
"How does the Commission intend to press home the urgency of this problem?"
"I would also like to hear from the Commission what, precisely, it regards as crucial if it is to be able to come out with a positive recommendation this coming spring and thus to recommend accession on 1 January 2007."
"As I have told the House before, I do think it of really vital importance that we should adhere to the conditions and criteria that were once so carefully formulated."
"Candidate countries or countries with an ambition along those lines not only join an economic area, but also choose to take part in the political union, the European legal community."
"The Commission takes a critical line, and that is something that I value."
"The question is whether the Council will seriously consider the Commission’s reports."
"It certainly did not do so in December 2004, when it was decided to round up the negotiations formally."
"As I see it, the Council’s absence from this debate is once again telling, whether it has other priorities or not."
"Let there be no doubt, though, I am in favour of both countries joining, but regard it as vitally important that this be done on the basis of what we have agreed to."
"– Mr President, there is good news from Bulgaria, but also alarming news."
"Since June’s elections, Bulgaria has had Ataka, a neo-Nazi party, in its Parliament."
"It obtained 8 % of the votes in June and now has 12 %."
"This party denies the Holocaust and, on its website, you can find discussions about how to castrate Roma and receive congratulations from the Klu Klux Klan."
"Behind this promotion of racism and xenophobia are the former Communist agents who are building a shadow economy through fake privatisation and manipulations."
"Their strategy is to divert people’s attention from high-level corruption by raising anti-Roma, anti-Semitic and anti-minority sentiments in Bulgaria."
"Bulgaria has democratic politicians who want to fight corruption and poverty, but they lack support from us in the European Union."
"The EU has an obligation to fix the problems in Bulgaria because it has cooperated with the wrong partners for 15 years already."
"How does the Commission view the recent cases of violence between Roma and Bulgarians provoked by anti-Gypsyism?"
"Secondly, do EC grants help put a stop to racism, or do they stimulate corrupt political structures?"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the previous speakers have forgotten to tell us what the real situation is in Bulgaria and Romania during the accession procedure."
"Real unemployment in Bulgaria and Romania is terrifyingly high."
"Huge industrial and livestock units are closing."
"Traditional crops, such as vines and tobacco, have fallen apart or are on the road to destruction."
"Even infrastructure works such as irrigation works have fallen apart."
"Almost all the irrigation pipes, water channels and irrigation stations and their equipment have been destroyed."
"In Bulgaria, for example, overall agricultural production has fallen by more than 50% so that the products of the multinationals of Europe, whose interests you defend, can be sold."
"With the restoration of the right to own land, the average size is 1.5 hectares or 15 decares, a very small allotment with, hence, zero margin for efficient cultivation."
"Thus, you will buy them for nothing, for a loaf of bread."
"The multinationals of Europe will buy up land in Bulgaria and Romania."
"However, you do not say as much, so that the invitees from Bulgaria and Romania can hear you, although of course they know all this."
"The health and education system is breaking down."
"The Romanian Government, Commissioner, has the objective today of achieving the standard of living of 1989, which you condemned."
"You talk of democratic freedoms, of rights, but you say nothing about the legislative ban on the action of the communist party in Romania."
"You say nothing about the unprecedented prison sentence being served since February 1999 by the president of the Confederation of Romanian Miners' Unions, Miron Cosma, who was imprisoned for defending the interests of the miners being made redundant by the thousand."
"This situation also has consequences for Greece."
"As wages are very cheap, this precise situation results in companies relocating to these countries, especially from the area of northern Greece, in order to increase their profits."
"Thus, the Bulgarian and Romanian workers, faced with the spectre of hunger, are forced to work for slave wages and, at the same time, there is pressure on workers in Greece."
"So welcome to the European Union, the land of promise, of 20 million unemployed, of 50 million in poverty, the European Union that crushes the rights of the workers so that big business can make untold fortunes."
"– Mr President, the June List will welcome Romania and Bulgaria as Members of the European Union in the same way as we shall welcome Turkey, the countries of the Western Balkans and, in time, Ukraine and, hopefully, Belarus."
"What, however, is at issue is the timetable, for this is important."
"I wish to sound a warning about the problems that will be faced by the EU if, over a very short period, we accept as Members a large number of countries that are poor and economically undeveloped, that have little experience of democracy and of government under the rule of law and that have major problems involving corruption."
"Even the enlargement involving 10 countries that has just been carried out and of which the June List has been a strong supporter is giving rise to problems."
"To now accept poor countries such as Romania and Bulgaria into an EU that continues to be encumbered by an absurd agricultural policy and a badly managed structural policy and that is grappling with difficulties in preventing waste and corruption in its own system would be dangerous for the future of the European project."
"We must ask ourselves at what stage a country should become a fully-fledged Member State."
"Is development quickest when a candidate country is making efforts to obtain approval or after it has become a Member?"
"I believe that the pressure to improve democracy, human rights, the judicial system and public administration and to set up a functioning market economy is strongest, on the one hand, before membership negotiations have begun and, on the other, before the country has been accepted as a Member."
"The Commission’s report on the state of things in Romania and Bulgaria is unconvincing on these different points."
"We find a key sentence to the effect that developments have been inadequate in a number of areas, and the Commission provides long lists of what has not been done in terms of infrastructure, organised crime, tax systems and the treatment of minorities."
"In this situation, membership for both countries should be postponed until a later date."
"This would be in the long-term interests of both the European Union and the two candidate countries."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, only in early October, the Romanian Prime Minister, Mr Popescu, stated that the enormous increase in organised crime in Bulgaria is at risk of jeopardising the accession of both countries in 2007 and that the safeguard clause will have to be applied to defer their accession until 1 January 2008."
"Popescu’s statements have now been corroborated by the Commission, whose report states, in black and white, that corruption in both countries – not, therefore, only in Bulgaria – has taken on such dimensions that it is putting at risk the future of the EU’s internal market and the programmes funded by the EU."
"With regard to reforming the judiciary and administration, there are very few improvements noticeable, which means that corruption is running riot."
"Bulgaria and Romania are European countries that, just like the other Central and Eastern European countries, are entitled to join the Union, but they do need to be ready to do so."
"We cannot admit countries that have no rule of law to speak of."
"The Commission itself admits that countries that are, partly at least, in the grip of organised crime could damage the European internal market."
"They should certainly not join in 2007, nor, probably, in 2008."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, please allow me to thank you personally for your continued openness in handling our proposals regarding accession issues."
"The inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the EU is a historical moment."
"But let us leave the historical significance aside for a moment, and face the bare facts at last."
"A key issue of the current debate is whether the country report reflects the realities of Romania, and if it does, to what extent."
"On this occasion, I would like to concentrate on Romania."
"We would have to examine a number of areas, and not only in light of the official statistics, but based on everyday reality."
"The report of the Commission does stress some of the serious issues, such as the internal market, animal health regulation and food safety, or it remarks on the absence of institutions that would make agricultural assistance available to Romanian farmers."
"At the same time, significant measures have been introduced in respect of the reform of the judicial system."
"The Commission is appreciative of these measures, and Mrs Macovei, the Minister, is to be commended for them."
"But while we are hearing about resounding achievements in the area of political criteria and are informed that the situation of the 1.6 million Hungarians living in the country has been resolved, there have not been any actual changes."
"Like in the case of the Minority Act, none of the partial solutions have actually been accepted."
"Although the report still mentions it as a positive development, I must inform the Commissioner that the Romanian Senate rejected the Minority Act yesterday."
"And in the course of the debate there was hate talk and discrimination that would not bring credit to any democracy in the world."
"Hungarians living in Romania must have heard similar things at the beginning of the 90s."
"In light of the shocking vote yesterday, there does not seem to be any possibility of cultural or any other type of autonomy that would actually provide a solution for the large Hungarian community."
"To quote the chairperson of the competent expert committee of the Romanian House: ‘Such a thing is an impossibility in a rule of law state!’"
"My question is, what kind of a rule of law state is this?"
"The legal framework for returning church property has been put in place."
"However, in practice, the return of church property is made impossible, the reclaimed buildings are being privatised underhandedly or the privatisation process is slowed down by successive lawsuits."
"Proprietary rights cannot be enforced."
"What kind of working market economy are we talking about here?"
"First of all, we must spell out the problems, because naming the problems may help find a solution."
"Our task here in Parliament is to name the problems, and it is a considerable task."
"This is the most effective way of helping people living in Romania."
"By a willingness to see the real situation, together with and for those who ought to see it in Brussels and in Romania."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by telling you how pleased I am to be able to speak here in our Chamber in front of the Romanian and Bulgarian observers."
"It is truly a first important stage towards Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession to the EU."
"I should also like to testify to the progress that I, as a member of our Parliamentary delegation, have observed take place in Bulgaria in the space of six years."
"A great deal of progress has been made, including progress shared by a large part of the people."
"However, achieving such progress has been very difficult for the people of Bulgaria because a great deal of effort was required of them."
"I believe that, in the West, we cannot appreciate the culture shock represented by a shift from a centrally-planned Communist economy to a market economy."
"You have all noted that a large number of European have been adopted, an action that has resulted in obvious progress being made in economic and political terms."
"Yet, you have also highlighted a large number of grey areas."
"Like you, I have to admit that the integration of minorities is a very difficult problem in these countries."
"I am thinking about the Roma community, disabled people, women and their role, and homosexuals."
"However, are we in a position to tell anyone what to do when we are encountering similar problems in our own countries?"
"Bulgaria has problems with corruption, property rights and security."
"In order to overcome these problems, it needs to carry out a real reform of its judicial system and to start to implement this system effectively, which will give democratic guarantees to the entire population."
"There is a need for Bulgaria and Romania to step up their efforts before the next progress report, and for them to do so in the space of a few months."
"Yet, there is also a need for the EU not to waver in continuing to contribute its help, its technical assistance and its budgetary support."
"Finally, I should like to say that, while we must be rigorous and demanding in our dealings with these two new countries, we must also realise that their arrival in the EU will add a new dimension to Europe and that, at last, we will together be able to turn the page on Yalta."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is now one year since the vote on the Moscovici report on progress by Romania and Bulgaria towards accession."
"We said ‘yes’ but with reservations, invoking the safeguard clause stipulated in the Treaty which allowed for a one-year deferment if there were delays or unsatisfactory results in achieving the Community ."
"I have followed the Romanian situation more closely as a member of the interparliamentary delegation, and I believe that, today, a cautious approach may help us to gain a better awareness of the situation in that country, where the educational system is still inadequate, corruption is still widespread, environmental, energy and economic policies still require strengthening, there is still no real answer to discrimination against minorities, and the average income of the population is too low."
"The question of international adoption is also still unresolved and, after the moratorium and approval of the new law, it has now been blocked, with unfortunate and extremely damaging consequences for the children, those with the least protection, who should be the main beneficiaries of what we all refer to as ‘human rights’."
"The victims are the children who got to know their families but who today are unable to embrace them and live with them."
"The European Parliament must keep this problem under close scrutiny and ask Romania to comply with its institutional promises."
"Then there are the areas of justice and border controls in relation to prostitution, which needs to be contained, and we must avoid the arrival of under-age girls in neighbouring countries, exploited by local organisations."
"Enlargement is a process we cannot halt, but it cannot and must not merely be an economic process: it is also a cultural and democratic phenomenon to ensure peace."
"That is why I agree with the prudent comments of the Commission on the definition of accession for Romania and Bulgaria."
"The months remaining before the accession of these two countries to the Union will give them the chance of joining Europe without being at the bottom of the class, and will allow us to have the necessary and prudential assurances that accession will occur with full consciousness and on an equal footing."
"Naturally, this is our ambition, in order to achieve the dream shared by Romano Prodi with the citizens of Europe when, as President of the Commission, he strongly supported enlargement and expressed the wish for a united Europe able to offer a robust political project, to restore confidence to those looking nervously at the major changes taking place in our time, and thus enable us to be the architects of an international action with a human face."
"That, in my view, is the Europe to which we all aspire."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen from Romania and Bulgaria, I will confine my remarks to the subject of Romania."
"In mid-July, we received a visit from some particularly anxious Romanian farmers."
"They explained to us that the Romanian authorities had lost all control over GMO crops."
"No one, not even their minister, knows how many thousands of hectares are covered by these crops."
"On the other hand, it turns out that Romania is the country in which GMO crops reign supreme, with soya, maize, plums, potatoes and so on."
"The directive on GMOs, Commissioner, is categorically not enforced and has been passed over in your report."
"I have not seen the Rosia Montana gold mine mentioned anywhere in the report either."
"The present Government, however, took a stand against this project, which violates the very concept of sustainable development, one of the pillars of our European policies."
"However, Romania also possesses the jewel in Europe’s environmental crown in the shape of the Danube delta."
"Its approach to managing the delta had succeeded, until now, in striking the right balance between promoting the various activities taking place in the delta and protecting its fabulous biodiversity."
"However, the way in which the delta is being managed today gives us cause for concern."
"Thus, the start of the hunting season, on 15 September, is harmful to the preservation of these natural surroundings, and this demonstrates that, as far as the environment is concerned, Romania is really not on the right track."
"On the other hand, I entirely support Romania’s accession to the European Union but, in doing so, I call on the Romanian authorities to get to grips with the environment and to undertake effectively to protect it."
"– Mr President, it is because our political attitudes are often shaped by imagery in constant use that I want to object to the use of the ‘yellow card’ analogy, which is so frequent nowadays."
"The Commission has not, today, shown Romania and Bulgaria the yellow card, for that would presuppose that they were already on the pitch, but they are not – yet."
"That they are European players is not in doubt, but they are not yet in the stadium."
"What are they saying among themselves, and where are they in the league?"
"Reference has been made to the NGO ‘Transparency International’, which has also stated that corruption in Bulgaria has, indeed, become more widespread, and has recently moved Bulgaria down its Index, not only in terms of ranking, but also of points."
"What that means, if you agree with Baroness Nicholson’s view that corruption is humanity's enemy number one, is that Bulgaria is on its way off the EU pitch."
"As regards Romania, let me quote its newly-elected President, who has said, ‘I do not hesitate to say that almost every state institution is affected by corruption.’"
"Romania is not prepared for the European Union’s standards, and we should act accordingly."
"– Mr President, during the past months, Bulgaria has made positive steps towards membership in the European Union."
"The country is slowly recuperating economically and most probably it will meet the objectives by the date of accession."
"An increase in trade with Member States bears witness to this positive factor."
"However, one should look at Bulgaria’s judiciary system, a system which still has to make many changes because among many other most crucial factors, there is the fact that it still does not conform to the charter of human rights."
"Organised crime is also an important worrying problem which the Bulgarian Authorities must tackle."
"For example, the resignation of five high officials within the office against organised crime, makes us ask a lot of questions and the Bulgarian Government should take immediate action before more harm is done."
"The proposals for a reform in the national service against organised crime should be revised so that the system will start operating with the least possible number of problems."
"It is also disturbing to discover that a criminal gang has, for example, been exporting babies to Europe."
"This is because this vile trade is becoming frequent in recent years."
"The authorities should therefore continue working to break this vicious circle and it should be assured that the strictest measures are taken so that all those involved in this clandestine trade are caught."
"Yes Mr President, fundamental rights are indispensable so that the Bulgarian people live as they deserve after long years of Communist rule."
"If Bulgaria does not adhere to these basic principles, I and a number of others in this Chamber will find it difficult to accept Bulgaria as a member of this Union."
"Here, there is no need for a transitional period, for we are not talking about economics or politics, we are talking about fundamental human rights."
"Thus I hope that the Bulgarian authorities will overcome these obstacles so that they can join the European Union by 2007."
"– Mr President, I, too, would like to greet the observers, in particular because they are here with us today as a result of the insistence of the Socialist faction that following the signing of the Accession Agreement on 25 April, they should also be allowed to study the work of Parliament, alongside that of the other EU institutions, to facilitate a smooth accession process."
"Both the Enlargement Commissioner and my colleagues have already listed the shortcomings found in the two countries, and I am not going to repeat them, as I am certain that the observers will pass them on to their countries."
"However, I welcome the fact that following the elections on 25th June the new government of Bulgaria is headed by Socialists, because Socialists have always been pro-enlargement both in the new Member States and in the pre-accession states."
"In Bulgaria an agreement has been reached both among governing parties and opposition parties to support a successful implementation of the EU accession."
"As the Commissioner has mentioned, legislation has been speeded up in the past two months, and thirty laws have been introduced with a view to accession, regarding matters that had been criticised by the Commission, in areas such as the fight against corruption, judicial system reforms and organised crime."
"The introduction of these laws is still not sufficient, as the emphasis should now be on the enforcement of these laws, and I therefore invite both the Bulgarian and the Romanian Government to use the remaining period of time for this purpose."
"As a Hungarian, I would like to use this opportunity to say a few words about Romania, as well, as many of those present in this auditorium are aware of the fact that there is a Hungarian minority of a million and a half living in Romania."
"Their only possibility of joining the EU is together with Romania, and accession would enable them to live happily with us in a common Europe without borders."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the enlargement and unification of Europe will not of course be complete without our friends Romania and Bulgaria."
"They have a natural place in the European community, and we look forward to their becoming Members before long."
"We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are delighted to have our colleagues here in the form of observers. In that way, we are able to get to know them, and we shall be able to prepare each other for Romania’s and Bulgaria’s forthcoming membership."
"We are impressed by the progress made in both countries but, at the same time, we must of course examine this progress, the implementation of the relevant measures, and any remaining problems."
"The Commissioner indicated a number of these problems: areas requiring further measures as a matter of some urgency."
"We owe this to the people of the candidate countries, and we owe it to ourselves if we are to be able to defend European values."
"Corruption is a big worry, and the Roma – Europe’s largest minority – are marginalised in Romania and Bulgaria just as in many other European countries, with high unemployment, high figures for ill health and large and serious social problems."
"Unfortunately, discrimination and racist violence still occur, and too often it is on the part of the authorities."
"This is naturally unacceptable."
"Another storm cloud mentioned by certain colleagues has to do with children, especially those children cared for in institutions, among them children with mental disabilities."
"There are worrying signs that these children are being openly neglected, and that is of course unworthy of a Member State."
"I hope that the Commission will increase its efforts to support Romania and Bulgaria in order to help them to cope successfully with these and other problems and to do so – as I still believe and hope it is possible for them to do – within the time frame for accession in 2007."
"– Mr President, I wish to thank Commissioner Rehn for a well-balanced report."
"Unfortunately, I do not believe that the debate on enlargement is always balanced."
"Those who wish to put the brakes on enlargement talk about the danger of accepting poor countries and about the referenda on the EU Treaty having changed the mood in the EU which, they say, has become chillier."
"They say that the referenda were really not about the Treaty itself but about other matters."
"That is true, moreover. They were about other matters because we European political leaders did not show enough political leadership and because we did not manage to explain that it really was the Treaty, and nothing else, that the referenda were really about."
"Let us now make sure that we do not make the same mistake. Let us ensure that the current debate about Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession to the EU really is about that alone and not about anything else."
"We must show that we have visions and plans regarding enlargement."
"Enlargement is not about aimlessly accepting new Members whenever we want and whenever public opinion in our countries allows us to."
"Enlargement is about democracy and freedom in Europe but, above all, about European security, something I am surprised no one mentioned today."
"To see Bulgaria’s and Romania’s accession to the EU as an isolated phenomenon would be a mistake because many challenges await us over the next few years, such as the debate on Kosovo’s status, the referendum, Montenegro’s independence, continued discussions with Bosnia and Serbia and Macedonia’s application for membership."
"To postpone Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession unless it is absolutely necessary to do so would be a mistake in this very uncertain situation where the politics of security are concerned."
"No one, either in this Chamber or in Romania and Bulgaria, believes that we should accept any country unless it fulfils the criteria, but nor should we disqualify any country in advance. If it is the case that, following the referenda, Europe has become chillier, it is our task to warm it up."
"If Europe has become more selfish and closed in on itself, it is our duty to make it more generous and open."
"That is what differentiates those who represent public opinion from those who create it. That is what makes us European political leaders who accept our responsibility."
"– Mr President, as so many footballing metaphors have been laboured, perhaps I might be allowed to make a few comments on the rules of the game."
"This is not a second debate about whether or not Bulgaria’s or Romania’s accession should go ahead."
"That decision has already been taken and I am glad to see the observers here today."
"I would, though, like to make two observations, which are addressed to us ourselves and to the two countries in question."
"Let me start with us ourselves: Mr Van Orden has called for tough action aimed at combating corruption and crime."
"In some of his press releases he has specifically referred to trafficking in people and drugs."
"He also, though, more or less openly stated that deferment of accession beyond the envisaged date of 2007 is absolutely out of the question."
"I would remind the House that, if we were to put the two together in the way in which he has, it would be to declare bankrupt the theory that accession to the EU provided an incentive for more domestic reforms."
"What incentive for reform is left, after all, when the pressure is taken off, if it is guaranteed that accession is going to go ahead anyway?"
"So let me make it perfectly clear that the date has not been decided in advance."
"That they will join is a given, but the date on which they will do so remains undecided; it is dependent on what is done by the countries in question during the time that remains, and by nobody else."
"There can be no input on the part of the European Union, nor can any kind of discount be given."
"I get the feeling that not every aspect of the is equally important."
"I do believe that the EU public’s need for security may make the combating of crime and the securing of the external borders more important than the number of cars with insurance cover, although things might well look rather different from the motorist’s point of view."
"There are, though, or so I believe, different hierarchies of problems, and that is why every country will be judged separately."
"It used to be very comfortable to travel in convoy, with one country’s weaknesses being compensated for by another’s strengths, but those days are no more; from now on, every country will be judged separately."
"– Mr President, we, the Liberals, support the accession of Romania on 1 January 2007."
"This is still possible, even in light of the report presented by the Commissioner. But serious efforts are required, indeed."
"The Romanian Government deserves to be commended for the efforts made in recent months to meet the requirements."
"The government has done a lot, but a lot more remains to be done."
"The reform of the judicial system is stalling; action against corruption is tentative and unsuccessful."
"Neighbouring countries are seriously concerned about the condition of the environment."
"The opening of the gold mine at Rosia Montana has raised further worries."
"In this respect we expect the implementation of the strictest environmental protection standards."
"We find the rejection of the Minority Act by the Romanian Senate yesterday particularly worrying."
"We hope we can count on the promise of Prime Minister Tariceanu that the House will accept this Act soon."
"In any case, we will hold him to account for this promise."
"We hope that members of the Hungarian minority will soon be able to choose to study at mother-tongue universities, we hope that there will be a perceptible change in the situation of the Roma, and we admit that the Romanian Government has made efforts in this respect."
"It has done more than its predecessor, but there is still a great deal to be done."
"Therefore, Romania has a real chance to join in 2007."
"We would like Romania to join in 2007."
"We, the Liberals, and I believe all factions of Parliament, will give her all the support in this respect, but most of the work must be done by Romania."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, firstly, to extend a warm welcome to the observers from Bulgaria and Romania."
"I should also like to underline the sterling work of Commissioner Rehn and to remind all Members that the method of comprehensive monitoring reports we are adopting is the same approach used for the other 10 States which joined the Union on 1 May 2004."
"If we compare the degree of readiness of those 10 countries fourteen months prior to accession, we can see that the level of preparedness of Romania and Bulgaria is not dissimilar; indeed, compared to some of those 10 countries, Romania and Bulgaria are probably more advanced today."
"Moreover, Commissioner Rehn’s work has been thorough: he mentioned 140 areas investigated out of 29 chapters of the ."
"Where has he found real grounds for concern?"
"In 10% of these areas."
"They are important issues, such as food safety, border control and the much-discussed prevention of corruption."
"Commissioner Rehn himself spoke of the energetic way in which Bulgaria has managed to recover the time spent on the elections, and Romania’s impressive catching-up on issues such as legal reform, competition and, in general, all those sectors in which they were requested to achieve alignment."
"It is precisely because of what has just been said that, in my view, we should have confidence in Bulgaria and Romania, which still have fourteen months to go, and we must avoid any preconceptions – of which there is a hint from time to time in comments by some of the speakers – that we should already be making up our minds on the efforts of these two countries, their populations and governments."
"I really believe that the words with which Mr Moscovici ended his speech, namely ‘friendship, confidence, but also rigour’ must be taken to heart."
"Rigour, Commissioner, certainly, but also support for the efforts of the two countries concerned."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by reiterating what we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have been saying for months: we are entirely in favour of Rumania and Bulgaria’s accession to the European Union, and we maintain our commitment and hope that their accession may become a reality in January 2007."
"We must state equally clearly that, having been carefully monitoring developments in each of the countries, we are concerned about whether their respective governments still have time to carry out the reforms and fulfil the requirements for their accession on the scheduled date."
"It is time to encourage our partners to give new impetus to the said reforms in order to ensure that they are complete by the date in question."
"We will not accept imposing any new demands on either of the two candidate countries, nor shall we ask more of either of them than was required of our countries when we entered in our day, but neither will it be acceptable to relax any of the conditions agreed."
"Henceforth, Bulgaria and Rumania are two different situations that we must assess separately according to the merits of each."
"It is clearly their respective governments, rather than us, who hold the key that will open up the doors of the European Union to their people."
"During this final phase of the process, we in Parliament and the Commission want to help rather than to hinder."
"Finally, we note a differing tendency between the two countries."
"In Bulgaria, the political forces have been able to put together a government of national unity and everybody seems to be joining forces in order to move forward in the best possible way towards Community integration."
"On the other hand, it is very worrying to see in Rumania that the government appears to have embarked on an operation to harass the opposition, with a change of rules that interferes with the democratic workings of the institutions."
"Without evaluating the situation any further, we shall merely state that we believe that arguments amongst the country’s main political forces does not appear to be the best way to make progress on the consensus for reforms and for the negotiations with the European Union."
"– Mr President, Bulgaria and Romania have formally closed the accession negotiations, but before they become Member States with full rights, they must eliminate the deficiencies pointed out in the last European Parliament resolution and the new European Commission report."
"The situation of Romania is more complex."
"The young government of the country is making serious efforts to eliminate the deficiencies and deserves to be commended for this."
"But they still have a great number of problems to tackle, in areas like the judicial system and internal affairs, the fight against corruption and organised crime, and environmental protection."
"Another crucial issue is that of the gold mine at Rosia Montana, although Foreign Minister Ungureanu had promised back in spring that he would solve this issue within six months."
"Another heavy burden is the Roma issue."
"The new government endeavours to develop an effective system, but there are still many irregularities to be eliminated, things that are completely unacceptable to the EU."
"When Bulgaria and Romania join the EU, the number of Roma people in the EU will rise by approximately half, and this means that a long term strategy must be developed."
"The situation of ethnic minorities has improved considerably in the past decade, but it is still far from being satisfactory."
"For instance, why is the acceptance of the Minority Act such a huge problem?"
"The rejection of the draft law by the Senate yesterday is a very serious negative development."
"I would just like to warn Romanian politicians to avoid making statements to the effect that Romania already extensively guarantees all the rights of ethnic minorities."
"Romania is still a long way from this."
"It is true that the largest ethnic minority community, that of the one and a half million Hungarians, has seen considerable development."
"Hungarians are present in the government and in public administration, and can therefore have their say in the internal and foreign policy of the country."
"As the representative of the Hungarian community in Slovakia, I would definitely like to see the Hungarian community in Romania join the EU as soon as possible, to live as Eurocitizens and enjoy the opportunities offered by the Union."
"It is the task of the European Parliament to inspect all of this consistently, but at the same time it must also provide maximum assistance."
"I trust that the safeguard clause included in our resolution will not have to be applied."
"– Mr President, I should like to start my speech today by warmly welcoming the observers from Bulgaria and Romania to the European Parliament."
"On the whole, these two countries meet the political and economic criteria for membership of the European Union, and they have both made enormous progress towards democracy and a market economy over the past 16 years."
"In order to gain a full picture of this progress, we should remember their point of departure in 1989."
"Over recent years, we have seen a consolidation of democracy and a move from an electoral to a liberal democracy."
"As members of the European Union, Bulgaria and Romania will bring greater security to the European continent."
"In particular, they will help stabilise the political situation in the Balkans."
"Being in favour of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union does not mean turning a blind eye to the problems that both countries must resolve before they join the EU, however."
"At present, these problems mainly relate to the implementation of the EU , judicial and administrative reforms and the fight against corruption."
"The Bulgarian and Romanian Governments must accelerate reforms in these fields and take effective measures to promote good governance in order to ensure that accession can take place on 1 January 2007."
"The constitutional crisis faced by the EU Member States must not spread to those countries outside the EU that are on their way to becoming members."
"No country has ever been entirely ready for membership, and the EU cannot make demands of Bulgaria and Romania that it did not make of the 10 Central and Eastern European countries two years ago."
"The Romanian and Bulgarian Governments must now step up their efforts to tackle the problems they currently face."
"The citizens of the two countries must be made aware of the need for reform, and public opinion in the EU itself must be in favour of further enlargement."
"– Mr President, I am not a football fan so I am probably not good at football rules, but I take it as my personal political duty, as a Member of the European Parliament from the Czech Republic, to add some comments on the subject of Bulgaria and Romania."
"First, regarding the findings on political criteria, in my opinion the report should give necessary public administration reform, prosecution of high-level corruption and the fight against trafficking in human beings a lower profile."
"All the members of the public in this Chamber observing the debate must believe that Bulgaria and Romania are countries totally based on corruption, which is obviously not true."
"In my opinion we should do something about our European public administration reform and almost legendary EU red tape."
"I recommend that the high-level corruption wording, as used in the report, be only used in a very careful and limited way."
"The part of the report concerning economic criteria is exceptionally sensitive."
"When we compare economic performance in the eurozone and the economic performance of Bulgaria and Romania, we can only envy their courage in undergoing deep economic reforms with stunning results."
"However, what is worth mentioning in the reform is the labour market."
"Unfortunately that is not so much a debate about Romania and Bulgaria as a profound debate about the unwillingness of the western European labour markets to open up to the free movement of labour from Eastern and Central Europe."
"In my opinion, that is a message for the citizens here in the visitors’ gallery: the European Union does not have the keys to Europe."
"– Mr President, the valuable report submitted by the Commission gives an objective and realistic picture of the situation in the two countries."
"It is a fact that Bulgaria and Romania have made significant efforts, since the last Commission report, towards the integration and full application of the ."
"It is a fact that no one can contest and no one can disparage."
"However, it is also a fact that serious shortcomings are noted in the Commission report."
"Amnesty International has already pointed out certain problems with the protection of human rights, just as the Commission report has pointed out serious shortcomings in combating corruption, in reorganising the public administration, in modernising the judicial system, in combating piracy and infringements of industrial property rules, in integrating the , in farming as regards plant health protection and the protection of animal health, in controlling the external borders, in state aid in the steel industry, in the environment and in nuclear safety."
"These are important shortcomings which not only affect the progress of the two countries towards their accession, but also affect neighbouring countries and the Member States of the European Union."
"Issues such as the protection of the health of animals, plant health protection, the environment, nuclear safety, state aid and tax, insurance and labour dumping also cause serious economic and social problems in the Member States of the European Union."
"I believe that it is in the interests of the European Union and the peoples of the two countries to remain firm in defending the strategy of enlargement and to make every possible effort to complete the procedure of the timely integration of Bulgaria and Romania into the European Union."
"The Balkans face serious developments and the integration of Bulgaria and Romania will contribute to peace and to the strengthening of stability and security."
"However, the message must be clear."
"The accession procedure will proceed without discounts, but also without new terms and with the constant objective of the full integration and application of European principles and the ."
"To close, I should like to point out that what is urgently required is the contribution of the European Commission to the full appropriation of preaccession financing aid for Bulgaria and Romania in the direction of the full application of the ."
"It is the responsibility of the Council to adopt the proposals of the European Parliament on the 2006 budget."
"– Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his extensive introduction, which gives a balanced picture of the progress that has been made in a number of areas since we last considered them, yet also of the various problems that remain."
"In my speech, I should briefly like to focus on Romania."
"There is no doubt that the Basescu government means well and tries to work hard on further reforms, so credit where credit is due."
"Even so, there are still a number of recurrent problems."
"First of all, there is the continuing corruption."
"Since honesty by decree is impossible, the government will need to do more than spell out its opposition to corruption time and again."
"If further confidence is to be gained, it will, in particular, have to tackle the people in the higher echelons of the civil service and prosecute former politicians who have been corrupt."
"Needless to say, the judiciary has its own role to play in this, but the government should make every effort to show the first emphatic signs of change as a matter of urgency."
"Then there is border control, the fight against cross-border crime, not to mention people smuggling. Progress will definitely need to be made on that score too, also given the fact that Romania will soon have one of the most extensive external borders, if not most extensive, both in terms of land and sea."
"The third point has to do with food safety and genetic modification, and my Dutch fellow Member, Mr Lagendijk, has discussed it in detail."
"The fourth point may seem less significant on the surface, namely the position in hospitals of people suffering from mental illness and the situation in orphanages."
"There is certainly a need for more progress to be made in those areas too."
"Both in his speech and in his documents, the Commissioner has spoken in no uncertain terms."
"There are still major problems with 10% of the ."
"We will need to see improvements if we are to commence proceedings on the planned date."
"Both now in the autumn, but certainly also in April, we will need to join with the Commissioner in examining whether it will be necessary to defer accession."
"We hope that it will not be, but if we have to defer, then so be it."
"We should also check whether, after a possible accession, certain chapters should be put on hold if the level of implementation is inadequate; the Council will need to look into this in detail and it is unfortunate that the Council is not present here."
"On a final note, I should like to say to Romania that we are strict where the criteria are concerned."
"We are not against Romania; it is not a yellow card, but rather a push for further reforms, a push for more freedom for the Romanian people and guaranteeing our values as Europe, to which we must very definitely hold fast during each enlargement round if we want to keep our credibility intact."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, if I may, I too should like to start by welcoming the observers from Romania and Bulgaria to the European Parliament."
"The Czech Social Democrat Party, on behalf of which I am speaking, has always backed the accession of these two countries to the European Union, and one need look no further than the votes held in this House for proof of this."
"I believe that my party will continue to back the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the European Union in 2007."
"The reason for this is that we believe this accession to be the next step in a historical process, namely the gradual enlargement of an area of peace, prosperity and stability to cover the eastern parts of the European continent."
"I believe the Commission report that we are debating here today to be extremely well-balanced, and I should like to thank the Commission for having drafted it."
"It gives details of the progress that both countries have made in the fields of human rights, civil liberties and the political system, without of course forgetting the unquestionable progress they have made in economic terms."
"At the same time, however, it also highlights the problems that are still faced by both Romania and Bulgaria."
"Previous speakers have already mentioned many of these problems, which include corruption, food safety and other agricultural issues, border protection and public administration."
"The latter problem obviously also involves the capacity of these countries to absorb EU funds, to administer such funds in a democratic and transparent manner and to monitor their expenditure."
"Further problems include the protection of minorities, for example the Roma minority, which has been the subject of much debate."
"I am quite sure that it is still feasible for both Romania and Bulgaria to join the EU in January 2007, but there is one point I should like to stress, and I hope that the observers will take my recommendation, which is based on my experience of the Czech Republic’s accession to the EU, back with them to their own countries."
"I believe that if the two countries are to succeed in joining the EU, cooperation must be established there between all European political parties, irrespective of whether they form part of ruling coalitions or are in opposition, and of whether they represent social democratic, liberal or conservative views."
"If such cooperation can be achieved and efforts are made in this direction, then I am sure that in six months’ time, when this House holds a debate on the final report, we will come to the conclusion that it will be possible for the two countries to join in January 2007."
"– Mr President, the speakers before me talked about what Romania and Bulgaria had promised prior to the closure of the accession negotiations, and what they have actually delivered on their promises."
"I would like to talk about a different matter: the fate of the EU directives prepared in the period between the closure of accession negotiations and the actual accession."
"The Mining Waste Directive is currently in the reconciliation phase."
"This is the directive initiated by the Commission following the mine disaster involving cyanide in Romania in 2000."
"The disaster resulted in serious drinking water contamination and environmental pollution in Romania, the Ukraine, Slovakia and Hungary."
"We prepared this directive to avoid the possibility of a similar disaster in the future."
"The directive is expected to be issued in December."
"Commissioner, is it possible that the Commission and the Council may give Romania any concessions in respect of compliance with this directive?"
"What guarantees can they give that this will not happen?"
"Why do I ask this question?"
"Because in spite of the fact that the Romanian mine disaster took place five and a half years ago, to this date none of the damage claims have been settled by the courts."
"The negotiation is stalling, as well, but the company that had caused the damage continues to operate undisturbed in Romania."
"Neither the injured parties, nor nature have received any damage compensation, in Hungary or in the other countries affected."
"One of the reasons why I support the EU membership of Romania is because membership would ensure that Romania is bound by EU regulations, and we would be able to enforce their implementation."
"Environmental protection, prevention of damage or the settlement of any damages caused is a basic right and obligation in civilised European countries."
"This is not happening in Romania yet."
"Whether it will happen or not, it depends on the Council and the Commission."
"This is why I ask the Commission and the Council: can they guarantee not to allow Romania and Bulgaria to evade the effect of the new Mining Directive, even temporarily?"
"– Mr President, the quantitative accession criteria are simple and measurable."
"However, it is difficult to measure the qualitative criteria, the criteria at the core of the politicisation of the enlargement exercise."
"This is the fault of Europe, for failing to clarify the qualitative criteria in an objective, reliable and functional manner, for failing to lay down the political geography, its political limits, and for failing to define the dialectic ratio between deepening and enlarging."
"If these major questions had been answered, we would not have the dilemma of Turkey, there would not be the uncertainty of the prospects of the Western Balkans and there would not be the speculation about Bulgaria and Romania."
"The crucial time for evaluating the readiness for accession of the two countries was when the accession acts were signed."
"Since then, the special transitional time for political, institutional and administrative adjustment has been correctly granted and extended."
"The remarks in the report about the state of accession readiness of the two countries presented today by the Commission are also correct."
"In all events, we must not overlook the fact that the rate of acceptance of the in Bulgaria and Romania has been stepped up."
"Under no circumstances must it be the Union that disappoints the citizens of the two countries."
"The principle of there being no automatic link between candidacy and accession, to which I subscribe, cannot be a belated claim, an claim."
"Bulgaria, Romania and the Union of the 25 must up the ante, step up efforts and demonstrate a convergent and creative political will to make the Europe of the 27 a reality on 1 January 2007."
"If nothing else, the geopolitical and geo-economic restoration of the historical unity of Europe so dictates."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our rejoicing at the positive steps that Romania and Bulgaria have taken on the road towards the European Union make us all the more entitled to talk about the things that cannot be seen in a positive light and deserve some measure of criticism."
"According to the Commission, the political criteria have been met;"
"I do not believe that they have been in every respect."
"The law on minorities, to which reference is made in the Commission’s report, was yesterday voted down in the Senate, as Mr Duka-Zólyomi has already said."
"These rules in relation to minorities were, in practical terms, absolute minimum requirements, and even they were rejected."
"I regard that as shameful and as a flagrant about-turn on the road towards compliance with the Copenhagen criteria."
"I have to tell Commissioner Rehn that, although I take a very favourable view of the large amount of space devoted to the Roma in the report, I do believe that the one and a half million Hungarians in Romania would have merited at least as much attention in it, and that it would have been better if their situation had been considered in rather more detail."
"Although the report discusses higher education, it fails, for example, to mention the fact that higher education is privately funded from abroad, and that the Romanian state therefore makes no money available for it, or that its failure to pay anything towards higher education in Hungarian constitutes a failure to comply with the Copenhagen criteria, and one that has as a consequence the fact that, of the 6.6% of the Romanian population who constitute the Hungarian minority, only 1.6% have completed college education."
"What this means is that the education system is keeping an ethnic group, and one comprising more people than some Member States of the European Union, at the bottom of the pile."
"Let me conclude by saying that this House, in the Moscovici report, called for better protection for minorities."
"We therefore need, ‘while maintaining the principles of subsidiarity and self-government, to ensure the protection of the Hungarian minority’."
"The Romanian Parliament and Government have, so far, voted to reject the initiatives the Commission has taken to this effect; here, too, action is needed, and I ask Commissioner Rehn to use what influence he has to this end."
"– Mr President, we Greek MEPs in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats vigorously support the prospects of accession to the European Union of both Romania and Bulgaria, because we believe, among other things, that it will result in the strengthening of stability and security in southeast Europe."
"The Commission report refers to the progress made in both these countries; and a great deal of progress has been made."
"At the same time, however, it notes that delays have emerged in certain sectors."
"The battle against corruption, the reorganisation of the judicial system and guarding the borders are some of the problems which need to be resolved more quickly."
"Particular attention also needs to be given to respect for human rights and minority rights, while the situation in the orphanages and psychiatric hospitals in Romania is far from satisfactory."
"We are closely monitoring the reports by the competent bodies and hope that the necessary legislative reforms will be made more quickly."
"We also hope that Bulgaria will keep the promises it has made, especially about the nuclear power station in Kozloduy."
"However, I consider that the application of legislation – its practical application on a daily basis – is more important than its reform."
"The Commission needs to monitor this matter closely."
"I trust that these weaknesses will be rectified over the next 14 months, so that we can welcome these two countries as new members of the European Union on 1 January 2007 with open arms."
"– Mr President, I thank the Commission for its report."
"This is a very important day for Romania and Bulgaria, and I welcome the observers here today."
"It must be difficult for them, because here we are pointing out some of their faults."
"However, we do it not in a mean-spirited way but to offer them some help to improve the situation."
"I would accept the premise of the report that progress has been made by both countries but that more is required."
"I want to talk about Romania in particular and, even though others have dealt with the subject, specifically about the situation for young children, babies and adults with handicaps in institutional care."
"As Baroness Nicholson pointed out, while very good progress has been made on children’s rights – indeed, it is a model – it is disturbing that there are difficulties in practical terms."
"For example, many babies are abandoned in maternity hospitals; they cannot be put into institutions so they languish in maternity hospitals for months and, indeed, years."
"Recently, I met a toddler of 18 months in a maternity hospital."
"We need emergency fostering situations in those cases."
"In relation to young people with handicaps, there are examples of pilot projects working to close down institutions and to put up sheltered accommodation, but the implementation is erratic."
"There are huge difficulties in some counties: for example, only yesterday, some of the staff in Giurgiu County had not been paid."
"If these people are not paid, who will feed those who cannot feed themselves?"
"That is something we need to address."
"In relation to agriculture, there are huge difficulties for both countries: they need investment and modernisation, and we must assist them with that."
"The uncertainties over the financial perspective are a worry."
"I would urge Mr Blair, the President-in-Office of the Council, to come to us soon with a resolution to that."
"Overall, I am not obsessed with dates, but I am obsessed with delivery."
"What I am trying to do today is to highlight for those who do not have a voice that their issues are heard here in the European Parliament and that we will watch to ensure that we deliver for them."
"– Mr President, this House is discussing many issues, but without paying sufficient attention to the big issue, which is the European Union itself."
"What is in the interests of the European Union and its citizens?"
"Firstly, that the process of Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession, which we wholeheartedly welcome, should actually be completed successfully."
"What I object to about it is the obsession with different accession dates."
"It is of course in our interest that Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia should become Member States of the European Union before the end of the life of this Parliament, that is to say before the 2009 European elections, but whether it is to happen half a year earlier or later strikes me as less important than the actual implementation of that which constitutes the ."
"Mr Horáček is perfectly right to point out that what counts here is not what is in black and white, but what happens in reality."
"Over the coming months, the Commission, Parliament and the Council will be obliged to join with our Romanian and Bulgarian friends in observing how things actually develop in those countries, and passing judgment after they have done so, and not on the basis of this or that sentiment or resentment."
"The second important issue has to do with the Copenhagen criteria, which were devised expressly for the last round of enlargement and are supplementary to the ."
"We must not allow them to be softened up, for if they are, they will have a detrimental and dangerous effect on future enlargements."
"My third and final point is that, although we should, of course, recognise the accession of Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia as an important step, we should, once the deed is done, stop conferring candidate country status willy-nilly."
"Over the coming years, although we should, of course, hold out the prospect of eventual accession, no more countries should be recognised as candidates for it."
"South-Eastern Europe must have the prospect of membership, but the first thing we have to do for the moment is to consolidate the EU."
"Nobody, after all, stands to gain anything from joining a union at the same time as it is dissolving itself to the point of evaporation."
"What is needed, then, is the definite consolidation of this EU of ours, and Romania and Bulgaria will, without doubt, make their contribution to it."
"They are European countries, but they can make that contribution only on the basis of facts and of law."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for this excellent, high-quality debate, well worthy of this issue."
"I appreciate the responsible way in which Parliament is handling enlargement policy, and I would like to continue the close, concrete and very viable partnership we have."
"Unfortunately, I cannot answer all the numerous questions that have been put in connection with this matter."
"I hope that we will be able to continue the dialogue in the Committee, and bilaterally in the form of urgent questions and oral debate."
"I will concentrate for now on two or three of the most important questions which have come up in this discussion."
"There has been an emphasis in several of the speeches on how important it is for the legal system to function properly, and in fact the practical implementation of the legal system, which is to say the reform of the prosecution and court systems and specifically the effective adoption of these reforms, is absolutely essential for the preparations for accession."
"This is directly linked to the fight against corruption and organised crime."
"These reforms must therefore take absolute priority, be the first priority, not least because the influence they have will extend to all areas of life and society, whether it is a matter of access to health services or the corporate business environment."
"I would like generally to stress the importance of implementation with regard to legal systems as well as other areas."
"The time for devising strategies and drafting action programmes is over."
"They are in quite good shape."
"Now we need practical results: it is time for actions rather than words."
"The most challenging questions in the area of Community policy are agriculture and the treatment of animal diseases."
"Both countries need to achieve standards that guarantee food safety throughout the EU."
"Inspections at external borders also need to be improved."
"On the other hand, there are also examples of good practice in this area: the reaction of the authorities to avian flu in both Romania and Bulgaria was positive."
"It was swift, efficient and professional, and was therefore encouraging for the future."
"Some Members asked about genetically modified organisms."
"I am fully aware that genetically modified soya is grown in Romania."
"On the other hand, we have to consider that EU legislation will be applied in this area from the time of accession."
"As this soya production is not strictly on European Union soil at present, it is not a matter of contravention of EU law."
"If, at the point when Romania joins the Union, the EU has not permitted the production of genetically modified soya, Romania will simply have to obey EU legislation and destroy the soya crop."
"The Commission will be following this closely, and I can assure you that the situation will be under control."
"The monitoring mechanism that we adopted in its improved form a year ago is yielding results."
"A good example is the reform of the legal system referred to and competition and state subsidy policy in Romania."
"These have moved from the category of serious matters of concern to one where work with a clear objective is still needed."
"The Commission will continue its close monitoring of Bulgarian and Romanian preparations."
"Before the report is drafted in April or May, the Commission will undertake tours of inspection with experts from the Member States to assess the most worrying areas of dissatisfaction."
"In conclusion, I would like to say that the best service we could do Bulgaria and Romania and the citizens of these countries is to keep to the terms of accession."
"Accordingly, these reports will point out not only the progress that has been achieved but, first and foremost, the flaws that are still apparent, thus ensuring that these countries and their governments receive support for their reform policies."
"Conditionality policy therefore acts as a force to change society, and that lies at the heart of enlargement policy."
"Comparisons to football have been made in this Chamber."
"Mr Lagendijk started this and, as he thinks of himself as the incarnation of Johan Cruyff, no doubt for very good reason, I could probably say finally that, instead of a -type hedgehog defence for Bulgaria and Romania, it is now worth putting some effort into an aggressive, all-embracing soccer match in the reform policies of both countries."
"Now is not the time for passivity, but for activity and determination."
"The debate on this item is closed."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0332/2005)."
"We shall be taking a series of questions to the Commission."
"Is the Commission aware of the practical difficulties which can prevent airline passengers from exercising their new rights under Regulation (EC) No 261/2004(1), and is the Commission prepared to take any action to resolve these issues?"
"Is the Commission monitoring the implementation of the new legislation in Member States, particularly with regard to the role that the designated national bodies should play in helping passengers access their rights?"
". Madam President, the regulation cited by Mrs McAvan in fact lays down common rules for compensating and assisting passengers in the event that they are denied boarding, their flight is cancelled or they face a long delay."
"Since the regulation entered into force on 17 February 2005, the Commission has been watching closely to ensure that it is being enforced by the Member States and has been monitoring the airlines to check that they are enforcing it."
"In order to ensure that the regulation is being enforced uniformly in all parts of Europe, the European Commission has started infringement procedures against several Member States that have not yet taken the necessary steps to set the penalties to be imposed on airlines if they do not comply with the legislation in force."
"Furthermore, on the basis of the complaints that it regularly receives, the Commission has noticed certain practical difficulties in effectively implementing the regulation and in monitoring its enforcement by the Member States."
"This is particularly the case as regards the obligation placed on the national bodies to take the necessary steps to safeguard passengers’ rights and to investigate the complaints lodged."
"In this context, the Commission is currently working with the national authorities in order to arrive at a harmonised interpretation of the role that these bodies have to fulfil in terms of monitoring, and dealing with, complaints."
"– Commissioner, surely the problem with this legislation lies in the fact that it depends to a large extent on the information given to passengers, and the problem arises when there is nobody to give passengers any information."
"In June, a constituent of mine, Mrs Underwood, was stranded overnight in Alicante with her family, which included a ten-month-old baby; there was nobody there from the airline to give any information."
"In fact, they rang the airport of destination themselves, which was also unable to give her any information."
"The family had already checked in; they could not get their luggage back; there was no provision for babies nor any baby food."
"They eventually left at 4 a.m., although they were supposed to have left at 7 p.m. on the previous day."
"She wrote to the airline but was given no compensation; the national body also said that the airline had acted properly."
"We have a piece of legislation here."
"I am pleased you are going to review the role of these national bodies because, at the moment, I am not convinced that this legislation is practical and workable for citizens."
"Mrs McAvan, I have listened carefully to the example you have just given. The national bodies are there to intervene in the event of the airlines shirking their obligations."
"I have said to you, and I will repeat what I said: we did not adopt this regulation for it not to be enforced."
"Consequently, we are going to look carefully with the national authorities at the practical conditions in which these complaints are dealt with."
"As your example has clearly demonstrated, the national authorities have to fulfil the provisions laid down in the regulation precisely to avoid the need to resort to legal action to deal with airlines’ conduct."
"The spirit underlying the resolution was a desire to avoid having constantly to resort to the law."
"Thank you, Mrs McAvan, for having pointed out to us this one example, among others."
"It strengthens my determination to see this regulation enforced."
"– I welcome the Commissioner's reply."
"Some airlines seem to be doing everything they can to avoid their obligations."
"I, too, have had letters from constituents, one where the airline in a case of lost luggage said of course they would refund the items in the luggage, provided the customer could provide the original receipts."
"As if we all keep receipts for everything we buy!"
"Another airline refused compensation for a flight cancelled because of the weather, even though a rival airline was able to fly ten minutes later on the same day, from the same airport and to the same destination."
"There are numerous examples."
"Please be vigorous in chasing them up."
". I can confirm to you that the Commission has started an infringement procedure against a number of Member States."
"I note 12 Member States against which we have started an infringement procedure."
"Of course, I personally want this extra-judicial protection, which is included in the regulation and which offers Europeans a transparent and flexible solution, genuinely to be enforced."
"A meeting between the Commission and the national bodies will take place – we hope – before the end of the year."
"Our services already reply to some 500 letters a month."
"This proves that there is still work to be done, but I assure you, Mr Corbett, that I personally am paying a great deal of attention to this matter."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are airlines that make it a point of principle to set out to be taken to court."
"If you try any other approach, your complaints end up in the wastepaper basket."
"What would appear to be urgently necessary is the introduction of a sort of third-party certification, so that the refusal to pay out on the grounds of or for some other reason would have to be confirmed by a third-party organisation."
". I will repeat what I said, Mr Rübig: in each Member State, there has to be a body that is responsible for investigating complaints and, if need be, it has to impose penalties on airlines infringing this regulation."
"This needs to become a regular practice."
"Furthermore, I believe that, insofar as these complaints are handled well, the way in which they are handled will also have a deterrent effect."
"By that, I mean that airlines will increasingly be encouraged to comply with the regulation and to pay compensation, if need be, because they will know that, if they do not do this, there will be an appeal and, undoubtedly, a penalty."
"Everything comes down to enforcing this regulation."
"Madam President, I believe that that was the last question. I therefore thank Parliament for having seen fit to emphasise this point in order to make it understood that we are doing everything possible to ensure this regulation is enforced effectively."
"Following the recent ruling by the Court of First Instance regarding the takeover bid launched by the Portuguese electricity company EDP and the Italian energy company ENI for the Portuguese gas company GDP, the Competition Commissioner stated that the liberalisation of energy markets carried out in recent years must not lead to the creation of fresh monopolies, and that 'it is not acceptable for customers in one Member State to pay the price for a company to become a bigger player in other Member States'."
"In that case, does the Commission believe that there has been a sufficient increase in the number of operators in the Member States in the gas and electricity markets, or is there still a high degree of concentration?"
". The Commission believes that the degree of concentration in the energy market of many Member States is considerable."
"At the same time, energy markets have seen some new entrants in many Member States, either in the form of start-ups or through companies established in other Member States setting up subsidiaries."
"Therefore, consumer choice has increased in many parts of the Community."
"A high degree of concentration may negatively affect the level of competition in these markets."
"The price level of energy may be one indicator for this; however, it has to be borne in mind that the price of energy is also influenced by many other factors: oil, gas and coal import prices, prices of CO2 emission allowances on the carbon market, additional expenditure for the support of renewable energies, and increasing internalisation of the external cost of energy."
"That is why the Commission is monitoring the competitive dynamics of the markets at issue very carefully and why it recently launched an inquiry concerning the European energy sector."
"We await the findings of this inquiry."
"As far as energy mergers are concerned, their possible impact on the level of competition has to be evaluated on the merits of each case."
"The Commission is strongly committed to carrying out this assessment with great attention in order to protect European consumers against the risk of reduced competition and unjustified price increases."
"The Commission would like to draw the attention of the honourable Member to the fact that it is currently carrying out phase II in-depth investigations into the E.ON/MOL merger in Hungary and the DONG/E2 merger in Denmark."
"– Commissioner, I should like to thank you, first and foremost, for reiterating those principles, which are key principles."
"The fact is that the Commission’s legal inquiry into the Gas Natural/Endesa merger could – although I do not think it will – find that that this merger does not have a Community dimension and that it would in turn have to be assessed by a national competition authority, under the auspices of the government concerned."
"Against this backdrop, and in light of the Commission’s decision of 9 December to block the EDP/ENI/GDP merger, I wish to ask the Commission how it can stop a merger that has cross-border repercussions and considerable implications for competition at a time when the prevailing desire is for an integrated Iberian energy market and a more complete internal market in Europe’s energy sector."
". I can be brief, because the decision has not yet been taken."
"As soon as the decision is taken, Parliament will be informed and those closely involved with the whole dossier will of course be informed first."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is evident that, on the European Power Exchange, European electricity customers are currently being charged for the most expensive form of electricity generation, that being lignite-fired gas turbines with the highest proportion of their costs accounted for by CO2."
"Do you have any plans to carry out an investigation into the European Power Exchange on the basis of competition law in order to prevent this concentration?"
". That is an interesting question."
"I can assure you that we are aware of the importance of that aspect."
"It is one part of the inquiry into the energy sector."
"We are looking forward to the results and you will certainly be informed of the outcome."
"– Madam President, I would like to return to the issue raised by Mr Pinheiro, the Gas Natural-Endesa takeover bid."
"This takeover bid has raised serious doubts in Spain in terms of its effect on competition and on its compatibility with the Treaties."
"My question is very simple: what are the regulatory time limits for notifying an operation of this nature?"
"Has any government or any competition body of any Member State asked the Commission to intervene so far?"
"If so, when did it do so?"
". I repeat that I am trying to give a clear indication of the state of play to the honourable Members."
"The decision has not yet been taken."
"At this point, Gas Natural is of the opinion that it should be dealt with by the national competition authority in Spain."
"That depends not only on figures and on turnover but also on a number of other technical aspects, and at this stage I am unable to give you information about the final decision."
"As soon as that information is available, I promise that you will be informed."
"Mr Masip Hidalgo, which point of order do you wish to raise now?"
"– Madam President, I simply want to ask the Commissioner about this same issue again."
"That, unfortunately, is not possible."
"The rules specify that there is always one questioner and that two other Members can put supplementary questions."
"You are the third, and I cannot permit that."
"Perhaps you can sort this matter out later in a discussion with the Commissioner."
". I should like to emphasise again what the situation is today."
"There is no doubt that this is a very important matter."
"We all agree."
"Within the energy market, we have a great responsibility as a Commission for looking at competition, prices and the possibilities of a guarantee not only for today, but also for the future."
"Having taken that into account, we have to take our responsibilities and decide who has to deal with this."
"That is the situation today."
"We have not yet been able to draw the final conclusion as to whether it is a matter for the national competition authority or the Commission in Brussels."
"As soon as that has been decided, you will be informed."
"The continuous fluctuations in the stock market price of oil, due largely to speculation aimed at boosting the profits of oil companies and other speculators, are aggravating the economic situation of workers, particularly with winter approaching."
"The adverse effects of high prices are particularly evident in countries which are dependent on oil for their energy."
"What initiatives does the Commission intend to take to protect the standard of living of workers and the working classes from the adverse effects of high oil prices?"
"Does it intend to promote any special measures to supply heating oil?"
". I have taken over from my good friend, Commissioner Piebalgs."
"As you are aware, he is unable to be here today because he has to sign a very important agreement."
"The Commission is very concerned about the sharp escalation in oil prices over the last two years."
"While the impact on our economy of this increase in oil prices is currently less severe than in the 1970s, it is nonetheless having serious repercussions, particularly for our most vulnerable citizens and oil-intensive sectors."
"The Commission is actively responding to the challenge of high and volatile oil prices and is following a five-point plan in this respect."
"The main elements are: to manage our demand for energy by measures to increase energy efficiency and energy savings; to increase the use of alternative forms of energy; to improve the transparency and predictability of oil markets; to increase the supply of oil and gas by promoting an increase of investment in production and refining capacities and, finally, effectively to manage energy disruption."
"In addition, the Commission is actively increasing cooperation with the European Union’s main external oil suppliers through initiatives such as the European Union-Russia Energy Dialogue and the European Union- Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) dialogue."
"The Commission is also planning a proposal to implement an EU-coordinated system for security oil stocks."
"The Commission does not have the competence to regulate the price of crude oil or petroleum products, particularly given that the oil market is a global one."
"Nevertheless, the Commission intends to continue to work in close collaboration with all the parties concerned to increase the level of transparency in the market in order to reduce speculation."
"– Madam President, for the first half of 2005, the 70 biggest oil companies expect to make profits this year of USD 230 billion."
"In the face of this profit frenzy, the European Commission and the governments, anticipating the wave of anger from the workers about the unaccountable action of the multinational oil companies, issue warnings from time to time to the companies, which continue to reap huge profits."
"Basically, and with your reply today, it must be concluded that this is a question of collusion on the part of the European Commission, the governments in the Member States and the companies at the workers' expense."
"The governments make use of oil to increase taxes, given that every consumer, out of one euro paid for petrol, pays 70 cents in taxes, while at the same time the companies' profits are increasing."
"What specific measures does the Commission intend to take in the run-up to winter?"
". The question is quite clear: what can be done to stimulate and increase investment in alternative sources of energy or for other purposes?"
"In this respect, it is worth mentioning that some have voiced their perplexity at not seeing the authorities take measures to capture part of the oil companies’ windfall profits resulting from the latest oil price increases."
"Oil companies should behave in a responsible manner and ensure that a significant share of their profits are reinvested in increasing the capacity of the sector to cope with the growing demand, thereby laying the foundations for more reasonable prices in the future – and, by the way, creating business for themselves."
"That is, investing both in the production of crude oil and in the refining business."
"Indeed, oil and energy companies should be strongly encouraged to develop new energy sources with a view to dealing with the future scarcity of oil."
"The Commission has continued to make efforts through its contacts with the industry to increase the awareness of oil companies of the appropriateness of reinvesting part of their profits in activities that allow for more sustainable economic growth, such as the development of alternative energies and energy efficiency."
"– Madam President, the Commissioner’s work is very important and we in this Parliament would therefore like to know whether it relies on results audited and registered in companies or on creative accounting and also whether it listens to experts in its department or whether it is going to make up new theories."
". The question is a very interesting one."
"The Commission is aware of the great responsibility in the energy sector."
"I can assure you that we in the Commission, in particular Commissioner Piebalgs and myself, are aware of our great responsibility where competition policy is concerned."
"Have the Member States given a firm undertaking regarding the separate collection of waste by category?"
"What view does the Commission take of the implementation of such measures to date in the Member States, in particular regarding the collection, destruction and recycling of chemical, toxic, lubricant and radioactive wastes?"
"Does the Commission consider it necessary to heighten awareness of the problem and provide funding for measures such as the above to protect the environment and health of future European generations?"
". Madam President, the honourable lady Member has submitted a series of questions."
"The first question is the extent to which there is a binding obligation for the Member States to collect waste by category."
"The directive on hazardous waste bans the mixing of different categories of hazardous waste and the mixing of hazardous and non-hazardous waste."
"Other legislative acts of the European Union relating to specific waste flows supplement this obligation regarding the separate collection of waste."
"In addition, the Member States can take additional measures in accordance with their national policies."
"The second question is the extent to which the Commission considers that the practice, especially as regards collection, destruction and so on, is or is not successful."
"The Commission believes that more correct application of legislation is required without fail; we have major problems in the application of the legislation and it has undertaken to improve its application."
"Consequently, the policy on waste constitutes a priority sector of environmental legislation and, of course, there are directives for various waste flows, such as the directive on lubricants, the directive on batteries, which is being debated, the directive on electrical and electronic waste, the directive on end-of-life vehicles and so on, which lay down specific separation and collection and destruction methods."
"The lady Member also asked a very important question about heightening awareness; in other words, the extent to which heightening awareness and publicity help to deal with the problem."
"Of course they help, because publicity and maximum awareness-raising among citizens are important elements in finding optimum waste management solutions."
"I should also like to say that the 'polluter pays' principle must be applied as a preventive measure in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"In addition, it is the responsibility of the Member States to take the necessary measures to comply with Community legislation in the waste sector."
"Then there was a question about funding."
"The European Union funds the combating of waste; this is, in fact, one of the priorities of the Cohesion Fund."
"This funding may be provided through the European Regional Development Fund and through the Cohesion Fund and of course it concerns the disadvantaged areas and less wealthy countries of the European Union, which are entitled to the corresponding funds in order to apply the in the environmental sector."
"This aid is expected to total approximately EUR 2 billion in the period from 2000 to 2006."
"There are, of course, various other sources of finance, such as LIFE, and a new LIFE+ is in the pipeline for various actions, such as raising citizens' awareness about environmental issues, especially waste."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, my interest in the matter reflects the concerns of civil society."
"Is it possible to estimate over time, in parallel to the ecological consequences, the economic and social consequences of failing to comply with the relevant Community legislation and to find a more effective compliance procedure than that of referring the Member States to the Court of Justice of the European Communities?"
". The question is that we need other methods on the basis of which we can combat the huge problem of waste without taking recourse to the Court."
"To be honest, my greatest pleasure will be not to go to the Court and not to have procedures of this sort, but through cooperation, through awareness-raising among citizens, through better understanding and exchanges of experience by the various countries, through the application of modern technology, for us to be able to find solutions and answers to the problems which concern the various countries in the waste sector."
"Of course, I must tell you that, within the framework of the thematic strategies which the Commission is presenting at the moment, in a few days – if I remember correctly during November – we shall also present the thematic strategy on preventing, limiting and recycling waste."
"This is a particularly important strategy which is horizontal and holistic, which deals with the problem of waste as a whole and, of course, will provide answers to many of the problems which exist and which, due to disputes, often lead to the courts."
"I hope that, in this way, waste in the European Union will, firstly, be limited."
"This is the main objective; in other words, for us to produce less waste and, secondly, will be recovered and recycled and, only if these possibilities do not exist, will it either end up in incinerators, preferably with energy recovery, or in sanitary landfills, about which I should like to say, because this interests Greece in particular, that we hardly even know how many there are, while in numerous cases they even constitute a source of contamination and reduce the quality of life of citizens and, at the same time, create problems both for biodiversity and for climate change because they release methane, which is one of the gases that helps to create the greenhouse effect."
"– An example of where the Commission might assist Member States is with the introduction of the WEEE Directive in Ireland, which this year caused utter confusion and consternation because people really did not know what was happening."
"Maybe you could answer this question."
"Many people saw this as an additional cost to the consumer, yet we are being told by the government that it was not an extra charge."
"Can you clarify if this visible recycling charge which is now itemised on all our electrical goods is indeed additional and perhaps why consumers are being asked to pay VAT on top of it?"
". The problem concerns not only Ireland, but other countries of the European Union too."
"This is a very important directive that aims at collecting in the best possible way the waste from electrical and electronic equipment, either for partial re-use, recycling or safe disposal."
"Because problems exist, we are preparing guidelines that will soon be available."
"– Would the Commissioner agree that one of the best ways to manage waste is not to create it?"
"Is he aware, for example, in Ireland again, that a 5 pence – as it was then – charge on plastic bags in supermarkets in particular simply resulted in people not taking plastic bags away from supermarkets and going back home to bringing bags to supermarkets to collect goods?"
"This had a huge impact on waste management in Ireland."
"There may well be other practices in other Member States from which we could learn."
"Would the Commissioner see it as his role to benchmark for Member States best practice in other Member States so that we could use that as a resource?"
". I agree that it is best to prevent the creation of waste, and plastic bags create problems."
"It is much better to have paper bags, for example."
"Certain Member States have introduced paper bags and have banned the use of plastic bags."
"The exchange of best experience is what we are doing, trying to get best experience from various Member States."
"We organise seminars and visits to Member States to inform them of what is happening elsewhere and how they can deal in the best possible way with the various environmental problems, giving them guidance and sometimes even financing for eligible projects."
"Will the Commission now reach a speedy decision on infringement proceedings against the UK for breach of the Urban Waste Water Directive due to overflows of raw sewage into the River Thames?"
"Is it aware that the UK regulator, the Environment Agency, ‘believes that most of the combined sewer overflows do not meet the requirements of the UWWTD’?"
"What view does the Commission take of the fact that the UK Department for Environment (DEFRA) refuses to release the legal advice given to the Thames Tideway Strategic Study which brings together the various agencies?"
"Will the Commission help London avoid the embarrassment that this pollution scandal, if not resolved, will cause to the 2012 Olympics, both to water sports and because the proposed athletes’ village will overlook the overflow at Abbey Mills with its associated smells and unsightly mess?"
". The Commission is aware of the concerns raised by the honourable Member with regard to sewer overflows into the River Thames."
"A number of complaints were registered following events in August 2004, which saw large quantities of untreated raw sewage entering the Thames."
"The Commission has drawn the attention of the United Kingdom authorities to these concerns in a letter of formal notice issued under Article 226 of the European Community Treaty, which was sent in March 2005."
"The letter of formal notice stressed the need for Member States to ensure the adequacy of their collecting and treatment systems under the Council Directive concerning urban waste water treatment."
"A reply has been received from the United Kingdom, and this is currently being assessed."
"That assessment is being carried out together with that of cases raising similar concerns about excessive storm water overflows in other parts of the United Kingdom."
"If I remember correctly, two are in England and one is in Scotland."
"The Commission hopes to be in a position to decide what steps to take next in this matter before the end of the year."
"The Commission is unable to comment on the legal advice given by the UK Department for Environment referred to by the honourable Member, as it was not aware that such advice existed or that access to it had been refused."
"– The last comment was very interesting and one that I should like to follow up."
"The Environment Agency, which is the UK regulator, believes that there is a breach of the directive."
"Could I just say to the Commissioner that it is not just a matter of storm overflows: it does not need unusually heavy rainfall to have these outflows; they happen on average once a week."
"Only one of the 57 outflows is screened and so I have to leave to your imagination the sewage solids that go into the river."
"I am particularly worried about the run-up to the 2012 Olympics."
"For water sports and for the image of London, this is a terrible situation, and the athletes’ village will overlook one of these overflows."
"I am amazed that the UK Government, as well as the Mayor of London, is content to put up with that situation."
". I shall do whatever I can within my remit, which is to see that the requirements of the directive are met."
"Of course, I shall work with you in order to help London, as you stressed in your question, avoid the embarrassment that this pollution from overflows of raw sewage would cause to the 2012 Olympics."
"It is interesting to know that, if the problem is not resolved by then, the site of the proposed athletes’ village will overlook the overflow at Abbey Mills, with its associated smells and unsightly mess."
"It cannot be ruled out that athletes may be allowed to practise on the Thames or that events may take place on the river itself."
"The Commission is unable to take a position on the arrangements being made in London for the 2012 Olympics."
"I must repeat that our only involvement is to ensure that the requirements of the directive concerning urban waste water treatment are met."
"You are right to say that these spills occurred not only during the very heavy rainfall in August 2004."
"According to an Environment Agency press release, these spills occur about 50 to 60 times a year."
"The Environment Agency, which is an adviser to the UK Government, has also reached the conclusion that the system of collection and treatment is inadequate."
"There were some suggestions on how to solve this problem."
"One was an interceptor tunnel underneath the river Thames, which would be about 20 miles long and would take about ten years to construct."
"The Directive on Urban Waste Water Treatment is a results-based directive and so it is not my business to suggest what method the British Government should choose to solve the problem."
"That is a matter for the Government."
"But there is a problem and we have therefore started infringement proceedings against the United Kingdom."
"In December we will see whether we should proceed with the reasoned opinion in order to persuade the United Kingdom authorities to take the appropriate measures to carry out the infrastructure works necessary in order to treat the water in an acceptable way."
"My final point is that, if untreated sewage is discharged into the river, then the Thames estuary, which is an important wetland, will be endangered."
"Recently, the situation in the area of Ano Liosia has become unbearable owing to the accumulation of thousands of tonnes of sewage sludge transported to the landfill site there from Psyttalia."
"As a report by the local authorities of Western Attica points out, cracks have appeared in the embankment surrounding the site where the sludge has been deposited, with liquid waste flowing from one particular point and lying stagnant in a natural hollow in the ground."
"In a previous answer (E-1728/05), the Commission said that it would examine the matter in close contact with the Greek authorities."
"Could the Commission say what the present situation is in regard to the treatment of sewage sludge and the works at Psyttalia?"
"Could the Commission also say whether it has completed its examination of the Greek authorities' answer (in accordance with the answer to Question P-0916/05) to the reasoned opinion which it set out in respect of the contravention of the directives on waste and urban waste water treatment, and what are its conclusions?"
". Madam President, Mr Papadimoulis has tabled several questions on this issue and I am always in the happy or unhappy position of replying."
"The Psyttalia station has been operating fully since December 2004 and takes care of third-level treatment of urban sewage discharged into the sensitive area of the Saronic Gulf."
"During the construction and upgrading of the station, complaints were submitted to the Commission about the handling of the sludge – the sewage sludge – produced."
"In October 2002, the Commission instituted infringement proceedings against Greece in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty, on the basis of the fact that the Greek authorities had not made provision for the disposal of the sewage sludge in a manner which was compatible with Community environmental legislation."
"The infringement proceedings brought about results, in that in August 2003 the Greek authorities finally decided to construct a drying unit on the island of Psyttalia, at which the sludge would be converted to solid matter of adequate calorific value for subsequent incineration in suitable installations."
"There are similar applications in other European countries."
"It should be emphasised that, in December 2004, the Commission decided to cofinance the project within the framework of the Cohesion Fund."
"The project must be completed by the end of 2007."
"This is expected to resolve definitively the problem of sewage sludge management."
"However, despite all these positive developments, there is still the problem of the management of the sewage sludge already stored on the island and of the sewage sludge which will be produced on a daily basis until the proposed drying unit is commissioned."
"One solution is to transport large quantities of untreated sewage sludge by ship and lorry to the sanitary landfill site in Ano Liosia, on the mainland outside Athens."
"However, this solution presents certain environmental problems: possible contamination of the waters due to the discharge of sewage sludge into the sea, repercussions due to emissions from the transportation of waste over a distance of 21 kilometres through a densely populated area and danger of contamination due to spillage of waste during transportation."
"In addition, the disposal of the treated sewage sludge in the sanitary landfill site at Ano Liosia is considered to be a factor which will lead to the saturation of the site."
"Consequently, the Commission considers the method of disposal of the sludge referred to above to be incompatible with Community environmental legislation."
"The national authorities are responsible for the selection and implementation of a suitable method for the temporary treatment of the sewage sludge, pending the completion of the proposed drying unit."
"The Commission is evaluating the temporary solution proposed by the Greek authorities, a sort of soilification procedure, in conjunction with the operation of the sanitary landfill site at Ano Liosia and, if necessary, it will not, of course, hesitate to institute judicial proceedings against Greece, because this is required not only by Community legislation, but also by the need to protect citizens' health and the environment."
"Within the framework of its powers, the Commission is taking – and shall continue to take – all the necessary measures in order to safeguard compliance by the Member States with Community legislation."
"– Commissioner, the Greek authorities, as you know, have promised to stop the unsuccessful transportation and soilification of the sewage sludge in Ano Liosia in December."
"Does the Commission know if this promise will be kept and what alternative solution is being proposed?"
"In Greece, we hear various rumours without there being any official information."
"Perhaps you can enlighten us?"
"Have you examined and evaluated this famous alternative post-December solution which is a secret from the Greeks?"
"Finally, the contractor for drying the sewage sludge in Psyttalia has still not been selected, even though it is two years since August 2003."
"Do you believe that the deadlines set by the Commission will be kept?"
". To be honest, the minister has not told me what the solution is that has been promised for the end of the year."
"I assume that, if that is what he says, he has something in mind and, of course, a minister and a government do not make this sort of promise unless they have something specific; in other words, a planned method of disposing of the sewage sludge during the period up to 2007 when the drying unit on the island of Psyttalia will be finished."
"The problem, therefore, is in the interim period and what will happen with the sewage sludge which is currently being dumped at the Ano Liosia landfill using a partial soilification procedure, which is at the pilot stage at present, whereby the material produced can be used either to cover the landfill or to reinforce the ground in certain areas."
"Of course, I repeat that the way in which the sludge is transported through a densely populated area to the landfill is not right."
"That is why the government, from December onwards, as announced, will have an alternative solution which undoubtedly, I too believe, will be much better from an environmental point of view."
"– Madam President, the Commission is an important institutional factor, both in the lawmaking process on environmental issues and in the sanctions process on infringement issues."
"It is quite right to be strict within the framework of this institutional sanctions chain."
"However, I have a feeling that there is a contradiction between strictness, between being justifiably strict on issues of infringement of European environmental legislation, and the acceptance of acceptable waste management standards."
"The Community bureaucracy, the Commission bureaucracy should indicate waste management standards in a strict and binding manner."
"It has huge technical know-how, it has experience, and methods should not be left to the discretion of the Member States."
"In other words, we should move to acceptable European waste management standards."
". I should like to start by referring to how strict or less strict we are."
"In particular for Greece and for me, what I can say is that I am neither more nor less strict with the country of which I am a national."
"I try to be objective and to do what is needed in order to protect the health of the citizens in the European Union and, of course, in Greece, and to protect the ecosystems and the environment."
"Consequently, we deal objectively and with an effort to improve conditions for health and the environment and questions of recourse to the Court and, I repeat, I always try to ensure we avoid going to the Court and find other ways of dealing with issues."
"The honourable Member said that the Commission should have even more competences and should indicate specific methods."
"What I can say to you is that, depending on the conditions which apply in each country, the best method is applied."
"The method of waste management in northern Europe is not the same as the method in southern Europe or in one country in relation to another or even in areas within the same country."
"There are reasons why one country prefers incineration and recycling and another country prefers landfill in order to reinforce the ground and, of course, our basic objective is always to try to prevent the creation of waste."
"On the specific question of Psyttalia, the European Union has intervened in the financing of the first project, which was third-level treatment of waste, and now the drying unit."
"That being so, as for what happens about the problem created by the Greek Government by collecting all this sewage sludge on the island, that is not the European Union's business to say what should be done with this sewage sludge."
"It is a problem which was created by neglecting to build the drying unit at the right time, ten years ago, with the result that all this sludge has collected."
"However, it is not our job to say what should be done with this sewage sludge and how the government should address the problem."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, does the Commission know whether all the Member States have transposed the Community environmental legislation in force on the treatment of waste, whether they have incorporated it into their legislation and whether they are applying it properly?"
"Does it know whether all the States are doing so?"
". There are differences between the various Member States."
"Most of the legislation has been transposed, but not all."
"I cannot list just now which countries have transposed all and which only some of the legislation, but we are trying to work closely with the authorities in each country on its transposition."
"We send teams of experts, often legal experts, and we use the IMPEL system in order to encourage and facilitate the transposition of the environmental legislation in general and the waste legislation in particular."
"As the speaking time allotted to this subject is exhausted, Questions 53 to 59 will be answered in writing(2)."
"In a question submitted in August, P-3040/05, regarding the ICJ ruling on the Separation Wall in Eastern Jerusalem, I asked the Commission to outline a 'concrete plan to fulfil its own obligations...under the ruling of 9 July 2004'. The Commission re-stated the EU position on this issue and claimed that 'dialogue is seen as the most effective way to make known one's views'."
"The ruling articulates erga omnes obligations 'to see to it that any impediment, resulting from the construction of the Wall, to the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end,' which clearly require more than a mere expression of views."
"Moreover, the fact that the Wall is still under construction today indicates that political dialogue has proved wholly inadequate in ensuring Israeli compliance with international law."
"Can the Commission explain what other tools are at its disposal to ensure compliance and, objectively and transparently, indicate under what circumstances it would use them in the fulfilment of its own obligations?"
". The European Union will continue to collaborate very closely with the international partners in the Quartet, as well as with its partners in the region, working with both sides to restore the political process and return to the roadmap."
"We believe that dialogue with Israel within the framework of the political arrangements set out, on the one hand, in the association agreement and, on the other hand, in the European Neighbourhood Policy is the most effective way to impress upon the national authorities the Union’s concerns regarding respect for human rights and international law."
"The threat of sanctions, and the suspension of any part of the association agreement, is likely, we think, to diminish rather than bolster the Union’s ability to bring its influence to bear on Israel."
"In this critical period following Israel’s disengagement from Gaza and parts of the West Bank that we and the whole international community wholeheartedly welcome, the Union has agreed to help provide very strong support for the reconstruction of the Palestinian infrastructure and institutions and to promote economic reform and governance."
"Thus, we think that improving the life and lives of the Palestinians is the best way to stabilise the situation in Gaza and to further the prospects for peace."
"The Commission remains committed to that end."
"– Commissioner, thank you for your response."
"Of course, I endorse what you say, but we must recognise that, despite early optimism after Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, the picture today is much bleaker than hoped."
"Only last week, Israel broke off diplomatic ties with the Palestinian Authority after three young settlers were killed; these are the real politics of that region and are the things that we must concentrate on."
"What I ask, in specific terms, is how does the Commission plan to bring Israel and the Palestinian Authority back to the negotiating table, and ensure that those early feelings of optimism are not entirely wasted?"
". I can tell you that we are working very closely in the Quartet, which has a special envoy, Mr James Wolfensohn, with whom I am in very close contact."
"What we want to do is to bring the two parties together on the different points."
"These include the ‘six plus three points’ identified by Mr Wolfensohn."
"The parties have not yet found a consensus on all of these."
"There is the Rafah crossing and the link between Gaza and the Left Bank; there are the greenhouses and many other issues."
"I was in Washington last week, along with President Barroso."
"I saw President Bush and Condoleezza Rice."
"We spoke about that."
"I saw Mr Wolfensohn before that meeting."
"At this stage we want to follow these events very closely."
"We have also said in a communication that we are even ready to double the means that we have been giving to the Palestinians this year, if both parties make progress and other donors participate."
"– Commissioner, your comments about the activities of the Quartet and the offer to increase aid to Palestine are all very welcome."
"However, I wonder if you would agree that the long-term security of Israel and the Middle East will be guaranteed by making Israel more integrated with its neighbours to ensure that trade and movement between the neighbours develop."
"Will you use the Barcelona process to try to encourage Israel and its neighbours to see communication between them as a solution and not as a threat to their security?"
". I completely agree that the long-term perspective has to be one where Israel can work in peace with all its neighbours: above all with a Palestinian state, as set out in the roadmap, but also with all its other neighbours."
"I will also go to Barcelona, where we are working specifically towards a new set-up for the next ten years, trying to focus more on education, on cooperation in the economic and commercial fields – not only with the Agadir process, which is a south-south process, but also as a whole, meaning investment, agriculture products, and high-level products and services – and on the question of democracy and human rights."
"Indeed, I am travelling around many countries, trying to stimulate them to do more and to implement the action plans we have at the moment."
"– Many EU citizens who travel to Israel are exposed to very brutal and degrading treatment, especially if they are of Arab origin or if they show active solidarity with democratic development in Palestine."
"Recently, a young Swedish woman who travelled to Israel was subjected to very violent treatment."
"Her life was threatened by the Israeli border soldiers, and she was refused entry in the most brutal ways because she had worked for a democratic and free Palestine."
"In your dealings with the Israelis, are you addressing the issue of how they treat EU citizens entering Israel?"
". If cases such as this are brought to us, we will of course give them our attention."
"I was not previously acquainted with this case, but it goes without saying that human rights – those of every traveller as much as of every other person – must be upheld everywhere."
"As the author is not present, Question No 61 lapses."
"What specific strategy is the Commission employing with a view to stepping up EU cooperation with the three States of the South Caucasus and with the States bordering on the Caspian Sea?"
". With regard to the South Caucasus and the states bordering the Caspian Sea, this region and its development have become increasingly important issues since enlargement."
"I am therefore very happy to say that this has now been included in our Neighbourhood Policy."
"This was done last June and since then we have been preparing proposals for draft action plans with each of the three countries concerned."
"The partner countries themselves are developing their own priorities for such action plans."
"The Commission will start consultations on those action plans very soon."
"An EU troika is visiting the region as we speak, from 24 to 28 October, and its assessment will indeed be very helpful as we start our discussions."
"Strengthening democracy, the rule of law, improving business and the investment climate for sustainable economic development, and encouraging people-to-people contacts are matters of utmost importance."
"These are key EU priorities for the whole region."
"Further priorities under the ENP include regional cooperation and conflict settlement."
"The EC countries will, in the meantime, provide substantial support to the partner countries of the South Caucasus region and, by way of example, I could cite our deep involvement in the reform of the judiciary in Azerbaijan and Georgia, our support for institutional, legal and administrative reform in Armenia, or our rehabilitation efforts in those parts of Georgia especially affected by frozen conflicts, such as South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"We also hope to encourage greater cooperation between and with the countries bordering the Caspian Sea."
"Let me give just a few examples."
"We regard the process of EU-Black Sea/Caspian Basin energy and transport cooperation, launched at the Baku ministerial meeting late last year, as a very important vehicle for encouraging broader regional cooperation."
"We are also giving due attention to the environmental situation in and around the Caspian Sea, because it is the largest saltwater lake in the world but also one of the richest oil reserves."
"So this is a region that will be an increasing focus of our attention under the Neighbourhood Policy."
"– Thank you, Commissioner, for that very good and exhaustive reply."
"I would like to put a supplementary question: you have already referred to one of the two problems specific to the region, namely energy and the minorities, which brings in its train expulsion, separation and much else."
"What I would like to know is whether the Commission or the European institutions are still planning to hold a conference devoted specifically to the energy problems, and, secondly, whether you are giving specific attention to the issues relating to minorities, particularly in Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia?"
". As I have already hinted, I can tell the honourable Member that energy policy does indeed, and naturally so, play a very major role and that we are at least open to the idea of more conferences being held."
"I am unable to say whether my fellow-Commissioner Mr Piebalgs is planning another conference in the immediate future, but I can say that we are keeping a very close eye on developments, which are, of course, becoming more and more important."
"What this means is that this will be an ongoing issue for the Commission throughout its term of office."
"Turning to the subject of minorities, these issues are dealt with by the OSCE, with which we are working quite closely."
"I myself chaired the OSCE in the year 2000, and took these matters very seriously."
"The European Union will continue to monitor these issues as part of the action plans that have yet to be negotiated."
"As democracy and human rights always have a prominent place in these, minority rights fit into them as well."
"– Madam President, I should like to ask the Commissioner something about Georgia."
"Over recent years, this country has seen significant changes, by which I mean reforms relating to democracy, the economy and human rights."
"It is well known that Georgia is making certain efforts towards moving closer to the EU."
"How do you assess its chances of accession at some future date?"
". Mr Paleckis, the neighbourhood policy has now, so to speak, brought these states, like all other countries in the Caucasus, close to the European Union for the first time."
"What that means is that the neighbourhood policy quite deliberately refrains from addressing the issue of membership of the European Union."
"That is never, of course, generally prejudicial to future developments, but it is quite essential that Georgia, and its two neighbours Armenia and Azerbaijan as well, should now do everything in their power to push through reforms on the domestic front."
"That is quite essential, and much that will bring them closer to the European Union still remains to be done."
"We regard these countries as future important friends, and will, to some degree, be prepared – provided that they carry out these reforms – to include them in the internal market and to open up options for them in the spheres of energy, transport and education policy."
"We do, of course, also expect these countries to give priority to action in relation to democratisation, the rule of law, and the prevention of corruption and many other scourges that currently afflict them."
"Is the Commission aware of the difficulties with EU funding in Tunisia?"
"Tunisia is a target country of the EIDHR and one of the MEDA partners which receives significant financial assistance for economic/social actions, human rights and democracy development."
"The Commission is, no doubt, aware that the grants awarded by the EU to various NGOs, targeted in democracy-building and training projects, have been frozen by the Tunisian authorities without any proper explanation."
"No progress has since been observed in the release of EU funds."
"Parliament's Resolution on Tunisia of 29 September 2005 urges the Council and Commission to improve the management of projects under the MEDA programme and EIDHR and to work out the appropriate measures to be taken if no progress is observed in the release of blocked funds."
"What specific plans has the Commission drawn up, and what tangible steps have been taken to improve this situation?"
"Does the Commission think that it should review the amount of financial grants to Tunisia (both under MEDA and EIDHR), bearing in mind that part of such funding has not reached its recipients and target?"
". I can tell you that of course we are aware of difficulties and obstacles to the European Union, especially the funding of civil society activities in Tunisia."
"We are devoting a great deal of attention to trying to resolve these issues."
"I myself have just visited Tunisia, on 12 and 13 October, and I took the opportunity to raise these issues with all the people I spoke to: the Prime Minister, the Minister for Cooperation and International Development and the Minister for Foreign Affairs."
"I have also met civil society representatives in Tunisia, notably the associations that are encountering difficulties in receiving support from the European Union, the Tunisian League of Human Rights and the Association of Women for Research and Development."
"I must say I strongly encouraged the Tunisian authorities to rapidly unblock the four projects that are still currently blocked, representing a total of EUR 143 000."
"I have also made it clear that the problems with the implementation of our civil society and governance projects will have very negative consequences for our future financial cooperation with Tunisia."
"I hope that these talks will have an effect and that we will be able to unblock the projects very soon."
"The future financial envelope for partners including Tunisia will, of course, specifically take account of progress on the current projects."
"– Thank you, Commissioner, for your explanation."
"I also visited Tunisia last month and that is why I put this question, but I would like to say that personally I would like to see more energy and precision in your reply – since the questions were sufficiently precise – what specific measures?"
"In Tunisia talks were held and there was the feeling that those in power appeared rather dismissive of the European Union’s capacity to influence human rights conditions in talks with Tunisia."
"That is why I would like to see more energetic action from the European Union."
". Mr Kristovskis, I have just stated that I myself was very much involved."
"It is not just a case of my staff constantly having dealt with these issues and addressed these questions at every level; we have also made it perfectly clear that, if these projects are blocked and cannot be completed shortly, then there will be no funding for them."
"That means that there very definitely are conditions attached."
"As the speaking time allotted to this subject is exhausted, Questions Nos 64 to 72 will be answered in writing(3)."
"Questions Nos 73, 74 and 78 lapse, as the authors are not present."
"The previous fisheries agreement with Morocco provided for sponge fishing possibilities for five Greek vessels."
"These possibilities were not fully utilised in the past but, during negotiations on the new agreement, Greece requested the allocation of possibilities for a few vessels which expressed a genuine interest."
"However, the final text of the agreement does not provide for any such possibility."
"Can sponge fishing possibilities be incorporated in future within the new agreement and under what conditions?"
". The Commission negotiated the new fisheries partnership agreement with Morocco, which was initialled on 28 July."
"The agreement follows the new partnership format which the Community has developed for relations with third countries in the field of fisheries."
"This new approach includes, among others, a clear commitment from the Commission side to promote the general principles of conservation and sustainable management of fishery resources."
"The new agreement paves the way for a permanent policy dialogue on fisheries between the European Community and Morocco and envisages initiatives and measures in support of responsible fisheries policy."
"The previous fisheries agreement with Morocco, which covered the period 1995-99, did indeed provide for fishing possibilities for sponge fishing."
"In fact, it included the provision of five licences, which were never used."
"The new agreement establishes different categories of fishing possibilities for Community fishing vessels, covering a total of 119 fishing vessels and a quota of 60 000 tonnes for industrial pelagic fisheries."
"The Commission is well aware of the Greek interest in sponge fishing, since, as part of the preparations for the negotiations on a new fisheries partnership agreement with Morocco, Greece pointed out on several occasions its interest in including sponge fishing in the new agreement."
"During the negotiations, the Commission took account of the Greek interest and presented to the Moroccan side a request to include sponge fishing in the agreement."
"Unfortunately, however, at this stage, sponge fishing cannot be covered in the agreement."
"The scientific evaluations available do not provide sufficient data with respect to sponge fishing to allow us to cover this type of fishing in the agreement."
"However, were a favourable scientific assessment of sponge stocks to become available in the future, the Commission could propose to the Moroccan side the inclusion of this type of fishing in the agreement."
"This inclusion could take the form of a decision of the joint committee that is provided for in Article 10 of the agreement."
"Having said that, I wish to emphasise that both the Community and Morocco have agreed to the possibility of carrying out certain experimental fisheries under Article 5 of the Protocol."
"In this context, experimental sponge fishing can be envisaged."
"Experimental campaigns could facilitate the preparation of a scientific assessment of sponge resources in the Moroccan fishing zone."
"– Commissioner, your reply, as it comes from a person with a great deal of sensitivity, partially satisfies me."
"However, what I should like to emphasise is that we believe in the sustainability of the sea, which is why we feel that the five fishing vessels we are asking for is a very small number of vessels which will not cause any imbalance."
"We are therefore asking, as you promised, for you to speed up your scientific studies so that they can continue to fish for sponges, because otherwise these family businesses will close."
". Let me say first of all that we will be looking into establishing experimental fisheries under Article 5 of the protocol."
"That would provide scope for an almost immediate assessment of the state of health of sponge stocks within the areas covered by the agreement with Morocco."
"Once we have a scientific evaluation of the state of health of the stocks, then we will negotiate with Morocco the inclusion of this type of fishery in the agreement."
"In fact, there is an understanding with Morocco to this effect."
"I will see to it that the experimental fisheries and scientific evaluation are carried out as early as possible."
"– Madam President, if an honourable colleague has been unfortunately delayed and is not in the Chamber for his or her question, but then arrives three questions later – there are, after all, very few colleagues present – would you, in your personal capacity, please take question number 72?"
"I cannot do that, as we have strict rules on Question Time and each Commissioner is allotted 20 minutes."
"I would have been quite happy to take the honourable Member’s question to which you refer, were it not for the fact that it is intended for Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, who is no longer here, and so your question will be one of those answered in writing."
"Given the continued threat to salmon stocks in European waters, and given the action that several European Union Member States have taken to counteract the further depletion of this species in Europe's waters, notably by prohibiting or discouraging the use of driftnets, what is the European Commission's view of those Member States which continue to allow the use of driftnets in their waters, and what measures does it propose in order to put an end to this practice in European waters?"
". The Commission and the Member States are following closely all the particularities of the management of salmon stocks, an important element of which is the regulation of salmon fisheries at sea, ensuring a sufficient number of returning salmon reach the spawning grounds upstream."
"No less important are the regulation of river and estuarial fisheries and the maintenance of rivers in good ecological condition to ensure appropriate spawning success and the survival and growth of young salmon."
"But other aspects fall outside the direct competence of the common fisheries policy."
"An important drawback of the management of salmon fisheries at sea is that these do not target single stocks of salmon."
"In fact, salmon caught in these fisheries can belong to a mixture of stocks in unpredictable proportions."
"Another important aspect of these fisheries is that they are deeply rooted in the tradition of coastal communities of fishermen and their consequent social importance."
"The challenge is then to establish a balance between the conditions by which fishing may be allowed to continue and to ensure that such fishing does not undermine the sustainability of stocks in need of recovery."
"Member States with sea salmon fisheries have developed management strategies to address that difficult problem."
"Measures taken range from total prohibition to the regulation of fishing gear, in order to target better the stocks of salmon in good condition and preserve those in need of recovery."
"The Commission has undertaken to review the situation and examine the success of these management strategies and subsequently report to the Council and to Parliament."
"This work is in progress and will be completed during the coming weeks."
"Following the result of the above-mentioned report and the discussion both with the European institutions and with other stakeholders, the Commission will consider proposing management measures within the framework of the common fisheries policy."
"With regard to the reference made by the honourable Member to the use of driftnets, the Commission should clarify that the salmon driftnet fishery within the Irish 12-mile limit is not covered by the 1998 ban on the use of driftnets for highly migratory species such as tuna."
"The Commission would also add that the question at stake refers to stock management issues but does not directly relate to the type of gear concerned."
"It should therefore not be confused with the 1998 prohibition on the use of driftnets because of cetacean by-catch and which, in the Atlantic area of interest, applies only to the catching of tuna and some tuna-like species."
"The decision taken by the Council last year, with the full support of the European Parliament, for a progressive phasing-out and a total ban on using driftnets in the Baltic Sea as from 1 January 2008, which shall apply without any distinction on target fish species, including salmon, is aimed at protecting the extremely endangered population of harbour porpoise that remains in the Baltic Sea."
"– Thank you for that answer."
"You will be aware that in Ireland there is a great deal of debate about driftnetting and whether we should introduce a compulsory or voluntary buy-out of driftnets."
"You said we need to get the balance right, do you think we have the right balance at the moment between management practices and preserving our stocks?"
"I am interested in your review."
"Can you be more specific as to when it will be available and will it make firm recommendations?"
"We need to protect salmon stocks, which are in grave danger in Irish waters, and there are economic consequences arising from that."
". With regard to your point on the right balance, the Commission has undertaken to carry out a review of the situation and to examine the success of the management strategies in order to see whether the balance is right between sustainability and the continuation of traditional fisheries for salmon."
"The study will be completed by the end of October, which is next week."
"We will be looking at the results of this study and then coming to Parliament and the Council with our own proposals in order to see to it that there is proper management of these fisheries."
"– I come from Scotland."
"As you may know, Scottish wild salmon is the best in the world."
"We are worried about the future of salmon stocks."
"You give a very factual and clear answer in terms of the current situation, but I should like to ask you personally, as Commissioner: do you feel that driftnets, with their indiscriminate catch, can continue to be used in European waters?"
"Has the time not come to end the use of driftnets in fishing?"
"."
"It is very difficult to make a blanket statement; obviously we have a ban on driftnets with a very large span because of the negative effect they can have on the sustainability of fish and their impact on bycatch cetaceans."
"There we have a total ban on the use of driftnets."
"With driftnets that are much smaller in size and where there is no risk of cetacean by-catches, the Commission’s position is more open."
"If, on the basis of scientific study, it can be concluded that driftnets do not create undue pressures on the sustainability of salmon or any other fish stocks and there is no risk of by-catches of cetaceans, then we take a more open approach."
"That is why, because of the reports and criticism in Ireland, we have commissioned the study to see what the situation is and how the management of the stock is proceeding."
"If we see that there are undue pressures on sustainability then we will take the necessary remedial action."
"Perhaps it is somewhat misleading to point the finger at one particular type of net."
"There could be other types of net that are not classified as driftnets but that, in particular circumstances, could have an even more negative impact on the sustainability of fisheries."
"Therefore the task of the Commission is to restore sustainable fisheries where they do not exist and where we are fishing sustainably – which is the exception, not the rule – to maintain sustainability."
"Fishermen who use traditional, environmentally sound fishing equipment (as is the case with Almeria's long-line fleet) are in a serious plight: they are the victims of unfair competition from certain vessels (French and Italian ones in particular) which use the banned though much cheaper drift nets and at the same time they suffer on account of the environmental damage caused by such practices, which result in a 40% reduction in catches."
"The rogue vessels are not pursued in any way by the authorities of the countries to which they belong indeed, some governments even make changes to their internal law which enable Community rules to be circumvented."
"Is the Commission using all available means (including legal remedies) in order to force the Member States in question to ensure that their fishing vessels comply with the relevant Council regulation?"
". It is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure effective control, inspection and enforcement of the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy, which include a prohibition on the use of driftnets targeting highly migratory species."
"It is, on the other hand, the responsibility of the Commission to evaluate and monitor Member States' compliance with this obligation."
"For a number of years, the Commission has monitored Member States closely to ensure they are taking the necessary measures for proper control and enforcement of the driftnet prohibition."
"Although in the Atlantic the situation has proved to be satisfactory, in the Mediterranean serious problems persist."
"The last inspections carried out by Commission inspectors this summer confirmed that driftnets were currently being used in Italy, France and Spain."
"The Commission has already launched infringement proceedings against these Member States."
"Reasoned opinions were addressed to Italy and France and a letter of formal notice to Spain."
"The opinions and the letter from the Commission challenged the lack of proper control and enforcement by the competent authorities of the Member States concerned as regards the prohibition on driftnets."
"The Commission is also examining closely, on the basis of the information at its disposal, national legislation which is not, or seems not to be, in conformity with the Community probation on driftnets."
"To cite an example, in the infringement procedure against France the Commission challenged the compatibility with Community legislation of a French decree allowing the use by French fishermen of the thonaille, a driftnet targeting bluefin tuna."
"This legislation was recently annulled by the French Conseil d´État, which, in its decision, used the same arguments as the Commission had used in its reasoned opinion."
"I would also like to stress that, although the Commission is aware of the assertion that Almeira's surface longliner fleet has suffered a 40% reduction in catches, as stated by the honourable Member, there is no scientific evidence that such a reduction has actually occurred and that this is caused by the unfair competition attributable to non-Spanish fleets."
"Representatives of the Spanish fleet concerned have been asked to provide the data to support their allegation."
"In any case, I can confirm that the Commission will take all necessary steps in accordance with the rules of the EC Treaty and of the Common Fisheries Policy to ensure that Member States comply with the Community legislation prohibiting driftnets."
"– Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his sincerity."
"It is clearly well-known, as the Commissioner has demonstrated very well, that driftnets are still being used in the Mediterranean."
"The fishermen who conform to the Regulation have a sense that they are not being protected, but there is something more serious than all of that."
"It has come to light this summer that, of 37 vessels found with driftnets prohibited by ecological organisations, 18 had already received subsidies for their restructuring."
"I do not believe that this problem can be left solely in the hands of the Member States."
"I believe that the Commission must act and it has done so in relation to certain States, but that is clearly insufficient."
"We cannot allow non-compliance with the Regulation and we cannot allow certain practices to take place while subsidies are being paid."
"We are eagerly awaiting a response to their comments."
". Firstly, I wish to underline the fact that the whole question of control and enforcement is the primary responsibility of the Member States."
"If the Commission receives information that there might be a breach of the i.e. of the regulations concerning the common fisheries policy, then it will investigate whether the Member States are effecting controls."
"The Commission carries out enquiries and it is as a result of these enquiries that infringement proceedings are initiated against Member States."
"This is exactly what has happened with regard to the infringement proceedings against France, Italy and Spain."
"It is important to underline that we were hoping to have the Mediterranean regulation adopted in the Council last month."
"This would have included a definition of driftnets, which are banned by the 1988 regulation."
"Unfortunately, the Council did not adopt this regulation last September."
"We will be trying our luck again soon, in the hope that we can secure a long overdue regulation governing fisheries in the Mediterranean, which would give the Commission increased powers to ensure that fisheries are carried out properly and within the limits of sustainability."
"Since the time allotted to Question Time has elapsed, Questions Nos 79 to 126 will be answered in writing.(4)"
"That concludes Question Time."
"That is exactly what we have done, and we have come to the conclusion that it is our firm belief that the human body and all of its parts are not patentable, since their functioning is not a human invention, but rather a discovery, and, as such, not patentable. This applies just as much to embryos, stem cells, germ cells and the genome, on which we cannot claim right of ownership."
"Although, in the second 16C report, the Commission is right to state that the totipotent stem cells are not patentable, it remains vague about the patentability of pluripotent stem cells."
"These are also parts of the human body and are, in accordance with Article 5 (1) of the directive, excluded from patents."
"The patent that has fuelled this debate concerns human gametes."
"The fact that this patent has been granted flies in the face of the principle that the human body and the parts thereof are not patentable."
"It would be preferable if the groups were able to spell this out more clearly and unequivocally, particularly in the common resolution."
"Parliament should take its monitoring task seriously."
"This means lodging a firm objection with the European Patent Office."
"– Mr President, I should like to say to the Commissioner that it is not good enough to come up with grand policy statements setting out our ethical position on European values if, when a clear, specific challenge to those values is brought to light, we just say timidly that it might be an infringement."
"The European Patent Office has granted Edinburgh University a patent, number 125 7167, covering human cells. It also, ironically, involves a process of sex selection, at a time when we in Europe have firmly committed ourselves to the principle of non-discrimination on the basis of sex."
"This resolution is important, because there is not much time left for us to register our objection to help strike down this patent. I therefore ask my colleagues to vote for this resolution and Mr Blokland’s amendment."
". – Mr President, personally speaking, I believe that organised crime is the cancer of our society and, like cancer, it is very difficult to cure."
"I would just mention two aspects that should, I feel, cause us to consider reviewing our strategy further. First, fighting organised crime using the classic police and judicial methods has proven largely futile."
"For example, much organised crime is connected with drug trafficking. By adopting a more liberalised stance on drugs, we could help drug users deal with their sickness and at the same time eliminate drug traffickers."
"Secondly, in some cases organised crime thrives because it has the backing and cooperation of corrupt politicians or corrupt policemen."
"Do we have in place in all Member States the necessary effective means to correct this situation, or do we just pretend that this corruption does not exist?"
"Unfortunately, this piece of legislation, although it contains many fine things, does little in respect of the two points I have just mentioned."
"That shows, in my view, that neither the Commission nor Parliament is yet ready or brave enough to cut deep and remove the cancer of organised crime from our society before it is too late."
". – Mr President, what is it that is happening here? We are being asked once again for non-binding advice on Council framework decisions in a key area of internal security, of judicial and police cooperation, which 25 parliaments are ultimately supposed to transpose into national law."
"In practice, that means that what we are concerned with is purely and simply a kind of ratification process under the pressure of the difficult task of reaching agreement between 25 governments, without the consultation being binding, without codecision, without Community law, without comprehensive rights of scrutiny, and without any extension of the competence of the European Court of Justice."
"A continual deepening of police and judicial cooperation is taking place here that, although necessary, does not take sufficient account of the issues of the degree to which the guarantees of fundamental rights are binding, of parliamentary legitimacy, and of legal and parliamentary control, and disregards the conflicts with regard to the rule of law."
"This report demonstrates once again that we have reached the upper limit of the legitimacy of intergovernmental cooperation in this field."
"The report contains a number of vague legal terms, which is surely the most dangerous thing possible in such an explosive field. Promotion of criminal organisations: what is that, what does it mean, what is the legal definition?"
"Particular investigation methods are demanded, and appropriate instruments, infiltration methods and techniques proposed, without the rapporteur actually taking the trouble to clarify the problems regarding the rule of law that these vague legal terms entail. We shall not be supporting this report, therefore."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is the duty of the Presidency of Parliament to uphold the honour of its Members."
"It has been claimed that in this Chamber there are political exponents and representatives of institutions with links to criminal and terrorist organisations. I believe claims of that kind are unacceptable and I therefore call on the Presidency to take precautions to prevent speeches of that kind and to adopt whatever measures are needed to uphold the honour of the Sinn Féin delegation, which belongs to our group."
"I consider all that to be unacceptable and believe that the Presidency of Parliament should also intervene to penalise speakers who fail to respect the honour of the European Parliament and its Members."
"– Mr President, this would appear to be a popular theme among the Polish Members of the House, and I shall continue the trend."
"The Commission’s new principles governing the granting of financial aid for the trans-European transport networks are a prime example of price dumping. They are intended to encourage the Member States to take measures that are in the interests of the European Community as a whole."
"Put briefly, these interests boil down to two key issues. The first of these is the need to eliminate transport bottlenecks in the old Member States."
"The second is the need to link the transport systems of the 15 old Member States to those of the 10 new Member States. There is cause for concern, however, that one of these goals will take precedence over the other if the above principles are implemented."
"By this I mean that there is a better chance of the first goal being achieved than the second. It goes without saying that the reason for this is that the new Member States, in particular those such as Poland, are facing lengthy delays in the development of road infrastructure."
"As well as finding solutions to the problem of how to link their transport systems to those in Western Europe, these countries are confronted with the challenge of constructing the very systems themselves. One answer could be to allow double Community funding for priority routes."
"The Commission proposal makes no provision for this possibility, however, since the new principles exclude funding for sections of routes covered by the Cohesion Fund. This could mean that the dumping I mentioned at the start is entirely ineffective."
"Of course, the effectiveness of the new financial instrument in the old Member States will also be limited if cuts to the total funding available are made in the budget, and indeed this issue has already been touched upon several times today."
"Such cuts would be absolutely disastrous, and would render a valuable initiative by the Commission completely meaningless."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Mauro, as well as Mr Bösch, who has been of great assistance to us in this work. I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and I would like to say that this regulation is long awaited."
"It contains many innovations for better managing the funds that are going to be invested in the trans-European transport networks, such as multi-annual programming, which is necessary and which is attached to each project, automatic decommitment, so that the funds do not remain unused indefinitely, the increase in rates of intervention, the establishment of European coordinators or the new loan guarantee instrument."
"This is therefore a regulation of very high quality, but it contains a significant mistake: we have considerably increased the rates of intervention, we have considerably extended the geographical scope of the trans-European networks, we have doubled the number of priority projects, and we do not yet have any budget!"
"I believe that we must avoid the loss of credibility that we suffered in relation to the big Essen projects."
"I therefore believe that it is extremely important that we pursue the budgetary battle to its end, because otherwise we will suffer a very considerable loss of credibility, which would be a very great disappointment for all of the regions of Europe."
"Furthermore, it seems to me that the spending adjustment variable is what are being called projects of common interest, which are not priority projects. In this regard as well, I fear that many regions and many local authorities in Europe are deluding themselves."
"The regulation is deceptive: it says that it funds everything, not just priority projects, but also projects of common interest within countries."
"I therefore believe, Commissioner, that it needs to be put differently. In the absence of the resources to cover everything, we must explain that we will intervene wherever there is Community added value, that is to say, essentially the great cross-border projects."
"– Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Drčar Murko, and Commissioner Kyprianou for the desire for mutual understanding they have shown in the course of this work."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament obviously welcomes the Commission’s proposal to limit the use of those substances in what are known as jelly mini-cups that have led to tragic accidents involving choking."
"We also welcome the Commission’s proposal to establish the level of nitrates and nitrites on the basis of added values in, for example, meat products instead of, as at present, on the basis of residual levels."
"We believe that this will lead to safer monitoring for consumers."
"We want these restrictions to enter into force as quickly as possible, and we have therefore been anxious to reach a rapid agreement with the Council. We are also pleased that, under the agreement with the Council, the use of soybean hemicellulose is to be limited so as not to make life more difficult for allergy sufferers."
"We should, however, have liked to have seen lower upper limits for nitrates and nitrites."
"We should also have liked to bring about a ban on the use of antibiotics in foodstuffs since such use may lead to increased resistance, and we should have liked to have seen a more thorough investigation of the risks associated with the sweetener aspartame, but on these points a majority of the committee was opposed to us."
"Now that the Commission has, both in writing and orally here in the Chamber, stated that it takes our concern about the long-term use of aspartame and antibiotics in foodstuffs seriously, we shall support the compromise with the Council and so vote against the other amendments. We wish, however, to call on the Commission to return as quickly as possible to these issues, thoroughly to revise these directives on the basis of the need to limit the use of additives in foodstuffs, and to take greater account of the situation of vulnerable groups."
"More and more people are rightly expressing concern about the level of additives in food and about the long-term consequences of their use. We in the EU must take this concern extremely seriously."
". – Mr President, although this is a very lonely debate, it is nevertheless a very important piece of legislation because it deals with what we knowingly – or in many cases, unknowingly – ingest."
"It is also a somewhat complicated and controversial piece of legislation in places, and therefore much credit should go to the rapporteur for achieving a valuably balanced report."
"I wish to pick up on a couple of aspects that I feel need to be noted further."
"First, it is right to ban jelly mini-cups with gel-forming food additives in order to prevent choking in children, but the banning of gel-forming food additives in general is unwise because these substances are only hazardous when used in jelly mini-cups."
"If used in other products, they are perfectly safe; so I fully support the principle that we should not place a blanket ban on all substances, and should only ban unsafe products."
"Secondly, with regard to the newly authorised sweetener erythritol, I agree with the rapporteur that its laxative effect, even if at very low percentage levels, should be made known in the form of product labelling."
"As a matter of principle, I believe that it is an unquestionable right of the consumer to know exactly what he eats or drinks."
"That right surely supersedes any marketing tactics or side-effects."
"I thank the Commissioner for staying so late with us."
"The use of antibiotics is very unwise in any foods because of the danger of microbial resistance and allergenic reactions."
"I did not thank the rapporteur. She did an excellent job and I second the congratulations expressed by the honourable Members."
"It is true that this is a technical subject, but it touches upon many sensitivities. Mrs Drčar Murko did an excellent job in dealing with this issue and reaching the compromise that we have before us today."
"We shall begin with the joint debate on the budgetary procedure for the financial year 2006. We shall examine"
"- the report by Mr Giovanni Pittella, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2006 (Section III, Commission) [C6-0299/2005 2005/2001(BUD)] (A6-0309/2005) and"
"- the report by Mr Valdis Dombrovskis, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2006 (Section I, European Parliament; Section II, Council;"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two questions have often sprung to my mind during this long process that has brought us to the vote at first reading."
"First, what is the budget?"
"Is it a dull accounting exercise or a key political act?"
"Secondly, do the decisions – or rather ‘codecisions’ – that we make actually correspond to our citizens’ priorities, and is it really our job to fund these priorities or would it be fairer if they were funded out of national or regional budgets?"
"I believe these two questions, which apply both to the annual budget and to the financial perspectives, come before any analysis of budget lines and spending categories."
"They form the crux of a debate that has to rise above arid technicalities, because it is an altogether political debate."
"Whether the European Union should take certain measures and not others is not something that should be decided behind closed doors, fuelling a stale, vacuous dialectic between proponents of stringent and attitudes."
"This is a central theme of the European political agenda: I have to say to the Council representatives that I am astounded that there is no place for such questions at tomorrow’s Summit of Heads of State or Government."
"How can the Union’s social agenda be drafted without also linking it to the decisions made in the annual and multiannual budgets?"
"That is a mystery that I hope will be answered today in the speech by President-in-Office Blair."
"The financial resources needed to carry out our work are a key issue."
"The time has come to take the bull by the horns."
"The issue is this: are there responsibilities that have to be met at a supranational level?"
"Is there European added value in respect of national public spending?"
"What are these policies and programmes and where do they fit into the European budget?"
"I shall give you some examples."
"First, cohesion policy: is it a necessary policy and who should make it?"
"There is no doubt that the Union is still marked by social, economic and regional imbalances."
"It is therefore imperative to promote economic development by addressing structural shortcomings, stimulating sustainable growth and significantly boosting employment and competitiveness."
"This policy needs to be made at European level because that is the only level at which it can be effective in terms of costs, procedure rationalisation and standardisation, resource sharing, objective setting and exchange of good practice."
"My second example is research."
"Does research policy need to be made at European level?"
"In other words, looking beyond the individual Member States and private players, should there also be a direct research commitment at European level?"
"The competitive gap that has opened up in recent years, leaving our continent lagging behind both emerging and established economies, is plain for all to see."
"Can we close the gap just with protective measures, or do we instead need to enhance European research efforts by creating centres of excellence, adding value to industry and small and medium-sized enterprises, promoting cooperation between the public and private sectors especially through research infrastructure and public-private partnerships, disseminating knowledge, and networking our researchers working around the world?"
"As you know, the European Union trains more science and engineering PhDs than the United States, but many of them decide to emigrate or switch to different careers."
"There are currently some 85 000 to 90 000 European researchers working in the scientific research sector in the United States."
"Increasing investment at European level can surely help to improve this situation."
"In this respect, a look at data from around the world shows that the European Union has a long way to go to catch up with its main competitors."
"In 2001, the European Union spent 1.9% of its GDP on research, whereas Japan earmarked 3.1% and the United States 2.8%."
"The key programme for our actions in this area, as we all know, is the sixth framework programme, and the seventh framework programme is currently nearing completion."
"Can we leave these instruments without adequate funding?"
"My third example is education, training, culture and youth policies."
"Mr Blair is right to remind us – as he did in his passionate and well-received inaugural speech for the UK Presidency here in this House – that we have to modernise our social model and drastically cut the dreadful figure of 20 million unemployed by raising productivity, training more workers in the sciences and making human capital our top priority."
"His position is likely to become less effective, however, unless it is accompanied by consistent decisions on the financial means to implement it."
"We have made some specific choices by increasing the amounts for youth-oriented programmes."
"Before this budget there had perhaps never been such a large increase for the three fundamental youth programmes: Socrates, Leonardo and YOUTH."
"We must send out a strong message to the young people of Europe and remain consistent with the Youth Pact, which the Governments themselves launched a few months ago."
"We must set up new pilot schemes, such as Erasmus for young entrepreneurs and Erasmus for upper secondary school students (16- to 18-year-olds)."
"Lastly, external actions."
"We have seen a paradoxical situation arise in recent years."
"On the one hand, the European Union has rightly been called upon to play a more united and incisive role in world affairs, yet on the other there has also been a demand, particularly from the Member States, to retain the power of veto on external policy as well as an utterly inadequate level of funding."
"The people of Europe are thus all the more justified in lamenting the Union’s substantial lack of influence on the broader international stage."
"The Community budget, roughly amounting to a mere EUR 5 billion, is now expected to cover reconstruction in Iraq, reconstruction in Afghanistan, the tsunami emergency, humanitarian aid, strengthening democracy, protecting human rights in crisis regions, fighting poverty and destitution, cooperation programmes in the Mediterranean and the Balkans, and dozens and dozens of other major initiatives."
"On top of that, it has just been announced – and rightly so – that we need to increase our aid for the reconstruction of Pakistan in the post-earthquake emergency there."
"Then it has also been announced that we will make a more substantial contribution to assist the Middle East peace process."
"All that means that we are caught in an untenable position between these political statements, commitments and – I venture to say – duties, and the heading 4 appropriation, which is only EUR 5 billion."
"This contradictory position leads our fellow citizens to see us all – the European Parliament, the Commission and the European Council – as classic cases of ineffectual leaders."
"Those, then, are the issues that I believe concern our budget."
"I regard the strategy adopted by the Committee on Budgets as being based on the following principles: remaining consistent with previous years’ approaches; leaving all possible strategic options open to Parliament, so that a final decision can be made during conciliation in November, without nullifying the interinstitutional agreement at this juncture, but making maximum use of the flexibility instrument to stand by all our priorities; guaranteeing an adequate general level of payments; ensuring an adequate general level of Structural Fund payments; providing maximum support to achieve the Lisbon goals by increasing funding for small and medium-sized enterprises, research, the environment and above all youth policies; increasing the financial commitment under heading 4 (external actions), where the ceiling does not allow funding for the new emergencies that every year are added to the existing ones – Afghanistan, Iraq, the tsunami – at the same time as Parliament’s traditional priorities."
"I shall spare you the figures, which you know at least as well as I do, and move on to the political conclusion."
"Representatives of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that is our position."
"It is a strong and reasonable position for an ambitious yet unpretentious budget. It is a position on which we are united, thanks to responsible contributions by all the political groups."
"I should like to thank all the group coordinators in the Committee on Budgets and all those Members who have contributed to our work and enabled us to examine the 900 or more amendments, and who thus far have ensured a very broad consensus for our platform."
"I am grateful to the Commissioner for the cooperation that has been established, which has grown stronger and stronger and become invaluable, to the extent that our positions have become very broadly convergent."
"I thank Mr Lewis, the Council representative: I thank him today for the perfect courtesy with which he has conducted his dialogue with Parliament;"
"My thanks also go to Chairman Lewandowski and the staff and secretaries that have assisted me, particularly my peerless assistant – please excuse this personal note, but it is sincere and well-deserved – in the gruelling work of recent months; I am sure she will continue to do it."
"My final message is again addressed directly to the Council."
"We often say that there is bound to be a terrible tug-of-war between Parliament and the Council between first and second reading."
"However, I ask the Council: is that really the case?"
"Is it inevitable that blood will run in Charlemagne’s golden halls?"
"Do we have to come armed with Article 272 hidden up our sleeve?"
"Is it so very difficult to understand that what is at stake is not a collection of crazy corporative demands but, more simply and dramatically, the future and the fate of Europe, of our institutions, and of the relationship of trust between us and our fellow citizens – a relationship that has worn very thin but can still be mended and revived?"
"This budget is a bridge to the new programming period."
"It comes at a terrible time in the life and history of the Union."
"It cannot escape you, Mr Lewis, your representatives who are here today, or even Mr Blair, that there are challenges that no one can face alone, no matter how faithful you are to the British tradition, from Churchill onwards, whereby you are more partners than part of united Europe."
"These challenges, from cohesion to competitiveness to external actions, can only be faced by the Union if it has sufficient financial means to do so."
"The new global scenarios, which could not even be foreseen when the current financial perspectives were decided in 1999, place pressing demands on us to which we must respond appropriately."
"I think very few people are asking for less Europe, while many are demanding more Europe."
"My hope is that the second half of the UK Presidency will present us with two shining, decisive outcomes to get us back on our feet."
"Together we can deliver a good budget for 2006, and together we can deliver the new financial perspectives by the end of this year, ushering in a new period of confidence in the European project."
"Mr Pittella, thank you for your explanations and for adhering so strictly to your speaking time."
"The advantage of the European Union is that we can be sure that we may have anything running through the rooms of the building but blood."
"Thank you for your image, which reminds us of our current situation."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow the European Parliament is to vote on the European Union’s budget for 2006."
"The significance of this vote will be greater than just the setting of an annual allocation of EU finances."
"2006 is the last year of the existing Financial Perspective."
"Therefore, the 2006 budget will also serve as a point of reference in taking decisions for the next Financial Perspective, that for 2007–2013."
"With regard to the 2006 budget for the other EU institutions, the main priorities are EU enlargement and the effective and highly targeted use of EU budget resources."
"The first priority is connected with the successful completion of the 2004 round of EU enlargement, by fully integrating representatives from the new EU Member States into the EU institutions, as well as preparations for the next round of EU enlargement, when Bulgaria and Romania will join. We have an unacceptable situation where, despite more than a year having already passed since EU enlargement, many permanent staff posts set aside for the new Member States still remain vacant."
"One of the problems to be emphasised in this connection is the excessive red-tape and slow procedures for taking on staff."
"In order to ensure that the next round of EU enlargement is successful, it is proposed that support should be given to all the permanent staff posts requested by the other institutions in connection with enlargement, and also other additional expenditure connected with EU enlargement."
"The second priority is effective and highly targeted use of EU budget resources."
"This priority encompasses such matters as: focusing EU institutional expenditure on fundamental tasks; giving support to requests for new budget requests and permanent staff posts only after having assessed the possibility of redistributing resources and staff within the framework of the existing budget; giving support to new initiatives only after having assessed their impact on the budget and interinstitutional cooperation with a view to economical and effective use of budget resources."
"Both institutions with budgetary decision-making powers – the European Parliament and the Council – endorse the principles of budgetary discipline and the rational use of EU taxpayers’ money."
"The Council is proposing to reduce the administrative expenditure of the other institutions by 15 million euro as compared with the institutions’ original requests."
"It must be said, however, that in many cases this reduction has been implemented in an ill-considered manner, without thorough examination of the specific nature and problems of the institutions’ work."
"Following a careful review of the requests in the budget for the other institutions it is proposed to restore part of the reductions made by the European Council to the budget – a total amount of 7.5 million euro."
"With regard to the European Parliament budget, firstly I should like to emphasise the issue of the ceiling on joint expenditure."
"After a wide-ranging discussion within the Committee on Budgets, taking into account the experience of last year with inflated budget votes and the resulting failure to achieve Parliament’s budgeted expenditure, it is proposed to reduce Parliament’s budgeted expenditure by 20 million euro as compared with the administration’s requests."
"I believe that the European Parliament budget ought to be set on the basis of needs that have been established following careful evaluation."
"Achieving a ceiling of 20% of total administrative expenditure is not an end in itself."
"Of course, the issue of the sum of over 200 million euro per year which is spent additionally in order to provide the European Parliament with a seat in Strasbourg is still a topical one."
"The main problem is the maintenance of two European Parliament buildings in parallel, in Brussels and Strasbourg."
"It must be acknowledged that this matter falls within the jurisdiction of the European Council."
"Considerable attention has been paid in the European Parliament’s budget for 2006 to information and communication policy, to ensure that information is accessible and that the work of the European Parliament is better explained to EU citizens."
"The European Parliament’s role as the representative of the EU Member States should be especially stressed in this connection."
"Various measures have already been taken."
"I can mention, for instance, the launch of the new European Parliament home page, where much more emphasis has been placed on current information about the work of the European Parliament in all the official EU languages."
"It is proposed that in 2006 the European Parliament’s visitors’ programme should be improved, and that a special reserve should be established for information and communication."
"Finally, I should like to return to the issue I emphasised at the beginning of my speech."
"In view of the fact that 2006 is the final year of the current Financial Perspective, it is important for the total amount of commitment and payment appropriations for the 2006 budget to correspond with the commitments which the European Union has undertaken, including those connected with EU enlargement."
"I fully agree with what Mr Pittella said, that in 2006 it is necessary to provide an adequate amount of payment appropriations, including for the Structural Funds."
"The attitude adopted by the European Council in connection with the EU budget for 2005, where it artificially blocked the amount of payment appropriations, was unacceptable."
"Now the unjustified nature of the European Council’s stance has become obvious."
"The European Commission is preparing amendments to the 2005 budget, providing a larger sum of payment appropriations for the Structural Funds."
"If the European Council tries once more to block the amount of payment appropriations for the 2006 budget, that will prove the Council’s unwillingness to fully finance those commitments which the EU has undertaken within the framework of the existing Financial Perspective."
"It must be said that this indulging in empty promises without backing them up with deeds increases the alienation and scepticism that citizens feel towards the EU."
"In conclusion, I would also like particularly to draw the attention of Commissioner Grybauskaitė to the poor quality of the Latvian translation of the budget prepared by the European Commission."
"For example, budget lines 02030202 and 02030203, which deal with medicines for treating rare diseases."
"The Commission’s Latvian translation talks about resources for treating orphans and medicines for orphans."
"Therefore, the Commissioner should not be surprised: she is going to receive requests from Latvia’s orphans to fund their medicines, since that is what it actually says in the translation prepared by the European Commission."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Thank you very much, Mr Dombrovskis."
"Amongst all of us we will try to improve our multilingual communication procedures."
". I would like to thank Parliament for its evaluation of the draft budget for 2006, Mr Pittella for his appraisal of our growing understanding and the cooperation of the Commission and Parliament as well as the manner in which all discussions and preparations for budget acceptance have taken place."
"In order to avoid translation-related problems, I will continue in English."
"To avoid interpreting problems, I would like to give my more technical presentation in English."
"Mr Pitella has set us a fine example with his presentation."
"I shall go through the various headings."
"On agricultural expenditure, under heading 1a, the Commission will, in a week’s time, present its new estimates in accordance with the new market tendencies which, according to our information, will mean a reduction in the estimates that the Commission proposed for agricultural expenditure."
"As regards the second heading – structural actions – the PDB proposed by the Commission was presented and established on the basis of observed trends and our revised estimates, which do not exactly correspond with those of the Member States."
"The Commission will submit an amending letter at the beginning of November, bearing in mind that we will be receiving the final data from the Member States at the end of this month, so we will be coming to you in the first weeks of November with the final level, which will have to be determined in trialogue in November."
"On internal policies, Parliament has tabled a lot of amendments, mainly on co-decided programmes."
"So, as usual, the Commission confirms that it will support any proposals in the co-decided envelope, if this is agreed between two budgetary authorities."
"External action is the most difficult heading for all of us, especially because it entails pressure as regards the use of the Flexibility Instrument."
"Next year we will need expenditure at least for the tsunami and for sugar reform, and it is becoming clear that two further items of expenditure will be needed: support for Gaza and the earthquake in Pakistan."
"This defines and distinguishes clearly how we should reflect or understand the Flexibility Instrument’s usage in future, and I would like to re-confirm what I said recently in COBU: the Commission and its Legal Service understand that, for 2006, up to EUR 493 million are available under the Flexibility Instrument."
"On administrative expenditure and posts, I welcome the reinstatement of all the PDB requests we presented."
"I also welcome the reaction from Council and Parliament to our message sent in September about recruitment, and I would like to correct a point in Mr Dombrovskis’ presentation."
"All 1480 posts for new Member States have been filled as at present."
"There are no vacant posts left."
"We are doing our best."
"So, if EUR 16 million is to be reserved in the way proposed today, subject to very demanding conditions, which cannot be met promptly next year, we will be confronted with recruitment problems in respect of about half of the new posts proposed, some 200 to 300 posts."
"Nonetheless, the Commission will take the opportunity to comment on the amendments as a whole, especially those to be tabled – and which are indeed of great importance to Parliament – in our letter on implementability."
"I will send this to you in advance of the second reading."
"We would like to wish the rapporteur and Parliament a very constructive debate and successful vote tomorrow."
"The Commission will be on your side, helping to reach a deal for 2006 in November or, at the latest, in December."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my capacity as deputy for the draftsman, Mrs De Keyser, I should like to highlight three points raised by the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"The first point concerns the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, for which we do not accept the 25% cut proposed by the Commission and we call for at least the 2005 budget figure to be restored."
"The second point concerns aid for reconstruction in Iraq."
"We should like the Community’s money to be spent transparently by entrusting it to the United Nations agencies operating in Iraq."
"Lastly, we call on the Council for greater clarity when mentioning the use of funds for the European Union special representatives."
"Pending explanations from the Council, the Committee on Foreign Affairs has proposed cutting the payment appropriations ascribed to the budget line in question by EUR 1.5 million."
". Mr President, I want to congratulate Mr Pittella, the rapporteur, on having produced an excellent budget statement, and the Commissioner."
"Mr Pittella has very kindly accepted about 80% of the Committee on Development’s amendments to the budget."
"We all know that this budget is very stretched."
"Mr Pittella has himself explained how external actions have been very difficult: Afghanistan, Iraq, the tsunami, Gaza, and the earthquake."
"The earthquake represents a challenge."
"Three million people are stranded on mountainsides freezing to death."
"They have no tents, food or water."
"Logistically it is impossible to supply them with food, water and heat, etc. We do not know how much it is going to cost this year."
"The response to the tsunami was magnificent – I was caught up in the middle of it."
"USD 5.3 billion was raised globally, of which the European Union committed EUR 160 million and then further sums under the flexibility instrument."
"However, I am conscious that the UK Presidency is very concerned about the earthquake and Pakistan."
"To feed and look after three million people over the winter will be difficult."
"Do we adopt a family and ask the Pakistani people in Karachi, Lahore or Rawalpindi to look after these people over the six-month period and help them with coupons, ration cards and provide them with food so that we do not allow them to starve and die on mountain tops?"
"I do not know."
"I am also very grateful that much of what the Committee on Development has asked for has been given."
"I only regret that the handwashing programme – which we talked about in my committee – was not accepted by the budget rapporteur."
"I would like that to be noted."
". Mr President, I think we are all agreed that trade can do more for development than all the aid and debt relief we give."
"In other words, Hong Kong in December can be more important for development than the Gleneagles summit in the summer was."
"However, there is more to trade than simple liberalisation: we have to give developing countries assistance in getting their goods to the market and we have to give them assistance in terms of meeting our technical and health standards."
"That is why the Committee on International Trade is proposing a new budget line called 'aid for trade'."
"It is not that we do not already have trade assistance in our budget, but at the moment it is spread over two hundred different budget lines."
"The Trade Committee would like this to be unified into one single budget line."
"We would like a clear budget line so that aid for trade is more easily mobilised, more visible and more accessible to the developing countries."
". Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner very much indeed for coming today."
"I would also like to start by thanking the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgets for coming to a couple of meetings of the Committee on Budgetary Control and listening to the concerns and queries of the Committee."
"It is a very healthy process for us all to be involved in."
"The process by which the Budgetary Control Committee operates is as follows: we go through our discharge reports and look at conclusions and points that we have raised with which the House has concurred and which the Commission has not completely implemented, and then draw up amendments to try to ensure implementation in the future."
"We also look at the OLAF budget in great detail because it is one of the areas where we have many concerns and will have many concerns in the future."
"This year, OLAF asked for a great deal more staff, in fact 25 new staff and an increase in its budget of 10 %, which our committee, the committee that should be the most proactive and supportive of OLAF (as I believe it probably is), was concerned that this level of new staff was not actually required."
"One of the amendments in the budget this year has details on that."
"We are seeking a satisfactory explanation, which I am not sure we have properly received."
"We also called on the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Auditors to amend their respective administrative decisions by 1 November of this year in such a way as to rule out the private use of official cars, and there are amendments in the budget for that."
"Finally, and completely off track and on a personal note, there is an amendment signed by all Members across this House to allow funding of Europe-wide events to encourage the social inclusion of young people and mentally disabled people through sporting activities, which I hope the rapporteur will pick up."
"Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I should like to outline our budgetary priorities."
"Firstly, we need appropriate resources to ensure high quality and coherent economic analyses enabling accurate economic prospects to be established for the Union."
"You know that we are committed to the PRINCE Programme ‘The euro, a currency for Europe’ because, as we also know, a second wave of euros is due to be introduced and we therefore need to continue to keep citizens in all of our countries interested in the currency."
"Finally, we are very keen to help SMEs by promoting both a viable economic environment for microenterprises and ethical financing instruments."
"As for giving support to the Fiscalis Programme, which is aimed at improving the functioning of the indirect taxation systems of the internal market, we are training the officials required in each country because, as far as we are concerned, doing so will guarantee that the Union has a future and is secure and prosperous."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Mr Pittella for his outstanding work throughout the 2006 budgetary procedure."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for whose opinion I was the draftsperson, welcomes the fact that the Committee on Budgets has acknowledged and accepted the need to increase certain headings, and, moreover, to reinstate the amounts laid down in the preliminary draft budget with regard to the European Social Fund, the EQUAL programme, EURES, measures to fight and prevent social exclusion and the Leonardo programme."
"Nonetheless, some of our suggestions fell by the wayside, some of which are very close to our hearts, and I should like to bring them to your attention."
"For example, Europass is an instrument for promoting the transparency of qualifications, a key factor in achieving the Lisbon goals and was presented within a package along with the Leonardo programme. We believe that the allocations to Europass should be increased, yet these aspects were not taken into account."
"I should also like to draw your attention to the situation of the Bilbao agency, which, without any budgetary adjustment since 2004, either in terms of inflation, or in terms of meeting the needs of the enlargement, will soon be entirely unable to continue functioning."
"Lastly, I should like to pay tribute to Mr Pitella’s efforts on behalf of the European Year of Workers’ Mobility; firstly in including it as a special annual event, given that it could not be envisaged as a pilot project; and secondly given its importance and, objectively speaking, its effectiveness in meeting the aims of making the European economy competitive."
". Mr President, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has examined this budget in the light of the cuts that have already been made under the current Financial Perspective, which will soon enter its final year."
"We should therefore like to register our protest at the proposal to reduce spending on the trans-European networks by EUR 120 million."
"We believe that the trans-European networks are a key tool for implementing the vision of a cohesive Europe and that of regional development."
"Furthermore, we cannot consent to the Council’s amendments aimed at reducing expenditure on transport safety bodies."
"In particular, we are opposed to the cuts made to spending on the prevention of marine pollution."
"In view of these two key issues, we should like to make it quite clear that an efficient transport system is in the interests of the citizens of the EU and of its economy, and I would ask all the political groups and Members of this House to lend us their support."
"I should like to pay tribute to Mr Pittella, who has contributed so much to work on this draft budget."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee for Regional Development has, in its opinion on the budget, agreed to the Commission’s proposals and reinstated the preliminary draft, with particular reference to the payments."
"The rapporteur took the needs of the Member States into account by again increasing the payments by 40%, and so there are two things I ask of them."
"One is that they should actually spend this money properly and in accordance with up-to-date knowledge, and the other is that, in the debate on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, they take that into account and budget accordingly for cohesion policy in future."
"I would like to ask the House to endorse two more proposals from the Regional Committee, one being for a project on the European networking of SMEs, and the other for a study on the particular needs of the new Member States as regards the reconstruction of panel-built housing estates – a problem we have frequently discussed in this House without any exact knowledge of the challenges with which these present the Member States in question."
". – Mr President, I too wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Pittella, who has set both the political vision of this budget and the technical vision, which is direct and functional."
"The credibility of the European Parliament will also be judged on this budget."
"Up to now, the Commission has told us that agricultural spending will be improved or will be determined on the basis of a corrective letter."
"I consider that it is not a sign of credibility for us to debate this issue of agricultural spending, of a large section, under the influence of a corrective letter."
"However, nor will the European Parliament be credible if it votes for the amendment by the Committee on Budgets, on the basis of which Community subsidies are being put in reserve, by which we mean frozen, at a time when the reform of the COM in tobacco is here and has been voted on by all the governments of the Member States."
"I should like to ask the Commission why it has not also included tobacco in the new draft budget, together with all the products which it has included in the subdivisions of category 1."
"As far as gender equality is concerned, the amendment already adopted by the Committee on Budgets on strengthening the Daphne programme and programmes to subsidise and help fund women's organisations, especially the European women's lobby, should be supported."
". Mr President, I speak as a replacement for Mr Mulder, who drafted the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries."
"Our committee has more confidence in the figures advanced by the Commission in the PDB than in the Council's estimates."
"Accordingly, we propose restoration of the Commission's figures."
"These are already cautious ones and there are a number of priorities for us."
"They include supporting the newer Member States in making adjustments to their fisheries sector, investment in environmentally friendly fishing methods, adequate funding for the development of regional advisory councils, economic aid to assist those whose livelihood is affected by reductions in fishing effort, more consistent allocation of appropriations for research, greater account of the needs of remote regions and better implementation of control instruments so as to ensure respect for both substantive and financial rules."
"We look to all the appropriate institutions for their endorsement of this approach."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the amendments adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to the draft general budget for 2006 were mainly centred around three objectives: the fight against terrorism, the control of the EU’s external borders and the protection of citizens’ personal data."
"Generally speaking – and, at this point, I should like to thank our general rapporteur and my fellow Members from the Committee on Budgets – these amendments have been accepted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and will, I hope, be adopted tomorrow by plenary."
"Turning more specifically to the fight against terrorism, we are proposing a substantial increase in the operational resources given to Eurojust, at the same time as increasing by nearly 30% the appropriations allocated to the pilot project, which our Parliament wanted in order to coordinate more effectively the resources for anticipating and confronting the terrorist threat."
"Moreover, we are in favour of allocating the resources requested by the Commission in order to have a real crisis management capacity and we are proposing to extend the appropriations designed to help the victims of terrorist acts in such a way as to include legal aid."
"As regards controlling the EU’s external borders, we are proposing a substantial increase in the resources dedicated to the new Frontex Agency and we are bringing back the payment appropriations initially included in the PDB for the Schengen Information System and for the Visa Information System."
"These payment appropriations had been, rather stupidly, reduced by the Council."
"As regards data protection, we are keeping back part of the appropriations requested by the Commission for passenger rights with the aim of forcing the Commission to respect the commitments it made before Parliament on changing the system for transmitting passenger name records to the US authorities."
"Furthermore – and this will be my final point – in the motion for a resolution, we are emphasising the need to implement a mechanism aimed at protecting personal data in the third pillar."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating my friend, Mr Pittella, for a job well done."
"I should like to make three points."
"The first is that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs made five proposals: we wanted more money for the Jean Monnet Chairs, more money for cultural organisations, more money for organisations advancing the idea of Europe, more money for European think-tanks and more money to debate the future of the European Union."
"What happened?"
"We got nothing!"
"The five proposals were all rejected."
"I am sure Mr Heaton-Harris is really happy about it, but I hate to tell him that I am very happy with his proposal, because he gave a lot of money to the PRINCE programme."
"We asked for EUR 9 million and we were given commitments of over EUR 4 million."
"That is a great thing, and, therefore, I am pleased about the changes the Committee on Budgetary Control made."
"My second point was more of a question: what do we need the money for?"
"We all know that the French and the Dutch rejected the Constitution in referenda, and that we need to start debating the future of the Union."
"That is in all our interests."
"The Constitution is not dead, it will continue to live on and we need to restart the debate on it."
"For that we need money."
"My third and final point is also a question: can we buy the debate with money?"
"The answer, of course, is no."
"However, I think, personally and as a member of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, that it is very important to get that debate going, and the fact that the Commission has put down a plan B – sorry, a plan D – and is receiving over EUR 4 million in commitments from the Committee on Budgets is a good thing, and also good for the future of the Union."
". – Mr President, as regards Community policy on gender equality, I should like to start by thanking Mr Pittella, who accepted the amendments relating to the integration of equality in all chapters on Community policy."
"I should also like the amendment to be supported which has already been adopted in the budget, strengthening financing for the Daphne II programme, a programme which aims to address the phenomenon of violence against women and children."
"In addition, I consider it important for the amendments by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality on greater financing for women's organisations, especially the European women's lobby, to be supported."
"That is because the action by these organisations is essential to promoting gender equality in social, economic and political life and to achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy of better and stronger participation by women in the labour market."
". – Firstly I would like to congratulate rapporteur Giovanni Pittella for his excellent report and would like to thank him for his constructive cooperation during the first reading of the budget in the European Parliament."
"I am satisfied that we in the Budget Committee succeeded in making decisions on the most important priorities: the European Union's competitiveness and union’s improved funding, support for small and medium business, other measures for implementing the Lisbon Strategy, improvement in the security of citizens, consolidation of the recent expansion of the European Union and the growth of the European Union's role as a world partner."
"These priorities ought to be the focus of our efforts in 2006."
"If the Council approves the European Parliament's proposal on a flexible instrument, we will have sufficient funds to finance reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan and the necessary aid to carry out post-tsunami reconstruction work in several Asian countries."
"2006 is an exceptional year from the budgetary point of view."
"It is the last year of this financial period and the Council has been unable to reach a consensus on the new financial perspective."
"Since preparations must be made for the next wave of European Union enlargement, I believe that the Council's behaviour is irresponsible, as enlargement is being discussed without an agreement on how it is to be funded."
"Therefore, the European Parliament is being forced to consider very different alternatives, including worst case scenarios."
"I trust that tomorrow the European Parliament will support the Budget Committee's most important proposals and we will be ready for the second conciliation meeting with the Council, which will take place in November."
". Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to make an introductory remark."
"It seems to me that we ought to change these procedures relating to a so-called budgetary debate, because it is absurd to restrict each committee to one minute’s speaking time."
"A new procedure really ought to be drawn up."
"I should like to say to you that our rapporteurs and all of the members of the Committee on Budgets have adopted a strategic approach with regard to this budget."
"On the one hand, the EU has needs, and it has a very large number of them: traditional policies, agricultural policy, Structural Fund policy."
"These needs are extensive and they certainly cost a lot of money."
"However, we must not forget that the EU has an ever increasing number of new needs: in terms of employment, sustainable development and everything the Lisbon Strategy entails for research, networks, information for citizens, training and security in every sense of the word, whether security against terrorism, border security or security, for example, in the current context of avian influenza."
"On the other hand, the EU also has duties to fulfil, as regards, for example, helping the poorest people and those countries awaiting membership of the European Union, not to mention helping other countries in which the death toll is constantly rising in terms of victims of natural disasters, be they the tsunami, typhoons or the earthquake in Pakistan, of countries and regions that have been caught up in conflict – the Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq, Gaza – and of the sugar reform."
"The burden on Europe’s budget is constantly increasing at exactly the same time that we are facing a shortage in revenue."
"We are faced with an impossible and, therefore, absurd task."
"This situation cannot continue."
"Hence our budgetary strategy, which was to allocate substantial, but by no means excessive, amounts of expenditure."
"However, we have not even been able to allocate all of this expenditure."
"We are therefore coming up against some great difficulties."
"I am, however, obliged to recognise that our relationship with the Commission is improving: that is why it seems to me that, this year, we have made further progress in our method of working, precisely in order to execute the budget more effectively."
"This improved situation will have to continue."
"As regards the pilot projects, we need to strengthen our action, including our preparatory actions."
"Our action will have to focus not only on the pilot projects we hold most dear, but on all the other pilot projects: for example, relating to SMEs, to youth assistance – particularly as part of the Erasmus programme – and to aid for the poorest countries to promote vaccinations throughout the world."
"My final point is that, above all, we must continue to disseminate more information around us."
"However, the problem is that, despite a very reasonable budget, which requires EUR 115 billion in payment appropriations – a figure corresponding to 1.04% of our GDP – we will find ourselves confronted with an imperturbable and stoic Council, which has only one thing to say: hands off my national budgets!"
"I call on the Council to cooperate more effectively with us."
"We are aware that there are some internal difficulties, but you also need to know that Europe will not be able to move forwards without genuine new resources."
"In the context of our budget, we have used nothing more than what we were entitled to within the current financial perspectives, which enable us to call for a large degree of flexibility."
"That is what we have done because, if we truly want to have a common future, this requirement for flexibility is crucial so that we can carry out the minimum policies sought by the European Union."
"Finally, we want you to understand that Parliament cannot continue doing the impossible: doing more with less."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I think that the draft 2006 budget, which is now before us following the vote in the Committee on Budgets, is well balanced, and I hope that, during tomorrow’s vote, we can continue to sing from the same hymn sheet regarding not only the general lines of the budget but also the details of the compromise established between a broad majority here in the Committee on Budgets."
"I also wish to say a big thank you to Mr Pittella for his major efforts in bringing about a compromise and for his readiness to listen and his considerable patience."
"Mr Pittella has made the youth and education programmes his main priority, and that is to his credit, I think."
"Precisely by investing in this area, we shall be achieving very considerable results with very few resources."
"Thanks should also go to Mr Dombrovskis for his work involving the other institutions."
"Those points in the compromise that we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe would particularly emphasise involve increased appropriations to the Lisbon Process, especially to research and to the programme for developing credit facilities for small enterprises in the new Member States."
"We should also very much like to emphasise that we have put our faith in more realistic appropriations to the area of foreign policy, in which the foreign ministers apparently think that it is the poor countries that should suffer privation so that we can fund the reconstruction following the tsunami and that it is the poor countries that, following the sugar reform, should fund the compensation paid to those countries that are deprived of their quotas."
"That is, of course, quite unacceptable, and that is why it is right to do what we are going to do, namely use the flexibility instrument."
"When it comes to the Structural Funds, adequate payment appropriations are of course required, and we can see how, in recent years, there has been better implementation of our projects."
"For two years, the payment appropriations in the budget have in actual fact been too low, and that is the situation we are remedying."
"Under the budget heading, ‘Pilot projects and preparatory actions’, which is a small item, more is of course desired than there are resources for, and I am pleased that resources have been successfully earmarked for a pilot project to build safe lay-bys on European motorways, enabling us to make active efforts to prevent attacks on long-distance lorry drivers and to guarantee greater security."
"It is a small thing, but a very important one."
"In Parliament’s budget, we wish to support the compromise whereby we set aside reserves for information policy, including Web TV, as well as for continuing to purchase buildings so that we save rent in the future."
"We have been reluctant to go below the 20%, but we support the compromise."
"It is important for us not to set aside larger reserves than necessary in the budget."
"The overall budget we now have is larger than that offered by the Council, but not so large that we cannot defend it."
"Clearly, this budgetary debate is influenced by the lack of agreement on the financial perspective for 2007-2013."
"My group comes out, then, in clear support of the proposal before us."
"The appropriations are realistic and necessary."
". Mr President, Commissioner Grybauskaitė, Mr Lewis, today, again, you stand before a self-confident parliament, one that spells out how Europe’s tasks have become greater and how we consequently need more resources if we are to face these challenges."
"The Commission’s draft budget, with its 1.02%, is a prudent one."
"We regard the cuts that the Council has proposed as utterly unacceptable."
"We must be bold enough to fund specifically targeted tasks if we are to respond adequately to the challenges of the future."
"I am much obliged to Mr Pittella, the rapporteur."
"Although he and I have moved closer together on essentials, there are a number of points that I would like to take up, where my group believes that there must be changes."
"We believe that the agricultural export subsidies in their present form are unjustifiable; for vegetables from Europe to be cheaper in countries such as Senegal than those produced locally is an intolerable state of affairs, and, by perpetuating it, we in the European Union are giving people cause to become refugees."
"This policy cannot be allowed to continue."
"The tobacco subsidies must also be cut back; that would offer us the chance to free up funds that could be invested elsewhere, particularly in research policy or in education, culture and young people."
"Mr Pittella takes the line – and on this I agree with him – that this is where we need to spend more on enabling students to become more mobile in Europe."
"Real cultural provision reaches people where they are, and in making it available we should return at least to the 2004 figures."
"We also have to spend more on renewable energies if we really want an ‘away from oil’ strategy as an adequate response to the challenges of climate change."
"We need to do this not only for environmental reasons, but also for reasons of economic policy."
"Any strategy of this kind must form part of the Lisbon strategy, for it is environmental technologies that will give us an edge on the world market."
"This is something in which we, as Europeans, must have a particular interest, and we must be ambitious enough to make headway here."
"Turning to foreign policy, the Council keeps delivering itself of pious utterances about how we need to do more: more in Iraq, more in Afghanistan, more for the victims of the tsunami."
"Then it goes and cuts the expenditure on day-to-day policy."
"In so doing it is irresponsibly undermining the European Union’s credibility."
"The present budget estimates will do nothing to enable us to achieve the objectives we set ourselves in the year 2000, which involved such things as a more determined war on poverty."
"Like some of those Members who have already spoken, I would like again to say loud and clear to the Council that we have to make full use of this flexibility – in the shape of these EUR 493 million – if the European Union is to be able to hold its head up in the world next year and really be able to do things we have promised to various parts of the world."
"We therefore urge the Council not to take a rigid line on this, but to change position and join with the Commission in bringing into being a really good budget for the European Union – one that shows a commitment to its future."
". Mr President, it could be claimed that the EU budgetary economy thrives in a world of plenty."
"For years the European Parliament’s own budget has been 10% air."
"This being the case, the Bureau of the European Parliament has had enormous difficulties spending the 20% share of the Union’s administrative expenditure that the other institutions give Parliament without questioning what the money is to be used for."
"Not all the uses for the money which our Bureau quickly dreams up are acceptable, however."
"In the drafting of the budget, a very stringent policy has been followed with regard to Section IV, whose ceiling for expenditure Parliament wishes to raise through maximum use of the flexibility instrument."
"The budget implementation figures proposed by the Commission for 2005 show that there is, and has been for a long time now, a lot of air in this Section; either that or the Commission is not implementing the wishes of Parliament with regard to the budget."
"The strangest aspect of the budget has to do with the budgeting of Structural Funds payments."
"The Council, in its own draft budget, has cut EUR 8 billion from the payment requirements put forward by the Member States."
"The same ministers who, on behalf of their countries, sent the Commission their country’s estimate of the amount of money needed to make payments for structural action have, in the Council, pruned back by a fifth the very requirements that they themselves put forward."
"Parliament has gone some way towards meeting the wishes of the Member States by taking 40% of the deficit for financing structural action into account in the budget, as advised by the Member States to the Commission."
"I would like to say on behalf of my group that next year’s budget will not meet the targets we have prioritised for developing the Union’s social dimension."
". Mr President, I should like to pay tribute to Mr Pittella and to the Committee on Budgets for the work they have done."
"The challenges facing the European Union are as follows."
"Firstly, economic growth is slowing."
"Secondly, EU businesses are becoming less competitive."
"Thirdly, unemployment is high and the gap between the rich and the poor is widening."
"Fourthly, there is a lack of political will and initiative to stimulate the economies of the new Member States, with the result that the post-Communist countries remain backward and dependent in economic terms."
"Fifthly, the EU leaders have pushed though the decision on Turkey’s accession to the EU, despite the opposition of the majority of citizens to this decision, and despite the fact that there is a concurrent lack of political will, vision or strategy as regards Ukraine’s accession."
"The 2006 budget makes no attempt to solve any of the above-mentioned problems, and in fact the opposite is the case."
"It is a continuation of the strategy that has been applied in previous years, which means that it will result in further economic slow-down and even more deep-rooted social and economic problems."
"The structure of spending is almost identical to previous years, which makes it inevitable that large sums will be spent on headings that have little effect in economic terms."
"At the same time, there will not be enough money to fund research and development, large infrastructure projects or aid for backward regions and countries."
"The scope and structure of the 2006 budget will make it impossible to meet the challenges posed by the enlargement of the EU to include 10 new Member States."
"The draft budget also fails to take sufficient account of the future accession of Bulgaria and Romania."
"Worse yet, the 2006 budget contains a long list of superfluous expenses for a wide range of consultancy and promotional services, as well as increased spending on administration and bureaucracy."
"To sum up, we believe that the 2006 budget is flawed, and that it runs counter to the ideals of a united Europe."
"These include rapid economic growth, social peace and solidarity with backward regions and countries."
". Mr President, I should like to thank both the rapporteurs for the huge amount of effort they have put into drafting the budget reports, and to congratulate them on having dealt with the huge number of amendments that have been tabled."
"Once again, Parliament is faced with the difficult task of adopting a draft budget that not only meets our expectations, but at the same time can be agreed on with the Council."
"The Commission only increased commitments and payments by 4% and 5.9% respectively in the draft 2006 budget, in the expectation that the Council would otherwise raise objections."
"Yet the Council still made substantial cuts, eventually reducing the draft budget from 1.02% to 1.01% of gross national income."
"Constant cuts to EU spending by the Council pose a threat to the principles of cohesion and solidarity upon which the concept of European integration is founded."
"I need hardly add that this is a source of great concern to the new Member States, including Poland."
"Such cuts also place a question mark over the implementation, however minimal, of the principles of the Lisbon Strategy, in which the new Member States also take a great interest."
"The Polish delegation in the Union for Europe of the Nations Group is celebrating a victory in the parliamentary and presidential elections held recently in Poland."
"We have read press reports from many EU Member States that wrongly state that the Law and Justice Party and the President-elect, Lech Kaczyński, are opposed to the EU."
"Some even go so far as to describe the imaginary threats that Poland and the European Union will face as a result of these elections."
"I should like to take this opportunity to state most emphatically that these threats are fictitious."
"We are in favour of the EU, even if we criticise its lack of cohesion and solidarity."
"The question I would ask is whether European integration is put more at risk by one of the many parties in Europe that voice criticism of some of the EU’s more questionable practices, or by those who are in favour of budget cuts."
"The position adopted by Parliament’s Committee on Budgets, and, we hope, by Parliament as a whole, may appear modest."
"We are quite sure, however, that it could guarantee at least a minimum level of expenditure, and one that we would find acceptable if it meant that an even smaller budget would be avoided."
"– There is an old saying that goes: ‘It's hard to tell whom to want and whom to forget’."
"This is doubly true with regard to the avalanche of amendment motions proposing increases in the budget."
"I would like to express my appreciation for the skilful manner in which the distinguished rapporteurs Mr Pittella and Mr Dombrovskis from Parliament’s Budget Committee have succeeded in coping with a virtual ‘pandemic’ of proposals for the 2006 EU budget."
"Although the Budget Committee has made every effort to consider thoroughly all of the proposed items, the resulting budget expenditure exceeds the European Council’s proposal by EUR 4 billion, amounting to an increase of nearly 4%."
"In my view, this shifting and strengthening of budgetary resources is not self-serving."
"The increase is intended mostly for areas such as structural funds, science, research and education."
"These are the areas that can really become the powerhouse of the European Union, and an influx of greater funding, if put to effective use, may have a kind of ‘Viagra effect’ on the sluggish European economy."
"However, getting support for this increase will call for considerable effort and a united stance during Parliament’s negotiations with the Council and the Commission."
"I would like to emphasise specifically the need for MEPs to exert some political influence in their parent countries in order to make their national governments adopt a positive position on the budget so that Parliament will approve it tomorrow."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commission for being here and I profoundly regret that the President-in-Office of the Council is absent, since he has been with us throughout the budgetary procedure, but just when we have a debate at first reading and we have to hold a trialogue, he has decided not to attend."
"I would like to thank both rapporteurs for being here today and for the work they have done."
"I hope that we can still find a consensus today on some of the amendments and some of the separate votes."
"It is important that we have a homogenous first reading, because we must go into the conciliation on the 24th all united and certain of the support of the political groups and the Members of this House."
"Our negotiating position is very hard this year due to two exceptional circumstances."
"Firstly, we have stretched category 4 for external actions to the maximum."
"Three such important priorities as Iraq, Afghanistan or the tsunami did not exist in 1999, when the current financial perspective started; category 4 has been badly financed from the outset and we have never been able to budget normally."
"Unfortunately this year has been no exception."
"Secondly, there appears to be no end to the deadlock amongst the Member States with regard to the financial perspective; we are at risk of reaching 2006 with no viable financial plan."
"The European Parliament must take precautions, because the application of Article 272 of the Treaty is, for the first time – I repeat, for the first time – a real possibility."
"For all of these reasons, we are presenting a draft budget which does not exceed the ceiling of the financial perspective, but which does get very close to it."
"And we are calling for an increase in payments and a use of the flexibility instrument that goes much further than the Council would like."
"My group supports Mr Pittella and Mr Dombrovskis, who have presented a very courageous and innovative draft budget to the European Parliament, and I would ask them to maintain their positions at second reading and conciliation."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Pittella and Mr Dombrovskis for their very good work."
"Mr Dombrovskis, as rapporteur for other institutions, has incorporated most of our group’s priorities into his final resolution."
"One such priority was the retention of Parliament’s budget at the 20% level of heading 5."
"If used effectively, this benchmark provides us with the stability and rigour necessary for any budget."
"Moreover, we have increased the reserve allocated to property investment and we reserve the right to utilise the EUR 20 million reduction in the contingency reserve as a capital injection for any eventual purchase of new parliamentary buildings."
"The policy on acquisition of property was very successful and made much financial sense."
"In contrast, the policy on communication and information was disappointing, since we have failed to convince European citizens that the European Parliament is representing their aspirations and their interests."
"In this year’s budget we have made available enough funds to start implementing, hopefully, an effective and citizen-friendly information strategy."
"Naturally, more needs to be done to improve the streamlining of an activity-based budget and to improve the efficiency of our operations."
"If we had to evaluate critically and objectively the impact of the ‘raising the game’ exercise, one has to acknowledge that a few of these objectives have actually been achieved."
"Realistically, however, there is no reason why, in the coming year, the administration should not achieve most of its stated targets."
"There is very little room for complacency."
"Bottlenecks should be eliminated and we have to sharpen our focus on the core operations, ensuring a more efficient use of our resources and cutting down on waste and duplication."
"Proper manpower planning, including redeployment, recruitment harmonisation and training services improvement should also be considered priorities in 2006."
"We need to initiate a prioritised plan catering for our future needs, bearing in mind that, with effect from 2009, we would have to budget over EUR 100 million per annum resulting from the Members’ Statute."
"These changes and reforms should improve the quality and performance of our institutions."
"However, in the final analysis, one has to review this in terms of the impact on the new citizens, offering them a product with added value that meets their expectations and, in so doing, strengthens the image and credibility of the European Parliament and other institutions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is by money that we show what things are worth to us."
"A look at the EU Budget, though, gives us the impression – astonishingly enough – that agriculture is some seven times more valuable to us than research and education."
"Such an outlook is false on two counts, for, if there is something that the EU regards as politically desirable, it should use the budget to provide the groundwork for it, and Europe should be investing in the future rather than subsidising outdated structures."
"It does make a difference whether, for example, one invests in nanotechnology or guarantees a farmer his income – yes, I know, the CSU is living in another era."
"That is why it is a good thing that Parliament has increased expenditure on the Lisbon agenda and slashed the tobacco subsidies."
"We need to carry on further down this road."
"Mr President, Commissioner, like all of my fellow Members, I shall begin by paying tribute to the rapporteur, Mr Pittella, who had a tough job to do with regard to the Commission."
"Mr Dombrovskis’ task was perhaps even more complicated, for he had a tough job to do within Parliament itself, there always being a difficult trial of strength between the Committee on Budgets and the Bureau, and I believe that he has thoroughly fulfilled this task, even if it was sometimes difficult to do so."
"Since my colleague, Mrs Trüpel, has focused her speech on the general budget, I should like to focus mine on Parliament’s budget so as to put down a marker because, in my opinion, we are preparing to vote in favour of a rather absurd provision."
"For the first time in its history, Parliament is abandoning the theoretical threshold of 20% administrative expenditure."
"I am not abnormally attached to this figure but, nonetheless, I am going to make two or three remarks."
"Firstly, I do not wish to let it be said in this Chamber that, at the end of the year, the Bureau might urgently contrive an injection of the capital that we were unable to use."
"That is not the case."
"What we are really talking about is a long term policy, in accordance with which our Parliament wanted systematically to inject capital in order to buy property."
"Doing so has enabled taxpayers to make a saving of hundreds – and I mean hundreds – of millions of euros, because we bought our buildings at just the right time, instead of paying absolutely absurd rates of interest."
"In its resolution, our Parliament says that we are giving up EUR 20 million."
"On the other hand, it is also saying that it is ready to lay claim once again to this money from the Council if the money is required for buying property."
"I am going to leave this Chamber in exactly four minutes to go and negotiate the sale of some new buildings for Parliament."
"It is therefore already clear that we are going to need that money."
"Consequently, I can picture the Council laughing when it sees our request for an amended budget arrive, in which we lay claim to what we are rather hastily giving back to the Council today in order to make an outward gesture."
"Making an outward gesture is a very nice idea but, in truth, this EUR 20 million would enable us to inject capital and to make substantial savings."
"EUR 20 million divided up among Europe’s citizens – I calculated how much that came to – is a good four cents that we are giving back to every citizen."
"I believe that each citizen would be very pleased to receive these four cents."
"However, we could have used those EUR 20 million to carry out another policy."
"EUR 20 million is either too much or too little."
"As it happens, this is a particularly exceptional example of a situation not making sense."
"Mr President, in order to fund EU military operations, the Council and the Commission set up shadow budgets that are not capable of being officially scrutinised."
"Using what is termed the ‘ATHENA Mechanism’, the EU Member States pay the money for the EU’s military operations into a separate fund that is specifically not defined as a heading in the EU’s budget."
"In so doing, they leave Parliament on the outside looking in and make scrutiny almost impossible."
"I have asked the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Security and Defence Sub-Committee how much money there is in this fund, but have been given no answers."
"Now, therefore, I put that same question directly to the Council and the Commission."
"This procedure is currently being used for EUFOR Althea in Bosnia, and it is intended that it should in future be used specifically to finance what the EU calls its crisis management operations, which amount to waging war."
"It is evident that the development aid budget was used to fund the EU’s questionable military and policing operations in the Congo and in the Sudan – or so, at any rate, it would appear from what the representatives of the Commission told the Foreign Affairs Committee."
"It was also stated at this meeting that the Treaty of Nice as it stands at present proscribes any independent military budget for the EU."
"Quite right too!"
"Stop using financial trickery to fund military operations by the EU!"
"Mr President, I find it very difficult to take seriously a debate about voluminous documents that only a real euro-nerd would be able to read, let alone understand."
"Furthermore, what is the point of a debate about a 2006 budget which we all know will bear no relationship to the way the money will actually have been spent?"
"The European Court of Auditors has, for good reason, refused to sign off the EU’s accounts for the last 10 years and said, in its last report, that 95% of the EU’s budget was open to fraud."
"Yet every year this House just shrugs its shoulders, sighs and looks the other way."
"That is a shameful indictment of this institution and demonstrates how pitifully useless it really is."
"Before we start debating ways to spend next year’s money, I believe we should sort out the mess that has been left behind in previous years."
"Until the disgusting state of the EU’s finances has been sorted out, this House has no business debating further expenditure."
"I call upon you all, in good conscience, to reject the 2006 budget."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the last budget for the financial perspectives and it is still fixed at a mere EUR 111 billion, which, like everyone has said - Mrs Guy-Quint, Mrs Trüpel – is a derisory sum that in no way corresponds to the multiplicity of tasks to be carried out. This obviously leads to a waste of energy on the part of the coordinators, such as Mr Garriga Polledo, on the part of Mr Lewandowski and on the part of"
"... our overall rapporteur, Giovanni Pittella, who conducted the debate with refined skill and sharp Italian subtlety."
"Consequently, year in year out, the problems remain the same: farming is under budgeted, and there continues – on the model of Krushchev in the 1960s - to be a discrepancy between the ambition of the Lisbon Strategy to develop the knowledge-based economy and the paltry amount of resources available."
"This means that Mr Pittella uses the introductory pages of his report to highlight just how pathetic the budget allocations of EUR 700 million for transport and EUR 650 million for education are."
"Even then, we remain more than EUR 2 billion below the financial perspectives."
"The cause is, of course, political but, above all, it is ideological: it is the rule according to which the budget has to be balanced in the short term, a foolishly mathematical rule that means that we do not have the resources to fulfil our ambitions."
"We should be moving not only towards a balance of the Maastricht kind, but also towards a long-term balance in the economic cycle and even towards a social balance."
"Hence, the obvious reason why the people of Europe are disappointed."
"Hence, the specific reason why, among 900 amendments, I tabled my Amendment 146, which has been endorsed by nearly all of the groups and which proposes establishing a European Mayors’ Day in order to entrench Europe in local democracy, a grass roots Europe that is to some extent a Europe of the people, characterised by solidarity and firmly rooted in its villages and in everyday democracy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what makes our discussion, at European level, of the 2006 budget so exciting is the fact that it is the last budget under the current Financial Perspective, and so, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we are determining what the fundamentals of the 2007 will be like in the absence of a Financial Perspective."
"That is something of which I would like to take this opportunity to remind the House, lest we completely lose sight of that fact."
"Here in this House, we will also have to embark on something of a rethinking process."
"I take the line that we can no longer give more support across the board, but must concentrate on what really has to be done at European level and on the question of how much money can be made available for it."
"To Mrs Koch-Mehrin I would say, further to her calculations of how much goes on research and how much on agriculture, that she should take a look at all public budgets, and then she will see what an infinitesimal amount expenditure on agriculture represents in comparison with what is spent on research."
"The German Federal budget spends far more on research than it does on agriculture."
"When the figures are added up, these all cancel each other out."
"In this case, it is we who are responsible, and this budget must reflect that."
"The Member States have more responsibilities where research is concerned, and that is why their budgets reflect that."
"These calculations do not come out like that."
"Let me make it perfectly clear, though, that if we require the Member States to keep to the stability criteria – which means making savings – that means that we in this House cannot go throwing money around all over the place."
"Not all Europe’s problems need a line in the European Budget to deal with them."
"Parliament will, in future, have to get used to making the sort of financial proposals that are the norm in national parliaments."
"If we manage to learn that lesson from the 2006 budget, then we will have achieved a great deal."
"Mr President, I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Pittella, on his excellent report."
"It is a radical report, but one to be commended for the timely emphasis it places on achieving the Lisbon goals and the need to improve the structural funds and external actions."
"I just want to make four points."
"Firstly, on information and communication: it is quite clear we need greater focus and direction."
"Therefore, I welcome Commissioner Wallström’s initiative to regenerate communication tools through the use of plan D, but stress that this will only be a success if adequate resources are made available."
"Therefore, I call on the Council to do so."
"Secondly, the biggest challenge for this year’s budget and for future financing is in heading 4: External actions."
"Given the number of new regions where the EU has had to intervene recently, combined with the frequency and the destructive enormity of the natural disasters affecting largely poor countries and not least the recent earthquake in Pakistan and India, for which it is essential we increase resources next year, I believe there is a dire need for the Council and the Commission to have a thorough rethink on how these new areas are to be funded and, at the same time, how we are going to meet our obligations in achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"The situation as regards this heading is further exacerbated by an unwillingness to be more flexible vis-à-vis the sugar regime, where it is very important for us to help poor farmers, but, at the same time, it will add more pressure in heading 4."
"Whilst on agriculture, this brings me to my third point."
"I am extremely pleased that my amendment on reducing tobacco subsidies was adopted in the Committee on Budgets."
"This is a major step forward in finally putting an end to a hypocrisy within the European Union whereby, on the one hand, we have been funding health programmes warning of the ill effects of tobacco use and, on the other hand, subsidising tobacco production."
"This totally undermines the credibility of the EU and, adding insult to injury, a vast amount of the tobacco is burnt and destroyed because it is not good enough to be used."
"Therefore, I am calling on all colleagues to support this particular amendment."
"Finally, on Parliament’s budget, I must admit that I am somewhat perplexed by our strategy – or the lack of it – as it really is a shame that ..."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Dombrovskis, Mr Pittella, Europe is currently going through a major institutional crisis, combined with economic problems which are often on a very large-scale in some EU countries and which entail, as we all know, shortcomings in their political prospects."
"Now, more than ever, our fellow citizens need to have their faith in the future, and their confidence in Europe, restored."
"Europeans need to believe in – and even want to believe in – great political projects, such as cannot be implemented if we do not provide ourselves with sufficient and ambitious budgetary resources."
"Everyone – or nearly everyone – in this House believes that the draft general budget proposed by the Council corresponds neither to the level of powers that our fellow citizens want to entrust to the European Union nor to the new tasks that the Union wants to undertake today."
"As permanent rapporteur for the Structural Funds within the Committee on Budgets, I should like to highlight the importance of these funds and the need for us to emphasise them, not only to make our action clearer to our fellow European citizens but also to bring the territories in this Europe of 450 million people more in line with one another."
"Finally, although I am delighted that we are strongly emphasising our support for research, development and youth, I should like, on the other hand, to protest against the totally inadequate sum allocated to the External actions heading: there lies the key to our credibility in Europe and to the strength of the European dream."
"– Although Parliament’s proposal improves on the Council’s proposal in terms of volume of payments, it fails to meet the economic, social and environmental needs and challenges presented by an enlarged EU."
"Let us not forget that this proposal falls short of what was envisaged in the financial framework for 2006, which was 1.08% of gross national income."
"Bearing in mind that the final figure will be between 1.04% and 1.01%, we hope that Parliament is not putting in jeopardy the already inadequate proposal that it had submitted for the 2007-2013 financial perspective."
"In spite of our broadly critical stance, we call on Members to adopt the amendments to which we put our name, which were aimed at setting up a pilot project for actions in the textiles and clothing sector, in turn leading to a Community programme for the sector, as proposed by Parliament; at setting up recovery plans for fisheries resources, in light of the social and economic impact of the closed seasons; and at promoting multilingualism, not least in the ACP-EU parliamentary assemblies."
"Mr President, Parliament’s draft budget for 2006 implies an increase of 1.04% in the Member States’ average gross national income."
"I regret that Parliament is trying to increase expenditure on a large number of items without proposing corresponding and adequate economies in other areas."
"The Council, by which I mean the Member States’ governments, proposes that expenditure be limited to 1.01% of gross national income for 2006."
"I support that proposal."
"It is the various Member States that should establish the framework for expenditure."
"The Member States and the net contributors have felt able to accept that it be done at that level."
"My basic attitude is that Parliament should have significant influence over the prioritising within this framework but that political responsibility in the various countries for how much tax should be collected lies with the national governments."
"Parliament should not constantly try to increase the budget. That is going too far."
"Parliament should confine itself to the main task of prioritising within the framework established by the Member States."
"Mr President, one gets the feeling, when listening to Mr Ferber, that it is very unfortunate that he has not yet been summoned to Berlin to take charge of the Germans’ financial arrangements in Brussels, for then a few things would change."
"It is also regrettable, Mr Ferber, that you are in a minority in your own group, and what is even worse is if, as a former lead candidate for the Social Democrats – which is what I am – you have to listen to this gentleman with his unending ‘more, more, more’ and nothing else, with no sign of comprehension that times have changed and that less might often mean more."
"As long as its current financial arrangements are as they are, this House is a living example of how to waste money."
"The fact is that, taken as a whole, the 2006 budget is yet another example of greed, incomprehension and missed opportunities: greed because of the emphasis on ‘more’; incomprehension because nobody has worked out how to do anything useful with the 90 million we had already, and as for the missed opportunity, well, that is it."
"It is becoming ever more clear to us that this Europe of ours needs real alternatives."
"We need alliances – alliances that cross Europe, alliances that are democratic, alliances that have transparency as their objective and will at last bring pressure to bear to get what is currently being done badly changed right across Europe and for the good of its citizens."
"Mr President, the first reading of the European Union’s 2006 budget serves as evidence that the European Parliament, which is a symbol of diversity and provides a forum for all views, even those as radical as the ones we heard a few moments ago, is capable of reaching a compromise on complex budgetary issues."
"Even though over 900 amendments were initially tabled, we have now agreed on a strategy that should be endorsed during tomorrow’s vote."
"We have succeeded in reaching this compromise despite the fact that 2006 is a challenging year from a budgetary point of view, for reasons that have already been mentioned."
"Expenditure has increased as a result of circumstances that could not have been foreseen at the start of the current Financial Perspective."
"Much credit is due to the rapporteurs, Mr Pittella and Mr Dombrovskis, to the voluntary coordinators of the political groups, to the advisors of these groups and, of course, to the secretariat, headed by Mrs Fialho."
"The European Parliament has thus adopted a position, both on the 2006 annual budget and on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective."
"Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the EU governments acting through the Council."
"We expect them to reach a position on the multi-annual financial perspective, and we also expect them to ensure that the conciliation meetings to be held in November on the 2006 budget will not be wasted opportunities."
"A clear government mandate is required if these goals are to be achieved, and this will be a real test of the British Presidency."
"The mandate for conciliation on the 2006 budget is a test that the Presidency will face in November of this year."
"Parliament has already sketched out its strategy."
"It is noteworthy that it includes confirmation of Parliament’s right to participate in 20% of administrative expenditure, while at the same time starting the search for ways in which Parliament itself could make savings."
"We respect the Interinstitutional Agreement, and we are taking full advantage of its legal force."
"We are also making good use of the flexibility instrument, in accordance with Commissioner Grybauskaitė’s understanding of this mechanism."
"We are well aware that consensus on budgetary issues is the good news for which the European Union’s citizens are waiting."
"– Mr President, I too should like to start by congratulating our rapporteur, Giovanni Pittella, on his excellent and – if I may say so – bold work."
"The budget for 2006 is being debated in the middle of a serious crisis of political orientation in the European Union, which was reflected in the impasse on the new financial perspectives."
"Unfortunately, the Council of Ministers – now with the draft budget – has demonstrated huge political weakness once again."
"A serious question of credibility arises now, when political priorities are being set at European level and adequate funding is not then being safeguarded for them."
"The Ministers for Finance again thought predominantly like accountants."
"We saw this in the linear reduction of appropriations with no political thought or criteria."
"Unfortunately, there was only one objective: for the overall budget not to exceed 1.01%."
"The drastically blinkered Council is addressing the budget as a lowest denominator for compromise rather than as a means of development, redistribution and solidarity and as a tool for implementing European policies."
"The question which arises, therefore, is political."
"Are the Council and the European governments getting the message from our peoples, from the citizens?"
"Do they realise that it is only by strengthening policies which target development, employment, solidarity and cohesion – especially now following enlargement – that they will respond to the needs of European society?"
"We here in the European Parliament shall vote for the amendments which strengthen the Community budget and the policies which Europe and its peoples need today."
"However, that is not enough."
"Today, Europe needs a new progressive strategy and the corresponding budget to implement it."
"Today Europe needs to break away from conservative, managerial and neo-liberal perceptions."
"We need to project a new plan for Europe and to express the real political will to implement it."
"Mr President, I would first like to congratulate Mr Pittella, the general rapporteur, and Mr Dombrovskis, rapporteur for the other institutions."
"Likewise, I wish to thank Mr Lewandovski, Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and Commissioner Grybauskaitė for the excellent level of cooperation she has shown."
"The Committee’s draft budget reflects a strong desire to improve employment and competitiveness in the EU."
"The Committee has increased Structural Policy funding by EUR 3.7 billion and funds for research and information society, education and culture by a total of EUR 243 billion."
"This is a logical continuation of the priorities in the financial frameworks approved by Parliament."
"This budget will be the last one to be drawn up under the current financial frameworks."
"The new frameworks have not yet been agreed upon, a situation for which, among others, the state currently holding the Presidency bears great responsibility."
"The main objective in the immediate future will be to establish the new financial perspective; otherwise, the work of the EU will be paralysed."
"Mr President, the 2006 budget is important because it is the last budget in the current Financial Perspective."
"This budget will also be a bridge to the next financial perspective, on which there is no agreement at present."
"Parliament, of course, adopted its own negotiating position in its adoption of Mr Böge’s creditable report last spring."
"It is particularly important to secure funding for the EU’s future from the point of view of the major priorities, which are improved competitiveness in the Union, investment in research and development, and improvements in public safety."
"By investing in research and development, we are at the same time investing in the Union’s future."
"We should not, however, completely forget the Union’s other policy areas."
"Agriculture will need a structural change in the future, but these changes must be made in such a way that agriculture can be practised in the future throughout the Union as a whole, including the peripheral regions."
"Recent times have unfortunately shown that natural disasters are becoming more common."
"The Union budget should in future make better provision for this, so that we can react quickly both within the Union’s borders and outside them."
"Mr Dombrovskis, Parliament’s own rapporteur for the budget, should be congratulated for ensuring that Parliament sets a good example by budgeting according to real needs and not according to how much money might possibly have been spent on developing various more or less appropriate new schemes and projects."
"It is absolutely intolerable that the budget should be drawn up in such a way that 20%, by a ‘gentlemen’s agreement’, should be spent every year, up to the last cent."
"An accountable Parliament inspiring public confidence drafts its budget with reference to real costs, not percentages."
"Mr President, I too should like to start by expressing my disappointment at the fact that the British Presidency is conspicuous by its absence."
"I wonder if Mr Lewis could afford to adopt a similar attitude in the British House of Commons."
"Secondly, I should like to congratulate both rapporteurs, and in the one minute that has been allocated to me, I would mainly like to talk about democracy."
"In 2004, we reached an agreement with the Council about the common foreign and security policy, in which we undertook to hold high-level consultations on the content of that policy on a regular basis."
"The Council has never kept to that undertaking; never has there been any consultation at a high political level."
"The Council now takes the view that we have breached the gentlemen's agreement, because we have put a certain amount of that money in reserve, but I would beg to differ."
"I think it is the Council that has breached the gentlemen's agreement."
"This agreement is about both Parliament’s and the Council’s administrative expenses."
"I really fail to see how one could consider the expenses of the common foreign and security policy as administrative expenses."
"That is why democracy should verify these."
"Mr President, in this cycle we have set ourselves significant targets: improved employment opportunities, better traffic, a knowledge-based society, strong cohesion, our visible presence in the world."
"The budget for next year does not support the achievement of these targets, but I truly appreciate the fact that the Council exceeded, even if only slightly, the notorious 1%."
"Therefore the Committee on Budgets, under the direction of the rapporteur, would increase next year’s payments by four billion, and we would be able to spend an extra 3.7 billion euros on cohesion policy."
"Even after the acceptance of our proposal we are still well below the earmarked amounts specified in the applicable medium range draft general budget."
"If in the second round the Council does not support this merely symbolic extra expenditure, it acknowledges that it does not take national development plans seriously, that the new Member States have failed to learn from the mistakes of the first years and that governments who believe they are able to solve their own problems by holding back on the Union are still in the majority."
"This is a big mistake."
"The economy of Europe cannot be revived by cutting down on funds spent on the Union, but by a better utilisation of the opportunities provided by the Union."
"The solution is not less, but more Europe."
"Therefore I urge you, my fellow Members of the House, to support the proposal presented to us!"
"Mr President, first of all I, too, would like to congratulate Giovanni Pitella for his excellent work and wonderful report."
"The current budget is hugely significant to Hungary and the other newly joined states."
"On the one hand, because it represents a transition to the 2007-2013 financial plan which will be defined within the framework developed by the European Parliament and will hopefully be accepted as soon as possible, and on the other hand because the representatives of all Member States have participated as equal members in the creation of this budget, from the preliminary work to completion."
"At long last, here we did not see the fifteen plus ten differentiation."
"In light of yesterday’s debates I do not think I need to emphasise the significance of this fact."
"Close cooperation was evident not only during Commission meetings, but also during conciliation sessions in the course of developing the 2006 budget and the 2007-2013 financial perspective."
"For the first time we were able to say that the 25 Member States are equal parties, that there are no differences between them."
"This is extremely important, as we can only build a common Europe if we work together."
"The main figures of the 2006 budget in respect of Hungary have been known, they had already been determined through the Copenhagen Agreement."
"However, we were able to effect certain changes in these figures within the framework of the Agreement through the amendment proposals in order to reach our common European values."
"We are particularly pleased that following a Hungarian proposal we wish to ensure a larger allocation to Serbia, demonstrating that the EU does not only impose conditions, but also rewards their implementation."
"– Mr President, I wish to make three brief political comments."
"Firstly, deleting all the appropriations from one sector, such as tobacco, does not reflect the sensitivity which our Parliament has traditionally shown to the weakest groups of society."
"Secondly, this slender budget, with a 1% limit, does not allow us to exercise policy which is worthy of the ambitions of the Europe we want."
"Major Community objectives such as competitiveness, economic cohesion, sustainable development, small and medium-sized enterprises, research and innovation – basically, in other words, all the Lisbon objectives – have fallen victim to across-the-board cuts to the budget by the Council."
"At the same time, however, there have been cuts to the authority of the leaders of Europe themselves, who got everyone's expectations up and then capitulated unconditionally to the philosophy of austerity or, to be precise, to the philosophy of miserliness, not austerity, because austerity is when you cut the excess, when you cut the waste; but when you cut back on investments in the future and in hope, that is not called austerity, it is called miserliness."
"Thirdly, we have arrived at the point today where we have just EUR 13 million in our emergency fund."
"When?"
"When all around us nature is avenging itself on man, when the frequency of earthquakes and fatal hurricanes has become the new global nightmare, we have tied our hands together instead of promoting the humanitarian solidarity of Europe internationally."
"Instead of leading, we are bringing up the rear."
"The British Presidency may finally agree with the French by the end of the year."
"With a few painful compromises, it may perhaps close the financial perspectives."
"However, the idea of Europe will have gone bankrupt, in that, unfortunately, all our ambitious objectives for Europe will have been abandoned."
". Mr President, I rise to speak in place of my colleague and fellow member of the Petitions Committee Mr Schwab, who is, regrettably, unable to be present."
"I refer to the budget estimate for the European Ombudsman, which is the Petitions Committee’s responsibility."
"The Ombudsman’s functions are of fundamental importance, involving as they do communication with the Community’s citizens and bringing its institutions closer to them."
"By examining the growing number of complaints relating to maladministration in the Community, and, where necessary, carrying out inquiries, he ensures that the rights and obligations of our fellow citizens are secured."
"His work helps to make the services rendered by the European authorities more transparent and of higher quality."
"It is therefore of fundamental importance that the European Ombudsman should be allocated sufficient funds to enable him to perform his functions as efficiently as possible."
"The Petitions Committee regards the increase in funding of 3% over against the 2005 budget as appropriate and defensible, particularly in terms of the increase in work across the board resulting from a rise in complaints and communications activity."
"The main reason why additional funding is needed, though, is in order to prepare appropriately for the accession to the Community of Romania and Bulgaria, and so we also endorse the call for additional staff to deal with enlargement."
"The budget line does also, however, make it possible for the petitioners, that is to say the members of the public to claim, under certain circumstances, the partial reimbursement of up to 80% of their travel costs from Parliament’s budget, subject to the prior approval of the Chairman of the Committee."
"Subsistence costs for hotels and other expenses can also be reimbursed."
"The Committee believes it to be necessary that such safeguards be put in place, as they have already had a beneficial effect on the Committee’s own capacities and improved its response to European citizens’ needs."
"We must not, therefore, be in any doubt about the fact that you cannot have more Europe for less money."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m."
"– The next item is Voting Time."
"Mr President, I just want to propose that we change the word ‘mutation’ to ‘recombination’ in the amendment."
"The PSE Group has indicated that it would be in favour of this."
"This is essentially just a technical change, but, scientifically speaking, you cannot prevent mutation of H5N1, much as we would like to and powerful though we might think we are."
"We might, however, have a chance of preventing recombination, so I would like to have the word ‘mutation’ changed please."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for the Doyle report on reducing harmful emissions into the environment in order to safeguard the climate."
"Today, 26 October 2005, however, the weather in Strasbourg is wonderful, spring-like and warm, and it is the same in Bergamo, my home town, as well as in Athens."
"I wonder, then, whether we should really consider climate change to be bad, because instead I think it is very pleasant."
"Above all, if China carries on polluting and thus having a negative effect on the climate, do we not want to do anything to stop imports of Chinese products if they are produced non-ecologically?"
"Mr President, I would like to point out that I followed the rapporteur’s line on the Doyle report and regard Article 175 as the right legal basis, on the grounds that Austria and Denmark have already adopted wholesale bans on the use of these f-gases, and their experiences show that alternatives to them are, in principle, technically and economically workable and that these have a far less damaging effect on the environment."
"If HFCs continue to be used in practically all new air-conditioning equipment, it is to be feared that these f-gases will become even more widespread, with a 5% increase to be reckoned with by 2010, which is not justifiable."
". I voted in favour of the recommendation for second reading by Mrs Doyle on ‘Emissions from air conditioning systems in motor vehicles’, for the following reasons:"
"1. It honours the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere;"
"2. Environmentally-friendly technologies must be used if we are to prevent climate change and the increasing numbers of natural disasters."
". I will be voting in favour of the report despite reservations."
"The legal base is an important issue."
"The proposal for a split legal base of Article 175 and Article 95 for Articles 7, 8 and 9 seemed the best solution, rather than Article 175 on its own, to maintain vital elements of a single market approach rather than renationalising the industry."
"Arguments for allowing higher standards in those Member States that want them are seductive."
"But just how far can we follow such a route without endangering wider interests?"
"I welcome the moves to limit the further enlargement of the list of prohibited gases."
"Technically it is possible, but it may be expensive, both for the consumers and for the environment, with sharp rises in energy consumption of up to 40%."
"At this stage we should leave these further bans for assessment by the Commission as to the overall impact they would have on the economy and environment."
".As regards the regulation, I voted in favour of keeping a dual legal base."
"I believe, in actual fact, that this text simultaneously pursues the objectives of protecting the environment and of harmonising the regulations to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market."
"Using Article 175 as the sole legal base would have had a negative impact on the operation of the internal market, without having any real merits in terms of the environment."
"I was opposed to expanding the list of prohibited products and equipment, in particular because of the impact assessments carried out by the Commission and because of the absence of alternative solutions in the medium term."
"As regards the directive, I was opposed to changing the dates on which the bans on the use of fluorinated gases enter into force."
"In actual fact, setting the implementation deadlines 2011 for new types of vehicles and 2017 for all brand new vehicles is a necessary step, because changing over from refrigerants involves not only developing new types of air conditioning systems, but also making structural changes to the way in which the various parts are fitted under the bonnet."
". Labour MEPs strongly support the Doyle report which seeks to contain and ensure safe use and proper recovery of F-gases which contribute to global warming."
"Cuts in F-gases will help Member States meet the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol."
"However, we cannot support those amendments to the legislation which seek to impose bans on certain F-gases without a proper impact assessment."
"The legislation provides for a review clause in article 10 and this is the proper mechanism to deal with any possible prohibitions."
".The three fluorinated gases concerned here – HFC, PFC and sulphur hexafluoride – contribute to the phenomenon of global warming."
"It is therefore important for the European Union to endeavour to reduce the use of these gases, and even to ban their use under certain conditions, which include having efficient alternatives and a specific timeframe."
"I voted in favour of the Doyle report for two reasons:"
"Firstly, as a result of the efforts already made by industry."
"In the 1990s, today’s much maligned HFC gases replaced CFC gases, which were destroying the ozone layer."
"This goes to show that the principle of substituting dangerous substances with safer ones is already a reality."
"Secondly, the use of these three gases for such varied purposes as refrigeration and air conditioning systems, fire extinguishers or pharmaceutical aerosols for treating asthma justifies a balanced approach between guaranteeing people’s well being and protecting the climate."
"Finally, I should like to point out that we can fight effectively against greenhouse gases without making a ‘purely legal’ show of the matter."
"That is why I rejected the having the ‘environment’ as the sole legal base, which would have had only one effect: that of splintering the single market into 25 different sets of legislation."
"Our businesses, our employees and our citizens do not want a nitpicking Europe."
". My comments will relate to the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases and the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on emissions from air conditioning systems in motor vehicles and amending Council Directive 70/156/EEC."
"Mr President, the regulation on F-gases is yet another example of overregulation, and it bears no relation to reality."
"What is the point of adopting another environmental regulation when statistical analysis shows that F-gases are virtually harmless, and that any negative effect is hard to distinguish from statistical error?"
"The regulation demonstrates a completely unbalanced approach to environmental and industrial development."
"The fact that it is founded on a single legal basis, namely Article 95 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, means that the functioning of the common market could be disrupted, which is an alarming prospect."
"Poland and the other Member States that have not imposed restrictions on the use of F-gases are firmly opposed to this decision."
"They believe that the regulation should be founded on two legal bases, namely Articles 95 and 175 of the Treaty establishing the European Community."
"This would allow identical requirements to be applied throughout the European Union regarding restrictions and bans on the placing on the single market of certain products containing F-gases, and would mean that the principle of the common market would not be violated."
"There can be no question that for the majority of new Member States restrictions on emissions of fluorinated gases would result in economic losses that would be out of all proportion to their environmental benefits."
". These proposals are intended to provide continuity to the negotiations on the Commission’s fresh proposal to make a significant contribution towards meeting the EU’s target under the Kyoto Protocol, as the rapporteur says, by cost-effective mitigation methods."
"Whilst these measures are insufficient in themselves, they do constitute a contribution, especially the new directive and the regulation currently under discussion."
"The old models will be phased out gradually and the Member States may promote the installation of air conditioning systems using a gas, such as CO2, that is efficient and has a low global warming potential, as stated in one of the proposals adopted in Parliament and which we supported."
"We trust that the Commission and the Council will accept it."
". I welcome this Commission proposal aimed at reducing emissions from motor vehicle air conditioning systems which are covered by the Kyoto protocol."
"I am in favour of an accelerated timetable for the implementation of this proposal overall but with a longer timetable for small-scale car producers."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for the report by Mr Florenz, whom I congratulate, because his report aims at reducing environmentally harmful noise emissions."
"In the resulting silence, governments will, I hope, be able to hear the voices of pensioners calling for higher pensions, for they have not been heard so far."
". The Florenz report will enable the Commission’s proposal relating to the noise emission in the environment by equipment for use outdoors to be adopted at the earliest opportunity."
"It would appear that the technical know-how available five years ago and the progress made since have brought new data to light that will enable us to make fresh changes to the limit values."
"The potential impact on the internal market for this equipment of a delay in amending the legislation must not be overlooked."
"We cannot allow the equipment to be forced out of the European market."
"Accordingly, the limit values of the stage beginning on 3 January 2006 should merely be viewed as a guideline."
"If the directive is published before the end of the year in the Official Journal, the manufacturers concerned will have the necessary legal certainty for their products."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Florenz report."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues are broadly supportive of the TENs projects but have abstained on the final vote because of our concerns that the increased amounts being suggested are excessive and would breach Member States' financial contributions of 1% GNI."
". This report concerns Community cofinancing for planned transport and energy networks, as part of the ‘Lisbon Strategy’ objectives, or, in other words, the completion of the internal market – with priority given to the internal market’s eastward enlargement – in which privatisation and competition are encouraged in the fields of transport and energy."
"The report suggests, for example, that so-called public-private partnerships should be encouraged. This is an instrument that has led to numerous public services being handed over to private capital, ‘by means of legal guarantees which are compatible with competition law and the internal market’, in other words, the primacy of capitalist competition in the EU, at the expense of what is known as ‘social and economic cohesion’."
"We welcome the report’s proposal to increase the level of Community cofinancing for these projects, yet the report does not say that the global financing package needs to be increased for this purpose. This is a contradiction in terms, as the number of projects subject to funding would decrease."
". I should like to congratulate Mr Mauro on his important and timely report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council determining the general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport networks and energy and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2236/95, which I wholeheartedly support."
"I especially welcome the establishment of provisions promoting the investment required for the Lisbon goals to be achieved."
"Europe must invest in transport and energy infrastructure. Nevertheless, when minimum financing rates for this proposal are determined, the financial perspective for 2007-2013 must be taken into account."
". The recommendations contained in this report should give a welcome boost to trans european networks in the field of energy and transport."
"The proposal is for a 10% increase in the budget and allowing up to 50% of cross border projects to be financed through Community aid."
"I welcome this."
". Today, another attempt has been made to misuse funds and rules that exist to solve cross-border problems."
"Trans-European Networks were intended to compensate for past shortcomings."
"State borders often appeared to hinder the construction and maintenance of fast, long-distance through connections."
"Old railway lines and roads were mainly intended for domestic travel."
"European cooperation could make a useful contribution to connections between two neighbouring countries, or across the territory of a third country between two non-neighbouring countries."
"The original cofinancing plan of not more than 10% was intended for that purpose alone."
"The contributions have now increased to 30% or 50%, and, according to Mr Mauro’s amendments, natural boundaries have been exceeded within one Member State as well."
"Were these amendments by any chance intended in his country to cover half the cost of a non-earthquake-proof car bridge to Sicily before long?"
"I should have voted against when this proposal was adopted."
"I object to the EU’s increasing interference in national administrative deliberations and prestige projects."
"If funds are available for the TENs, these could be better invested in cross-border railway connections, particularly the previously neglected connections between east and west."
". The trans-European networks are a very important instrument in creating and developing the infrastructure of the transport, telecommunications and energy sectors in Europe."
"The Commission’s proposal is to review the general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport and energy networks for 2007-2013."
"I feel that, in view of the list of 30 transport priority projects, we must establish clear rules for the granting of financial aid, in such a way that these projects can develop in compliance with other Community policy, on the basis of effectiveness criteria and transparency rules as regards the financing of projects."
"Lastly, nobody is in any doubt that this report will help us to implement measures aimed at promoting the investments required to achieve the Lisbon objectives."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Mauro report."
"We share the view that a continuous overhaul of existing legislation is necessary."
"What, however, is at issue is the political level at which legislation is to be passed."
"In terms of basic principle, we are of the view that it is the Member States’ respective national food authorities that should in the first place decide which food additives are to be permitted."
"If the food authority in a particular country judges that certain specific additives are to be permitted in connection with the preparation and sale of a food item, we see no reason why an EU directive should affect this judgment."
"Food safety and public health are extremely important issues, and EU authorities should therefore only deal with them when there are practical benefits of their doing so that also extend beyond national borders."
"There are good reasons for assuming that this report, as well as similar legislative proposals, will further strengthen EU authorities such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)."
"We have voted in favour of those amendments that emphasise that this is a minimal directive and that thus make it clear that national flexibility is to be permitted."
"We have voted against the report as a whole."
"We have confidence that the Member States’ national food authorities are fully competent to deal with this important issue in a satisfactory way."
"Our attitude naturally presupposes that goods are to be labelled with their country of origin so that consumers will be able to make active and informed choices."
"Mr President, it is quite clear that we have, since 11 September 2001, devoted most of our attention to anti-terrorism and have neglected the combating of crime."
"This misguided change of emphasis has made it possible for criminal organisations, most of them originating in non-European foreign countries, to extend their influence and become decentralised."
"Criminal activities are a source of funding – albeit not the only one – for terrorism, and so it is essential that we should again devote our attention – and to a greater degree – to fighting criminal activity and organised crime."
"Temporary cooperation by the state authorities with criminals in order to be able to combat these later on is of but little use; it is a positive invitation to more corruption and more mismanagement."
"There is, I believe, a need for shared communications structures for the police and the judiciary, with more cooperation between both individual organisations and states, along with better protection for witnesses – although support for the victims of crime must not be forgotten."
". On behalf of the Danish Social Democratic delegation, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Mr Henrik Dam Christensen, Mrs. Britta Thomsen, Mr Ole Christensen and Mr Dan Joergensen."
"The delegation has voted in favour of the bloc vote on 28 amendments."
"We are aware though, that amendment 15, point F includes the possibility for member states to use disqualification from and ineligibility for political and public office against convicted criminals."
"We are against this particular point."
"The Danish Social Democrats are aware, that the proposal concerns an issue within section IV in the TEU, on which Denmark has an opt-out."
"The June List is in favour of increased cooperation and greater exchange of information between the Member States with a view to combating organised cross-border crime."
"Decisions concerning the harmonisation of criminal and procedural laws should, however, only be taken with the agreement of the Member States and should be subject to supervision by the national parliaments."
"It must not be for the European Parliament to establish what constitute crimes, mitigating circumstances and degrees of culpability."
". We feel that organised crime, its multiple networks and trafficking activities, money laundering and tax havens, must be combated as a matter of priority."
"We nonetheless share the concerns expressed by members of our Group regarding certain aspects of this report, including the following:"
"- the extension of the definition of a criminal organisation, in the context of the fight against organised crime, to cover groups of people whose purpose is not that of financial or other material gain, circumventing the definition in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, which classifies organisations whose purpose is financial or material gain under the heading of organised crime – thereby excluding political or social motivations;"
"- the increased possibility of incriminating people in a way that may lead to ambiguity; in other words, people not involved in criminal activities could be incriminated;"
"- much remains to be done to combat organised crime, given the resources currently available, and the report advocates the creation of a ‘European Union police force’, while sidestepping the underlying causes of organised crime."
"We wish to highlight our disappointment that amendments tabled by our Group were rejected. We particularly regret the rejection of the amendment aimed at guaranteeing parliamentary control over Europol’s activities."
".Europe wants to fight against serious organised crime, the international ramifications of which strike at the heart of Europe."
"That is all well and good."
"It is indeed high time to become concerned about the damage caused by the deplorable Schengen Agreement."
"Although I am opposed to setting up a European police force – a real European FBI – it is, in actual fact, necessary to strengthen cooperation between the Member States, but to do so by fully respecting national sovereignties where the police, justice and the fight against cross-border organised crime are concerned."
"Europe does not need to provide itself with scores of Theodule-style committees whose ultimate aim is completely to strip the nation States of their sovereign prerogatives: the ability to say what the law is and to enforce it."
"Today, the majority of police information is transferred, and handled by, Interpol."
"Our Eurocrats’ obsession with superimposing a European agency on Interpol generates, over and above the inherent costs of funding any organisation, a great deal of complications, particularly in relation to the absolute desire to harmonise the definitions of punishable crimes and offences or, furthermore, the scale of their penalties."
"Let us abandon this pipe dream of standardisation and finally concentrate our efforts on a coherent fight against all types of crime, and let us begin to do so by re-establishing our national borders."
". International organised crime is a huge, and growing, phenomenon."
"How is this growth measured?"
"Which data actually reflect what is happening?"
"Nobody has a clear, coherent picture of how far organised crime actually extends. Things cannot be allowed to continue in this vein."
"As politicians, can we tolerate this situation?"
"No."
"There is an urgent need to step up the fight against international crime on European territory, for the sake of our societies in the years ahead."
"The new text on the table seeks to improve the effectiveness of the fight against organised crime."
"This text is more precise in its focus; for example, it defines relations between Europol and Interpol, and this is particularly welcome."
"I voted in favour of the Dunn report, because I believe that these measures may help strengthen the fight against organised crime."
". – The framework decision and (more importantly) the report by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs propose the adoption of a common definition of and penalties for participation in organised crime, while particular importance is attached to the responsibility of legal persons if they are considered to be involved in organised crime activities."
"Nonetheless, the legal order of each Member State has an adequate and sufficiently strict legal arsenal for combating organised crime, which is a constituent element of the capitalist system and is bred by it."
"As with the European terrorism law, these new measures, which abolish basic principles of criminal law, are being adopted so that they can be used against the grass-roots movement and democratic rights, so that repressive mechanisms such as Europol and Eurojust can be strengthened."
"Obvious evidence of this is the recent premeditated plot against the chairman of the Workers' Party of Ireland, Sean Garland, who is in danger of being handed over to the USA on charges of 'communist conspiracy in order to undermine the American dollar'."
"Already in plenary of the European Parliament we have heard an insulting speech presenting the activity of a political organisation (Sinn Fein) as organised crime."
"The communists are and always have been opponents of the crime under common criminal law which is often connected to mechanisms of the urban state."
"However, we do not accept measures which might be a pretext for the criminalisation of political activity."
"Mr President, I would like to point out that it is, in principle, the Member States that are responsible for taking the action needed to forestall the flu pandemic that is being prophesied."
"That having been said, it is also important that the Commission should coordinate them in doing this."
"It is evident from the warnings they have issued that both the World Health Organisation and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control are taking the prospect of a pandemic breaking out extremely seriously."
"Now is the time to draw up emergency plans, take the necessary coordinating action and, most of all, act to prevent panic among the public at large."
"In conclusion, I would also like to thank the interpreters for having sacrificed some of their lunch hour."
"The resolution that we have just adopted is a step in the right direction in the fight against this disease. Most importantly, it sets great store by prevention, as we have been advocating, because a potential pandemic can be avoided through prevention."
"As the text says, exchanging information is vital if we are to avoid alarmism."
"We must work with a sense of proportion, in tandem with the national and international authorities."
"Hence our calls for the Commission to provide financial support for a monitoring system, laboratory tests, research into suitable vaccines, vaccination in the Member States and financial and technical support for third countries, especially in Asia, to ensure prevention and screening at source."
"Community support must be provided, as we have been advocating, in the event of an outbreak of the disease, given that this will cause poultry breeders to lose income as they restart their operations."
"Such an outbreak will also affect a significant number of farmers and others working in or connected to the poultry sector, and will have a major economic and social knock-on effect in the Member States."
"It is therefore important to bear in mind that, quite apart from the human health problems, some countries – be they EU countries or those at the source of the disease in South-East Asia – may not be able to meet the high costs involved."
"This resolution deals with an issue that is, to the highest degree, cross-border in nature."
"There are thus good reasons for the EU Member States to coordinate the measures adopted and the political decisions taken."
"We have therefore chosen to vote in favour of the resolution as a whole."
"We wish, however, to emphasise that isolated EU measures are insufficient for getting to grips with the challenges posed by a global influenza pandemic."
"It is therefore extremely important for the EU to act in cooperation with the World Health Organisation (WHO)."
"We question a number of individual points in the report, such as that relating to the Commission’s need to prepare a comprehensive communication strategy in conjunction with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)."
"We presuppose that the EU Member States are perfectly capable on their own of communicating successfully with their people, without the aid of EU bodies."
"We believe that it is internationally recognised organisations such as the WHO that should work on global world health issues."
"Quite a few of the amendments lose sight of this and instead emphasise the EU’s international role."
"We are critical of the fact that the European Parliament is in this way exploiting an important political issue in order to strengthen the EU and its international political role."
". – Of the proposed measures for the Member States, some are right and others are pure propaganda, such as the provision of vaccines and medicinal products."
"Of course it is done without excuse, by calling on the Member States to take a stand first and to order large quantities, giving vaccine and medicinal product companies the incentive to increase their output."
"Without doubt a broader plan is needed, based on prevention, with examinations of poultry farm workers by occupational doctors and with the provision of integrated assistance (technical, financial and scientific) mainly to the countries of the Far East, where the disease has been endemic for 7 years."
"The objective is the definitive eradication of the disease in reared poultry and wild birds, species that carry and feed the pathogen."
"If these aspects are not included, the problem may reoccur in the future."
"Similarly, the new EU directive, instead of introducing stricter measures than those which apply today, becomes very relaxed on certain issues, giving the facility to large poultry-rearing companies to derogate from bans on the intra-Community trade in poultry, even in areas which have been attacked by highly pathogenic influenza."
"The EU policy, even on pandemic issues, is to use them for the profitability of big business, which is why they are 'harmful' to the grass-roots classes."
"The solution is to 'combat' the ΕU of big business and war until it is exterminated."
". A few years ago, two major deadly epidemics were looming, that of the mysterious SARS virus, which has meanwhile disappeared out of the public eye, and a possible combination of bird flu with human flu variants."
"I thought that there was far too much of a ‘wait and see’ approach to the way these were handled."
"The international movement of travellers from sources of infection was hardly checked, if at all; little attention was paid to research into the emergence of new flu variants; no preventive vaccination of poultry was carried out and the supplies of a vaccine for the mass-scale vaccination of people against already known flu variants were totally inadequate."
"I have on previous occasions in this House drawn attention to these deficiencies: I did so on 7 April 2003 and 13 May 2003, and in questions to the Commission in 2003 and 2004."
"The European Union and its Member States were then hardly prepared for a great danger that could have cost millions of lives in a short space of time."
"There was also the imminent need for the removal, on a massive scale, of birds kept by humans."
"Although those problems have not yet been resolved, this House and the Commission are now taking a different attitude."
"Those who, like the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, believe that unnecessary panic is being spread and that it is mainly the hunters of birds that need protecting are no more than a small minority."
"That is why I will be voting in favour of this resolution."
".Avian influenza has arrived at our gates, with cases recorded in Croatia, Russia, the United Kingdom and Germany."
"What assessment can we make of 15 days of crisis management?"
"We can be delighted that the Member States have taken vital emergency measures to prevent the risk of contagion in the EU by imposing a ban on wild birds, by using labels displaying the words ‘locally produced poultry meat’, by slaughtering huge numbers of chickens, by placing quotas on species and so on."
"For all that, how is it possible not to lament the lack of coordination among the 25 countries, each one keen to isolate itself from any health risks present in others, even though it was with the aim of confronting all of these risks of a pandemic that, in 2003, following the SARS crisis, Europe equipped itself with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control?"
"Stockholm ought to be the centre for coordinating and monitoring the health situation in Europe."
"It is no such thing."
"Therefore, while we wait for the Member States to be so good as to give Europe a chance where its people’s health is concerned, it is vital that we prepare for the annual migration of wild birds next spring."
"Let us hope that Europe puts these six months to good use in developing a vaccine and in making sure that all the conditions needed to encourage an outbreak of avian influenza on EU territory do not come together."
". In the vote today on the Joint Resolutions on patents for biotechnological inventions, I voted for those amendments making clear the need for a prohibition on the patenting of all human body parts, tissues and cells in their natural life state and their DNA sequences."
"There are no circumstances in which the human body and parts thereof should become a commercial commodity."
"Moreover, believing strongly in the protection of human life, including at its earliest stages, I am opposed to both destructive processes and scientific engineering which tinkers with the marvellous creation which is the human body."
"Biotechnology is, without doubt, one of the most important technologies for the future and as such needs to be backed up by an appropriate political framework. Ethical, environmental and health aspects must also be taken on board."
"One of the most significant problems in this area is that of patents."
"We believe that under no circumstances should human life, including human DNA, be patented."
"We therefore voted against all of the proposals paving the way for the patenting of genes and of life itself, and regret the fact, moreover, that in the final resolution there was a degree of ambiguity that could leave that door open to such patenting, even though its purpose was to prevent another proposal with more serious consequences."
"We stand in clear opposition to any patents covering life and knowledge that we consider a universal good."
"A further area for debate is that of ethical principles. Stem cell research should not be blocked, although we are opposed to human cloning, as referred to in the resolution."
"We ultimately abstained on the resolution, on account of its contradictory aspects in relation to our positions of principle."
".The practices of the European Patent Office are once again subject to debate before this Assembly."
"Software and computer-implemented inventions were the talking points a few months ago."
"Today, in a far more serious way which affects the foundations of our moral principles and the essence of our humanity, biotechnology is the talking point."
"Without doubt, European legislation, in failing to adapt and in allowing grey areas to exist in law, is partly responsible for the current situation, whereby permission has been given for human germ cells to be patented and opposition to a patent on embryonic stem cells has been rendered ineffective."
"This legislation has to be rapidly revised."
"We cannot, however, completely exonerate the EPO from this affair."
"It can never be repeated enough: human beings are not patentable; a human being, as a whole or in part, and whatever its stage of development, is not patentable."
"It is high time this was spelt out in a binding text."
". An emotional and simplistic approach must not be used to tackle the problems linked to human genetics."
"The European Union cannot allow itself to fall behind its international partners and hold a number of areas for research in abeyance."
"From the perspective of the great fundamental principles and the universal values that we stand for, it is crucially important entirely to rule out reproductive cloning and the risks of eugenics."
"Yet, it is just as important to define what is feasible and acceptable to carry out in genetic research, particularly in the context of therapeutic cloning and stem cell research aimed at improving human health."
"We know that the framework set out for patenting biotechnological inventions is a crucial platform for developing new types of therapy, which, for a large number of ill people, represent an unhoped-for opportunity."
".I voted against the resolution and all of the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"This text is an alibi, one extra element in a long drawn-out strategy that has no other aim than to put a stop to European funding of embryonic stem cell research."
"There have been three targeted attacks in less than nine months."
"March 2005: the Verts/ALE Group and the PPE-DE Group initiated a resolution on the trafficking in female reproductive cells taking place in Romania."
"Their only motive was to denounce cloning - including therapeutic cloning - and to demand that the EU cut off all funding for this research."
"October 2005: 73 Members wrote to the President of the Commission on behalf of Parliament."
"For what reason?"
"To attack – once again - freedom of research in Europe in the name of their beliefs, which, by the way, I do respect."
"A few of us have set about replying to this letter, and a good 127 Members have made it clear to Mr Barroso that it is unthinkable for us to exclude Europe from a crucial area of research."
"26 October 2005 and the third act carried out by these Groups: holding this resolution hostage."
"By means of this obscurantist vote, 338 Members have decided not to give science any chance whatsoever."
"This is just one more disastrous sign for genome research and for million of patients in Europe."
". Mr McCreevy made it clear last night when speaking on this subject that he does not intend to respect the Directive prohibiting any human cloning when he said that even though reproductive cloning was excluded under the directive he left the door open for the possibility of therapeutic cloning."
"In doing this McCreevy is once again giving ""the two finger"". This time to the Council of Minister and the Biopatents Directive."
"""A. Council memorandum on the common position on the Biopatnents Directive states, at point 35, that:"
"'At (a) in paragraph 2, the Council replaced 'procedures for human reproductive cloning' with 'procedure for the cloning of human beings', since it thought the adjective 'reproductive' could be too restrictive."
"It was understood that the words 'human being' referred to human being from embryonic state'."
"It would seem that Mr McCreevy is anticipating is ignoring the EU's existing Directives and anticipating the now defunct Constitution."
". This subject area is very complex technologically and morally, and while I have misgivings about some aspects of the resolution I believe that it does go some way to striking a balance between the need for research which could be hugely beneficial, and on the other hand the potential damage that this research could do to human life."
"I therefore broadly support the compromise that Parliament has reached today, but this technology will need to be kept under constant review."
"Mr President, the Klamt report, which, we, I am sad to say, approved a moment ago, can best be described as a sort of naïve wish-list, and as a description of ideological, left-wing concepts that are totally unrelated to the real world."
"Quite apart from the mandatory obeisance to the alleged blessings of the multicultural society – which, incidentally, bears no relation to what that society is doing to our cities and neighbourhoods – I am particularly shocked by the notion in this report that organised legal immigration to Europe could help address the enormous problems of bogus asylum applications, illegal immigrants and people-trafficking with which we are faced."
"As I see it, the one is completely unrelated to the other, for it goes without saying that the people and professional categories that could qualify for temporary or permanent legal immigration or for work permits are not the same people or the same professional categories who overwhelm us with this immigration problem."
"Why, in fact, would the fight against illegal immigration suddenly improve if the only things that are hampering today’s fight were a lack of political will and courage and if, as a result, the bold measures that are so necessary in our countries are not forthcoming?"
"Mr President, I have voted against the Klamt report, which contains a list of proposals that fly in the face of the interests of our own people."
"It looks as if the European Parliament is, more and more, making a speciality of voting on texts of that kind."
"It is particularly short-sighted to again seek our salvation in new economic migrants."
"We should learn from our past mistakes."
"The integration policy so far adopted in most, if not all, Member States, has largely failed."
"It follows that attracting aliens from outside of Europe would only exacerbate the problem."
"It is therefore high time that we, in our ivory towers, started to realise this."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must express my solidarity with Mrs Klamt, in view of the left’s unsuccessful attempt to sabotage the report in committee."
"As it is very clear that the amendments do not solve the problems and do not improve conditions for jobless immigrants, I agree with the rapporteur that mass regularisation is neither a way to control illegal immigration nor a way to recruit economic migrants; instead, it fuels marginalisation and widespread criminality."
"Although the ambitious proposal to set up a European ‘green card’ system is worth endorsing, a policy making entry more flexible for seasonal workers or for those with fixed-term employment will generate a catastrophic, unmanageable situation."
"For immigration to be a source of prosperity and development, rather than instability, there have to be stringent procedures and criteria."
"In addition to the immigrant having a sponsor and being able to demonstrate the ability to provide for his or her own upkeep, I believe further guarantees are needed."
"A job must be a for a migrant to be admitted."
"Providing for derogations and exceptions is unacceptable."
"I hope the Commission will submit a consistent, pragmatic proposal containing precise, non-arbitrary conditions."
"Economic migration provides an opportunity for a country, but it cannot be a panacea for all ills, from an ageing population to a labour shortage."
"That is why my group, the National Alliance or the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, abstained from voting on this report."
".I abstained on Article 6 of the Klamt report on a Community approach for managing economic migration because I believe that, although it is acceptable to allow Europeans and non-Europeans to vote in local elections, it is much less so to allow non-Europeans to vote in European elections."
"During local elections, all citizens who have lived in a European country for a given period of time – for example five years, like in Belgium – have to be able to voice their opinions on their living conditions, the way in which their towns are developed, their children’s education and so on."
"I should also like to see – again, like in Belgium – the right to vote granted to non-Europeans insofar as they make a solemn commitment to abide by what is laid down in the Constitution and in the laws of their host countries."
"The own-initiative report is part of the process of setting up a European immigration policy in which one and the same procedure shall apply in all the Member States."
"The June List believes, however, that the Member States themselves should be free to decide what form their policies on economic migration are to take and that it should not be for the European Parliament to lay down which rules are to apply in this area."
"We believe that economic migration needs not to be seen as a problem requiring harmonisation of the rules at European level. On the contrary, the Member States should deal with these issues independently."
"A Member State that, for example, wishes to permit generous rules for economic migration should be allowed to do so in accordance with the principle of institutional competition."
". The report before us contains points that we endorse."
"For example, it calls on the Commission to ensure the inclusion of all provisions of the ‘International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families’ adopted by the UN General Assembly on 18 December 1990, and urges all Member States to ratify this Convention."
"Among other aspects that we welcome is the report’s condemnation of the way in which current EU policies concentrate on the punitive side."
"The report contains some contradictory points, however, in the context of a migration policy that encourages the exploitation of human resources, especially the best qualified workers, from third countries."
"It also draws attention to the importance of clauses on migratory flows and compulsory readmission – in other words, expulsion – in the event of illegal immigration."
"We also regret the rejection of proposals tabled by our Group, expressing our opposition to ‘temporary detention centres’ and to other measures denying immigrants their freedom, condemning the setting up of ‘temporary detention centres’ in third countries and condemning the political failure of the ‘quotas’, which have exacerbated illegal immigration and the precarious work status of these workers."
".This report, which is meant to be a response to the European Commission’s Green Paper on economic migration, is nothing but a long litany of dangerous and suicidal aberrations for the nations and peoples of Europe."
"Proposals demonstrating the greatest bias towards immigration and the developing world are littered throughout the report:"
"Granting non-European immigrants the right to vote in local and European elections; relaxing the measures allowing economic migrants to enter, and stay in, Europe; approving mass regularisations as a means of creating future prospects for illegal immigrants; launching awareness campaigns on the positive impact of immigration policies and including the history of migrations in school curricula; reaffirming immigrants’ right to large-scale family reunifications; allowing economic migrants to benefit from social security payments from their host countries after they return to their home countries; and, furthermore, doing away with bank fees for economic migrants transferring money from their host countries to their home countries."
"Finally, the icing on the cake is that this report refuses to give priority to citizens of the European Union before turning to third-country nationals."
"It is always the same old story: preference is given to third-country nationals over European citizens."
".This report on managing economic migration is a web of lies, falsehoods and ideological bias."
"The wording is so excessive as to do a disservice to immigrants themselves by aiming systematically to encourage a policy of immersion at European level."
"No national government whatsoever could present such a catalogue of measures without being sent to the opposition benches at the next election."
"Mrs Klamt wants to go through European channels by keeping the people in the dark about the crime being committed behind their backs."
"Fortunately, the Council, in its great wisdom, has held on to the principle of unanimity for all issues to do with legal immigration."
"Only one example is needed to highlight the absurd nature of such proposals: ‘economic immigration can help in the management of existing migratory flows… and immigration has been proven to have positive effects on the labour market’."
"This is obviously a falsehood: the more we let in legal immigrants, the more we will see an explosion in the number of illegal immigrants, who are hoping to have their status regularised one day in the near future, as in Spain and in Italy."
"The European Parliament would be making a fool of itself and discrediting itself if it were to adopt such a report, which, if adopted, would draw to our borders millions of men and women enticed by the land of opportunity promised by our sorcerer’s apprentices."
"Mr President, I would like to call on the Commission to provide the House with an explanation, but the Commission is unfortunately absent."
"Perhaps, though, your services might be so kind as to convey this to the Commission, which I would ask to do so in the course of this week."
"The reason for this demand is Commissioner McCreevy’s statement in the course of yesterday evening’s debate on the patentability of human cloning, a statement that finds no support in law."
"The Commission’s interpretation of this point is quite simply wrong and contradicts the protocol note of the Council of Ministers handed down by the Council when the directive was adopted."
"In Article 35 of that protocol note, it is stated quite clearly that it is not only reproductive cloning that is barred from being patented."
"The Commission, which is the guardian of the Treaties, cannot, in a speech by one of its members, give an interpretation that does not concur with the directive, that is false and that contradicts the Council’s protocol note."
"It is, therefore, as a matter of real urgency that I ask your services to demand that the Commission rectify this, for if it does not there are sure to be consequences."
"Knowing that many other Members present in the Chamber take a similar view, I really do ask that this be clarified, that the clarification be forwarded to Commissioner McCreevy’s office, and that he himself, this week, should correct this error."
"I am pleased to welcome a delegation from the Verkhovne Rada, the Ukrainian Parliament, to the official gallery."
"This delegation, made up of nine Members of Parliament, is chaired by Mr Valeryi Pustovoytenko."
"They have come to Strasbourg for the eighth meeting of the European Union-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee which will be held today and tomorrow."
"I wish you and the whole of the European Union-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee a very fruitful meeting."
"The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the preparation for the next informal European Council."
"The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mr Blair, is with us for this debate and I would like to thank him in particular for the effort I know he has had to make to be here with us today."
"I believe it is a positive thing that, on the eve of the Hampton Court meeting, Parliament can hear directly from the President-in-Office of the Council his explanations of the purpose of this meeting."
"Thank you, Mr Blair."
"You have the floor."
". Mr President, colleagues, it is a very great pleasure to be with you this afternoon, here in the European Parliament in Strasbourg."
"Let me add my words of welcome to our colleagues from Ukraine."
"If we should ever feel lacking in confidence about Europe and its values, then the interest of people such as our Ukrainian friends should tell us that the values of Europe are strong and are much envied by so much of the rest of the world."
"My purpose in coming here today is to report back on what we intend over these coming weeks to be the basis of the UK Presidency."
"I have with me Douglas Alexander, who is our Europe Minister, and after I have left he will stay to answer more questions – especially the difficult questions!"
"However, I shall be here I am pleased to say for at least an hour and a half to hear both your comments and to answer some of those questions myself."
"I would also like to explain at the very outset how we want to take forward the Presidency over these coming weeks."
"On 23 June in Brussels, we set out an essential vision of how we should combat the challenge of globalisation."
"I think it is agreed generally in Europe that we need to get Europe moving and we need to get it moving in the right direction."
"The question is how we do that."
"We now have an opportunity, both in the informal summit, which is tomorrow, and then in the formal summit in December, to set out that direction and put in place the specific policies to match it."
"So, over these two summits, our idea is first to agree on the right direction for Europe economically, then, secondly, to set out some new priority areas for European action and then, thirdly, on the basis and in the context of that, to get a budget deal in December at the formal Council."
"I shall first of all come to the informal summit."
"This is what I want to come out of this informal summit."
"The first thing is that I want to get that informal summit to agree effectively on the Commission paper presented by President Barroso and the European Commission."
"That Commission paper is an analysis of the challenge of globalisation and how we meet it, both as Member States and as the European Union."
"I have to say that it is a stark analysis, but it is the right analysis."
"It shows just how great a competitive challenge we have from the emerging economies such as China and India, never mind the United States and others."
"It shows how important it is we deal with the almost 20 million unemployed people in the European Union."
"It shows how we must make our labour markets less restrictive, how we have to make sure, in the field of research and development, innovation and other areas, that we catch up with the best practice in the world."
"It shows how in areas like energy – where after all we are going to be importing within the next few years something like 90% of our oil and gas needs – Europe has to up its game considerably, and it shows also the enormous demographic challenge that we will face, with fewer people of working age, more people in retirement, and more people therefore needing to work."
"As a result, issues such as work/life balance and how we allow people both to raise their families and to work in the workplace are all the more crucial."
"The first thing we want to do at the informal summit is to get that paper agreed and make that the basis for the discussion we then have about Europe, its social model and its economic future."
"However, we also want to add some specific areas of future priorities for European work."
"I should like to mention some of those."
"In respect of these areas of future work, we are also, as the Presidency, publishing some papers today from academics within the European Union on certain aspects of the challenge we face in each of those areas."
"Those will be published and available to Members of Parliament and people attending the summit tomorrow."
"But what are the new priority areas we should be thinking of?"
"First of all, there is research and development, and innovation."
"We need to make sure that more of the European budget is spent on those priority areas, because those are the future areas for the European economy."
"We also need to coordinate better the way in which we work in these areas."
"We propose specifically a European research council that is the equivalent of the American National Science Foundation, that will support the funding of research and development projects and give us the chance in Europe to be forming the world-beating companies in the technologies of the future."
"So, one major area for future priority work is research and development."
"The second area is energy and energy policy."
"I believe it is time to develop within Europe a common European energy policy."
"For far too long we have been in the situation where, in a haphazard and random way, energy needs and energy priorities are simply determined by each country according to its needs, but without any sense of the collective power that we could have in Europe, if we were prepared to pool our energy and our resources."
"That policy should focus not on new regulatory barriers, but rather on obtaining a genuinely open energy market."
"It should deal with, for example, a properly integrated European Union grid."
"Already this is done on a bilateral basis between countries."
"Think of how much greater economic power and competitiveness we could have, if we were prepared to make sure that it was integrated on a Europe-wide basis."
"Secondly, we, like other major countries in the world, should be prepared to enter into dialogue at European level with key suppliers of energy, to use our collective weight to make our voice heard."
"Thirdly, we need to be developing clean technologies, energy efficiency and coming to some common views at least about the possibilities and perspectives on issues related to areas such as nuclear power."
"I thought certain things might get a mixed reception."
"These are areas we need to work on in future."
"The third area concerns universities."
"Let us be clear about the situation in Europe today."
"Our university sector is not competing in the way it needs to with America."
"China and India are developing their university sector in an extraordinary way."
"Looking not just at the spending of our tertiary education sector, but also where we are getting the value-added in the connection between business and university, we do not have anything like the same possibilities in Europe that they have in other parts of the world."
"Our proposal is that we task the Commission specifically to report back to the European Council next year on the challenge facing European universities, how we compete with the United States, how we get more public-private partnership into sustaining them and more graduate schools linking business and the academic world across the European Union."
"There is a fourth area I would like to suggest for priority work, and that is how we control migration, but also use it to boost the effectiveness and competitiveness of the European economy."
"We need both to make sure that we have the proper controls on illegal immigration at the same time as recognising that controlled migration can actually bring a benefit to our European economies."
"One of the papers that we published today is a paper from a French academic, Patrick Weil, who has also been an adviser to politicians in France, which points out how, ironically, those countries that have opened their labour market to those from the accession countries – the accession ten – have actually benefited economically from that opening up."
"We need to take those lessons further."
"The fifth area concerns the need to make far greater progress on what I might call the demographic or work/life balance issues."
"Now here it is not appropriate for the European Union to be engaged in substantial bouts of extra regulation and so on, but here is where the open method of coordination could work properly, in things like work/life balance, childcare and provision for people to be able to raise their family and work at the same time, in how we get the best practice in pension and social security systems across Europe."
"This would be sensible if we are looking at how we can modernise the European economy."
"The final area of priority work concerns what was called by the European Commission the globalisation fund."
"I just want to make one thing very clear about this idea."
"The important thing about the globalisation fund is that it should not be a fund that protects companies that need to restructure, or failing companies, or one that bails out companies that cannot succeed."
"What it should do, however, is protect and help people in circumstances where restructuring has made them redundant or left them facing difficulties within the labour market."
"To take an example from the UK recently, where thousands of people were made redundant at the Rover works: we did not stop the restructuring, because, I’m afraid, it was economically necessary, even though tragic for the individuals involved."
"However, we provided real help with retraining, re-skilling and finding new jobs for the workforce in order to protect not the job but the individual."
"Such a fund, if it is done in the proper way, will help rather than hinder us in meeting the challenge of globalisation."
"What we want to propose at the informal Council tomorrow is that we should agree the basic direction in the Commission paper and then, in the six areas of work I have just outlined, that we should set out how we can make progress in each of those areas in order to enhance the competitiveness of the European Union and also its social solidarity in helping people adjust to the challenge of globalisation."
"In addition, tomorrow, arising out of the special Council that we had on 13 July, we want to propose measures for a counter-terrorism strategy in order to get agreement to those measures at the December Council."
"Those should focus on things like the radicalisation of people inside the European Union, the protection of our infrastructure and, in particular, how we exchange information and protection more effectively, how we retain that, how we get cooperation between the different security and police services inside the European Union in order to protect our people better and, as the Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, said to you when he was here in the European Parliament, we are happy to deal with this under the first pillar, so that it can be part of the codecision-making process."
"If we can agree that tomorrow, then I believe that we have the beginnings, at least, of the right context in which we can get a financing deal."
"In addition to these other issues, there are outstanding dossiers, and let me just say a word about those now."
"On the working time directive, I hope we can reach agreement under the United Kingdom presidency – we will certainly try to do that."
"In respect of the services directive, we know the position taken by the European Parliament;"
"I still, however, hope that it is possible to get political agreement on the right way forward, because – and I say this in all sincerity – the services directive is a necessary part of completing the single market and it is important for Europe."
"I decided to come to the European Parliament today and was unable to attend the British Parliament – this is a sort of reminder, so thank you for that!"
"I would like specifically to say – and this may get me into further trouble – to the President of the Commission, whom I congratulate on the work that he has done over the past few months, that Commissioner Verheugen’s proposals on deregulation are an important indicator that Europe is prepared to regulate where it is in the interests of its citizens, but prepared also to deregulate where it is necessary for our competitiveness."
"This will be giving our Ukrainian colleagues an excellent example of what a modern democracy is all about!"
"When we come to the December Council, it is our intention to do our level best to reach a financing deal."
"I want to make it quite clear and I know from conversations I have had with Members from the accession countries that for all of us the European budget is important."
"As we know in Britain, there are major issues that arise in connection with it."
"However, we should remember – that is, we, the 15 Members of the European Union as was, some time ago – that for the ten accession countries, this is of fundamental importance to them."
"I acknowledge our responsibility, as the Presidency, to do our level best to reach agreement."
"I hope we can do that, whatever the particular level of the budget may be."
"I would also like to make one other point. If we are to get a budget agreement – and I know that people want it in the European Parliament and they want it in the European Council, too – we will be in a better position to do so if we have agreed an economic direction and new priorities for work, and if those can then influence the outcome of that budget debate."
"That budget debate has to make a start in this financing deal, in reordering the priorities, and it has to be able – through the review process – to give us a forward perspective of a more rational way to spend the European budget in today’s world."
"If we want our economy to meet the future challenges, at some point we have got to make sure that the budget is aligned with the economic priorities of our citizens and of our business and of our workforce."
"Finally, on external relations, in respect of climate change you will know that we had successful agreements with China and India, as well as Russia, on the issue of how to take forward a proper dialogue on climate change."
"In particular, I would commend to you the coal demonstration plant with near-zero emissions that we have agreed with China for Europe to build."
"That could be an important signal for the future."
"I am perfectly happy, in response to questions, to say more about climate change in a moment."
"In addition, we hope we can get agreement at the December Council on an Africa strategy."
"Europe can be proud of what we have done in respect of development, but the truth is we need to do more."
"We also, incidentally, for these reasons hope to secure a successful outcome to the WTO negotiations in Hong Kong."
"On the question of defence, it is just worth pointing out that, when we began the process of European defence, people were very sceptical."
"Today we have nine different European missions around the world undertaken by European forces and that shows that European defence can indeed work."
"Of course, we have had the accession negotiations with Turkey and Croatia opening."
"Our aim therefore is to get the following things done: agreement on a new economic direction; new priorities for European work in areas like research and development, energy, universities, migration, demography and so on; and a future financing deal that is fair, begins to address those priorities and gives the future prospect of being able substantially to reorder the European budget."
"We also want a set of conclusions in the area of justice and home affairs that allows us to combat terrorism and illegal immigration, whilst taking the benefits of proper managed migration."
"We want to take forward our defence, particularly the common defence policy, in areas like strategic airlift and air-to-air refuelling."
"We want to get clear conclusions in December on a development strategy for Europe in respect of Africa and to make sure that we keep to a strong process of change in order to combat greenhouse gas emissions and the environmental challenge we face."
"We came to the point a few months ago where, as a result of the ‘no’ votes in the referendums, there was a sense that Europe was in paralysis."
"If we want to get Europe moving again and in the correct direction, then we have to agree both what that direction is and the specific measures to get us there."
"If we are able, in the course of these next few weeks, to offer at least some explanation and answers to our citizens on how we meet the challenge of globalisation, how we provide greater security in an era of global terrorism and mass migration, and how we can have a foreign policy that uses Europe’s collective weight for the benefit of the citizens of Europe, then we will at least have made a start on putting Europe back together again, on the right track and moving forward."
"No one Presidency can achieve all of that, but if we can achieve what we set out here, I think it will be significant."
"I came here today in order to report back both on what we had done and what we intend to do over the next few weeks."
"I can tell you we intend to report back again and make sure you are kept constantly in touch with the deliberations within the Council."
"If I may end on this point, it is important that we make sure that, in addressing these challenges, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council work together and work together closely."
"That is our desire."
"As is obvious from the debates you have and the debates we have with you, we are not always in agreement."
"But to return to the point I made at the very beginning, it is also obvious from those up in the gallery watching our proceedings that Europe has an immense amount to be proud of and it is time we showed our citizens that the next fifty years can be as good as the last."
". Mr President, Mr Blair, ladies and gentlemen, the informal meeting at Hampton Court will, I hope, be an opportunity to hold a genuine debate on the economic and social challenges confronting Europe."
"I hope that it will not only be a debate, but also – as the President of the Council, Mr Blair, has just said – an opportunity to make decisions about the path to follow in the future."
"Last week, in Brussels, I presented to you the decisions that had been taken that very day by the Commission for the benefit of the Hampton Court Summit."
"I will not go back over that presentation. I will just point out that, in addition to a document on the economic and social challenges linked to globalisation, the Commission has also approved an initiative aimed at restarting negotiations on the financial perspectives and has contributed to a political agreement that we consider to be necessary and urgent."
"I should like to thank you for the support you have given to the document prepared by the Commission and I want to reaffirm in this Chamber, before you and Mr Blair, that we want to help find a solution to the budget issue, because if we truly want to show that Europe is moving forward, then we need to have a decision on the financial perspectives."
"In Europe, as we know, there have historically been high levels of prosperity, social cohesion and environmental protection, and a high quality of life, compared with other regions in the world."
"However, it is also true that there is a lack of social justice."
"Today, there are 19 million unemployed in the Member States of the Union."
"The gap between rich and poor is too great."
"In many of our large towns, we have serious problems relating to integration, which require emergency measures."
"The truth is that this situation is in danger of worsening in the face of the simultaneous challenges of an ageing population and of globalisation."
"Without doubt, globalisation creates great opportunities, but it also threatens certain sectors of our Europe."
"One thing is certain: maintaining the status quo is not an option."
"There is an urgent need for reforms to be undertaken and for Europe to be modernised."
"If we want to retain our European values, then we have to modernise our policies."
"That is why we are proposing ambitious reforms by emphasising the need to avert two dangers."
"On the one hand, there is the danger arising from those who believe that Europe is only, or principally, a market."
"They are mistaken, because an enlarged Europe – the Europe of 25, and more than that in the future – has to rely on a structure of social cohesion and political coherence, both internally and towards the outside world, if we want to support this project."
"We must never take for granted our great European project, but we must fight each day to strengthen it."
"On the other hand, there is the danger arising from those who believe that it is possible to make Europe a power at the same time as there are 25 micro markets for energy and 25 micro markets for services."
"If we want to make Europe a genuine power, then we have to fully implement the internal market."
"Our competitiveness in the globalised world depends on our doing so."
"I believe that the European Union has a central role to play in pushing forward these ambitious reforms and the modernisation of our social systems."
"Success depends on getting the right combination of action at European and national levels."
"We need to make full use of all the instruments at our disposal: legislation, as Prime Minister Blair said, and we are pushing for better regulation."
"There are cases where we need more legislation and others where we need less bureaucracy and less legislation."
"We cannot deliver the future European Union budget without the instruments, along with multilateral surveillance, shared experience, and all the mechanisms that we have at our disposal."
"The Commission’s executive powers, the right of initiative of the Commission, the effective use of competition rules: we have the instruments to complement and to add value to – not to replace – what we do at national level."
"At international level, too, Europe is the right level for action."
"Let us be frank: even the biggest Member States in our Community do not have the leverage to manage globalisation or to speak exactly on the same footing with other global powers."
"We are a successful example of globalisation on a regional scale."
"Our deep integration, our common policies and our shared values give us an added strength that no individual Member State can claim."
"That is why, in order to tackle poverty around the world, to project European values worldwide and to negotiate in the interests of our Member States, it is better to reaffirm clearly that we need a strong European dimension."
"I state very clearly: we need now, more than ever, a strong European Union in this globalised world."
"These instruments are mutually reinforcing; they depend on each other for success."
"In the paper that the Commission prepared for the informal summit, we put forward some lines of action."
"Let me underline some of those aspects."
"First, the creation of the globalisation adjustment fund to cope with the consequences of globalisation on those people who, for instance, are affected by restructuring."
"As Prime Minister Blair said – and it is precisely the original idea of the Commission as well – the purpose of this fund is not to protect firms that are not competitive or not economically viable, but to help people."
"At the same time as we are in favour of opening our economies, we should show that we also care about people."
"People are not statistics."
"We have to have an active policy to meet their concerns and aspirations."
"I am very thankful to Prime Minister Blair for the support he has given to this fund."
"We have also identified some areas where the partnership between the Commission and the Member States can be further explored and strengthened – areas which primarily fall within the Member States’ domain, but where the Commission can play a major role, either as an honest broker, a catalyst or as a focal point of benchmarking, of mutual surveillance, of collective action."
"For instance, as the Prime Minster said, and as we have said in our paper, we are in favour of a common approach at European level on energy."
"I will add just one more to the very good examples he gave: the important area of bioenergy."
"I believe we can do much more in that area, bringing together the fields of environment, agriculture, research and the funds we already have at our disposal."
"So there is a possibility of work between the European institutions and the Member States."
"Another area is research and development, and we hope to get the funding necessary for that to have some action at European level because we need that dimension."
"We need to ask ourselves why the best minds in Europe, and also in China, in India and in many parts of the world, go to study in the United States when we know that the best universities were founded here."
"Universities are a European creation, so why are they going elsewhere when they could be here?"
"We also need to complement action at national level with a European action for universities, for research and for innovation."
"Finally, the Commission is ready to present to the European Council a roadmap setting out the path to a modern Europe capable of delivering economic prosperity and social justice."
"So my message to the summit will be clear: if we want to keep our European values, we must modernise our policies, and it is better if we do that together."
"We should call for a personal commitment from all European Union leaders."
"We, the European institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – have to do it together."
"Also the Member States, regional and local authorities and the social partners – we have to work for this change."
"I know change is never easy, but let me tell you: inaction is much worse and much more costly."
"If we do nothing it will be much more painful than if we change now with our values and with our determination."
"I think that Hampton Court should also provide a positive message to our citizens on the role Europe can play in the world in terms of security and the projection of our values, be it in terms of development aid or the management of globalisation."
"It is important that we also define this new role of Europe in the world."
"I hope that our discussions tomorrow will allow a consensus to emerge on the scale and urgency of the challenges we face and the need to move ahead."
"I think this consensus, this common vision, is necessary."
"This new consensus is necessary to reconnect Europe with its citizens and also to prepare the ground for further progress in our European project."
"This consensus and this sense of urgency are necessary to reach agreement on the budget and the Financial Perspective, hopefully, by the end of this year."
"I thank Prime Minister Blair for the renewed personal commitment he gave to these goals here today."
"It is difficult, but it is possible and it is necessary."
"The task of responsible politicians is to make possible what is necessary."
"That is why we are now working very hard."
"We have been working very closely and very intensively with the UK Presidency."
"I want to thank Prime Minister Blair and all his staff for the very competent work they are doing and I want to reaffirm to you, the European Parliament, and to Prime Minister Blair, that we will be working hard to ensure the success, not only of tomorrow’s summit, but also of the December summit, so that we have Europe on the move again."
". Mr President, Mr President of the European Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I address you, Mr President of the European Council, quite deliberately as such and not as ‘Prime Minister’."
"While it is thanks to the office of Prime Minister that you hold the presidency of the European Union, you are there not to defend British interests alone, but rather those of Europe as a whole, and it is by the way you do that over the coming weeks and months that we shall judge you."
"This debate is being held at the right time and in the right place."
"Tomorrow, you and the Heads of State or Government will be meeting in a palace, in – as befits such as they are – distinguished surroundings."
"I hope that the name of Henry VIII is not a bad omen and will not have a baleful influence on the future of Europe."
"While it is common knowledge, Mr President of the European Council, that neither you, as Prime Minister, nor your party, belong to my – our – political family, I would like to give you a great deal of credit for being here today, here in the European Parliament, among the representatives of the European people."
"It is tomorrow, then, that the Council of Heads of State and of Government meet, and that gets the sequence of events right: first, the European Parliament in Strasbourg and then Hampton Court Palace on the outskirts of London."
"We wish you success, Mr President of the European Council, in re-establishing trust among the 25 Heads of State or Government."
"Your presence here today does indeed help to build trust, for all three European institutions are present."
"I will also say by way of appreciation that, tomorrow, the President of the European Parliament will be present throughout the day, and that too is something new."
"It ought, in future, to be taken as read that the President of the European Parliament should take part in all the meetings of the European Council."
"If you can make this a well-founded tradition, then you will be doing European democracy some good."
"We wish you success in making clear, tomorrow, our desire for a strong Europe in one world, by which I mean that we may not detach Europe from the world; on the contrary, this Europe of ours must help respond to the great problems of the world."
"One thing, though, is clear, and that is that we would be able to cope with none of these major problems were it not for the European Union."
"Europe may well not be the solution to all the great problems, but we will be able to solve none of them without the concerted action of Europeans in the European Union."
"Globalisation affects not only the economy, although that is what everyone talks about."
"Globalisation is, of course, an economic process, but, at its heart, it is about the fact that we are one world, and that represents a challenge – intellectually, morally, culturally, politically and, of course, in economic terms as well."
"If handled in the right way, globalisation has something very positive about it."
"What we are and what we do is underpinned by human rights and human dignity."
"Countries like Cuba or the People’s Republic of China will, in future, no longer be able to say that what they do – if anything – about human rights is a merely domestic matter."
"On the contrary, what globalisation signifies is human dignity for everyone on this planet, whether they be Americans, Europeans, Chinese or Cubans."
"Human dignity is shared by all; that too is part of globalisation."
"Nowadays, everything is interconnected."
"This morning, a colleague told me that the Commission, which already works very well with the WTO, could well become even more involved in it in terms of its presence on its committees."
"I cannot pass judgment on that, but that is what I have been told."
"The fact is, though, that what goes on in the WTO is not just about economics, and I would like to give an example of what I mean by that."
"I have made many visits to Morocco."
"If you walk through the streets of a Moroccan city, you will see a lot of young people, and that is of course a very good thing, but, if these young Moroccans are denied opportunities, if we do not open up our market, even to agricultural products – that can be done only step by step rather than overnight – then these young people have no opportunities in their own country, and they start knocking on the doors of Europe, as we see them doing in Ceuta and Melilla."
"That is why the World Trade Agreement is a profoundly human issue rather than just an economic one, and in addressing it we must take our political and moral responsibilities seriously."
"There is now talk of a fund, and our group asks that we take another, very careful, look at that."
"At a time, many years ago, when I was involved in the Committee of the Regions, there was restructuring going on in the steel sector, and Europe helped with that – not by means of maintenance subsidies, but by means of educational measures."
"It is of course possible to envisage something similar being done for those industries that find themselves in difficulties as a result of deregulation and globalisation, which would involve these funds being used to run retraining schemes."
"The money to do this is already there in the European Regional Fund, and it is for that reason that I ask that we take another, closer, look at this option."
"That there is a need for flexible labour markets is not a matter of doubt. There is also a need for bureaucracy to be reduced."
"Thank you, Mr President of the Commission, for putting before us a good proposal as to how this might be done."
"I ask you, Prime Minister – not in your capacity as Prime Minister but as President-in-Office of the European Council – whatever you decide tomorrow, not to take any formal decisions."
"But, whatever you might prepare to decide, in working groups for instance, you must include the European Commission."
"We will not allow an intergovernmental process to decide the future of Europe; we want the institutions of Europe to be involved in the whole process of the development of Europe."
"I regret to say that my speaking time is up."
"You are a good communicator – everyone knows that."
"If the results of your presidency at the end of 2005 are equal, in terms of quality, to your communications skills, then we will be very satisfied."
"We will then give our final answer in December or January."
"I wish you much success, which, if you achieve it, will be success for us all."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Council mentioned in his speech that discussions at Hampton Court tomorrow will touch on the combating of terrorism, and so I want to start by saying something about 7 July."
"The 7 July attacks in London were attacks on European civil society."
"They were attacks on the British people, but they were more than that; they were attacks on all of us."
"That is why your response – not only as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but also as the President of the Council – was a response on behalf of us all."
"The Labour government’s response, with an appropriate combination of rigour in public security and dialogue with the people, was the right one."
"It was one of the successes of the British Presidency of the Council, and one for which I want to thank you."
"When, though, tomorrow, you discuss the European social model, you and the Heads of State or Government will be discussing a social model that has been developed progressively in Europe over a period of 50 years since the end of the Second World War."
"At the heart of this development was the consistent coupling together, for the first time in economic history, of economic and technical advances with social progress."
"All economic and social growth went hand in hand with more social rights and greater social stability."
"That is the formula that has made the European social model such a success."
"Now there are more and more so-called economists, even at governmental level, who have been telling us for years that further economic and social progress is conditional upon the destruction of social cohesion, with lower wages, longer working hours, and fewer rights for workers and trade unions."
"To that we say ‘no’, for it destroys the European social model."
"That is the path that Commissioner McCreevy has mapped out, and we ask you, tomorrow, to close it off."
"You are right to say, Mr President, that the European internal market and its development present us with a great opportunity."
"Yes, of course, we want the free movement of services, but what we do not want is the free movement of social dumping in Europe."
"If the country of origin principle is to be used as a means of wrecking social standards, then that is not the services directive that we want to see."
"The market produces many things, but solidarity is not one of them; that we have to create for ourselves, and it is above all a task for the states."
"We, here in the European Parliament, must help them to do that."
"That, too, is what those who elected you expect."
"While Mr Poettering has had something to say about a lot of things, he has not had much to say about the summit that awaits you tomorrow."
"With that summit in mind, Mr President of the Council, I have something to ask of you: it is that you should ensure that the summit focuses on what the Commission has given us as its theme, on the fact that the fundamental precondition for a successful economy in Europe is not the destruction of social cohesion, but rather the truth that the profits that businesses make are a good thing because that is what businesses are there for, but that those, namely the workers, whose labour earns the profits, must benefit from them and keep decent jobs with decent incomes, from which they can feed their families."
"If that is the goal of the European Union, Mr President of the Council, then we Social Democrats stand side by side with Labour."
". Mr Blair, when you outlined your vision for the UK Presidency back in June, you challenged Europe’s leadership to get its policies right for today’s world: to reconnect Europe to its citizens, its citizens to the demands of a global marketplace, and its politicians to Europe’s priorities."
"Yet, six months on, as your reception here has demonstrated, many cannot, or will not, think beyond the terms of Liberal Europe versus Social Europe."
"Let me be clear."
"Over 90 % of the eurozone’s GDP is from countries whose social costs are too high."
"This poses a danger to our economic future."
"Yesterday’s solutions are no longer an option."
"It is time to realise that globalisation is not for tomorrow but today."
"It harbingers huge opportunities for wealth creation and intercultural exchange, but also cross-border challenges like migration, climate change and internationally organised crime."
"It challenges our social welfare state, and the German model, which seemed to work 20 years ago, no longer does."
"As my German friends tell me, it is ."
"If the European Union is to prosper in a global community, we must combine reform of expensive social models with a new determination to build a single market for goods, services, capital and labour."
"With more invested in research, innovation and education, the single market delivers the wealth which pays for our social policy."
"It is not an economic and social Shangri-La, sheltered from all the pressures of the world, but it caters for a common response to a common challenge."
"Let us go on to build the common policies in energy and home affairs of which you speak."
"The United Kingdom opposed these in the European Convention, and we welcome your change of heart."
"Many on the Left, particularly in this Chamber, perceive reform of welfare systems and market-opening as threats."
"But, as my colleague Bernard Lehideux pointed out last week, a free market economy and social solidarity can go hand in hand."
"Indeed, if economic Liberalism is complemented by Social Liberalism, we can offer our citizens the security, prosperity and opportunity they expect."
"It is neither the American way nor the Gallic way."
"It is, perhaps, the Third Way, which Social Democrats seek but have not found."
"Because, as Richard Crossman warned you years ago, the problem with too many on the Left is not that they lack ideological maps for the new territory they are crossing, it is that their leaders believe that experienced travellers no longer need such maps."
"President-in-Office, I do not envy your task at Hampton Court."
"But do not give up."
"The European Union is not only capable of reform: it yearns for reform."
"What it needs from the Presidency is leadership."
"Leadership must consist of more than the occasional good speech, as the British Conservatives may soon come ruefully to reflect."
"The time has come to lead from the front."
"The success or otherwise of the UK Presidency will only be fully assessed in December."
"You must convince the doubters that under your leadership Europe can live up to the high expectations you set for us."
"That means high ideals."
"What are your ideals for Europe, Mr Blair?"
"Abandoning ideology and trusting focus groups to get a government re-elected is not leadership."
"It is followership."
"Ideology gives us the moral fibre to take difficult decisions at home and stand up to thugs on issues of human rights abroad, giving us a foreign policy we can be proud of, not ashamed of; making us proud to be Europeans."
"Your difficulty, I suspect, is that some Member States doubt Britain’s solidarity."
"They see the UK like that explorer in the jungle who, when the band of explorers froze at the sight of a tiger ready to pounce on them, slowly took off his jungle boots and slipped on a pair of running shoes."
"To the colleague who whispered, ‘you must be mad, you’ll never outrun a tiger!’ he replied, ‘my friends, it’s not the tiger I have to outrun.’"
"If Britain were in the euro and fully in Schengen to show solidarity, its authority and influence would be greater."
"Mr President-in-Office, you have today confirmed your skills as a performer and a charmer, qualities that you might teach to some of our friends, my fellow countrymen, on one of your many visits to Italy."
"These skills of yours do not, however, make up for the fact that the great Summit on reviving the European social dimension now seems to have been downgraded to an amicable chat among friends on the most disparate subjects, particularly economic reform and competitiveness."
"Conversely, you still do not want to discuss the common energy policy, which is already contained in the Constitution, although its only use now seems to be to revive the old nuclear debate."
"I think you could have chosen something better to bring Europe closer to the people."
"Let us be clear, if you drop the country of origin business, I think we can have a deal, or at least we can start to discuss it and have a deal."
"If you want to do that, let us try to discuss it."
"If you do not want to drop it, I think it would be very difficult to find an agreement with this Parliament."
"I believe that in any case, even if you are trying to get a political agreement in December, you might have to wait a bit before claiming victory since we do not vote until January."
"Mr President, Mr Blair, ladies and gentlemen, it is not enough to say that we need more research and more innovation, but in my view we need to determine the subjects and direction of this research."
"Mr Blair, we should really like you to tell us what feasible concrete proposals you have to enhance Europe’s competitive potential in the fields of renewable energies, environmental technologies and energy efficiency – other than nuclear power or protecting the chemical industry giants, of course."
"That would help us to achieve a real synergy between the strategic economic benefits and the environmental challenges posed by globalisation."
"In your speech and the Commission’s we noticed a lack of any clear proposals on the international dimension of the battle for the European social model, or a strategy to promote on a global level those values of solidarity, democracy, human rights and health that everybody says they want to uphold."
"Mr Blair, we do not believe that there is a plan D or a plan B that can work."
"The real, true turning point for social Europe – and for Europe plain and simple – would actually be when you abandon the terrible idea that the European project can be revived by cutting the Union’s budget."
"It is on that point that we really would like you to change your mind."
"."
"Mr President, Mr Blair, Mr Barroso, the speech made by Mr Blair in June included at least three indisputable observations: firstly, that a serious crisis of confidence exists between our fellow citizens and the European institutions; secondly, that the idea of Europe’s having led 20 million people into unemployment needs to be changed; and, thirdly, that it would be useful to start a fundamental debate on what the European social model needs to be today."
"Everything is fine up to that point."
"On the last point – the social model – the British Prime Minister even appeared to have a recommendation to make to the whole of Europe, which he himself embodies in his own country."
"Is it not the case that unemployment in the United Kingdom has been reduced to 5% of the active population?"
"Such a success story deserved to be examined in more depth."
"What is therefore so special about this Blair model, given that the priorities of the UK Presidency are in perfect harmony with those of the entire Union?"
"What could be more Blair-like, in actual fact, than the action plan of the Lisbon Agenda, revised in 2005?"
"Yet the fact is that, in the United Kingdom, unlike in other Member States, the majority of these reforms have already been, or are due to be, carried out in full."
"It therefore seemed a good idea to my group, before the extraordinary meeting at Hampton Court takes place, to discover how this pilot experiment carried out by a 21st century liberal Europe is assessed by those it affects most – the British themselves."
"We therefore listened for two whole days last week in London to what members of the main trade unions, members of feminist movements, members of Parliament from the Labour Party and employees of British universities had to say."
"The least that can be said is that what we learned does not lead us to believe that this type of model might enable the Union to overcome the peoples’ disaffection with Europe."
"Turning our attention, now, to the matter of employment. Our speakers listed the numerous devices used to bring down unemployment figures."
"Hence, the United Kingdom has more than two million people classed as suffering from long term illness and others classed as being unable to work."
"As if by chance, only 2% of people are classed as unable to work in a well-off town in the south of England, while in the poor region of South Wales, the equivalent figure is 32%."
"Our speakers also told us that there is a enormous lack of job security, particularly for women, three-fifths of whom work part-time in underpaid jobs with no prospects, while the men suffer some of the longest working hours in Europe."
"The extent of poverty was another aspect of the situation highlighted by our British friends."
"In addition to a large number of unemployed and working poor, one female pensioner in four lives in poverty in the United Kingdom."
"Child poverty has even reached the staggering figure of 54% in inner city London."
"On the subject of public services: although no one denied the increase in spending that has taken place over the last three years, we were told – and I quote – that the benefits offered, and methods used, in the public sector have been modelled on those of the private sector, with profitability as a concern."
"Ten thousand hospital beds have thus been done away with in the last eight years."
"Summing up the general feeling, one researcher told us that, in our society, citizens are all too often left to their own devices, faced with market forces."
"Go on, laugh, ladies and gentlemen, I am talking about what the representatives of the social forces in the United Kingdom told us."
"Go on, laugh."
"On the other hand, a wonderful breath of fresh air of humanity came to us from our meeting with the trade unionists who organised an illegal solidarity strike this summer at British Airways involving the 800 male and female immigrant employees of the US sub-contractor Gate Gourmet, all of whom had just been made redundant so that their jobs might be filled by other, less costly, employees."
"Together they fought back and won, and dignity too prevailed."
"Mr President, it is our conviction that the notion of the European social model is too precious to be tarnished."
"It does not sit well with the cold and detached laws of the market."
"When people finally sit up and take note of this obvious fact, then, and only then, will Europe fare better."
". – Mr Blair, in your speech here in June I could scarcely believe what I was hearing."
"You said that the people were blowing the trumpets around the city walls, that unemployment was 20 million and that productivity rates were falling behind the US, and you pledged to peel back bureaucracy, which was music to eurosceptic ears."
"Perhaps that is why you have chosen Hampton Court for the summit tomorrow: Henry VIII was, after all, the first English eurosceptic."
"So what has happened since?"
"Well, the Commission announced it was going to stop 68 new laws, and then yesterday we were told that a further 200 pieces of legislation would be repealed over the course of the next three years."
"So it all looks rather encouraging."
"However, the truth is that it is all window dressing; it is a game of smoke and mirrors and the clue was Commissioner Verheugen’s comment that better regulation is not deregulation."
"The European Commission will not give up its power; there will be no real economic reforms."
"Since 1497 the British Parliament has made 25 000 laws."
"Since you became the European Council President, no fewer than 2 500 legislative instruments have been passed."
"Unless you can find your way out of that maze at Hampton Court tomorrow, this will be your legacy and proof that Europe is not working!"
". Mr President, I would like to thank the Prime Minister for meeting with us again today."
"I would also like to thank the President of the Commission for being with us."
"Having listened to some of the contributions from both the Prime Minister and some of my colleagues as presidents of groups, the situation could be summed up in words such as ‘meeting the challenge of globalisation’ and ‘exploiting the opportunities that it brings’."
"In reality, when we look at what we have to deal with at the forthcoming European Council informal summit, there should be four guiding principles towards that: solidarity, generosity, responsibility and capacity."
"The solidarity in question is to ensure that there is protection not only of the social model, as we see it, with the basic tenets of what that social model should contain, but also that there is solidarity with our fellow Member States and those who require the most income now and the most transfer of wealth to assist them in the redevelopment and upgrading of their infrastructure, systems and markets."
"There should be generosity, by the richer and larger Member States, towards the smaller States to ensure that they are protected and are given the opportunity to exploit these new advantages."
"There should be capacity, to ensure that we can deliver on behalf of our citizens, because whatever ideology you speak of, whatever ‘-ism’ you want to put to it, the real test of political work, the real test of new legislation, is about improving people’s lives on a daily basis, making sure that the lives of the ordinary man and woman on the street are better, that they have employment, social security, a proper health service and a proper education service."
"These are the real issues that should face us as we go forward."
"Finally, we should put the negotiations on the financial perspectives into a smaller context, because – whatever the percentages involved – the responsibility, the capacity, the generosity and the solidarity that I spoke of are equally as important in that area."
"But let us not overturn an agreement on the common agricultural policy that was made in 2002."
"Let us ensure that we do not drive against one section of society for the so-called benefit of other sections of society."
"Farmers and agricultural workers have had a difficult enough time up to now."
"I say to you, Mr Blair: Be strong, be firm, be true, but most importantly of all, be not afraid."
"To paraphrase George Bernard Shaw: some men see things as they are and wonder why;"
"I dream things as they should be and say, why not?"
"Mr President, as the first British Conservative to speak today, I should like to welcome the Prime Minister to Strasbourg."
"It is good to see you, Sir."
"Like your predecessors, John Major and Margaret Thatcher, you came to power determined to set aside the legacy of British ambivalence towards the EU."
"Yet, like them, you soon came up against the hard knocks of reality."
"Like them, you were forced to realise that the aspirations and ambitions of the EU are entirely contrary to British interests."
"You were welcomed in 1997 by European leaders, who believed that you were the man, finally, to bring Britain into the heart of Europe."
"Yet you never dared to face down the hostility of the British people towards the euro and now you never will."
"Your offer of a referendum on the EU Constitution torpedoed the whole project; it led directly to the French referendum and to the ‘No’ votes in France and Holland."
"Last June you made a very successful speech in this Chamber, yet your Presidency has run into the sand."
"You have little or nothing to show for it."
"You are here to survey the shattered wreckage of your broken European dreams."
"Your own Labour MEPs have opposed your modernisation agenda at every turn, notably on the working time directive."
"It may be New Labour in Westminster, but it is old Labour in Brussels."
"So I should like to offer you a positive and constructive suggestion: depending on the outcome of the current Conservative leadership contest, it seems very likely that Conservative MEPs will leave the Group of the European People’s Party, perhaps as early as Christmas."
"It is too leftist and federalist for most Conservatives."
"For your part, you must be sick to death of the old-fashioned Socialists of the PSE Group, so why not pull your troops out from the PSE Group and apply to join the PPE Group?"
"I am sure that the PPE leader, Mr Poettering, will look very favourably on your application."
"After all, Mr Poettering is about as New Labour as they come!"
". Thank you very much, Mr Helmer, for those constructive thoughts."
"If indeed you are the future of the UK Conservative Party, we look forward to a long term in office!"
"Let me try and respond to the points that have been made, and, as Henry VIII said to his wives, ‘I will not keep you long’!"
"If I can begin, first of all, by welcoming very much what President Barroso said; obviously I agree strongly with it."
"The Presidency and the European Commission have been working carefully on the Commission paper that is the subject of our meeting tomorrow."
"I shall try to deal with some specific points and then come to one general point."
"In relation to what Mr Poettering was saying, I agree entirely with the point on the WTO; it is very important, and everyone understands we cannot get immediate change fundamentally to the common agricultural policy, but it is important we get a forward perspective of change."
"In respect of the fund, I think we are in agreement: if this fund is about helping people cope with the consequences of globalisation, that is a good thing."
"If it is simply about propping up companies that have failed, that is obviously not something we want to do."
"But it is very much the former and not the latter."
"Secondly, in relation to what Mr Schulz was saying: first of all, can I thank you very much for those words about 7 July and the terrorist attacks in the UK."
"It means a lot to my country to have you say that; thank you."
"In relation to the social model, I hope I can answer some of those points in a moment, but I would say again, right at the outset, that we should never destroy social solidarity."
"What we should always do is make it relevant for today’s world."
"That is the purpose of what we are doing."
"In respect of the point that Mr Watson was making: I agree that I do not think it is choice between a liberalised Europe and a social Europe in that stark sense."
"I hope that the Commission paper and the new areas of work that we are proposing can get people out of feeling that they have to choose so starkly between the two."
"Ms Frassoni, – that is about the limit I am afraid!"
"You asked at an earlier meeting and again today about the areas in which we would cooperate in research and development."
"I said to you then that biotechnology is one very clear area."
"This is a major area for the whole development of healthcare and for business in the future."
"Europe should be a leader in biotechnology, and if we are not careful we are going to be overtaken even by countries like India."
"Environmental technology is another area."
"I want to give one example that I think people would have been deeply sceptical about 20 or 30 years ago."
"It took some imagination from people at that time to put the concept of Airbus together."
"Over these past few years, we have gone from a position where Boeing was literally completely dominant in the market to a situation where Airbus today is a European venture of which we can be proud and which is competing with the very best anywhere in the world."
"Sometimes it helps if we pool together in Europe our research, our development and our innovation across Europe in order to get the scale of challenge that we need implemented."
"If we are able to do that, and if we are able to meet the scale of the challenge in the way I have suggested, I think, in other areas, too, we can develop world-beating companies across Europe."
"Mr Wurtz, I do not know who your interlocutors were in the UK, but I will give you some new ones when you come next time, if you do not mind!"
"Let me just say to you, in respect of unemployment, that we have two million more jobs in the UK. The New Deal for the Unemployed is the biggest programme of any country in Europe to tackle unemployment."
"We were the government that introduced for the first time, in the teeth of Conservative opposition, a statutory minimum wage."
"We have the working families’ tax credit and other help for the low paid."
"We have lifted 700 000 children out of poverty and two million pensioners out of acute hardship, and our public services have meant that we have the best school results, and falling hospital waiting lists, for the first time in 20 years."
"That is a very good social record."
"However, I have to say to you that it has always been my experience in politics that at a certain point there are parts of the Left that join forces with the Right to decry modern progressive governments."
"Mr Farage, you talked about Commissioner Verheugen’s agenda for getting rid of redundant legislation and, as far as I can make out, you actually applauded what he was doing but thought that he had used the wrong terminology."
"I do not really care what terminology he uses, but it is important, when the European Commission is getting rid of unnecessary regulation, that there is a place, as I said to you in our meeting earlier, both for better regulation and deregulation."
"Sometimes, Europe needs to regulate, and then it is the correct thing for Europe to do."
"But Europe should only regulate where it is necessary and Europe should not interfere in areas where it is unnecessary."
"I think that is the right position for us."
"Mr Crowley, I heard what you said on the common agricultural policy."
"Again, I understand."
"Of course we are not saying we can change the whole system overnight; what we are saying is that we should in the future have a different perspective for reform."
"I want to finish on this point: there is a responsibility on the UK Presidency and the Council; there is a responsibility, of course, on the European Commission."
"However, globalisation, if we are intelligent about how we handle its consequences, is not a threat: it is an opportunity for us."
"Yes, it is true that, when you go to China and India, you are struck by the sheer size of the scaling-up of their industry and their business."
"Incidentally, it is no longer true that China, India and other countries like them are competing on the low-value-added goods and services."
"They are now competing at the top end of the market as well – it is true."
"That does not just apply to China and India, incidentally."
"There are countries such as Vietnam, for example, that a few years ago people thought of in a completely different context, but today it is an emerging economy."
"All of this is true."
"It poses a huge competitive challenge, but it also poses a huge competitive opportunity for us because those countries are going to need financial services; those countries are going to need technology; those countries are going to be importing goods as well as exporting goods."
"We have to have the confidence in the European Union to overcome that competitive challenge."
"It is not a question of abandoning social solidarity."
"If we end up having the debate in those terms, it will lead absolutely nowhere."
"No one is going to believe that it is right for the European Union to abandon its social dimension."
"I support the social dimension in Europe, but it has got to be one that enhances our competitive challenge for today’s world."
"Why?"
"Because, if our businesses are not succeeding, if our workforce is not competitive, if we do not put people back into jobs, what is the social dimension?"
"It can only be a true social dimension if it enhances the prosperity, the living standards and economic future of our people."
"That is what this debate is about."
"So, of course, in the modern world, with the single market being completed, it is true that there will be competitive challenges as our markets open up, but there will also be opportunities."
"Yes, it is true in today’s world that there will be delocalisation; that will happen."
"However, we can re-train, re-skill."
"We can give people support in finding new jobs."
"We can, for example in areas such as work/life balance and the social security systems, find new and better ways of supporting people."
"This is not a process about abandoning the social dimension of Europe; it is a process that is about change."
"And change, after all, is what the European Union has always been about."
"The European Union should be the institution, above all, that can be confident about changing."
"It was change that led to the European Union."
"It was change that led Europe, in the wreckage of war, to decide that its future was going to be different to its past."
"Look what we have today: countries living and working together in solidarity."
"The answer to anybody – British Euro-sceptic or Euro-sceptics from other countries – is ‘look at this Parliament today, the different countries that are here, the accession countries freed from tyranny and dictatorship, here, as part of this Parliament’."
"Why should we not be confident?"
"Yes Sir, and your country is now in the European Union thanks to the strength of Europe!"
"Of course, we can make this competitive challenge work for us."
"We, in Europe, who have managed to overcome war and disease, who have created 50 years of prosperity – are we really incapable of modernising our social model in the way that we want?"
"Of course not!"
"We can do it, and we can do it if we have confidence."
"We can do it if we are prepared to face up to challenges in a realistic way."
"And we can do it if we listen to our people."
"What our people are saying to us today is something very simple about Europe."
"They are not saying – which is why I disagree with Euro-sceptics – ‘we do not want Europe’."
"They are saying ‘let Europe answer the concerns we have."
"We are worried about globalisation, we are worried about security and terrorism, we are worried about the threat to our environment’."
"Let Europe be relevant on these issues."
"That is how we rebuild support for the European Union."
"I said to you when I came to this Parliament back in June that the first vote I ever had was in the referendum on Europe."
"I voted ‘yes’ and I have never regretted it."
"I am a pro-European, I have always been one and I will remain one."
"But it is the pro-Europeans that need to lead the case for modernisation and change."
"Do you believe that the Euro-sceptics want change?"
"They would delight if Europe did not change since it would allow them to replay what is essentially a narrow nationalist argument within the frame of making Europe more effective."
"That is why it is up to us to take these measures forward."
"Tomorrow, we will have the informal summit."
"Let us agree the Commission paper."
"Then, let the action follow, not just from the Council and the Commission, but from here in this Parliament too."
"Let us act together and make a Europe relevant to its citizens a reality."
"We can do it."
"We can do it if we have the confidence, the belief in ourselves and the courage to make the changes our citizens want."
"That is what I say and that is what we shall do."
"Mr President, I am sorry that the Prime Minister has had to go."
"But, speaking, as I do, for the real and responsible Conservative delegation of MEPs who believe in constructive engagement in this House and in Europe, I want to thank the Presidency for the Prime Minister’s statement."
"He gave us a shopping list in June, but he has not informed us today of the safe delivery of the items on the list."
"Instead, he has produced another shopping list for us, merit worthy though it may be, and I want to know – and I am sure his minister will answer this – when delivery will take place."
"A common energy policy was referred to by the Prime Minister."
"It seems to me that is a reversal of a previous position and I would like some clarification on that."
"When the Prime Minister was here previously, he stated in this Parliament: ‘The people of Europe are speaking to us."
"They are wanting our leadership."
"It is time we gave it to them.’ I very much welcomed those comments but I am bound to say that they seem to have failed their test."
"Indeed, the Prime Minister is reported to have said that his own Presidency has stalled."
"Others across the political spectrum have lined up to express disappointment with the lack of progress."
"I welcome the agreement on proceeding with care in accession negotiations with Turkey, and it is important that we send a signal to the people of that country, but the rest of the agenda seems to be stuck in a rut."
"The Council will discuss economic reform and the challenges that the EU faces with globalisation tomorrow, but where are the concrete proposals from the Presidency?"
"Where is the answer to the real challenge that Europe faces from India and China?"
"Where is the leadership on the Doha Round?"
"The Prime Minister says that it is progress on liberalising world trade that we need, but the process seems to be bogged down in a failure of political will on the part of the EU."
"Where is the leadership on the future financing of the EU?"
"Surely, it must be understood that the United Kingdom and others have vital interests."
"Is the Prime Minister prepared to defend those?"
"Could he or his minister tell us what the position is?"
"Does he agree with the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Prescott, when he said that Britain was ready to do a deal with the British rebate without any fundamental reform of the CAP?"
"Where is the leadership on the future of Europe?"
"We thought that, during the ‘pause for reflection on the Constitution’, we might have had some answers, but we have not."
"I said at the outset of the Presidency that it should be judged not by rhetoric, but by results."
"There are two summits to come on the Prime Minister’s watch, so there is time to make real progress between now and the end."
"We had hoped that the rhetoric of his speech in June would now be matched by some solid progress."
"Sweeping difficult problems under the carpet for future presidencies to grapple with is not the kind of leadership we have been led to expect from the Prime Minister."
"Time is short, winter approaches."
"We wait for some real results."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mrs Wallström, Mr Blair, ladies and gentlemen, many Europeans are concerned not only about the path taken by globalisation, as Mr Blair said, but also about the path taken by European policies."
"They now believe that Europe is not really protecting them against the worst effects of international competition and sometimes even that these policies are attacking their social rights."
"The Hampton Court summit must respond to these concerns; it must send a clear signal that the European people are determined to defend their social model and therefore to stop setting it in opposition to competitiveness."
"No, contrary to what the Prime Minister claimed before this Parliament in Brussels four months ago, it is not the European social model that is responsible for the 20 million unemployed in Europe, it is the weak growth in the large countries in the Eurozone, the lack of coordination between the budgetary and monetary policies, which do not support internal demand and investment, and the lack of investment in research and innovation."
"On this latter point, I see that we are in agreement."
"I also note, however, that you have given up on this rhetoric, which was supposed to be a boost to your presidency but which has instead lead to stagnation, to a degree of isolation and to the risk of getting bogged down."
"Indeed, it is not by destroying the social model that we will restore the competitiveness of our economies and create confidence in Europe, but rather by placing the emphasis on Europe’s strengths, on the quality of its infrastructure, including the communication and energy infrastructure, as you mentioned, on the skills of the workforce, on better coordination between research centres and universities, on a common industrial policy in the sectors of the future."
"That is why we would prefer to emulate the policies pursued by the Nordic countries: more investment in research, more rights to life-long training, maintenance of a high level of solidarity and redistribution, and high-quality public services."
"Their success shows that there is, in terms of competitiveness, an alternative to the destruction of collective protection systems and a reduction in the level of solidarity."
"They show that reform is not necessarily synonymous with regression."
"Reform and modernisation of our social systems will only be accepted and understood by the citizens if they bring new protection, new opportunities and new weapons for all to face competition, change and globalisation."
"If reform and modernisation mean aligning our social systems and our economies with the harshest market economies, this will contribute neither to the confidence of the citizens nor to support for the reforms."
"That is why it is vital to negotiate them with the social partners, and to relaunch the social dialogue, with the aims of harmonising rights to the highest level and ruling out social dumping between Member States, and that is why we are in favour of an internal market in services, but against the Bolkestein directive, which is aimed less at an internal market in services than at a weakening of the social model and of services of general interest."
"Finally, there will be no dynamic Europe without an ambitious financial perspective."
"It is vital to reach an agreement within the Council without further delay, particularly for the Member States, and we are delighted at the announcement of an agreement on a number of directives adopted by Parliament at first reading and now blocked: the Working Time Directive - but we hope that this agreement takes the same direction as the European Parliament’s vote at first reading, in other words abolishes the opt-out, and I am sure you will tell us if this is the case – the Temporary Agency Workers Directive, the revision of the European Work Councils Directive to increase employees’ rights when faced with restructuring, and, finally, the drafting of a framework directive on services of general interest."
"With regard to deregulation measures ..."
"Mr President, in June, Tony Blair shared with this House his ideas about the EU budget of the future, which would have fewer agricultural subsidies and spend more on research and education."
"I am obliged to him for saying this."
"Even though this reflected both reality and the way the public feel, it was a bold thing to say, and the reactions of the other Heads of Government are evidence of that."
"I do ask you, though, to keep to your priorities; they are vital to our future, and when people like Gerhard Schröder criticise, remember that he has been voted out of office and no longer has a mandate to speak for Germany."
"Today, the MEPs belonging to the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe welcomed Tony Blair with placards bidding him ‘make EU laws in public’."
"In so doing, we are responding to another of his announcements, which was that he intended to make the Council’s sessions open to the public."
"We ask him to make that announcement, too, reality."
"Just do it!"
"We are waiting for you."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I regret that Prime Minister Blair has seen fit to go and spin to journalists rather than listen to this whole debate."
"When the Prime Minister spoke to us in Brussels in June, he said that the UK Presidency wanted to resolve difficulties with the services directive, the working time directive, and to take forward a budget deal."
"Today he said exactly the same about these very difficult issues."
"At this late stage in the UK Presidency, it seems an empty presidency."
"We have zero progress and continuing uncertainty."
"Still no budget for 2007 and it is not only in the accession states that this is a major concern."
"The UK Government proposals would lose Scotland one billion pounds in structural funds and lose Objective 1 funding for Wales."
"We have uncertainty in our rural communities because the UK has suddenly withdrawn support for the agricultural funding package only recently agreed."
"We have uncertainty, too, about what will take the place of the now dead Constitution."
"Zero progress."
"What a contrast with the recent presidencies of Ireland and of Luxembourg: small, successful, independent nations whose achievements in their six months in office were immense and excellent examples of the independent status which I believe would be best for Scotland and which my Welsh and Catalan colleagues also aspire to for their countries."
"Zero progress, it seems, until the December summit."
"It seems to me that to store up so many difficult unresolved issues for one formal summit agenda is a recipe for potential disaster."
"In closing, may I just say that the final act of the UK Presidency will be to chair the Fisheries Council in December."
"Can I make a plea that for once – just once – the UK Government makes the survival of Scotland’s coastal and island communities an economical and social priority, not something to be sacrificed at the negotiating table?"
"Thank you for your outstanding speech to us in June, Mr Blair."
"If you offer the whole of the British rebate, you will not get a budget compromise by December."
"There will be no feather in your cap from the old Brussels centralists and champions of agricultural subsidies."
"For them, you are too modern."
"For us, you are not modern enough."
"What we miss hearing is a declaration on your part that the Constitution is dead and buried and a statement calling on us to start afresh and to allow supporters and opponents of the Constitution to draw up a common discussion paper. We should then directly elect a new Convention which would draw up either one or two proposals which would then be voted on in referenda in all the countries simultaneously."
"In that way, the voters would decide our common future, and we should obtain that distribution of power between Member States and the EU that the voters want to see."
"You could then use your last months as EU President to guarantee transparency in Council meetings and to ensure that elected representatives have access, upon demand, to all the documents from the 300 secret working parties in the Council of Ministers which adopt 85% of all legislation behind closed doors."
"You could also compel the Commission to publish the names of the members of the 3 000 secret working parties that prepare our laws."
"Give the elected representatives some insight into the laws and into the work that goes on."
"Two hundred out of a possible 220 members of the European Convention endorsed making everything open unless it was closed, in contrast to the present situation in which everything is closed unless it is opened up."
"All the elected representatives put their names to this, as did 23 out of 28 governments, but not Great Britain’s, even though Peter Hain would have liked to have appended his signature."
"He was unable to do so on behalf of Mr Blair’s Foreign Ministry."
"As EU President, Mr Blair can cut straight to the chase."
"Only a simple majority is required to change the Rules of Procedure in the Council so that, in the future, everything is open unless a qualified majority decides on an exemption."
"It is a very simple proposal, signed by 20 of the present 25 countries."
"Have you the will to put the proposal to the vote?"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just as he did in June, President-in-Office Blair has again today given a speech full of good pro-European proposals."
"Today we have heard clear statements on strategic sectors for reviving the European economy, including energy, research and infrastructure."
"However, they are just words, because everything depends on agreement on the financial perspectives. In that respect – despite the reassuring statements – we are not convinced that there is the determination needed to bring the talks to a conclusion."
"In addition, too little was said about the new European social model, particularly on the eve of a Summit that is supposed to be dealing precisely with that."
"Above all, we are not convinced by Tony Blair’s enthusiasm for reviewing the working time directive, which runs the risk of becoming a tool for contractual blackmail against a growing mass of atypical, temporary workers."
"Nor are we convinced by his enthusiasm for the so-called Bolkestein directive, which in its current form just threatens the rights of workers and consumers while creating a mere 600 000 jobs in the best-case scenario: an elephant giving birth to a mouse!"
"To conclude, Mr Blair was unconvincing on the European social model and, if he had not snubbed Parliament a little by leaving …"
"Mr President, Mr Alexander knows that I know that he is not very good at answering questions."
"However, I shall have another go."
"What is the UK Government planning to do about the institutionalised looting of public funds that has gone on in this place over decades? EUR 600 billion – according to the Court of Auditors itself – has been unaccounted for since the UK joined, and that is five times the contribution that we have made over that same period."
"On Mr Blair’s desk in Downing Street, there is a letter recommending that the UK Government set a time limit to complete the basic reform of the EU’s accounting procedures so that they comply fully with international financial reporting standards."
"Simultaneously, the UK should declare that failure to do so within that time limit should signal the UK invoking the Vienna Convention on Treaties."
"Meanwhile, the UK’s GBP 1.25 million an hour should be diverted into an escrow account."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, having, a few days ago, posted the President of the Council as missing, I wanted to say ‘Welcome back!’, but there he is, gone again."
"I hope we will not have to wait until December for him to return to the European stage."
"The reason why I announced that he had gone astray was that I think he is too reticent, too self-effacing, in his approach to public European debate, to the seeking of answers to the questions the public ask and to the problems that we face."
"There is, I think, a lack of active presidency at Council level."
"Although I think the one he gave on 23 June was better, we have, today, heard him deliver his second good speech, with the right analyses, vague suggestions and plenty of announcements."
"I have to tell you, Mr President, that you are now well over half way through your presidency, and your record to date is not one of success; you still have much to do to make your presidency of the Council a successful one."
"To do that, fine rhetoric and polished speeches will not be enough."
"I urge you to give the European Union the power to do what you demand of it; to give just two examples, we are not responsible for the universities, nor for national energy policies, yet these are things that you demand that we deal with."
"Give the European Union the funding to do what you demand of it, and to implement those things that you have had a share in adopting."
"Take it from us: the Böge Report is evidence of the lack of agreement with Parliament on the Financial Perspective, because we want to be able to do the things we are obliged to do."
"As we see it, the social market economy is the European social model, and the period of reflection on the Constitution begins now rather than on 30 June."
"Get back to meeting the people where they are, get Europe afloat, take action!"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would firstly like to say that I regret that any progress on the Financial Perspective should be put back until December, because I feel that it is dangerous to have to work in a hurried fashion."
"You know that this will have repercussions for the policy of economic growth, for solidarity with the new Member States, for investment in innovatory policies and for the strengthening of social justice and competitiveness within the context of globalisation."
"Not for agriculture, since that must be paid religiously, being an obligatory expense."
"I would also like to congratulate you, however, because we have returned to something essential from a previous era, a principle that was used during the era of the so-called ‘Jacques Delors’ financial packages."
"First we define and agree on the European Union’s political priorities ― we would like to do both at the same time ― and then, as the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Blair, has pointed out, we agree on the necessary financial package."
"But this will remain nothing more than words if we carry on with the straitjacket of a percentage, because the accounts will not square with all the priorities that have been mentioned."
"It should perhaps be deduced from Mr Blair’s words that the figures that have so far been bandied about in the Council are going to be renegotiated."
"I believe that we must act consistently with what we advocate and provide the necessary financial instruments."
"In June, this Parliament carried out its duty as budgetary authority."
"I believe that you now have the serious responsibility to do yours and to seek a common position within the European Council, because the saying is true: ‘What is not in the budget is not in the world’."
"Unless all of our words and priorities are accompanied at the same time by a political will and by the necessary funding, they will be of no use whatsoever."
"I would like to end by saying:"
"I agree absolutely that Europe is moving in the right direction."
"The bodywork is the Constitution, the engine is the euro and the petrol is the budget."
"Mr President, Europe has broken down."
"The constitution has broken down."
"The budget has broken down."
"The inspiration has broken down."
"And the UK Presidency has to take some, albeit not all, of the responsibility for this crisis."
"You prevented an agreement being reached on the Financial Perspective in June, and it seems, so far, that the only achievement of your Presidency of the Council will be the opening of negotiations with Turkey, as if vision has been replaced by a headlong rush into the future."
"Mr President, you will not resolve this crisis without reaching agreement on the budget of the EU."
"You will not resolve this crisis without the prospect of strong, democratic institutions."
"You will not resolve this crisis with less Europe."
"Above all, you will not resolve this crisis by giving the impression that Europe can be limited to economic agreements or to one large market."
"Europe is primarily a political project."
"Mr President, Europe is expected, within the Union by all those who know that it is the only possible response to globalisation, and outside the Union by all those who aspire to a better balance of power in the world."
"Do not disappoint them!"
"Stop disappointing them!"
"Mr President, I wish to begin with the Services Directive."
"I also hope that the message has got through to the Presidency that there are many in this Parliament who believe that services of general interest – important though they are for social cohesion and social mobility – do not belong in the scope of that Directive."
"Secondly, on energy: presumably, a common energy policy will include very dynamic movement on eco-efficiency; what lead is the Presidency giving on that?"
"What shift in the budget will move funds to renewables in order, at least, to put them on a par with nuclear energy?"
"It is true that it is essential to make progress on climate change, especially if we want to make progress on poverty in Africa."
"How, then, is the Presidency linking issues on climate change to other issues, for example within the Lisbon Agenda, promoting, I suppose, things like a really radical training strategy in order that our workforce can cope with climate change?"
"Lastly, what action will the Presidency be taking in terms of globalisation to drive standards up on an international level in the labour and environmental spheres?"
"Mr President, I believe that the summit on globalisation organised by the British Presidency, which will bring together the Heads of State or Government of the EU Member States, is an extremely valuable initiative."
"Globalisation is a new form of political, economic and cultural colonialism imposed by rich countries upon poor and less-developed countries."
"One of the greatest threats it poses is the inefficient use of the Earth’s natural resources."
"The European Commission has proposed that a special fund be set up to combat the effects of globalisation."
"The question I ask is whether this fund will also be used to support research and development work into environmentally friendly technologies and to promote environmental responsibility among businesses, including multinationals."
"It is to be hoped that tomorrow’s summit will be one of the factors that enable the EU Member States to launch a long-term policy of measures to prevent the undesirable effects of globalisation."
"Mr President, Mr Alexander, there can be no doubt that the European Union is in urgent need of honest debate, such as that which will take place at Hampton Court, and I believe that this summit was a good British idea."
"I should like to make two points in response to the questions raised in the letter sent by Prime Minister Blair to his guests."
"In order to create more jobs and growth in Europe, all we need to do is to deliver on the prosaic promises we made 50 years ago."
"By this I mean equal access to an open labour and services market."
"I propose that such issues should be dealt with first, before moving on to Europe’s hazy political future."
"Is it possible for us to achieve more together?"
"The answer to this question is a resounding yes, but our achievements will depend on the extent to which we believe in the European project."
"This belief is inextricably linked to the existence of an open labour and services market to which everyone has equal access, and to the old Member States demonstrating solidarity with the new EU Member States in budgetary terms."
"Reluctance to complete the common market or to adopt a budget based on solidarity will undermine belief in the European project in those countries where such belief is currently strongest, for example in countries such as Poland."
"Please remind Mr Blair of this link, Mr Alexander, and ask him to keep it in mind and make it clear to other guests at Hampton Court, even though some might regard this as blackmail."
"Mr President, I read on the official website that this European Council will look into measures to better safeguard the safety of the European citizens."
"According to the media, at this summit, the French and Spanish Prime Ministers will be presenting a joint initiative for a major immigration policy in Europe, and it is about this that I would like to express some concerns."
"After all, with its mass regularisation policy, the Socialist Government in Spain is responsible for the dreadful events around the Spanish enclaves in Morocco and it has to be said, in all honesty, that both countries’ immigration policies have failed."
"What we need, therefore, is the simple confirmation that our continent is not an immigration area, that our Member States today are already being affected by enormous problems as a result of the presence on our territory of millions of immigrants who cannot be assimilated."
"We should respect the will of our citizens and offer Turkey a privileged partnership instead of opening accession negotiations with a country that cannot, unfortunately, be called European in any sense whatever. That would be a good start."
"Mr President, when we listened to Mr Blair’s speech in June, we said to ourselves that everything was going to change."
"In reality, it has taken Mr Blair four months to present us with proposals, proposals with which we cannot fail to agree because, in any event, they are already part of our own plans."
"When he talks about research and development, energy, training, immigration controls and the challenge of democracy, there is nothing new in Mr Blair’s proposals."
"It is nothing but empty rhetoric."
"From one grand speech to another, Europe in crisis is slowing down, while the world is moving very quickly."
"Thank you Mr Blair!"
"Mr Blair’s Presidency is an absent one, a Presidency that makes no proposals."
"So, in concrete terms, what progress has been made since July?"
"I have looked everywhere, but I have not yet found any measures that respond to the expectations of the citizens."
"There has, it is true, been the opening of negotiations with Turkey, but the citizens of Europe did not really want that ..."
"In June, Mr Blair lamented the fact that only two of the top 20 universities in the world are in Europe, but what has he done in practice to change that?"
"Mr Blair stated that research was the cornerstone for remaining competitive."
"We totally agree, but what are his specific proposals?"
"What is he actually going to do to stop the brain drain?"
"Finally Mr Blair, what have you done to make Europe more popular?"
"We do not want Europe to be sacrificed on the altar of government stinginess!"
"A budget on the cheap will never be accepted in this Parliament; and it is not a question of exchanging the British rebate for the CAP, but of finally giving Europe the means to match its strategy."
"We cannot build the European Union with nothing but dreams and grand speeches."
"I am afraid that Mr Blair has paid too much attention to Shakespeare who said that ‘ambition … rather makes choice of loss than gain which darkens him’."
"Mr President, I am sure Mr Blair will be flattered by Mrs Grossetête’s belief that he is ‘super Tony’, able to click his fingers and the whole of Europe will be transformed overnight, and that he is a dictator and therefore able to get the other 24 Member States to do what he wants overnight."
"I, however, would like to welcome much of the progress made by the Presidency, particularly its involvement with Parliament and the constant attention by ministers to the wishes of Parliament."
"I welcome the progress that has been made on justice and home affairs and the very personal commitment by the British Home Secretary to involving Parliament on data retention and making this a first-pillar issue, which is a huge step forward for relations between the Council and Parliament."
"I welcome the progress made on Africa; the progress made on better regulation, particularly continuing the six-Presidency programme in relation to that, and the first commitment of the Presidency to work with the European Commission."
"I welcome the progress on enlargement, particularly opening negotiations with Turkey."
"We know that was a very difficult decision, that there are many Member States with genuine concerns, and it is a great credit to the British Foreign Secretary that he was able to keep that process on schedule."
"It would have been a disaster for Europe if it had faded away."
"We have opened negotiations with Croatia, and I notice that the British Deputy Prime Minister is there today furthering those negotiations, and we are making progress in the Balkans."
"Clearly, I welcome what the President-in-Office has said today, particularly about energy policy because, as the acting President will recall, it was something I made reference to at the Labour Party conference."
"It is our failure to get the single market fully completed that is important, as well as transport infrastructure and energy infrastructure."
"What is missing in Europe is that we have a delivery deficit."
"Governments have got to put their money where their mouth is and deliver on their promises."
"I hope that will happen at the summit."
"Member States will be made to realise Europe will only progress if they do what they promised to do."
"Mr President, I have to admit that Prime Minister Blair’s speeches have a certain seductive appeal."
"After hearing the speech he gave to the House in June, and his concluding speech today, I should like to start by saying that I regard Prime Minister Blair as one of the few real statesmen in Europe."
"Yet he took his charm with him when he left, and my comments will therefore be of a somewhat different tenor."
"There are increasing indications that the outcome of the British Presidency will be bad news for the European Union."
"This begs the question of what steps the British Presidency intends to take over the next two months to ensure that genuine progress is made on at least two issues."
"The new Member States too regard the Financial Perspective as problematic, since they will suffer as a result of it."
"Does the British Presidency have any idea how these countries could be compensated for the losses they will incur?"
"The second point I should like to make is that the European Union needs a political dimension."
"What proposals will the British Presidency make to the European Union in this regard?"
"Mr President, I would firstly like once again to acknowledge the significance of an excellent speech given today by Mr Tony Blair in the European Parliament."
"Firstly, because it was a highly political speech and we need political speeches in the European Parliament, because they make a change from our routine and because at the same time they undoubtedly have the capacity for renewal and regeneration, which is something I believe we must not underestimate."
"We could go on to say many things but we must not in any way undervalue or play down the importance of Mr Blair’s speech this afternoon, nor the speech he made on 23 June of this same year."
"I would like to say that, above all, I welcome the fact that he identifies certain priorities, certain problems and, at the same time, he indicates what leadership means, that is to say, the capacity to chose, to synthesise and to concentrate the political efforts that the European Union must make."
"Having said that, what we need is for that list of problems not just to be accepted by Mr Blair, but also by the Council that will take place this weekend in the United Kingdom."
"Secondly, it should be stressed — and this is what I felt was most lacking in Mr Blair’s speech — that, between the significance of the orientations he has indicated and the actions to be taken, there is an element which he has not mentioned: he must make an effort to define the political role that the European Union must play in relation to these issues, as my colleague Mr Karas pointed out a few minutes ago."
"Orientations are not enough and actions are not enough."
"There is an intermediate stage: to define the European Union’s role in the fight against terrorism, in immigration and in universities."
"And that means an effort by the Council, and the European Council must urge the European Union to give up some of its competences, some of its sovereignty, so that the European Union and its institutions can play the role that unquestionably fall to them."
"Finally, it is my hope that this excellent speech, which I do not undervalue, will not end in just one more frustration at the end of this six-month Presidency of the European Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to use the minute I have been given to send some direct messages to the British Presidency, beginning with the image used by Mrs Dührkop."
"If we want to move forward, as the President-in-Office of the Council has proposed, we need a motor, which is the euro ― and we must remember that the most competitive country in the world, since we are talking about the economy, is Finland, which is in the euro ― we also need a fuel, which is the budgetary agreement on the Financial Perspective and, furthermore, we need a chassis that works, which is fundamentally the Constitution."
"With regard to the areas that Prime Minister Blair has raised, research and development and innovation, they are in the perspective, and, in these fields, the greatest cut has been made; energy policy, this can be moved forward, since it is not a Community field; the universities, they are not;"
"Erasmus, yes, can also be increased; and immigration, which is very important: we must promote the European Borders Agency, re-admission agreements and assistance for Africa."
"Finally, in the fight against terrorism, there has been a change of position since 7 July;"
"Minister Clarke said here that if the Constitution were to move it to the first pillar that would be an important step."
"I therefore believe that the British Presidency has a great opportunity to present proposals aimed at making these objectives a reality."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the contents of Mr Blair’s speech about tomorrow’s summit, but I would ask the Council to pay particular attention to one key issue, already central to both Mr Blair’s and Mr Barroso’s speeches: the extent to which the Union’s economy will suffer because of our society’s ageing population."
"The demographic rate and working population of Europe are falling in an alarming way and, according to figures published only yesterday by Eurostat, the only way to overcome this deficit is through immigration."
"The birth rate of 1.5 children per couple is well below the natural replacement level of two children for two parents."
"The working population in 2020 will be 20.7% less than in 1980, which is the equivalent of 20 million fewer workers."
"The population of Europe is growing older: in 2020 there will be 19.1% more elderly people than in 1980."
"All that has a negative effect not only on health, pensions and public finances, but also on the prospects of growth in Europe, because we are losing dynamism."
"The reasons are many, but among them surely is the failure to safeguard and promote the family, the fundamental building block of society and a fundamental value of European civilisation."
"We are finding out that disregarding our values has not only a social, but also an extremely negative, economic impact."
"Such conditions would appear to make the Lisbon objectives difficult to achieve."
"What, then, should we do?"
"We need to return to the values that inspired the founding fathers of Europe to realise a dream that is in danger of being shattered just as it is about to come true."
"That is why, if we truly wish to create a new European social model, each institution must rely on the central importance of the individual."
"This social model should take as its inspiration the principles of the social market economy in which competitiveness, competition and the role of free initiative and of entrepreneurialism as a whole should have as their main aims full employment and the welfare of society."
"Much must be done to create balanced growth, including the need to review – and I agree with Mr Blair here – our energy choices, and to devise financial and project instruments."
"In the coming weeks, the Council, the Commission and Parliament will have to face difficult issues: the liberalisation of services, the Financial Perspective and agriculture."
"If they set out, however, without a strategic plan based on the values on which our society is founded, then all their efforts will be in vain."
"Mr Blair is right when he says that we have a great legacy to uphold."
"Let us do so in a way that does not destroy it."
"Mr President, the fight against organised crime and terrorism is one of your Presidency’s main preoccupations."
"When the UK’s priorities were presented in June, I reminded you that our fellow citizens want a protective, generous Europe of solidarity and that, as a consequence, the delicate balance between freedom and security must be maintained."
"This principle is still on the agenda for the directive on data retention."
"I welcome the efforts of your Presidency to promote codecision with Parliament."
"We have risen to the challenge and we are working towards an agreement at first reading."
"However, we are keeping a close eye on a number of points that are very important to us, in particular the protection of data in this directive."
"Only strict access rules and criminal penalties will enable us to guarantee that the retention of data does not have a detrimental effect on the liberty of our fellow citizens."
"Mr President, I was one of those who appreciated the Presidency’s speech, but I am afraid I was neither seduced nor convinced."
"I was not convinced there was any prospect of delivery."
"What the Union needs is not beautiful words, but concrete delivery and for that a multiannual budget is a burning and immediate need."
"Two-thirds of the way through this invisible Presidency, we are still where we were in June."
"Hopes rose in the new Member States."
"Today they are disappointed and worried because of the gap between promise and performance."
"Lack of budgetary perspective hampers their efforts and long-term economic programming, and deprives them of the benefits of membership."
"The 2004 enlargement needs to be equipped with the financial tools to bridge the gap and to sustain social and economic cohesion, based on the principle of solidarity."
"In June we heard about political leadership."
"The expectation of many was that there would be such leadership on budgetary questions."
"Are we any closer to a satisfactory solution?"
"We heard about a confident Europe looking at enlargement as an historic opportunity to build a greater Union."
"Can we really have more Europe with less money, if any money at all?"
"Why is the budget not on the agenda at Hampton Court?"
"The EU’s credibility is at stake here."
"The deadlock needs to be broken."
"We are running out of time."
"How to face the challenges of globalisation and the social model?"
"You intend to discuss in Hampton Court whether the Union is equipped with the proper financial instruments."
"That is putting the cart before the horse."
"Instead of delivery we have vision."
"Vision without real content is an illusion, and not much use to our citizens."
"There are two months left, President-in-Office, to fulfil the promise to take us forward to the budget deal."
"Our appeal to you is to use all the skills of the Presidency to deliver a budgetary perspective."
"There is a Polish proverb: he who gives quickly, gives twice."
"The European Parliament has delivered a decent, reasonable, bigger budget."
"This is not ideal but good, better than what the Council is able to deliver, if it can deliver at all."
"Why can the Council not take it up and approve it?"
"Please think it over."
"Mr President, permit me to continue where my predecessor left off."
"I very much agree with the British Prime Minister’s assessment that the structure of the European budget is outdated and no longer reflects the modern needs of the European Union."
"I am pleased that, at tomorrow’s informal meeting, the UK presidency will propose some strategic changes in this direction."
"I will be delighted if the Financial Perspective itself reflects this new consensus in European politics regarding priority tasks."
"However, as a representative of the new countries, including Slovenia, I feel it is my duty, to emphasise that attempts to formulate new priority tasks in the budget should not be used as an excuse for postponing the adoption of the Financial Perspective in December."
"Indeed it is essential, particularly for the new countries, that the budget be adopted as soon as possible, since otherwise we cannot properly draft our own budget programmes for the successful securing of finances from European funds."
". Mr President, on behalf of the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, I thank you for this opportunity to address Parliament on the wide range of issues that we have covered in the course of our afternoon, looking ahead to the informal meeting of Heads of Government that will take place at Hampton Court tomorrow."
"Not least because of the timing of this afternoon’s debate and discussion, it has been, I would argue, both a timely and a useful debate on the strategic issues facing Europe in the years ahead."
"These are issues that go to the very heart of how Europe faces up to globalisation and, as our Prime Minister concluded, both the threats posed by globalisation and, just as significantly, the opportunities."
"The United Kingdom Presidency, be clear, is keen to find a consensus on that future direction of Europe and to see that the views expressed here today by Members of this House are reflected in proposals in this area."
"I pay tribute to the leaders of all the political groupings we have heard from today for setting out their views so clearly and directly."
"I should also like to thank President Barroso for his contribution to the discussion."
"The substance of his input, together with the Commission paper to which he referred – the paper on European values in a globalised world – are testament to the extent to which Member States and the Commission share a common vision and, indeed, a common sense of urgency with regard to the important issues facing us today."
"I would ask Parliament’s understanding if I do not respond to every specific point raised during the course of this long but important debate."
"Instead, let me try to address the main themes that were raised by as many of the speakers as time allows."
"With the greatest of respect, I fear that Mr Kirkhope’s remarks reflect the risks of writing a speech in reply to a speech that you have not yet heard, in the sense that he was questioning the commitment of the Presidency in terms of the specifics that would be taken forward."
"Our Prime Minister made very clear, on behalf of the Presidency, not just the significant achievement relating to Turkish accession – about which I will say more in a moment – but also the importance of sequencing the debate about the future of Europe with the issue related to future financing of Europe."
"On his specific query as to where that would leave Britain’s national interest, I would simply tell this Parliament that the challenge facing Britain is the same as any Presidency, that we need to seek consensus across Europe, as I have suggested, but that consensus will necessarily and appropriately include the British national interest."
"Mr Désir raised important issues in relation to energy infrastructure and universities."
"I certainly noted with interest the points raised in relation to the services directive."
"Those are just some of the contributions that will inform our ongoing discussion of that issue."
"Mrs Koch-Mehrin, who appears to have left her place in the Chamber, talked of the importance of other priorities alongside R[amp]D and in particular the issue of transparency, which has been raised both within this Chamber and in a number of other fora involving our Prime Minister today."
"Again, I would report to this House that there was a formal discussion amongst the Permanent Representatives of the issue of transparency on 19 October."
"We made clear at the outset of our Presidency that we were keen to seek to make some progress on this issue, and that progress is ongoing."
"However, the discussions have already begun, as was shown by the debate held at COREPER on 19 October."
"Mr Hudghton raised, in the characteristically warm style for which he is famed, the claim that the British Presidency had made no progress whatsoever."
"I will merely point out that the prospect of Turkish accession has been held out to the Turkish people for 42 years."
"It ill behoves anybody in this Chamber, whether they are for or against Turkish accession, to undermine the historical significance of what was achieved back in Luxembourg."
"Given my responsibilities in answering for the Presidency today, I will resist the very great temptation to engage with him on the range of issues that, as a Scottish nationalist, he sought to bring to the attention of Parliament today."
"I would simply say – and I do so as a fellow, proud Scot – that the contribution he made to this debate today would not easily be confused with a ray of sunshine."
"In reply to Mr Bonde, I hope that I have addressed his point about transparency already."
"In relation to Ms Angelilli’s point, questioning whether there is enough commitment to seek a deal on future financing, I would simply reiterate the points that our own Prime Minister made earlier in our discussions today, making it clear that we believe both that it is necessary to have the discussion on the future of Europe at Hampton Court tomorrow, and that this discussion is an essential prerequisite for the progress that we are determined to try and make in relation to future financing."
"Mr Mote, who appears to have left the Chamber – perhaps that was a reflection on how I have sought to answer his questions in the past – raised the very specific question of corruption."
"The Presidency is working with the Commission and other Member States on the Commission’s paper ‘Roadmap towards a positive statement of assurance’, a package of measures to reform the Commission’s accounting system, making it easier for the Court of Auditors to give the accounts a clean bill of health."
"Our hope is to see agreement at the November meeting of Ecofin."
"Mr Karas sought an ‘open and public debate’."
"I would argue that what we saw today in Parliament was exactly that: a frank debate on the importance of a range of issues ahead of the Hampton Court meeting."
"On other issues, specifically competence over universities and future financing, I listened with care to the very specific points that he was making from his own group’s point of view."
"Mrs Dührkop Dührkop recognised the need for discussion on direction with reference to the issue of future financing, but again I would simply reiterate that we are very clearly of the view that the right sequence is to have the direction of Europe set before the future financing issue is addressed."
"I sense some scepticism from colleagues in Parliament as to the viability of that process."
"Again, I would simply recollect a previous British Presidency in 1992, where Presidency proposals on future financing were tabled in the November prior to a deal being agreed in December."
"Mrs De Sarnez raised the same question."
"She claimed that it would be very difficult for us to resolve the budgetary issue."
"I would simply reiterate that, if we are not able to resolve the question of the future direction of Europe, it makes the challenge of resolving the future financing of Europe commensurately more difficult."
"In relation to Mrs Lambert’s points, specifically on climate change, let me be very direct in terms of the progress that we wish to see."
"We wish to build consensus around the threat of climate change and the need for urgent action to tackle it."
"That is why on 17 October the Environment Council, under our Presidency, agreed an initial European Union position for the United Nations climate change negotiations in December."
"We are keen to provide a solid foundation of work for the European Union’s medium- and long-term climate change strategy, and a range of Council formations and the European Union’s external summits are contributing to that end."
"Finally, we seek agreement on the need for cost-effective, flexible solutions to tackle emissions from EU aviation and, as the Presidency, we welcomed the recent study commissioned by the Commission, which recommends emissions trading as the best solution."
"We are planning an initial discussion at the December Environment Council on these issues."
"Mr Piotrowski and Mr Szymański both spoke about the challenge of globalisation and raised important issues that I think will inform the discussions taking place with Heads of Government tomorrow at Hampton Court."
"Mr Van Hecke raised points on Turkey with which, with the greatest of respect, I simply disagree."
"I speak not only on behalf of the Presidency, but I am glad to say a unanimous General Affairs Council, which was consistent with the previous undertakings agreed at the December 2004 European Heads of Government meeting and was able to open those accession talks for full membership of Turkey back on 3 October."
"Mrs Grossetête acknowledged, I am glad to say, the precise historic significance of that point and of the opening of accession talks with Turkey."
"But in seeking, I sensed, to criticise the British Presidency, she said: ‘We cannot put Europe together with dreams’."
"I would respectfully suggest that we have much more hope of building Europe in the direction we would wish if we do so on the basis of our hopes and dreams, rather than simply our memories and our past achievements."
"As our Prime Minister very eloquently put it in his summation of today’s debate, if you look at the future challenges that Europe faces, whether on the issue of climate change or the issue of securing prosperity and sustaining social protection in the face of the challenge of globalisation, it is not difficult to make a case for the importance of Europe’s work over the coming 50 years."
"I therefore do not think it is inimical to the interests of Europe to consciously assert the future challenges that we face."
"I would argue that it is a surer foundation on which to build popular support for Europe than a simple recitation of past achievements."
"Mr Titley generously recognised and acknowledged the work of the Presidency with Parliament."
"I am not sure whether the current attendance in Parliament is a reflection on the relative interest in the Prime Minister’s remarks and those of Britain’s Europe Minister, but nonetheless I am grateful and will pass back to my fellow ministers his kind words."
"Equally, I am grateful to him for recognising the point I have sought to make already in my contribution, which is the truly historic significance of the opening of accession talks with Turkey."
"I was also very glad and grateful to hear the honourable Member raise the broader issue of Africa and the important work that has been taken forward under the British Presidency in relation to that issue of major international concern."
"In that regard, I would emphasise the importance that the Presidency, alongside the Commission, attaches to the important work that still has to be done in relation to development issues at the vital World Trade Organization talks in Hong Kong in December, towards the end of the British Presidency."
"All of us who during the British Presidency have worked so hard to secure further action on both debt relief and on aid payments now see this as being a vital and important opportunity which must be grasped if we are to make progress on the third vital area for development, which is of course the issue of trade."
"Mr Geremek also raised the issue of future financing and let me say very directly that, in the light of what our Prime Minister has reiterated today, I do not think it is the appropriate stage for us to be discussing the compensation being offered to new accession countries, the so-called A 10, given the failure to reach agreement on future financing."
"Now is the opportunity to rededicate ourselves and commit ourselves to the genuine endeavour of securing agreement on future financing, which of course is important to the country holding the Presidency and indeed every Member State. But I recognise that it is particularly important to those Member States that have joined the European Union recently."
"Mr Mayor Oreja asked broad questions about Europe’s future role and, specifically on the question of terrorism, wondered whether we would be able to translate the broader areas of work set out by our Prime Minister into action."
"Again, I would suggest to Members of this House that is exactly why we have commissioned the paper – in order to translate those broad areas of work into concrete achievement in due course."
"Mr Barón Crespo raised the question of the constitutional treaty, which provides me with the opportunity of reinforcing one of the original ideas behind the Hampton Court meeting, which this discussion anticipates."
"We were very clearly of the view, in the light of the decisions reached by the voters in France and the Netherlands, that it would be the wrong response simply to mechanistically continue a discussion of institutional architecture, when in fact probably the most accurate description of the vote – certainly in France and I would respectfully suggest also in the Netherlands – was that it related to both the text and the context."
"It would be wrong for us therefore simply to have addressed the question of the text when there is the broader question of how Europe is engaging with globalisation, to which our citizens are demanding an answer."
"That remains the inspiration and the intention behind the meeting that will take place tomorrow."
"Mr Tajani raised a number of important points, as did Mrs Roure."
"Let me end, however, by reiterating the importance of the point made by Mr Saryusz-Wolski, namely, the issue of future financing."
"As I say, I have sought to make clear on the floor of this House today the importance that we attach to finding agreement on future financing if we can at the December Council."
"However, in support of that contention let me also mention the letter our Prime Minister, as President of the European Union, sent to his colleagues inviting them to join him at Hampton Court tomorrow."
"He said, and I quote: ‘I know that a number of colleagues are concerned to know how the Presidency plans to take forward the future financing negotiations."
"We have consulted widely and I believe there is a collective will to reach agreement in December."
"President Barroso has issued some new ideas on how to kick forward that work’."
"I believe that the letter sent by Prime Minister Blair to his fellow Heads of Government makes very clear the sincerity of our commitment to reach agreement if we can and also the importance of the sequencing that I have suggested."
"Mr President, I am grateful once again for the opportunity to respond to this important and timely debate."
"I feel sure that tomorrow’s meeting at Hampton Court will be a real and important opportunity for Member States to send a message of both unity and collective endeavour and to demonstrate the European Union’s key role in responding to the challenges about which we have heard so much today."
". Mr President, Mr Alexander mentioned the strategy for Africa."
"The African Commission came to see us last week, and when it presented its political agenda – with regard in particular to famine, wars, AIDS, desertification and illiteracy – our European problems suddenly seemed manageable."
"I found this an interesting two-and-a-half-hour debate on the challenges which lie ahead of us."
"Of course we could find elements of disagreement, but we could also find broad agreement on a number of issues, including the need to establish a budget as soon as possible."
"I was disappointed only from one point of view."
"I would have liked to have heard a little more about how we can inspire the citizens’ confidence and trust in what we are doing."
"We know that we cannot move without having democratic legitimacy and democratic support and participation and, as you know, it is my task to ensure that – from a communication point of view – we are well equipped."
"This is about the content, about showing that we can make a difference in Europe, but we also have to establish a good dialogue and debate with citizens in Europe over the next few years."
"As Mr Alexander has commented exhaustively on that issue, I have very little to add."
"I would like to thank him again and I will make sure that the Commission is informed of all the very specific points raised."
"That concludes the item."
"We are in a ‘Period of Reflection’ on the future the constitutional treaty."
"The Presidency is right to have focussed this debate not on the treaty text, but on its context."
"Instead of proposing to re-write treaty articles, discussions have focused on the future of Europe’s social model (with the special European Council), on the economy, on re-shaping the budget, on enlargement and on how best to achieve a single market in services."
"Progress on these points will create a new context in which we can then decide what to do about the text."
"There are a wide range of scenarios, ranging from abandoning all reform to asking the French and Dutch to vote again."
"In practice, something between these two extremes is likely."
"But whether it is clarifying the current text, adding to it, modifying it, re-writing it, or drafting a new text, one thing is clear: the need for reform has not gone away."
"The issues that lead all 25 governments to conclude that a new, constitutional treaty is necessary remain on the table and will have to be addressed."
"First, we must change the context and the UK Presidency has made a good start."
"– Instead of proposals calling for effective responses to the serious social problems in the EU – more than 22 million people unemployed and 72 million people living below the poverty line – the President-in-Office of the Council continues to press for measures to support competitiveness and competition."
"In this context, the emphasis on research, development and innovation is always presented as a means of creating the right conditions for business and not as a much-needed response to questions of better health for all, higher levels of public education and the creation of high quality jobs with rights."
"Mr Blair, the President-in-Office of the Council, thus placed the accent on the need for greater flexibility in the labour market and on mobility and support for restructuring, which leads to job cuts, and in turn to more unemployment and a more precarious labour market."
"He also reiterated support for the proposed directive on the creation of an internal market for services and on working time."
"On this evidence, it is clear that what is in store is an emphasis on liberalisation, which would exacerbate existing economic and social problems, would only serve the interests of the economic and financial groups in the EU and would pander to the agenda of the Union of Industrial and Employers’ Confederations of Europe."
"At Hampton Court tomorrow, the Heads of State or Government will discuss the challenges that globalisation poses to our economic and social models."
"The simple fact that this meeting, despite its political and budgetary consequences, has been shortened to just one day is worrying in itself."
"What is worse, the solution has already been found, if we are to believe Gordon Brown, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer."
"According to him, we must put an end to the impasse of protectionism."
"Where, though, has Mr Brown seen protectionism in Europe?"
"It is the most open market in the world, and the one that complies most closely with the WTO’s rules."
"Our competitors, on the other hand, are shamelessly wielding the weapons of dumping, trade barriers, hidden subsidies, and so on."
"The Commission, for its part, is proposing a globalisation adjustment fund of a princely EUR 500 million – EUR 1 per person! – to help people made unemployed by its policies to look for work."
"How very cynical!"
"As long as you persist in trying to adapt our social models to globalisation, there will continue to be more unemployment, more poverty and more uncertainty."
"We need to do exactly the opposite: adopt only those aspects of globalisation that do not run counter to the political objectives of prosperity and full employment."
"I have listened to all of this debate with increasing sadness at the way in which the impressive, ambitious rhetoric of the UK Presidency is just not matched by reality."
"Where there was a clear agenda to be seized, post enlargement, to achieve real reform rather than just talk about it, the UK's entrenched position and poor style have alienated rather than enthused."
"Had the UK come up with meaningful proposals then I believe this Chamber would have been a useful ally."
"Instead we have seen yet more hot air, on all sides, while the people of Europe walk further and further away from us."
"We have not learned the lessons of the Dutch and French votes, and now this Presidency has no time to do anything useful and it is a sorely missed opportunity."
"The next item is questions to the Council (B6-0332/2005)."
"Mr President, I rise on behalf of a colleague, Mr Kamall, who last month submitted to the Council Question H-0688/05 concerning China textile quotas."
"He has not as yet received a reply in any form."
"I wonder whether you could ask the Council of Ministers when he can expect a response."
"In normal circumstances we expect a response the next day."
"Mr Purvis, I have received notification that the Council’s answer is due at any moment."
"In fact, the Council is present in the Chamber and I should ask it to give precedence to answering that question."
"Does the Council believe that the recent modification of the Green Line Regulation has fulfilled its purpose of making a significant increase of trade between the North and the South of Cyprus?"
"Is it an appropriate and adequate response to the political engagement by the Council in April 2004 to assist the development of North Cyprus?"
". In response to the earlier point, I cannot claim to be familiar with the specific question."
"I think if I had seen the question I would probably have had an answer."
"However, I can assure you that it is a matter the Council will look into and endeavour to ensure a reply is forthcoming."
"In relation to this question, the so-called Green Line Regulation was adopted by the Council on 1 May 2004 with a view to facilitating the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community through the facilitation of trade between the northern part of Cyprus and the European Union customs territory."
"As the honourable Member rightly points out in his question, the Council adopted amendments to the Green Line Regulation in February 2005 to try to extend its scope and effectiveness, thus contributing further to the integration of the island."
"In its first report on the implementation of the Green Line Regulation from 1 May 2004 to 30 April 2005, the Commission concludes that the crossing of persons is running smoothly, but that the volume and value of goods crossing the line remains limited."
"While the report mentions the last amendments adopted in February 2005, the Commission implementing decisions concerning the new goods covered were still under preparation."
"Therefore, a full evaluation of the effectiveness of these amendments was not possible."
"The Commission is due to report again on the Green Line Regulation in 2006 and will be reporting on the implementation of these provisions."
"As for other measures, which are intended to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community, the Council is aware of its responsibilities and efforts are continuing in that regard."
"I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply."
"Will he include, as an important part of his and the Commission’s assessment of progress, a quantified assessment of the volume of trade across the green line intended for third countries?"
"Could he also explain why it is that Turkish Cypriot trucks are blocked from travelling to the south?"
"It is patently absurd that a Turkish Cypriot vehicle can be permitted on the streets of Strasbourg, whereas it is blocked on the streets of south Nicosia."
". I thank the honourable Member for the points that he has raised."
"I can assure him I have listened carefully to them and noted them."
"With the permission of Parliament, I shall pass them on directly to the Commission so that they can inform the ongoing work that the Commission is taking forward."
"Commission officials told me last year, when I was in Nicosia just after the Green Line Regulation had come into effect, that in practice the Greek Cypriots were taking every opportunity to find reasons for preventing its maximum application and that trade was still being very severely restricted."
"I realise that this is a matter for huge frustration amongst members of the Council, the vast majority of whom want to see direct trade with Northern Cyprus."
"No one in the Council likes to rock the boat, but is it not time to do a bit more public naming and shaming when EU citizens, whose elected representatives are unfortunately not yet recognised by this Union, are being kept oppressed by one Member State?"
". The European Union foreign ministers expressed a desire to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots at the April 2004 General Affairs Council."
"At the Council’s request, the Commission produced two draft regulations to deliver on this commitment."
"Perhaps some of the frustration of which the honourable Member speaks reflects the fact that it has not yet been possible to agree them."
"However, I can assure Parliament that we will continue efforts to achieve agreement."
"Clearly that will involve a number of Member States."
"I can assure you that we are determined, if we can, to reach agreement to give expression to that decision of the General Affairs Council."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his reply, but is it not shameful that a year and a half after the Council made that pledge to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots there is still no direct trade and no financial aid?"
"Could he give a pledge that there will be agreement by December, by the end of the British Presidency?"
"Is the President-in-Office aware that some of the land crossings between the north and south of Cyprus are sometimes shut, so the refusal of direct air flights out of and into Northern Cyprus effectively shuts off Turkish Cypriots from contact with the outside world?"
"There was some legal thinking going on inside the Foreign Office about licensing direct flights to Northern Cyprus."
"Could he tell us what has happened to that thinking?"
". I would respectfully remind the questioner that I am answering on behalf of the Presidency today, rather than the British Government."
"She is welcome to correspond with me separately, in a different forum, about the views of the British Foreign Office on the licensing of flights."
"That being said, I share the Member’s frustration about the progress we had hoped to see in light of that earlier General Affairs Council commitment."
"However, as discussed at great length in our previous conversation about future financing, securing agreement often depends not on the will of one country, even one country holding the Presidency, but on the capacity to secure the support of all countries."
"That is why, notwithstanding the genuine frustration we share with her, I can only assure her that we will continue our earnest endeavours to reach agreement."
"At this stage, however, I cannot give her any guarantee of the date on which that agreement will be reached."
"In April 2005, the Commission finalised and submitted to the Council a draft negotiating mandate for the conclusion of an EU stabilisation and association agreement with the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro."
"Despite recognition of the strategic importance of Serbia and Montenegro to the security and stability of the region and the country's recognition by the EU, it was hitherto the only country in the Western Balkans whose European prospects were excluded from the European process."
"Why the delay in considering and adopting the negotiating mandate enabling negotiations to commence?"
"When does the Council plan to adopt the mandate and confer it on the Commission?"
"Given that, in the case of Croatia, the requirement of cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia did not prevent the EU from opening accession negotiations, why, in the case of Serbia and Montenegro, has that requirement been stipulated in such an unconditional manner, thereby establishing a policy of double standards?"
"Why does the Council not open negotiations immediately, whilst retaining the possibility of checking that the relevant requirement has been fulfilled at a later stage and, in any case, before the completion of negotiations and the signing of the agreement?"
". I entirely agree with the honourable Member about the importance of Serbia and Montenegro moving towards the European Union."
"That is why I am delighted that the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations for stabilisation and association and the agreement with Serbia and Montenegro at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 3 October, of which I have already spoken."
"A formal ceremony to open negotiations was subsequently held in Belgrade on 10 October, in the presence of the Commissioner for Enlargement, Mr Rehn."
"The decision to begin SAA negotiations follows the positive feasibility study that Serbia and Montenegro received from the Commission in April 2005."
"As one of our Presidency objectives, the United Kingdom sees this as a significant step for Serbia and Montenegro on the road to the European Union."
"It also affirms the European Union’s commitment to the Thessaloniki Agenda, which emphasises that the future of the western Balkans lies in the European Union."
"The Council has judged that the pace and conclusion of negotiations will depend in particular on Serbia and Montenegro’s progress in developing its legislative framework and administrative capacity, the effective implementation of the Constitutional Charter and, of course, full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia."
"The Council and Commission will jointly review Serbia and Montenegro’s performance in these areas before negotiations conclude."
"– Mr President, I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Alexander, two brief questions."
"Firstly, knowing that a referendum will be held in Montenegro in 2006 on its possible secession from the joint state of Serbia-Montenegro, to what extent will progress in negotiations on the stabilisation agreement affect this referendum in Montenegro?"
"Secondly, to what extent will negotiations on the stabilisation and association agreement be affected by the parallel negotiations due to start on the final status of Kosovo and, furthermore, does Mr Alexander believe that the position of Serbia on the question of Kosovo will affect the progress of negotiations on the stabilisation and association agreement?"
". In the course of our Presidency, I have personally had the opportunity to travel to Belgrade and hear directly from representatives of Serbia and Montenegro of their desire, ultimately, for European Union membership and their desire to move forward the process of stabilisation and association agreements."
"I therefore think we would be getting ahead of ourselves – given the recent announcement that was given formal expression when Commissioner Rehn visited Belgrade recently – if we anticipated what may or may not be the conclusion of a potential referendum in the future."
"However, I would certainly make the point – and this was a point I made very clearly on behalf of the European Union when I met with representatives both of Serbia and Montenegro – that the challenge of cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal is an immediate and contemporary one."
"We have been heartened by some of the steps that have taken place in Belgrade in recent months and the level of cooperation that has been shown in comparison to earlier levels of cooperation."
"However, let us be very clear this afternoon in this Chamber that there is further and real progress that must be made to secure full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia."
"Mr President, I apologise for being late, as a result of which I missed some of the response by the President-in-Office, but, as we are discussing Serbia, let me tell you that I was in Kosovo last week – the Albanian part of Serbia’s northern province to be precise – where people are extremely worried about the fate of 2 500 people who are still missing."
"Serbia is refusing help to recover those bodies."
"Surely one of the conditions we in the European Union should attach to our continued support for Serbia should be that that country must cooperate with UNMIK and with the Albanian authorities in Kosovo in order to ensure that all those people who have lost relatives at least know where they are, where those bodies are and that those bodies are returned so that they can be given proper burial."
"Can the President-in-Office promise that this will be one of the conditions for continued cooperation with Serbia?"
"."
"I understand the strength of emotion around such issues, not least given the opportunity that I have had in recent months to travel, not just to Serbia and Montenegro, as I have just described, but also to Kosovo, and hear for myself the very real challenges that continue to confront Kosovo in particular and the region more generally."
"In that regard, in the course of the conversations that I had both in Belgrade and in Pristina, I emphasised the importance of awaiting Ambassador Eide’s report."
"In that sense, our hope would be that this would provide the basis on which a way forward could be found that would be to the satisfaction not only of one element of one community but that would serve the broader interests of peace and security in the region."
"With the end of the 2000-2006 planning period in view, what is the Council's assessment of the results achieved through the use of the Structural Funds and other financial instruments in terms of the social integration, education, training and vocational development of young people living in rural, island, mountain, sparsely populated and remote areas, and areas facing demographic problems?"
"Does the new plan for 2007-2013 include measures which target this group to promote their integration into their natural social environment and enable them to continue living there?"
". The Council has not assessed the impact of the structural and cohesion funds on the social integration, education, training and vocational development of young people living in areas facing demographic problems."
"The Third Cohesion Report on Economic and Social Policy, which reports on the progress made towards achieving economic and social cohesion through SCF, the EIB and other financial instruments, was adopted by the Commission on 18 February 2004."
"Part of the report focuses on the impact of Community policies, competitiveness, employment and cohesion and the impact and added value of structural policies on such areas."
"The Council is aware of the importance of the role of young farmers, particularly in the development of the rural environment and environmental conservation."
"In 2003, 24% of agricultural holdings were headed by a person under 45 years of age."
"Generational renewal must be guaranteed in particular by means of special early-retirement measures combined with support for setting up."
"During the current programming period, i.e. from 2000 to 2006, approximately EUR 2 billion from the Community budget will have been allocated directly to young farmers to help them establish themselves."
"That amount is earmarked for the financing of investments and to help them set up in business through consultational services."
"Looking ahead, the Council has recently adopted a range of measures in the framework of the Rural Development Regulation for 2007-2013, in particular aid of up to EUR 55 000 per holding, aid for modernisation and the possibility of utilising the national reserve to help young farmers to establish themselves."
"– Mr President, I thank the Minister for his reply and I hope that financing will be decided quickly so that, by 2010 and 2013, everything he has told us about will have been put into practice."
"I also wish to ask if suitable provision will be made for the education and culture of these areas which, of course, are based on the reproduction of human resources."
". Let me deal first with the issue of progress towards achievement of an agreement on future financing."
"I would simply reiterate what I have said before this afternoon, which is that we are sincere in our endeavours to try and reach agreement in December."
"The tenor of the question reflects the sense of urgency on the part of not just one Member State but a number of different Member States about the need to reach agreement on future financing."
"I set out before the Council the terms of the third cohesion report on economic and social policy, which reported on progress."
"It would be helpful to make it clear that the target date for adoption of the EU-wide rural development strategy is autumn 2005."
"The framework for monitoring and evaluation should be agreed by the end of 2005 and Member States will then produce national strategy plans in line with an overarching European Union strategy."
"So clearly there will be a national as well as a European locus at that juncture."
"These plans will include quantified objectives for rural development spending, tailored to regional circumstances, against which, of course, the effectiveness of the spending can then be judged."
"Mr President, Minister, the British Government has indicated that it is in favour of reducing the CAP and lowering agricultural subsidies, and I would therefore like to ask the Presidency-in-Office of the Council whether it believes that young people living in rural and mountain regions are going to be able to integrate better into their natural environment and whether they will have more life opportunities as a result of this proposal to abandon the common agricultural policy."
"."
"If the honourable Member is referring to World Trade Organization talks, a framework agreement involving both the United States and the European Union, which essentially got the trade talks back on track, was reached back in 2003."
"The position on the prospective trade talks in the critical days ahead was discussed at the General Affairs Council last week and is a matter of ongoing concern and direct interest to the European Commission, which leads for us in that area."
"However, there is a risk that discussion of the importance of the Doha development round will be narrowed down to a discussion of agriculture and rural development issues."
"The European Union has a great deal to gain from a successful conclusion to the World Trade Organization talks, not just in agriculture but also in services and non-agricultural market access."
"So we all, whether we live in rural or urban areas, have a common interest in ensuring a successful conclusion to the World Trade talks."
"A spur to greater global trade is a spur to greater global prosperity."
"In light of recent shocks to the energy market such as the increase in oil prices and heightened public concern over the effects of climate change, what is the Council under the UK Presidency doing to ensure that the proposed directive on energy end-use efficiency and energy services (COM(2003)0739 – C5-0642/2003 – 2003/0300(COD)) takes into account the more rigorous measures to encourage energy saving supported by a strong majority in Parliament?"
". The Council is well aware of the issues raised by the honourable Member and shares her view that measures on energy efficiency are one of the key instruments in tackling climate change."
"Against this background, I can assure the honourable Member that the Council is sparing no effort to reach an agreement on this important draft directive with the European Parliament at second reading."
"As regards the extent to which the Council is taking into account the amendments adopted by the European Parliament at first reading during these negotiations, I can confirm today that the Council is making a substantial effort to accommodate key elements of these amendments."
"Several elements have to be considered in order to develop a compromise leading to an effective directive, such as how long the directive should apply, the level of the savings target, the role of the public sector, the use of energy efficiency indicators and benchmarks, as well as a reliable monitoring system."
"It is clear that an adequate balance has to be struck between realistic and achievable targets and over-ambitious ones that will only diminish the credibility of Community legislation."
"Thank you for that encouraging and positive response, but I have to say that it is disappointing that the Council is weakening the proposals before Parliament, particularly by reducing the level of the targets and making them non-binding."
"This means that, under the UK Presidency proposals, the target has been cut so much that, in the UK, it is pretty much what is being achieved by measures already in place."
"If the Government has a genuine commitment to energy efficiency, when are we going to see it in terms of a toughness in the current negotiations between the Council and Parliament?"
"We have had a lot of rhetoric about climate change and energy saving, but we still are not seeing the action in the actual text on the table."
". I am grateful for the opportunity to respond."
"I was somewhat naively touched by the description of my answer being encouraging if a little unsurprised then to hear it described as disappointing."
"Let me try to offer what comfort I can to the honourable Member by addressing the specific issue of the merits or demerits of mandatory targets."
"We have been clear throughout that all Member States are committed to increasing their energy savings in line with the targets set out in the directive."
"However, mandatory energy savings targets could lead to short-term measures being implemented purely to meet targets, rather than the long-term focus which is needed."
"It can also focus attention and resources unduly on measuring rather than doing."
"Member States felt that it would be inappropriate to create the possibility of being taken to the Court of Justice on the grounds of non-achievement of the prescribed levels of savings."
"For example, if a Member State achieved only 5% savings after six years instead of the prescribed 6%, the achievement of targets would partly rely on changes in consumer behaviour."
"Member States aim to influence this through the different measures proposed in the draft directive."
"However, the effectiveness of these measures is not completely predictable or entirely within the control of Member States themselves."
"On top of that, we already have mandatory targets as part of our commitments under Kyoto."
"Placing specific targets on individual elements of the package of measures, such as energy efficiency being undertaken to reach that target, would reduce the flexibility we require in meeting them."
"Does the European Court of Justice judgment on the appropriateness of Community law for imposing criminal penalties (Case C-176/03, 13 September 2005) encourage the Council in the direction of using the Community framework rather than the unsatisfactory intergovernmental one for law enforcement measures?"
"Is the UK Presidency exploring positively the potential to use Article 42 TEU for this purpose?"
"How will it guard against fora like G5 and G8 and new Schengen developments further prejudicing transparent, democratic and comprehensive EU-wide cooperation?"
"Will it at least keep the European and national parliaments informed about the evolution of intergovernmental negotiations and future plans?"
"."
"As repeatedly stated by the Court of Justice, the choice of legal basis for the adoption of legally binding instruments must rest on objective factors."
"The judgment of the Court of Justice confirmed that the Community legislator may take measures relating to the criminal law of the Member States when that is necessary for the achievement of the Community policy in question."
"The Court of Justice also reiterated that, as a general rule, criminal law matters did not fall within the scope of Community competence."
"It did not decide about the scope of application of Title 6 of the Treaty on European Union as such, nor did it limit the scope of application of Title 6 beyond the very specific issue on which the Court of Justice ruled."
"The use of Article 42 is not being considered at present."
"The Council cannot and should not seek to prevent Member States from cooperating bilaterally or multilaterally on police and judicial matters, as long as they observe the obligations incumbent upon them under the Treaties."
"Cooperation outside the framework of the Treaties is, by definition, not undertaken by the Council."
"Neither the Council nor its Presidency can therefore provide information regarding such forms of cooperation for the European Parliament."
"Information regarding cooperation on police or judicial matters under Title 6 is transmitted to the European Parliament on the basis of Article 39 of the Treaty."
"As regards the information to national parliaments, this is solely a matter for the individual Member States, not the Council or its Presidency."
"President-in-Office, thank you for your reply, but there is considerable concern about the proliferation of fora for addressing security and border control issues."
"A few months ago, the French Prime Minister, Mr de Villepin, talked about how Britain, Germany, Spain, Italy and France are moving forward in discussions on police cooperation, exchanges of intelligence, border controls, and internal security."
"Then we have the Prüm Convention among seven Member States, which seems to go back to the Trevi system of the 1970s."
"This is not only undemocratic and untransparent, but surely it also fails to provide the added value of really addressing terrorism and immigration challenges in common."
"Surely this is not in the interests of the European Union as a whole?"
"."
"I am certainly aware of the informal meetings that the honourable Member describes."
"However, there is no more eloquent testimony to the approach that we have taken, whereby the whole of Europe is involved in these discussions, than the role that our Home Secretary, Mr Charles Clarke, has played both with this Parliament and, indeed, with other members of the relevant Council."
"I also think – if you reflect upon the remarks made by our Prime Minister earlier today – it is clear that dealing with the issue of personal and physical security, not least in the light of the terrible incidents that took place in London on 7 July, remains one of the key priorities for our Presidency."
"Our ambition certainly includes taking forward that work as we anticipate the conclusion of our Presidency in the December European Council, which, of course, will involve all Member States."
"I welcome the Council’s description of the effect of the judgment of the Court of Justice, which was accurate, but I ask that the press reaction to this judgment – not least in Mr Alexander’s own Member State – be countered wherever possible."
"The press has given the impression – and this has been amplified by Euro-sceptics – that the Commission will now be able to decide sentencing policy in different Member States by itself; that is to say, it would be able to determine the sentences for different crimes."
"That is far from being the case."
"Even in the Community framework, the Commission proposes, but the Council and Parliament dispose."
"."
"I am grateful to the honourable Member for reflecting on the importance of my answer."
"I hope that the accuracy of my answer will fulfil the purpose."
"The Presidency of the European Union is responsible for many things, such as seeking a way forward on future financing or trying to chart a course for a modern Europe in the age of globalisation."
"Notwithstanding those very considerable challenges, I am glad that our responsibilities do not extend to the editorial policies of many of the newspapers in question."
"It is inherent in the nature of a union of democracies to have a free press and the best way to counter some of the misunderstandings and myths perpetuated about this particular issue and more generally is to ensure that the factual information I imparted today is spread outside this chamber and comes to be understood by the wider public."
"Will the UK Presidency support José Manuel Barroso in his efforts to curb unnecessary and burdensome lawmaking initiatives from the European Commission?"
"Despite assurances from this Presidency that it would act to prevent superfluous lawmaking and to promote the principle of subsidiarity, we see the UK Presidency arguing for the addition of impractical legislation, such as the protection of workers from sunlight in the directive on optical radiation."
"Will the Presidency seize the opportunity to help bring some sense to ‘joke’ EU lawmaking?"
"."
"Better regulation in all its aspects is a high priority for the Council and indeed for our Presidency."
"The Commission’s report on the outcome of its screening of pending legislative proposals, to which the honourable Member refers, will be studied with great interest within the Council."
"We have scheduled a policy debate on better regulation, including the screening package, for the November Competitiveness Council."
"The honourable Member specifically mentioned the optical radiation directive."
"She will appreciate that, as the Presidency, we now need to consult all Member States and work for an agreement that is acceptable both to the Council and to this Parliament."
"We have all signed up to improving the way Europe regulates itself."
"We the Council, the Commission, and again this Parliament, need to work together to make that commitment a reality now."
"Thank you, President-in-Office, for your reply."
"I am delighted that you have reiterated the commitment to better legislation, but we need action."
"We know that we are going to conciliation on the optical radiation directive."
"I understand that the Council of Ministers is going to get rid of natural radiation from the optical radiation directive, but why was it brought forward to start with?"
"It was brought forward by the Council of Ministers."
"I would like to know which ministers and which Member States pushed for it."
"That really demonstrates our need for EU Council meetings to be held in public."
"Then we would be able to know which countries are pushing for this sort of joke legislation which brings the EU into disrepute."
"Will the President-in-Office commit himself to pushing for EU Council meetings to be held in public?"
". I sense that the honourable Member is inviting me to shed some light on the workings of the Council and, given the terms of the directive in question, I hesitate to do such a thing."
"On the substantive issue of transparency, we had a discussion earlier today, not least in light of what our Prime Minister, on behalf of the Presidency, stated earlier this month in reply to a question asked in Parliament on the eve of the British Presidency."
"The process of seeking to take forward the undertaking he gave to look at the specific issue of transparency within the Council is now in the process of being taken forward."
"Rather similarly to the Council initiative which she described originally, it requires a degree of support beyond the Presidency-in-Office of the Council."
"In that sense, it is a necessary part of making progress on the issue of transparency that we take others with us."
"That is why a process is now established under our Presidency to seek to find a way forward."
"Is this not just another case where an important issue tends to get hijacked by the Euro-sceptics in the press and in politics?"
"The very valid issue of better regulation is portrayed by Euro-sceptics as Brussels bureaucrats imposing burdens on businesses."
"Whereas, in fact, we all know that no European legislation can be adopted unless it is approved both by the Council and the Parliament and that good European legislation is an exercise in cutting red tape: one patent instead of twenty-five; one trademark and registration form and fee instead of twenty-five; a single administrative document for our lorries at frontiers instead of the forty-something there used to be."
"Good European legislation is good, bad European legislation is bad, but we should not let the Euro-sceptics claim that it is all bad."
". I certainly concur with the question the honourable Member has put to me in terms of the need to delineate between legislation where it is appropriate and, indeed, where there are areas where there are alternatives to regulation that should be considered."
"I would, however, emphasise in my reply that the terms of his question – leaving aside the specific issue of how the press deals with these matters, for which none of us, I am afraid, are directly responsible – emphasises in my mind the importance of all the institutions of Europe seeking to take forward this agenda of better regulation."
"This is not an agenda that, with the greatest of respect to Commissioner Verheugen or, indeed, to President Barroso, can be achieved by their efforts alone, nor can it be achieved by this Parliament alone."
"It needs to be a shared endeavour between the Council, the Presidency and Parliament."
"If there is a genuine commitment – as I believe there is a growing commitment within each of those institutions to grasp this agenda and drive it forward – then we will hopefully in the future see less of the headlines of the type that the honourable Member describes."
"I would, however, with a little more optimism, highlight the kind of coverage that was received in the United Kingdom for President Barroso’s and Commissioner Verheugen’s prior announcement in terms of draft legislation being ditched where it was deemed to be otiose and unnecessary."
"It was almost uniformly welcomed in the pages even of the most sceptical British newspapers."
"To establish credibility for the Commission, the Presidency and for Parliament, it is necessary for us to be seen to be taking decisive action on what is unquestionably one of the issues of concern, not simply to the business community across Europe, but also to our citizens."
"Mr President-in-Office, I welcome your comments and your reply."
"I support your commitment to deregulation and a number of colleagues will try and help you achieve that."
"But, going back to the original point about deregulation and to the optical radiation directive, Prime Minister Tony Blair said in this House this afternoon that there is a need to regulate where necessary but also to deregulate when it is necessary for our competitiveness."
"Would you agree that, in terms of deregulation for competitiveness, we should revisit the mother directive of this optical radiation directive, which was the original 1989 directive?"
"I asked this question last time and got the answer that it is up to the Commission to initiate revisiting the directive."
"We know that, but would you please undertake to invite the Commission to revisit that framework directive or at the very least invite the Council to invite the Commission?"
". The most constructive way forward would be for me to pass on to the Commission the strength of feeling that has been communicated by the honourable Member."
"I am aware that this is not the first time that this issue has been raised, and I will certainly make sure that the Commission is made aware of the concerns that he has raised today."
"4.9 million people were infected with HIV in 2004, more than in any previous year."
"As 75% of young people infected are women and girls, the increasing vulnerability of women is underlined along with the inherent need to expand current prevention options, particularly for women."
"The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) was set up in February 2004, with one third of its budget to be funded by Member States (plus one third from the Commission, and one third from the private sector)."
"In the light of the rise in HIV infection rates and the creation of the EDCTP, can the Council provide information on what funding Member States have provided to the EDCTP, and as a result, which microbicide clinical trials are currently being funded by the EDCTP?"
"I could not agree more with the honourable Member about the unfolding tragedy of HIV infection cases amongst women and girls."
"As we know, the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership is a group of 14 Member States plus Norway from outside the European Union."
"The initial investment to establish the partnership was provided by the European Commission with a EUR 200 million allocation over five years through the Sixth Research and Development Framework Programme which runs from 2002 to 2006."
"The partnership has a total budget of EUR 600 million for the period from 2003 to 2007: in addition to the EUR 200 million provided by Community funding, EUR 200 million will come from Member States and a further EUR 200 million will be sought from industry, charities and private organisations."
"It is the responsibility of each Member State to contribute in kind through their national research activities."
"Various projects funded by public money in each Member State count towards the total EUR 200 million contribution."
"The Council has identified a need for joined-up action between the Commission and Member States in partnership with the Clinical Trials Partnership to support the research and development of new tools to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, a fact underlined in the conclusions of the General Affairs Council on 24 May this year."
"The partnership has identified a number of specific research topics and will issue calls for research proposals for these topics over a two- to three-year period."
"Only one trial relating to HIV was funded last year, which will look into providing anti-retroviral drugs to children with HIV."
"Calls for research proposals issued last month include a specific call for research on microbicides."
"The title of this call for research is ‘Capacity building for the conduct of phase I, II and III trials of vaginal microbicides against sexual transmission of HIV’."
"Applications will come in over the next few months and funding decisions will be made next year."
"Obviously, microbicides could revolutionise AIDS prevention throughout the world."
"Current clinical trials are already showing positive results, but this requires funding."
"As you are aware, Mr President-in-Office, the United Kingdom Department for International Development has been very supportive of research into microbicides."
"Do you agree with me that support for clinical trials into microbicides is essential in tackling AIDS and, particularly in view of the priority the United Kingdom Presidency has attached to Africa, will the Presidency encourage other Member States to involve themselves with the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership?"
". The simple answer is ‘yes’."
"It reflects our commitment, not just to the blighted continent of Africa – perhaps the only continent in recent years to have moved backwards on many of the key indicators that were so graphically highlighted in our own Prime Minister’s Commission for Africa report – but also to supporting other countries as they seek to meet the Millennium Development Goals, which were reiterated in September at the Millennium Review Summit in New York."
"It also emphasises the importance of clinical research being taken forward if we are to find solutions to a challenge as great as HIV/AIDS."
"I can assure the honourable Member, who I know has an abiding and passionate commitment to tackling injustice, not just at home but abroad, that we are determined to support the efforts of the partnership as I described, not least through the efforts of the Department for International Development that she highlighted in her question, but also by encouraging other Member States to play their important role in what is a hugely important contribution by the European Union plus Norway to confronting a genuinely global challenge and a global problem."
"On 29 August 2005, a Turkish Cypriot aeroplane flew direct from the illegal airport in the so-called 'Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' to the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku."
"This flight followed a direct flight on 27 July 2005 from Azerbaijan to the occupied territories."
"These flights took place in breach of the principles of European and international civil aviation."
"Bearing in mind the proposal for a Council decision (COM(2005)0060 final) on the conclusion of an agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Azerbaijan on certain aspects of air services, replacing Member States' bilateral agreements with the Republic of Azerbaijan, can the Council say how it will respond to the conduct of Azerbaijan, using the political means at its disposal?"
". The draft agreement referred to by the honourable Member does not cover air transport between Cyprus and Azerbaijan."
"The sole purpose of this draft agreement is to ensure that, where a bilateral agreement between a Member State and Azerbaijan exists, such an agreement complies with Community law."
"Since there is no such bilateral agreement between Cyprus and Azerbaijan, this draft agreement has no bearing on the issue the honourable Member raises relating to flights from Azerbaijan to the area of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic does not exercise effective control."
"– Mr President, I thank the Minister for the very substantial reply which he has given me."
"Would he nonetheless permit me to remark that he has given me technical answers to a purely political question."
"Of course we all know that Azerbaijan needs to comply with the guidelines of the United Nations and the ICAO, but I want to know what the Council's view is of the fact that Azerbaijan continues to maintain flights to airports on the occupied territories of the Republic of Cyprus."
". I would merely reiterate the technical points that I made."
"In some political questions the technical answer is often the best."
"However, it would also be important – given the terms of the supplementary question – to make clear that the European Commission has no competence to get involved directly in this matter: it is a bilateral issue between the Government of the Republic of Cyprus and the Azeri Government."
"That also reflects the position of the Council, which would hope that a resolution to this matter could be found on a bilateral basis."
"In response to the debate on the situation in the Middle East, held in the European Parliament on 7 September 2005, Douglas Alexander, speaking on behalf of the UK Presidency of the Council, repeated the 'clear view' of the Council on the Separation Barrier in East Jerusalem and assured Members that 'where [lt]the Council has[gt] concerns about Israeli actions on human rights, will raise – and raised those concerns with the Israeli Government.'"
"Mr Alexander also explained that the Council would be considering, in due course, which issues to raise at the EU-Israel Association Council, scheduled for the end of this year."
"Could the Council outline the process by which the agenda for the EU-Israel Association Council is decided and, in the light of Israel's continued failure to comply with the ICJ opinion of 9 July 2004, could the Council offer any possible justification as to why the implementation of the opinion of the highest international court, which articulates erga omnes incumbent on all Member States, should not be at the top of the agenda?"
". The Council has already indicated, in its reply to Written Question E-3041/05 by the honourable Member, the European Union’s position on the separation barrier and the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the question."
"The issue of the separation barrier is a fixed agenda item in the continuous political contacts between the European Union and Israel, including those scheduled in the context of the forthcoming EU-Israel Association Council meeting."
"."
"Thank you for that reply."
"Despite the early optimism felt after Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, the picture today is much bleaker than had been hoped for."
"Last week, Israel broke off diplomatic contacts with the Palestinian Authority after three young settlers were killed near Hebron."
"In yesterday, James Wolfensohn reportedly accused Israel of acting almost as though there had been no withdrawal, delaying making difficult decisions and preferring to take difficult matters back into slow-moving subcommittees."
"How does the Council, in its role as a member of the Quartet, plan to bring Israel and the Palestinian Authority back to the negotiating table and ensure that those early feelings of optimism are not wasted?"
". I would certainly agree with the honourable Member that there are times of frustration and disappointment as we seek a way forward in the Middle East peace process."
"That notwithstanding, we have to recognise that the withdrawal she describes marked a significant step forward and represented a significant opportunity to move forward in the roadmap process, which had not been as clear in previous years."
"So I recognise the tragedy she describes and the consequences that have followed."
"However, on the specifics of how, as a member of the Quartet, we can continue to progress, I would like to place on record, on behalf of the Council, our gratitude and support for the continuing efforts of James Wolfensohn."
"Given the very constructive role he has been able to play to date, he has a critical personal role as the Special Envoy for Disengagement."
"The European Union is ready to help."
"This is a real test for the Palestinian Authority and for Israel, but also a great opportunity."
"Despite the disappointments and frustrations, we need to take a longer view."
"All those who want to see a peaceful and stable Middle East must continue to support the efforts of the Quartet, and the Special Envoy in particular."
"President-in-Office, I am encouraged by your reply."
"Would you, through the EU-Israel discussions and through the Mediterranean process, point out to Israel and its neighbours that their security is best guaranteed not by separation, fences or barriers, but by integrating with each other economically and politically and through cultural, scientific and technical exchanges?"
"Only through that mutual reinforcement of contact will security be guaranteed for the Palestinians and Israelis and the region as a whole."
". I endorse wholeheartedly the points that have been made by the questioner."
"Of course Israel has a right to protect itself from acts of terrorism, but equally all of us understand that it is necessary to find a way forward and a political solution to the challenges of the Middle East."
"In that regard, and notwithstanding the very real difficulties that the Middle East continues to face, I think we should take pride in the efforts that the European Union has been able to make in this troubled and difficult area of the world and we should be encouraged in particular by the strength that Mr Wolfensohn has been able to bring to his role as the Quartet’s special envoy."
"Of course there is more work to be done, of course the European Union stands ready to make those points directly to Israel and to the Palestinian authorities, and of course the European Union stands ready to help in other ways if it can."
"However, I would simply reiterate that, ultimately, the responsibility lies primarily with Israel and with the Palestinian authorities."
"It is both a great test for them and also a great opportunity, for exactly the reasons the questioner set out."
"I agree with the last supplementary question and the answer given, and in that spirit note how idiotic it was to demand the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, as some did, or to talk about a boycott of universities in Israel."
"This is completely counterproductive."
"With reference to the desire to enlarge opportunities for Palestinians, to which the Presidency referred, can the President-in-Office give us any further encouragement about EU support for economic development in Gaza and enlighten us about suggestions that there could be an EU contribution to securing the borders of Gaza, particularly the border with Egypt?"
". I say to the honourable Member that, firstly, the issue of economic development is inextricably bound up with the issue of security."
"The European Union is committed to continuing the enhanced support for the Palestinian civil policing through EU corps, in order to help build the necessary security environment in Gaza following Israeli withdrawal, so as to allow exactly the kind of economic development that is necessary."
"We also welcome the agreement between the Governments of Israel and Egypt on basic security arrangements along the Gaza-Egypt border."
"A resolution to the issue of the crossing point on the Rafah border is also needed and is essential to the fate of other crossings and issues such as the port and airport."
"The European Union continues to be one of the biggest international donors to the Palestinian Authority."
"Last year assistance to the Palestinians from the European Community amounted to some EUR 250 million."
"That included assistance to refugees, food aid, the health and education sectors, the private sector, municipalities and institution-building."
"The Commission has recently announced a larger package of support to the Palestinians and will provide around EUR 280 million in 2005."
"That money includes a substantial contribution to help tackle the priorities identified by Mr James Wolfensohn."
"The European Union’s aim is to ensure that disengagement is a success and a step toward implementing the roadmap."
"The Commission attaches strict conditionality to the budgetary assistance it has provided to the Palestinian Authority."
"The conditions mainly reinforce the need for transparency of the Palestinian Authority’s public finances, strengthening the prudent management of the budget and encouraging progress on overall financial and administrative reform."
"The Council is moving ahead with the process of adopting the framework decision on the retention of data despite the reactions of Parliament concerning the legal basis and the lack of proportionality between the ends and the means, those of human rights organisations concerning respect for civil liberties and those of industry concerning the high cost."
"Does the Council share the views of officials that 'the cost is not a political problem'?"
"How will it safeguard human rights and deal with constitutional obstacles in various Member States to the general implementation of such a framework decision?"
"What are the Council's views on UK Ministers' objections that a Europe-wide system is unnecessary as the need for security can be better served through 25 national systems?"
". After the terrorist attacks in London on 7 July 2005, the Council reiterated the urgent need for an EU instrument on retention of communications data, called for in the wake of the Madrid bombings, and made a commitment to agree to it by October 2005."
"The draft framework decision tabled by four Member States in April 2004 does not aim at recording the content of any communication, but rather at the retention of so-called traffic data."
"These data, such as the names of the persons connected with a phone call or the time of the communication, are necessary for law enforcement authorities effectively to investigate criminal offences and bring successful prosecutions in an age when criminals exploit the advantages of modern communications facilities."
"The proposal for a directive on retention of traffic data, which the Commission adopted on 21 September 2005, and which the Council considered in October, also concerns traffic data and not the content of communications."
"A decision has yet to be made on whether the framework decision or directive is the appropriate legal base for such rules by the Council on data retention."
"In the meantime, work will continue on the substance, in consultation, of course, with the Commission and the European Parliament."
"At its meeting on 2 July 2004, the Council stressed the need to give particular consideration to the proportionality of the measure in relation to costs, privacy and efficiency."
"The Council aims at an instrument that balances law enforcement requirements with the right to privacy and costs, and which is compatible with Member States’ constitutions."
". – Mr President, Minister, thank you for your reply, but following the conclusions of the legal service of the Council and bearing in mind the legal problems that will arise if this proposal is adopted within the framework of the third pillar and the information about the commitment of the Dutch Minister not to agree to a proposal within the framework of this pillar, when does the Council intend to withdraw its proposal?"
". The thinking, as set out by our own Prime Minister earlier in the course of meetings, is to try and secure agreement on the way forward in the course of the UK Presidency."
"That suggests December as the opportunity when, under the scenario that we would wish to see, under pillar one, as our Home Secretary Charles Clarke has proposed, we can see progress being made in relation to this instrument."
"I hope that directly answers the question because we continue to seek to find a basis under pillar one rather than under pillar three, as the question implied."
"As the President-in-Office has just said, Charles Clarke made the welcome decision for the European Parliament to now give its views on this proposal."
"As the Parliament is now in the process of putting its view, could I ask the President-in-Office to take the safeguard argument seriously?"
"We accept the need for retention of data and we are looking at the timings now."
"We are moving very much in the right direction, but we need concrete and collective safeguards."
"Will he give an assurance that that aspect will be taken very seriously, because Parliament wants to see the Council treat that as a priority."
". I should like to make a couple of points directly in reply to the points that the honourable Member has raised."
"Firstly, the British Presidency is committed to securing agreement on the data-retention measure before the end of the year, as I said, and is taking forward work on substance in consultation with the Commission and European Parliament alike, which have made these points."
"We remain committed, however, to the belief that retention of specific communications data for a fixed period is a proportionate reaction to the threat of terrorism and that the associated costs are not excessive."
"On the specific point of the pillar under which we should make progress, it is important to add one point to the discussions that have taken place in Parliament today, and that is to say very honestly that I do not believe our citizens will care whether the measure is decided under the first or third pillar."
"What we need is a proposal that can be agreed quickly and will allow for effective law enforcement without threatening the fundamental rights of European Union citizens."
"On the specific point that the honourable Member raised, we agree that all retained data must be held securely in line with data protection principles and that information exchange must be accompanied by high standards of protection."
"Police and other public authorities will not have unrestricted access to the retained data and will have to meet national standards to access private information."
"The content of calls or messages – as I sought to suggest earlier – would not be retained."
"It is merely a question of providers keeping records of who called whom, where and when."
"This is part of striking the balance that we believe is necessary between protecting people from terrorism and serious crime and, on the other hand, respecting civil rights."
"We believe, therefore, that our response must be proportionate and respect common democratic values."
"We must defend our communities from the threat of attack while upholding human rights in accordance with international law and the ECHR."
"For let us be very clear: the terrorists want to attack not only our lives but also our way of life."
"I would like to thank the Minister for his reply;"
"I certainly share his concerns."
"However, recently in Ireland an Irish citizen won an international lottery of some EUR 100 million – I cannot remember the exact figure."
"There was immediately something in the region of 60 hits on her private social security file and extra hits on her private taxation file, which the Revenue Commissioners are examining."
"It seems to me that we need to take care to ensure that information within the public service is not actually used by terrorists as a source of intelligence, where organisations like the Provisional IRA sometimes have their intelligence officers in situ in the public service."
"I would ask the Minister to be very careful to ensure that there are proper checks and balances and that those who abuse for their own purpose intelligence or information gathered in any way in the public interest are dealt with very severely."
"I would like to make one other point: I understand that private detectives, for example, have people within the various public services, but they pay ..."
". I cannot comment on the specific case of the lucky lottery winner, who, as it transpired, was not so lucky when it came to the invasion of privacy described."
"Nor, I hope, would you expect me to comment on your allegations and suggestions on public services and data protection in individual Member States."
"The Presidency is keen to see progress on data protection and we agree that all retained data must be held securely, in line with data protection principles, and that very high standards of protection should be required for exchanges of information."
"The police and other bodies should not have unrestricted access to the retained data and it is essential that national standards for access to private information are met."
"If those standards are deemed insufficient in the honourable Member’s country, then I suggest that that is a matter that should be raised with the Member State, just as it is raised with the Presidency when we are considering data protection at a European level."
"Rendered animal tallow (animal fat) is included in the Waste Incineration Directive 2000/76/EC(1) (WID), and after December this year it will have to be incinerated under very strict conditions."
"Currently it is used as a fuel in steam boilers in rendering plants and in the production of biodiesel."
"However, the conditions of the WID directive appear to preclude its use for these purposes."
"Is this not inconsistent with the Commission's environmental policy of encouraging competitive and efficient alternative energy sources?"
". The Waste Incineration Directive neither precludes nor discourages the use of waste as a competitive and efficient alternative energy source."
"Rather, the aim of the directive is to prevent or to limit, as far as is practical, negative effects on the environment and human health from the incineration and co-incineration of waste."
"When adopting legislation, the Community legislator carefully examines possible trade-offs in relation to other Community policy objectives."
"Waste tallow is only included in the scope of the directive where it is incinerated or co-incinerated."
"Other waste disposal or recovery operations involving waste tallow, such as its processing into bio-diesel, are not subject to the directive’s requirements but are subject to control under the Waste Framework Directive."
"Thank you for your response."
"The Commission did in fact respond to a similar question yesterday, but it did feel that there were practical problems with the implementation of this directive, especially in three Member States – including the Member State you and I know best, President-in-Office – which had implemented it in the most rigid form."
"May I ask whether it would be possible to postpone implementation in those three Member States until the Commission can come up with a much more practical application of this directive?"
"Surely that would be consistent with our desire for a more sensible form of EU legislation."
"It would also benefit our Scottish constituency farmers and our Scottish environment."
". Greatly tempting though it would be to answer, both as a Scottish Member of Parliament and as a British Minister, I would respectfully remind myself and this Chamber that I answer today on behalf of the Presidency."
"In that context, while I have sympathy with the points made by the Member about the need for these practical difficulties to be addressed, it would seem more appropriate that these matters be brought to the attention of the Commission by the individual Member States acting in their own interests rather than it be, in the first instance, a Presidency matter."
"However, on the way forward and on the prospect of action by the European Commission, let me take the opportunity to say that the Commission has indicated an intention to place a consultancy contract, within the next month, for a study of the environmental, regulatory and operational impacts of the inclusion of the burning of waste tallow within the scope of the Waste Incineration Directive."
"The study will include recommendations to the Commission concerning whether the application of the Waste Incineration Directive’s regulatory controls to the burning of waste tallow is appropriate."
"These recommendations are expected to be made in the middle of next year."
"President-in-Office, this might seem in some senses quite an obscure topic, but it is extremely important."
"You are right to say that there is a review, but the problem is – the last point you made – the fact that the review will not be completed until next June."
"Once companies, farmers and so on stop burning tallow through incinerators, they are unlikely to return to it, so we need a decision before the end of the year."
"The Commission has not promised, but indicated, that it would look sympathetically on the idea of excluding tallow from the directive."
"Only 3 of the 25 Member States include tallow within the scope of the directive."
"A simple solution would be for the Presidency to ask the Commission to consider putting out an advisory note stating that tallow should not be considered as part of the Waste Directive."
"I think that would be met with a sympathetic response from the Commission."
". Firstly let me place on record my understanding, not least given my own responsibilities back home, of the importance of this issue and the fact that there are a limited number of Member States which have moved much more rapidly than others in implementing this directive."
"It has not previously been put to me that the Presidency should approach the Commission to issue the advisory note because, clearly, up until now the position has been clear in relation to this as in relation to other directives."
"Whether to invest in any necessary upgrading to comply with the directive when it comes fully into force at the end of this year is a matter for a commercial decision by the rendering companies and biodiesel companies burning tallow as fuel."
"However, if the situation is as the honourable Member describes, in that there is now genuine uncertainty as to the merit or demerit of making those investment decisions because of uncertainty as to the status of the directive, I will certainly consider sympathetically the point that has been made to me and perhaps I will be able to write to the honourable Member to confirm the way forward."
"Thank you for that response, President-In-Office."
"It is not only tallow that creates a problem, although it is the most pressing one."
"There is a real need to achieve carbon neutrality and to avoid placing unnecessary costs on business."
"So, saying Mr Martin’s suggestion is one way forward, I would also ask whether the Council would be prepared to support Members of the European Parliament in asking the Commission to produce a list of materials in relation to which it will refrain from instigating any infringement proceedings under the Waste Incineration Directive until an analysis has been conducted of their overall environmental effect when used as a fuel source."
". Given the range of views that have already been expressed as to the right way forward for the Presidency, the sensible approach would be to reflect on both of the suggestions and write to both of the honourable Members in due course, once this debate is concluded."
"In the light of the Council's positive approach to negotiations on the entry of Turkey to the European Union, can the Council update us on progress for the negotiations during the UK Presidency?"
"Can the Council comment on the particular position regarding Kurdish cultural and human rights as part of any negotiation package?"
". As the honourable Member will be aware, the Union opened accession negotiations with Turkey on Monday 3 October."
"This was a historic moment and another important step in the evolution of the European Union-Turkey relationship."
"It marked the beginning of a long and rigorous process that will be guided by the negotiating framework adopted by the Council the same day."
"The Commission started screening the science and research chapter on 20 October."
"The European Union will continue to monitor respect for the human and cultural rights of the Kurdish people and the situation in the south east of the country in general."
"As stipulated in the negotiating framework, Turkey should consolidate and broaden legislation and implement measures on, , freedom of expression, freedom of religion and minority rights."
"Progress in these areas should be irreversible, fully and effectively implemented."
"The Commission will therefore continue to monitor it closely and to report regularly to the Council."
"The Council can assure Members that the Union attaches great importance to this issue as part of the ongoing reform process in Turkey."
"Hence progress will continue to be monitored and evaluated in all the relevant bodies."
"I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the President-in-Office on his role in Luxembourg, a negotiation he probably will not forget."
"On the very serious question of the Kurdish community, I am in contact with the largest community centre of Kurds anywhere in the United Kingdom."
"Whilst they are grateful for the negotiations, they are anxious that you do not let the positive energy that is now flowing in these negotiations negate the very real human rights considerations the Kurdish community still has."
"They feel that this should be a major part of any negotiation – it is a symbolic part – and we ask the President-in-Office to continue to take that seriously."
". Let me take this opportunity to place on record my respect and admiration for the work that the honourable Member has taken forward over a number of years for communities such as the Kurdish community in London."
"In response to his generous tribute to my role in the negotiations and the assertion that I would never forget it, I think I was in some danger of forgetting my own name by the end of 30 hours of serial and continuing negotiations!"
"But I am delighted to say that, notwithstanding the lack of sleep and the considerable effort on all sides, we managed to reach what I think was a constructive way forward which reflected the long historical association between Turkey and Europe, the prospect of European membership having been held out to Turkey for 42 years."
"It was a genuinely historic moment in Luxembourg and one from which I think many of the Members of the European Parliament can take real pride."
"However, the emphasis that I place on that moment in history, as I hope I reflected in my initial answer, is that it marks the next step of a journey that Turkey is on."
"In many ways, the destination is important but so too is the journey that Turkey is taking to reach that destination."
"In that regard, I believe that those of us who have long argued for Turkish accession to the European Union have the best interests of those who have, in the past, been fearful of their human and civil rights within Turkey at heart, because the very process of accession and the rigour which I sought to reflect in my earlier reply in many ways represent one of the best guarantees that can be afforded to such communities that the progress we all wish to see as Turkey makes that journey over the decade or so ahead will actually be made, and that there will be a transparent means by which the scale and pace of that progress can be judged, not just by the communities within Turkey but also by the wider international community within the European Union."
"In considering the health section of the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Development, will the Council consider the relevance of different types of health issues to the Lisbon Agenda?"
"Is the Council aware that respiratory diseases cost European health services more than €102 billion and are the most frequent conditions requiring general practice consultations and emergency hospital admissions, presenting an enormous burden in terms of working days lost?"
"Does the Council agree that research in this area is likely to provide both health and economic benefits and therefore make a major contribution to the Lisbon strategy?"
". As the honourable Member is aware, the Council is currently examining the Commission proposal of April 2005 for the Seventh Framework Programme for 2007-2013 – or FP7 – which will be decided by this Parliament and the Council under the codecision procedure."
"The Council has, on several occasions, confirmed the importance it attaches to research and technological development activities in the context of the Lisbon Agenda."
"I hope the commitment of our own Prime Minister and the Presidency to that agenda was obvious to all Members of this Parliament from his remarks earlier this afternoon."
"The research programme in particular is the main Community instrument."
"Further research into respiratory diseases would be timely."
"Respiratory diseases are currently the leading cause of death in the European Union and yet these illnesses have a lower profile than many other diseases such as heart disease."
"The honourable Member is right to draw attention to the significant economic loss caused by these diseases in particular."
"In the European Union, 41 300 lost work days per one thousand of the population are due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease alone."
"Productivity losses resulting from this disease amount to EUR 28.5 billion annually."
"The Commission proposal for FP7 includes health and environment as priority research topics."
"As regards research potentially relevant to respiratory diseases, the following topics are proposed amongst others: innovative therapeutic approaches and intervention with potential applications in many diseases; transnational research into infectious diseases and major diseases including cancer; the quality, efficiency and solidarity of health systems; enhanced disease prevention and better use of medicines; the interaction of environmental factors such as pollution with human health."
"The Framework Programme indicates the broad lines of research activity and therefore does not exhaustively list the potential individual research topics."
"These will be elaborated on in the specific programme decisions and during the execution of the programme, which is the responsibility of the Commission."
"Research projects are selected mainly on the basis of open calls for proposals to the scientific community and take into account various criteria such as scientific excellence and European added value."
"I thank the Presidency for an encouraging reply and for the commitment shown by Mr Blair earlier to boosting RTD in the European Union budget."
"Research is an area where a common programme, rather than 25 separate national programmes, can provide added value and can save money."
"Health, important in its own right for the human beings involved, is also important in terms of our economic performance."
"The statistics you quoted show that this is an area that can tie in with and be a flagship example of how the Lisbon Agenda can be matched in the field of research."
"May I urge the Council to persevere with that line of argument in its internal deliberations."
". I can assure you that I will reflect on and bear in mind the remarks the Member has made."
"I reiterate the commitment and importance we attach to using the framework directive in the kind of ways that I outlined in my initial answer."
"If I can offer a ray of optimism to the Member, it would simply be to say that he is not a lone voice in this Parliament in making this case."
"Even while I was sitting at desk No 2 and our Prime Minister was still addressing the Chamber this afternoon, one of your colleagues in the Socialist Group had already passed a note to me saying that they took the strength of commitment to research and development shown by our Prime Minister during his speech as a very clear indication that the Seventh Framework Programme would be fully funded to the extent that she wanted."
"I am not able to give such an indication today, given the interrelated issues of financing that such a commitment would involve, but, in its own way, for me, it reflects the strength of feeling, not just amongst the Council – which I believe will be reflected in the Council tomorrow at Hampton Court – but amongst a wide cross-section of Members of this Parliament, that research and development is one of the key priorities for the Union moving ahead in the future."
"Does the Council feel that the situation of ethnic and religious minorities in Turkey has changed by comparison with last year, in particular in the light of the law on religion?"
". The European Commission has agreed that the reforms of recent years have strengthened minority rights."
"However, there remain a number of outstanding concerns, which the Commission will address in its regular report, due on 9 November."
"The Commission and the Council will continue to monitor these issues closely."
"Non-Muslim religious communities continue to experience difficulties with questions of legal personality, property rights, training, residents’ rights and work permits for Turkish and non-Turkish clergy, schools and internal management."
"A new law on foundations is expected to resolve some of these problems."
"The European Commission has acknowledged that the latest draft is a significant improvement on its predecessor."
"The Union has urged Turkey to adopt such a law promptly and ensure that it is fully compliant with European standards."
"On his visit to Ankara from 6 to 8 October 2005, Commissioner Rehn urged the Turkish Authorities to take into account the Commission’s comments on the draft law."
"The European Union has also repeated its calls for Turkey to reopen the Halki Greek Orthodox Seminary."
"With regard to the rights of those belonging to ethnic minorities, some progress has been achieved, notably in the field of cultural rights, but further progress is needed."
"Furthermore, the situation in the south east of Turkey remains a matter for concern."
"The negotiation mandate agreed by the European Union that will guide accession negotiations with Turkey in the months and years ahead stipulates that Turkey should work towards further improvement in respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as consolidate and broaden legislation and implementing measures on, , freedom of religion and minority rights."
"The Council can assure the honourable Member that the Union attaches great importance to these issues."
"Hence monitoring and evaluation of progress, as well as dialogue with the Turkish side, will continue in all the relevant bodies."
"Mr President, these problems mainly affect the Christian minority groups in Turkey, where Christians face the threat of their disappearance from the scene."
"Their numbers are dwindling, and the Ecumenical Patriarch fears that there may well be no Christians left in Turkey by the time the accession negotiations come to an end."
"It is for that reason that I have a very specific question to put to you."
"The Law on Religion was submitted to the Commission, which had some trenchant criticisms to make of it."
"The Turks said that their parliament would make improvements to it."
"Do you have any definite indications that such improvements have been made, particularly where the property law and the training of priests is concerned?"
"Have you received any definite indications, and will you insist on them being reflected in action over the course of the coming weeks, or do you intend to wait until the Turkish Christians have died out before dealing with this?"
". I think it most appropriate to await the Commission report on exactly these matters, because it is important – rather than to deal on the basis of individual examples, or sometimes even of anecdote – to have evidence on which to base assertions that are being made."
"It is certainly the case that the Union continues to urge the Turkish Government to reopen the Halki Greek Orthodox Seminary, as I said, that closed back in 1971."
"The Turkish Government remains committed to this and is searching for a solution that is both compatible with Turkish law and acceptable to the Patriarchate."
"On the specific issue of confiscation of Greek Orthodox Church property, Commissioner Rehn wrote to the Turkish Foreign Minister in June on the shortcomings in the draft law on foundations and highlighted the issue of property rights specifically."
"The final point I would make – given the very negative construction that was placed in the question as regards the prospects for the Christian community within Turkey – is to place on record the fact that leaders of those Christian communities themselves have been some of those who have recognised the scale of progress that has been made in recent months in anticipation of the opening of accession talks."
"So, while I am respectful to the point the honourable Member made, I think we also need to listen to those Christian voices within Turkey who themselves are claiming that the very process and prospect of accession is providing for them and guaranteeing rights which, tragically, have not been available to them in past circumstances."
"Under Regulation (EC) No 639/2003(2) the age of cows and heifers for which export refunds can be claimed was reduced from 36 to 30 months."
"Previously, under Regulation (EC) No 615/1998(3), animals had been eligible for export refunds up to an age at export of 36 months."
"This makes things more difficult for cattle breeders in mountain areas. Mountain breeders are tied to autumn calving in the alpine cycle."
"Owing to the harsh conditions, mountain cattle breeds grazing on alpine pastures also develop more slowly, and biological factors mean that they cannot be mated until they are 24 months old."
"Can the Council grant a derogation for alpine mountain cattle breeds as a matter of urgency, raising the export age for mountain cattle to the earlier limit of 36 months?"
". Under the procedure laid down for Regulation (EC) No 639/2003, to which the honourable Member refers, the Commission is responsible for submitting to the management committee any proposal for modifying implementing measures relating to conditions governing the payment of export refunds."
"The Council is requested to act only when a majority of delegations in the management committee has been unable to give an opinion on such a proposal."
"The Commission has made no such proposal."
"Mr President, this is a considerable problem for mountainous regions, which are particularly threatened by decultivation and desertification, and so, with regard not only to this but also to the environmental importance of these cattle breeds for the Alps, which are in any case at ecological risk, I would like to ask whether the Council endorses such a course of action, or whether it is maintaining absolute impartiality and declining to state a position on the subject."
". The European Union has a wide variety of instruments aimed at assisting farmers across the spectrum."
"None, to my knowledge, directly targets alpine mountain cattle breeds, but many are aimed at farmers that deliver the kind of benefits that many European Union citizens would associate with alpine farming, such as managing sensitive landscapes and habitats and, indeed, maintaining biodiversity."
"In response to the subsequent point made by the honourable Member, I would simply reiterate the importance of recognising the relative institutional responsibilities with regard to this Regulation, and I would suggest that, if there are continuing concerns of the type that the honourable Member has raised, then, given the relative responsibilities of the Commission and the Presidency, it might be more appropriate for them to be directed towards the Commission."
"The European Council failed to agree in June on the new financial perspective for the period from 2007 to 2013."
"One of the stumbling blocks to a consensus was the British rebate."
"Will the country currently holding the presidency submit a proposal to the European Council that would serve to treat the Member States equally or in other words do away with the rebates granted to the United Kingdom and some other countries?"
". The Presidency is fully aware, as the Prime Minister and I have stated on numerous occasions today, of the importance of reaching an agreement on the new Financial Perspective, if we can, by the end of the year."
"We will work to achieve that."
"It has just completed a series of bilateral meetings with all Member States and the two accession states in order to determine the basis on which such an agreement might be possible."
"In the light of these consultations, the Presidency hopes to draw up a proposal, which it intends to submit to the Council."
"The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said in his letter to Heads of Government ahead of the informal meeting that will take place tomorrow at Hampton Court, that he believes agreement can and should be reached at the December Council, and that he will make every effort personally to achieve it by then."
"All of that having been said, as was reaffirmed very powerfully by the turn of events at the June European Council, the ultimate determinant of whether agreement will be reached on the future Financial Perspective rests not on the will of one country – albeit one country holding the Presidency – but on the commitment of all 25 Member States of the European Union to work to secure that consensus."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in June this issue depended on just a few countries and, to a greater extent, on the country currently holding the presidency, the United Kingdom."
"At the time, you effectively torpedoed the solution, which would have allowed us to arrive at a financial framework for the period 2007–2013."
"Now that you yourself are drafting it, the question has arisen of whether it should form some sort of package, and I would like to ask this: is it possible that the joint financing of agriculture will be a part of this package, which would mean that Member States would start paying a portion of compulsory agricultural expenditure themselves?"
". Let me address both of those points in turn."
"Firstly, although it might be convenient to the honourable Member's question for the United Kingdom to have been isolated in a minority of one at the June European Council, I am afraid that simply was not what happened."
"I know because I was there."
"Five Member States were unable to accept the Luxembourg Presidency proposals."
"From a British point of view, we were very clear that there were specific reasons why we were unable to accept that."
"However, it would be inappropriate for me to narrate or rehearse the arguments that were advanced from the British seat in June, given my responsibilities today to answer on behalf of the Presidency."
"In relation to the general issue of agriculture, again, our Prime Minister addressed that in the course of his remarks today, namely that we believe it is necessary to have a pathway forward, in terms of reform, that recognises the kind of future challenges that the European Union will face in the course of the coming Financial Perspective."
"Beyond that, I can simply reiterate the point with which I began my answer, which is to say that, as our own Prime Minister has made clear in the course of his remarks to this Parliament today, we are earnest in our endeavour to try and reach agreement on the future Financial Perspective, not simply because it would be somehow judged to be a success for the British Presidency or in the interests of one Member State, but because it would be in the interests of all Member States of the European Union to have a budget that reflects the modern priorities of the Union in an era of globalisation."
"There are particular demands on the Presidency from the A10 countries – the new accession countries – which have articulated repeatedly to us their clear desire for certainty in terms of prospective funds being available to them in the future."
"We have listened carefully to those points of view, consistent with our responsibilities as President."
"Given the difficulties of the June European Council, we did not immediately table proposals but rather sought to listen to the views that have been expressed in other Member States."
"We recognise that the political context in which discussions on future financing should take place would be better served by having had a prior conversation about the future direction of Europe, which is why we have organised the informal Heads of Government meeting tomorrow."
"After that meeting at Hampton Court tomorrow, we will then seek to make practical and real progress in relation to the challenges that we all recognise."
"A study of the current Presidency shows that it enjoys not giving direct answers to direct questions in Question Time."
"Is it deliberately adopting the style of the House of Commons, where national ministers glory in revealing as little as possible, contrary to true democratic principles, or, since the Presidency represents the Council as a whole and not the Commons, is it planning to use the continental system of helping the citizens who are its pay-masters by giving genuine information in answer to questions put to it?"
". Draft replies to oral questions at Question Time are drafted by the Council's Secretariat in cooperation with the Presidency and the Member States with the aim of providing the most accurate answers to questions put by honourable Members of this Chamber."
"It should be recalled, however, that during Question Time the President-in-Office acts on behalf of the Council; hence he must decline to answer questions which are outside the Council's sphere of competence, for example, where matters of strictly internal politics are concerned."
". Thank you, President-in-Office, and thank you for reaching question 17."
"On the last two occasions, we unfortunately ran out of time and my question was not answered."
"My question is a follow-up."
"I believe that at the last Strasbourg part-session the Presidency decided unilaterally to change the system of answering questions so that the whole Council had to be involved."
"I understand that President Borrell Fontelles has written formally, asking for a return to the system that has served this House well for 30 years."
"I would urge you to do that."
"There might not be many of us here, but those who do come very much value this opportunity and would not wish the answers to questions that cannot be answered on this occasion to be further delayed."
". I can assure you that, in terms of what is an ongoing dialogue with President Borrell, there is no intention whatsoever of diminishing the capacity of ministers to be answerable and to answer questions directly to Members in the format that we are presently enjoying."
"I am not sure we are both enjoying it, but certainly you are!"
"I can also assure you that there was nothing personal in our failure to reach question 17 in the two previous question times."
"I think that ministers have an important responsibility to endeavour to address themselves to the questions that have been put."
"On the basis of my accumulating experience of answering questions in this Chamber, there are circumstances in which questions are put directly to us that are matters of national interest rather than being within the remit of the Presidency, and that, inevitably, is reflected in the answers that are given."
"As the time allotted to Question Time has elapsed, Questions Nos 18 to 46 will be answered in writing(4)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on Afghanistan."
". Madam President, last month nearly 7 million Afghans went to the polls to elect a parliament for the first time in 36 years."
"This was the culmination of a political transitional process agreed in Bonn four years ago."
"I visited Afghanistan at the beginning of September to look at the election preparations and see for myself the practical impact our assistance is having on the ground."
"I was also able to discuss all the challenges ahead and the next phase of the stabilisation process with President Karzai and his ministers, as well as with Afghan civil society and the United Nations."
"I would therefore like to take this opportunity to say a few words about the elections, the preparations for the post-Bonn period and future EU-Afghanistan relations."
"The European Union has supported Afghanistan’s recent election in a number of ways."
"It is no exaggeration to say that the election could not have taken place without the European Union, including contributions by the Member States."
"We funded 40% of the election budget, contributing EUR 159 million."
"We have also sought to improve transparency by deploying an EU Election Observation Mission, headed by Mrs Emma Bonino who is present today."
"This has followed the process since July."
"It also benefited from the cooperation of an observer delegation from Parliament, led by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, who is here today as well."
"I think we can say that the EU EOM was the single largest international observer group in the country."
"Its presence was extremely important."
"In its preliminary statement, the EU EOM reported that the election day itself had been largely peaceful, the process up to that point had been generally well administered and the elections marked a step forward for Afghanistan’s democratic development."
"Nevertheless, it also noted a number of concerns, for instance with the whole campaign environment, the choice of voting system and the complaints mechanism."
"I understand that in some provinces fraud and irregularities have come to light during the counting phase."
"The Election Observation Mission has urged the electoral authorities to deal diligently with these concerns."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Bonino for her team’s excellent work so far."
"I look forward to the final report, which will include an overall assessment of the entire election process, as well as recommendations to improve the conduct of future elections."
"Mrs Bonino will be travelling to Kabul again before the end of the year to present the report to election stakeholders."
"What comes next, after the Bonn process?"
"Afghanistan has come a long way since the fall of the Taliban."
"I am proud that the European Commission’s assistance has had a tangible impact."
"We have pursued a combination of visible reconstruction, lasting capacity-building and improvements in the day-to-day lives of the Afghan people."
