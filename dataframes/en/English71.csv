"Moreover, I do not think that the final vote will be affected since the nominal lists have already been drawn up, so why do we not just go ahead and have the debate and the vote today?"
"I share your view that the timetable leaves something to be desired."
"I would have preferred to vote this morning in plenary, but there was no majority support within the groups for this view. Had we done so, we would have at least achieved the majorities with all MEPs attending."
"Given that the vote has already been rescheduled three times, it is now, in my view, too late."
"Since we agreed on this timetable, the most important thing now, I think, is to close off this chapter with a debate and a vote."
"Here is the proposal from the President."
"We are within the scope of Rule 170(1) of the Rules of Procedure, which states in the second sub-paragraph, ‘The intention to move adjournment shall be notified at least twenty-four hours in advance to the President, who shall inform Parliament immediately.’"
"It is clear that this condition has not been met: the adjournment was not requested twenty-four hours in advance."
"I am therefore obliged to proceed to the debate, all the more because our rapporteur so wishes."
"I recognise, ladies and gentlemen, that a debate of such importance deserved a larger audience."
"I must, however, make two observations."
"Firstly, as a general rule, our debates rarely fill the House, be it a Thursday afternoon, a Monday, a Tuesday or a Wednesday."
"Secondly, our calendar is set up in such a way that Parliament sits on a Thursday afternoon."
"One cannot, therefore, discriminate between Members who make the effort to stay and those who prefer to attend to other business."
"Consequently, we shall proceed with this debate and hand over straight away to Mrs Martens, our rapporteur."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission proposes a long-term strategy for achieving the Millennium Development Goals in Africa by 2015."
"This can only be applauded."
"We need a very ambitious plan to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and, above all, to get sub-Saharan Africa on track."
"The question is now whether the proposed strategy will help achieve this in the best possible way."
"The strategy clearly outlines the problems, and I share its cautious optimism as regards the development of the African Union and NEPAD."
"The strategy has certainly come up with excellent ideas as to how problems may be solved, one example being the extremely important emphasis on the principle of ownership."
"After all, if Africans cannot take their fate into their own hands and take responsibility for further development, any strategy is doomed to fail."
"The European Union is the world’s largest donor."
"For years, Europe has given money and aid, and yet there is more poverty than there was before."
"A new strategy is therefore needed. Unfortunately, the document cannot really convince me yet that it really represents a U-turn."
"Why not?"
"There is certainly nothing wrong with its analysis or the goals, but the proposed ways and means leave a lot to be desired."
"The Commissioner is right in saying that we must provide more and better aid more quickly."
"We cannot do this by giving more money alone, even if we are talking about a few billion extra."
"It is great that Europe wants to free up more funds, and the Commission wants to remind the Member States of their financial commitments, but we need more than that."
"I am thinking first and foremost of what we can do in our own policy, about the three Cs of coordination, coherence and complementarity."
"If they do not improve, then chances of more effective aid will quickly dwindle."
"Much will ultimately depend on the political will of the Member States."
"I hope that the Commission will find an effective strategy to promote those."
"Secondly, the Commission acknowledges the fact that major differences exist between the African countries."
"The different situations and problems are described accurately, but clear, appropriate instruments that address those differences are lacking."
"In our view, a clear distinction should be drawn between aid to stable countries and aid to countries that are unstable socially and economically due to bad governance, corruption and mismanagement."
"Whilst it is possible, as the Commission proposes, for stable countries to be helped under certain conditions, even via budgetary support and sectoral aid, unstable countries also deserve our support."
"We cannot turn our backs on those people."
"In those unstable countries, we should not call for aid to be granted via the governments, but for aid via social organisations, which must specifically involve religious communities, as these reach out to many people, after all, and can benefit health, education and other basic provisions."
"Thirdly, the Commission proposes that our efforts for Africa be, from now on, grouped together under three strands."
"The first strand is promoting security and good governance, which is important."
"The second strand is that of economy and trade, and guaranteeing a better investment climate, which is also important."
"Only the third leg of the action plan concerns poverty reduction via the Millennium Development Goals, such as promoting basic health care, improving education, protecting the environment and creating jobs for as many people as possible."
"We think that the latter, the Millennium Development Goals, should be central."
"Poverty reduction is critical in order to achieve structural stability so as to, in turn, allow further development."
"That is why, in our view, all policies must first and foremost be an instrument geared towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"That is why we feel that major infrastructural works in Africa or exchanges between twin towns and universities in the European Union and Africa are premature."
"They are valuable projects but would be more suitable at a later stage."
"Finally, I should like to thank everyone who has contributed to this report, whether inside or outside this House, for their contributions to the thought process."
"I can look back on a pleasant and constructive working relationship."
"Just before I hand over to the Commission, and for the benefit of those Members who are wondering when the vote would take place in the event of adjournment, I shall read out the relevant rule from the Rules of Procedure."
"It is Rule 170(4), which states that: ‘Before or during a vote a political group or at least thirty-seven Members may move that the vote be adjourned."
"Such a motion shall be put to the vote immediately.’"
"That means, in practical terms, that we shall proceed to the vote at the end of this afternoon’s debates."
"It is at this moment, and at this moment only, that a political group or a group of thirty-seven Members can call for an adjournment specifying when, at which part-session, they wish the vote to take place."
"We shall, therefore, proceed to the debate and at the end of the afternoon the possible adjournment of the vote will be brought up for discussion."
"I thank the Commissioner for being patient and now hand over to him."
"Mr President, Mrs Martens, ladies and gentlemen, Africa is the continent that poses the greatest development challenges."
"Progressive desertification, the shortage of water, famine and HIV/AIDS have reached critical levels there."
"Africa is the continent where there are more donors than anywhere else."
"It is therefore the continent where the need for coordination and complementarity is the most urgent."
"Countries such as Tanzania or Mozambique each have to manage some 500 individual projects funded by European donors in the social infrastructure sector alone, even though the amounts devoted to each of these projects are relatively small."
"Africa is also the continent that offers us the greatest opportunity today."
"The birth of the African Union and the adoption of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, the reinforced role of Africa’s Regional Economic Communities and the emergence of a new generation of leaders at national level have changed the way Africa is governed."
"New glimmers of hope for peace are being seen in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in Somalia, Burundi and Liberia."
"This continent, which is the ecological lung of the world, has unrivalled wealth when it comes to natural resources."
"It is also a future demographic power."
"By 2025, the population of Africa will have grown to more than 1.3 billion, almost as large as that of China or India, and greater than the combined populations of the European Union and the United States."
"It will also have the advantage of a younger population, since at that time almost 800 million Africans will be under the age of 15."
"More than ever, this Africa deserves Europe’s full attention."
"That is why the Commission has proposed a new Strategy for Africa, which was adopted on 12 October and presented in this House the very same day, a strategy intended to provide the European Union with a single, comprehensive and long-term framework for its relations with Africa."
"Mr President, Mrs Martens, ladies and gentlemen, the Strategy for Africa is based on three main themes: one Africa, one Europe and one objective."
"One Africa: while Africa has many faces, different histories and diverse needs, it has now collectively embarked on a path of political, economic and cultural integration of the entire continent, crystallised in the integration efforts promoted by its Regional Economic Communities, the launching of the African Union and NEPAD."
"In short, this is integration that deserves our unconditional support."
"One Europe: Europe has also changed."
"The enlargement of the European Union to include ten new members has taken the number of potential individual partners to 26: the 25 Member States plus the European Community."
"This development has increased the European Union’s potential political and economic impact, but the enlarged membership also poses new challenges in terms of aid coordination and complementarity."
"The European Union Strategy for Africa will therefore make aid effectiveness and donor coordination central priorities in the years ahead."
"One objective: Europe’s policy on security, for example, has for a long time coexisted – not always happily, I might add – with its development policy."
"Recent experience – and I am thinking in particular of the Peace Facility for Africa – shows how intimately security and development are linked and how important it is for European policies in these areas to be closely coordinated."
"In the European Union Strategy for Africa, the common objective is, therefore, to promote the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in Africa."
"Our overall strategy comprises a series of specific proposals, as you know, and I am glad to see that we largely agree on these points, some of which appear in Mrs Martens’s report, such as strengthening the Peace Facility for Africa, and strengthening the role of national parliaments and civil society organisations in planning, prioritising and – let us not forget – scrutinising development cooperation policy."
"The conclusion of Economic Partnership Agreements as a development-centred tool for liberalisation has the potential to promote economic growth in Africa."
"When it comes to creating an attractive climate for reliable and predictable investment, to foster this we have, as you know, proposed setting up a permanent European forum bringing together African and European entrepreneurs, and building infrastructure in the widest sense of the word, including water, energy, ICT and transport, as provided for in the Europe-Africa Partnership on Infrastructure."
"Let us not forget either the launch of a new European Union Programme for Action to confront HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria; the emphasis placed on higher education alongside the efforts being made in basic education, and the increase in budget support."
"The Commission and the Member States will indeed have to endeavour to make the transition from aid projects to sectoral approaches and to direct budget support on that basis. No doubt we will be returning to this during the course of this debate."
"Finally, increased coordination of European aid and the implementation of a roadmap on coherence, coordination and complementarity seek to ensure that the European Union cooperates more effectively on development."
"These, then, are the main themes of the Africa strategy."
"I am delighted to see that Parliament finds its concerns reflected in our three basic concepts and in the specific proposals."
"Mrs Martens’ report and the motion tabled are ambitious. I am delighted;"
"I thank you for this and I congratulate you."
". – Mr President, the fact that we are holding this debate at this hour and with so few of us present does indeed seem to indicate what value we attach to policy on Africa."
"Some of the debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs on its opinion on this report was very lively, but it did eventually adopt it unanimously."
"It is unfortunate that there was later majority support for a Conservative motion that there be no demand for a debate on the role of colonialism, which I believe would be important in the African context."
"Among other things, our opinion states that fundamental human rights should be respected when dealing with refugees and illegal immigrants on the EU’s African borders, which I recently visited with a delegation."
"There one sees concrete evidence of the means currently adopted by the EU to combat poverty, in the shape of fences and walls, and that is highly problematic."
"In our opinion, we call for a debate on the social responsibilities of governments and businesses as an integral part of the new Africa strategy, to which the Commission certainly needs to make some improvements."
"Our opinion also addresses the need for the proposed cuts in measures to combat HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis to be reversed, and stresses the importance of promoting peace and conflict resolution in Africa, with consequent specific reference to the control of weapons exports, which we debated yesterday."
"This prompts me to mention that I have taken note of the speech made by Commissioner Michel to the Parliamentary Assembly of the WEU on 21 September, in which he said that EUR 250 million for African troops was to be taken from the development budget."
"That I regard as the wrong way to go about it, and I warn the EU against conflating its security or military policies with its policy on development."
". – Mr President, by way of introduction I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Martens."
"Her report reflects reality and lays down the prospects of the development strategy for Africa."
"The situation in Africa, where most of the less developed countries are found, is due both to endogenous and to extraneous factors."
"Addressing the endogenous factors is the responsibility of the African governments themselves."
"However, the overcoming of extraneous factors concerns us and not only because the European Union is by far the biggest donor of humanitarian aid."
"It does not concern us only in the sense of increasing aid to 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product by 2015."
"It concerns us in the sense that development aid will, as the report emphasises, go hand in hand with its improved quality, effectiveness, transparency and visibility."
"The challenge to the European Union consists, in my opinion, among other things:"
"Firstly, in overcoming the fragmentation of humanitarian intervention and in constructing a cohesive approach."
"Secondly, in linking the Union's policy with the Millennium Development Goals."
"Thirdly, in establishing effective coordination of humanitarian aid between the Member States and the Commission and between the Union's bilateral policies and its development policy."
"Action by the Union should obey a clear timetable, specific targets and the need to link objectives and means."
"This need is indicated, among other things, by the report, which I endorse."
"The Commissioner condensed the challenge of Africa in his phrase: 'One Africa, one Europe, one objective'."
"'One Africa' is the responsibility of Africa itself, 'one Europe' is the responsibility of Europe and 'one objective' is our common objective."
"We support this eminent initiative of yours and will respond convincingly to the challenge of Africa."
"– Mr President, we believe the report by Mrs Martens to be serious and timely."
"It received widespread support and our vote in the Committee on Development."
"I do not have time now to comment on the main body of the report, with whose resolution we Socialists will agree provided that it is not altered by means of amendments in plenary."
"For a long time we have been arguing that Europe has an ethical and political responsibility to make a decisive contribution to development in Africa, but in recent times it should be clear to everybody that that development has also become absolutely essential in order to maintain both stability on the international scene and stability and prosperity in Europe."
"This is why we agree with Mrs Martens that to do everything possible to help Africa out of its dramatic situation of under-development must become a genuine priority within the European Union’s policies."
"In this regard, it is essential that we see our role as one of accompanying the African leaders in the implementation of their own decisions."
"We are therefore concerned about the fact that the Commission’s Communication, to which Mrs Martens’ report refers, does not make more reference to the African Union and to the strategic plan that the Heads of State in that sister institution have defined as strategic priorities for the development of their continent."
"Perhaps we are making the mistake of defining priorities off our own backs that do not coincide with those of the people mainly affected, partners to whom we have a commitment in terms of achieving the objectives that we have been discussing."
"– Mr President, the focus has rightly been on combating poverty in Africa."
"Alongside the input we have received from the Council concerning Tony Blair’s Africa Commission and the UN Summit, the Commission’s proposal contains a good many constructive features relating to the environment, good governance and the fight against poverty."
"We have also noted that women and equality have been included as part of the picture and that importance is attached to women’s importance as driving forces in the development of society."
"I must, however, use the short period I have in which to speak in order to highlight an alarming aspect of the proposal, namely the unduly centralised way in which EU aid to Africa is planned, using for example a Donor Atlas, as if we in Europe could sit and plan how aid is to be coordinated in the individual African countries."
"This practice is in direct conflict with those principles of aid effectiveness and good donor behaviour that the EU helped adopt at the Paris High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in March of this year."
"It is the African countries that should have the crucial role in coordinating aid, proceeding on the basis of their own strategies for combating poverty."
"If we do not provide aid in that way, we shall be in danger of seeing a veritable invasion of white elephants in Africa, and that would mean a return to a very bad strategy."
"We must stand by what we have said so far."
"Quite a few of the amendments in the Martens report take account of these centralist measures on the part of the Commission, and I hope that Parliament will ensure that the recipient countries, and not the Commission, continue to play a pivotal role where aid is concerned."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s initiative promoting a development strategy for Africa, in the interests of greater coherence for European development cooperation, is, in principle, something to be welcomed."
"Up to now, every government has, in its dealings with Africa, pursued its own interests, formulated its own strategies for development cooperation and created its own structures to implement them."
"Coherence and improved coordination of aid are, as I see it, very important if we want to make a real contribution to combating famine, preventing violent conflicts and keeping states from disintegrating."
"Clear distinctions need to be drawn between the African states in terms of their social, cultural, economic, political and environmental development, and any European development strategy needs to take account not only of this but also of African people’s prospects and of the conditions and processes in their own countries."
"Any development strategy for Africa needs to be influenced by the knowledge of Africa’s regional organisations, elected parliaments, the organisations of civil society and trade unions concerning the processes and approaches involved in finding solutions to the maladministration of their own countries and to removing it."
"Only then will the criterion of ‘ownership’, on which so much stress is laid in the report, make any sort of sense."
"The President of the African Union responded with outrage to the questions he was asked about the tragedy of the refugees in Melilla, and he had every right to do so, saying, as he did, among other things, that these people were not lazy, and that the EU’s, and the USA’s, agricultural subsidies had to be seen as questionable."
"The Committee on International Trade, in its opinion, emphasised the importance of, , the abolition of export subsidies as a means of enabling Africa to become an equal partner in world trade, but the Commission’s development strategy, makes no clear commitment to this."
"This strategy will make aid more efficient only if it is understood as a guideline for cooperation with the various partner countries."
"Any such framework for the EU’s development cooperation must take account of the diversity present within Africa and make use of Africans’ experience and know-how."
"Only in that way can this strategy make a real contribution."
". – Mr President, Mrs Martens has put a great deal of effort into drafting this report, and there can be no question that it is very useful in many respects."
"I cannot help but point out, however, that it makes no direct reference to certain issues that are of absolutely key importance, both for Africa and for other very poor countries."
"We will not help these countries merely by setting up funds, or by cooperating with the same old organisations."
"We need to draw attention to the fundamental goals, the most important of which is education, education and education."
"Further goals include hygiene and health, and support for the local economy."
"I would repeat that it must be the local economy that receives our support, since this is what will help people on the ground."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this report would be a very welcome development, if it were not for the unfortunate fact that it has fallen victim to something that crops up all too often in this House."
"An ideological slant has been put on it, which is entirely uncalled for in a debate such as this on aid for developing countries."
"Once again, ideological references to reproductive health and reproductive rights have been included, even though they are completely out of place."
"We really cannot allow every text we adopt to be peppered with various extraneous references of an ideological and feminist bent, for they are indeed feminist."
"They are entirely uncalled for in this instance."
"I would therefore call on the House to lend its backing to the amendments tabled by Mr Szymański."
"Amendments 1 and 3 highlight the fundamental goals to which I referred, namely food, clean water, better sanitary conditions, vaccinations and mother and child care."
"Amendments 2 and 4 seek to delete the reference to reproductive rights, and to replace it with a reference to basic health care."
"We really should not put an ideological slant on every debate held in this House."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, looking to the future, the next thing that awaits us is the major round of negotiations in Hong Kong and it is my belief that we have to take care that it does not abandon the multilateral approach."
"As things stand at present, the prospects are very poor and I find myself wondering what we can offer if this round proves a failure."
"This week, I asked Commissioner Mandelson what he thought of the idea of a free trade area covering Europe, the USA, Canada and Australia."
"What would become of the countries of Africa?"
"Would they then have to organise themselves, or would they have to conclude bilateral agreements with these great world markets?"
"Whom would that benefit, and to whom would that be disadvantageous?"
"It is in difficult times like these that we have to ensure that these multilateral talks are beneficial to these countries, and that requires the facilitation of trade, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"As I see it, this is where we have to take ‘free SMEs’ as our watchword, with free markets for small businesses; cooperation between family businesses in Africa, in Europe and throughout the world, needs to be promoted as the basis for prosperity."
"What is needed to do that is a fair system of public invitations to tender, proper competition law and, finally, if these businesses are to be willing to become active in these countries, their investments have to be protected."
"That does, therefore, raise the question of how we can turn development aid into helping people to help themselves, into helping our small and medium-sized enterprises?"
"What sets Europe apart is that we are in a position to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and this is where there is much for the European Investment Bank, among other bodies, to do."
"– Mr President, many things have obviously already been said."
"I should like to raise one point."
"HIV/AIDS is impacting directly on millions of people and improving health is an absolutely essential prerequisite for Africa’s development."
"To combat it as effectively as possible, we need to offer women, men and adolescents a complete range of care and services."
"We need to guarantee access to irreproachable information and education on sexual and reproductive health, make training women a priority so as to make it easier for them to make decisions on issues of sexuality and reproductive health, and thus offer them the means and methods necessary to protect themselves from HIV infection."
"Just 1% of those infected with HIV/AIDS benefit from antiretroviral treatment."
"We need to do all we can to widen access to generic AIDS drugs."
"The timing of this report could not be better."
"We are working within the framework of the Millennium Development Goals."
"I will be voting in favour of this text, provided that no amendments alter it significantly."
"– Mr President, I wish to make two points, and they both concern money."
"Every 30 seconds a child in Africa dies of malaria, and yet there are a number of actions that could put a complete stop to that."
"Bed nets are a low-tech method of protection from mosquitoes, but very few families have them."
"Great progress has recently been made in Spain on a vaccine against malaria, but at the moment Bill Gates and other private foundations are putting a great deal more money into this than international bodies."
"It is clear that much more can be done and that more funding would make a huge difference, so what excuse can we possibly have not to provide it?"
"My second point concerns an area in which the European Union actually has been spending money, and needs to continue to do so without counting the cost too closely."
"This is our support for democratic elections in Africa."
"I was in Ethiopia in May, and just recently in the Congo observing the electoral registration process."
"Such action does not come cheap."
"The total bill was EUR 242 million, with 80% of that provided by the European Union."
"However, this is the first step on a very long road for a country facing enormous difficulties in terms of lack of communications and lack of infrastructure."
"Only by putting in the funding to enable the democratic process to get off the ground can we hope to start to see some progress."
"Nobody can pretend that democracy is the answer to everything, but without fair and free democratic elections many other things are simply impossible."
"So when we look at what we are spending where, we should think very carefully about refusing a budget to actions that are proven to make a difference."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, Africa, the cradle of civilisation, is in need of development aid."
"The EU’s fundamental desire to provide aid of this nature was enshrined as long ago as 1950 in one of the opening paragraphs of the Schuman declaration."
"Ever since, it has been a familiar refrain in the EU, which has been accompanied by efforts undertaken, since the Year of Africa, by the world’s developed countries to address the same questions, namely decolonisation, immigration to Europe, the need to build and maintain infrastructure, to build wells, to introduce irrigation, education, efficient farming based on agricultural production, to reduce nomadic pastoralism and to implement the forest planting plan as a key factor in the fight against the increasing desertification of the Sahel."
"In addition to such measures, the resolution before us builds on experience gained in other less-developed parts of the world by promoting the development of micro-loans based on the empowerment of women, the further development of education and health in conjunction with the UN and, as soon as possible, the achievement of the target of 0.7% of GNI earmarked by all developed countries for development aid to the world’s poorest countries; and this is something that we believe to be appropriate."
"Conversely, the temporary liberalisation of economically underdeveloped countries, in particular with regard to services of public interest, and the privatisation of state enterprises, have always proved detrimental."
"How can we recommend such measures?"
"This reservation notwithstanding, I support the resolution."
"– Mr President, I should like to thank the Commission for the strategy for Africa that they presented on 12 October."
"Its analysis not only highlights the continent’s potential, but also sets out the way things actually are."
"Alongside the various positive developments in some African countries – South Africa, of course, but also Botswana, Ghana and, it is to be hoped, in Mauritania too – there is a much longer list of countries suffering from conflicts, whether internally or with their neighbours, widespread poverty, and the illnesses to which reference has already been made: HIV/Aids, malaria, tuberculosis – the great scourges of Africa."
"If we ask ourselves why it is that Africa has lagged so far behind other continents, we must, of course, look not only at Africa but also at Europe and the other continents."
"Looking at Africa, we see that there are in many places governments or elites that obviously rather misunderstood what was happening at the time of decolonisation and started to see themselves as replacements for the former colonists and to treat their own people in the same way as the European colonial powers had evidently done before."
"They obviously had no conception of what development means or of how independence should be used."
"I believe, though, that we have to recognise, if we are honest, that it is Europe and the other continents that bear the greatest responsibility."
"We need only consider how European powers continue to interfere in Africa, whether directly, using political or military power, or by arranging things so that they can develop their own raw materials for their own companies and retain access to them."
"This is what I think makes it really necessary that the Commission should, by its approach, more firmly constrain the Member States to pursue a coherent policy towards Africa, which will enable us to abandon these contradictions and secure that continent a better future than it would have otherwise."
"– Mr President, Africa is a never ending source of remorse for part of Europe, and indeed Mr Gahler said as much a few moments ago."
"At the same time, there can be no question that the continent poses a political, economic and social challenge to Europe as a whole."
"We are not shirking our responsibility, since the EU has increased the aid it provides to Africa by 0.14% of GDP, and half of this money has been earmarked for the sub-Saharan countries."
"There are two extremes we must avoid when taking action to help Africa."
"One such extreme is the attempt to replace policy making with charity, the end result of which is to turn Africa into a bottomless pit and to help it to do almost everything, by which I also mean taking decisions on its future."
"The other extreme is to take the entirely opposite approach, or in other words to leave Africa to its own devices."
"We are delighted that the African Union is playing an ever greater role."
"I hope that as this body assumes greater importance, institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organisation will become more democratic, for example by ensuring that more developing countries are represented within them."
"This is a point I should like to emphasise most strongly."
"If I had to choose a priority target for our aid to Africa, it would be children, who account for as much as 50% of the population."
"Mr President, Mrs Martens, ladies and gentlemen, obviously I should like first of all to welcome most of the interventions, because they really are very much in line with the convictions underlying my communication on Africa."
"With the exception of perhaps one or two points, I can wholeheartedly agree with all of the comments that I have heard."
"Firstly, I should like to say that I obviously agree that there is a need to improve the coordination, convergence and coherence of actions, and that this forms an essential part of the communication and the political line that I am trying to develop."
"As you will be aware – and I think that Parliament will be able to offer very effective help here – in this connection I have made a proposal, currently being debated by the Council, to quickly implement an action plan, an action plan that does not consist only of words, no, an action plan comprising genuine and tangible commitments, such as, for example, a joint country strategy paper for the Member States and the Commission."
"We could debate this together."
"It will not be compulsory for the Member States, but I believe that it would nonetheless be a significant step forward if, instead of having 26 documents or 26 different strategies, one per country, we had just one."
"It would be worthwhile."
"That is what I have proposed in the action plan."
"A second aspect would also be to have joint programming."
"This would be a further strand of this action plan."
"For the time being, I have to admit that the Council is hesitating and that we are doing all we can to actually push this small measure through."
"It is difficult to achieve, despite the fact that it would obviously only be on a voluntary basis, as development – as I have had occasion to say in the past – is an area of shared competence; there is therefore nothing to fear in terms of Member States’ sovereignty, but it would constitute quite significant progress."
"As far as the three pillars are concerned, obviously the Millennium Development Goals are the priority."
"I see that everyone agrees on this point."
"But I think that it is difficult to isolate this third pillar from the first two, because we cannot achieve the Millennium Development Goals without peace and security and Africa itself shows that we cannot achieve them if we disregard growth and interconnectivity."
"It is clear that without infrastructure, without measures to open up the regions of Africa and without genuinely transcontinental infrastructure enabling production to be economically liberalised – I am thinking in particular of sub-Saharan Africa – the task will be extremely difficult."
"If we do not combine the third and second pillars then development will be reduced purely and simply to a large-scale charitable operation, which no one here wants, with the inevitable result that the developing countries will be dependent on us, the donors, which we do not want either."
"To respond to Mr Pflügler, who made sure to raise the issue of human rights, I obviously agree with him that this is absolutely crucial."
"One brief comment, however: I think that if, under well-defined conditions, we were able to increase the proportion of budgetary support, we would be in a better position to negotiate substantial improvements in human rights, but this is a debate to which we will no doubt have the opportunity to return."
"As far as business is concerned, as I have said, I am working on this at the moment – I announced as much and I will shortly be presenting the communication in question – and I have put forward the idea of having an ethical and social label for companies working in developing countries."
"I have also proposed setting up a permanent Europe-Africa business forum."
"As for the fact that I apparently proposed a reduction in the AIDS budget, I am not at all sure where that information came from, but it must be a misunderstanding."
"What is true is that, when I went to London to the Global Fund Replenishment Conference, I unfortunately only had EUR 90 million available to offer."
"Having said that, I should like nonetheless to remind you – I am not after all going to take the blame every day – that Europe provides more than 60% of the donations to this Global Fund."
"This is not insignificant."
"The contribution of all of the Member States and the Commission represents a little over 60% of the Global Fund."
"I therefore did not propose reducing our contribution to the fund;"
"I simply placed in it the money that I had for this financial year, for 2006, all of the money that I had left for 2006."
"I cannot do anything for 2007, because we do not have the financial perspective."
"Besides, I have to confess that the whole business is rather comical: the UK Presidency was pushing me to go further, but it was easy for me to reply, ‘I would be happy to do so, but you will have to help me out here.’"
"Concerning the African troops, I should like to clarify matters a little."
"I think that in principle you are right that the money required to fund the Peace Facility should come from a source other than the development budget."
"I think that we agree on the principle."
"But if we do not have a financial perspective, and if the evaluation that is going to be made of the effectiveness and the positive impact of the Peace Facility – an evaluation which will obviously prove to be very interesting and very positive – concludes that we need to allocate more funds to this Peace Facility when there is no financial perspective, I wonder whether one solution might perhaps be to use certain uncommitted funds, to convert resources that are already committed, resources that we know full well will not be used for some time, as a means of provisionally replenishing the Peace Facility."
"I should like all the same to remind you that there is still around EUR 35 million in the Peace Facility."
"But you should be aware that our work is not finished in Sudan (Darfur, and so on)."
"No doubt we will also need a stronger Peace Facility in the DRC at some point; at least this cannot be ruled out."
"As for Somalia, I had a meeting with the Prime Minister of that country yesterday and he too needs the Peace Facility to be stepped up in his country as a means of guaranteeing security."
"I can therefore safely assume that this facility is going to need a lot more money."
"I fear that we will not be able to leave Sudan in the immediate future."
"I also have to say that this Peace Facility is an extremely useful, indeed indispensable, tool, if we want Africans in principle also to take ownership of issues such as conflict prevention, peace-keeping, post-conflict situations, and so on, so as quite simply to create the conditions for a return to stability."
"In conclusion, I assume so."
"I have to be pragmatic."
"It is very easy to say, ‘The principle please, nothing but the principle’."
"The result? There will not be another euro to put in the Peace Facility, and we will find ourselves totally powerless to pursue the policies that we have to pursue."
"I hope that as soon as possible we will have the financial perspective and the Stability Instrument, which should, under normal circumstances, finance the Peace Facility and enable the problem to be resolved."
"There is one thing that I did not fully understand with regard to coordination amongst the African countries."
"Mrs Auken, I am in favour of also encouraging coordination between the African countries."
"Coordination is required at every level: at national level, because it is our aid and because it has to fit in with the government’s poverty reduction strategy; at regional level and at international level, with the other donors."
"I sincerely believe, therefore, that coordination is also an important factor, over and above coordination between our own Member States."
"I think it was Mr Libicki who highlighted the need for aid at local level."
"I agree wholeheartedly."
"Moreover, that is precisely why we have set aside significant sums to support decentralisation."
"I have had a meeting with Ousmane Sy, the former Minister of the Interior in Mali, to whom we have, by the way, recently awarded a prize in Belgium, to discuss this: he is preparing a study on decentralisation for the Commission, for me in this case, with particular reference to the DRC."
"He has considerable expertise on this subject."
"I have also personally chaired working meetings in Rwanda on decentralisation and I have seen evidence of the positive impact that this has had on the ground."
"I therefore share this point of view."
"On the other hand, I do not think that we are adopting an ideological stance by referring to reproductive health."
"I would say that this is not about ideology but about humanism, and humanism, I believe, is part of the common heritage of all democrats."
"Regarding the WTO meeting in Hong Kong, Mr Rübig, as you well know, we are very mindful of this issue and we are still hoping that we will be able to reach a positive agreement in Hong Kong."
"As far as your proposal for the EIB is concerned, I can tell you – and this is important because it is along exactly the same lines as you suggested – that we are working with Mr Philippe Maystadt on a proper strategy."
"At the very beginning of next year – I met Mr Maystadt on Monday and we will be having another meeting in December – we will probably be signing a memorandum of understanding between the EIB and the Commission so as, firstly, to pool resources, but also to ensure that the decisions taken by the EIB that relate to development take better account of the development aspect and of the risk associated with that."
"I think I have already responded to Mr Schapira in my answer to another question: the European Union – the Commission and the Member States together – contributes more than 60% of the Global Fund."
"Mrs Hall believes that we should put in more funding."
"I would say that we are obviously heavily involved in preparing for and monitoring elections, whether it be in the DRC or elsewhere, and you yourself wanted to highlight the fact that we have made a difference in the DRC, so far."
"This does not mean that everything is going to be easily resolved and that the situation does not remain fragile, but I see that so far, the latest figure – I receive figures every day – for voters who have registered in the DRC is 21 761 000."
"I have to tell you that we had set a target of 15 million: we are well above that and it is all the same encouraging to see that the population has responded in such great numbers."
"As far as malaria is concerned, be assured that, as part of the Sixth Framework Programme for Research, the Commission is funding the necessary research to find a vaccine for malaria."
"We are very much involved here too, as you are concerned that we should be."
"Mr Gahler said that the countries of Europe often continue to act like neo-colonial powers, by for example controlling natural resources."
"I have nothing to reply on this point."
"Let me simply tell you that my entire strategy seeks to move us away from these habits or reflexes, whether conscious or not, of paternalism and neo-colonialism."
"To conclude, I should like to say that the very foundation, the philosophy, underlying what we have proposed, is the principle of ownership."
"Moreover, I hope, Mr President – and I will conclude with this – that the translation of the word ‘ownership’ has been corrected in the French version: it had been translated into French using the word for ‘property’, which is not really the same thing as ‘ownership’."
"Ownership is therefore at the very heart of this new relationship that we want to establish with our African friends."
"There you have it, Mr President; I think I have been as comprehensive as I can."
"In any case, I should like to thank all of those Members who have supported us so actively."
"In particular I should like to thank Mrs Martens, who has drafted an absolutely outstanding report."
"I hope that all of this will help us in Monday’s Council meeting to make progress on our common cause, which is our concern for Africa and the need to open up to this continent."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for the clarity and robustness of your remarks."
"The debate is closed."
"Unless Parliament asks for the vote to be postponed, it will take place following this afternoon’s debates."
"On behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party, I thank Mrs Martens for her work and the UK Presidency for its willingness to increase the EU’s commitment towards Africa."
"I fully support the request to provide this strategy with adequate instruments and resources together with precise deadlines in order to be able to assess its progress."
"I also agree that it is a priority to coordinate the policies of the various Member States so as to prevent actions from being duplicated."
"It is important, however, that the EU finally assumes its due role at international level as a leader in the fight against poverty."
"Africa, the region which concentrates the highest number of people living below the poverty line, the worst kinds of transmissible diseases, infant and maternal mortality and a lack of education and health structures, represents the principal challenge to achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"Europe’s cooperation actions therefore need to be supported by a firm policy of international diplomacy that consistently promotes suitable economic and social policies within international organisations, primarily the UN, the IMF and the WTO."
"This policy should also promote dialogue with all the recipient countries so that these countries can eventually play an active role in establishing their own strategies and in managing the programmes, with the full participation of civil society as a whole."
", This report contains a long list of proposed measures that the EU should take in order to help combat poverty in Africa."
"Regrettably, the EU does not, however, have an overall view of development issues."
"In the present situation, the EU hands out resources with one hand, only to take them back with the other."
"That is not a credible way to act."
"The first proposal should concern the EU’s need to carry out radical overhauls of its agricultural, fisheries and trade policies."
"Unfortunately, there is no political will in this Chamber to do that."
"The British Presidency and the Commission have stated that development issues in Africa are a policy area to be given priority."
"Despite that, the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament all defend the EU’s fisheries agreements."
"These agreements are principally aimed at guaranteeing the EU’s short–term economic interests, and they generate extremely limited resources for those who need them, namely poor fishermen in developing countries."
"We must, as a matter of urgency, prevent the fragmentation and duplication of aid."
"I do not, however, think that the EU’s role should be that of leading the world on this issue."
"We do not need more aid organisations but should, rather, endeavour to pool our common efforts within already existing organisations."
"The primary task of the EU should be to reform the Union’s destructive policies."
"If that is not done, the developing countries will never be given a fair opportunity to achieve increased prosperity and development."
"The next item is the report (A6-0319/2005) by Mr Wijkman, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the proposal for a Joint Declaration by the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission on the European Union Development Policy ‘the European Consensus’ (2004/2261(INI))."
". – Mr President, before we start the debate I should like to ask you, on behalf of my group and in agreement with the other groups, to hold the debate but to postpone the vote."
"We agreed, for a number of reasons, to do that and I would ask you to give us that opportunity before I start my speech."
"Mr Wijkman, your request, on behalf of your group, for the vote to be postponed is noted."
"It will be put to Parliament when we come to the votes this afternoon."
"The postponement will be agreed or refused at the time and you will be able to argue for it then, but your request is noted."
"Mr President, we are now going to debate what, for Parliament, is a unique report."
"The European Parliament has, for the first time, been invited to participate actively in devising the EU’s development policy."
"When the current policy was decided on, Parliament was not involved in any way."
"In our view, the ongoing process, aimed at producing a tripartite agreement between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, is a great step forward."
"The present report constitutes Parliament’s response to the original proposal for a policy statement and our contribution to the negotiations."
"Since the original development policy was adopted in 2000, our world has undergone a number of changes."
"There are therefore powerful reasons to amend our policy and to design a new one."
"The agenda has changed, and issues of coherence, coordination and so forth have been given ever greater prominence."
"This is a quite splendid state of affairs, I think."
"Our report refers to the commitments to increased aid that have been made by a number of Member States and that will mean that the volume of EU aid over the next few years will be significantly increased."
"That is, of course, excellent."
"It is, however, just as important to debate quality as quantity."
"That is something we are trying to do in a constructive way in our report."
"All in all, the EU is the world’s leading aid donor."
"However, the effectiveness and quality of our aid have not, to date, been commensurate with its volume."
"Commissioner Michel himself did of course indicate a large number of major shortcomings, especially in the way in which aid has been coordinated in the past."
"There is poor coordination between one EU Member State and another, as well as between the Member States, on the one hand, and both the Commission and other donors, on the other."
"This means high transaction costs and a great deal of duplication, together with difficulties for our partner countries."
"The new development policy we are now debating establishes favourable preconditions for progress in this field."
"Issues of harmonisation are being given prominence."
"In addition to donor coordination and coherence, our report highlights a number of substantial issues to which we want to give added weight."
"These include democracy and human rights, measures to combat corruption, the important roles to be played by civil society and also by the national parliaments, the importance of strengthening the role of women in development work and the importance of paying more attention to the significance of natural resources, that is to say of forests, farmland and water and marine resources, especially in relation to the world’s very poorest countries."
"In addition, we discuss the importance of health and education issues, which we have been pushing for many years in Parliament, as well as increased efforts to combat the HIV epidemic."
"Finally, we refer, in particular, to the considerable problems encountered by many countries in tropical areas due to the more unstable climate."
"I should like to thank my colleagues for their very constructive cooperation."
"In my view, we have produced a kind of consensus document."
"There is one aspect with which we are especially pleased, namely the fact that, together with the Commission and the Council, we have, in this process, succeeded in conducting a constructive debate in which we have tried, as far as possible, to define the specific role of the Commission in the context of development."
"The Commission must not act as a 26th Member State in terms of aid donations, but must, naturally, make use of its special authority, its special capacity, its neutrality and its multilateral character in order to give some impetus to these issues and make certain things better than other institutions are able to."
"In this process, we have identified a number of areas in which the Commission, if I may put it like this, can make a difference and add value."
"Finally, I want to thank you for your constructive cooperation."
"I hope that, during the next few weeks, we shall be able to arrive at a final document and that, in time, we shall be able to return to this question here in Parliament and have a broader debate in which the Council too can participate so that we might together also discuss how, subsequently, we might best begin to implement the new development policy and this policy statement."
"Mr President, Mr Wijkman, ladies and gentlemen, I think Europe has demonstrated its aspirations this year."
"It has proved that it is capable of carrying some weight in the world."
"It has done better than others in assuming its responsibility towards the developing countries."
"As you know, in May the European Union gave some strong commitments to make its aid more effective and its development policies more coherent."
"In June, the European Union decided to double development aid between 2004 and 2010 so as to reach the target of 0.7% of gross national income by 2015."
"I would nevertheless point out that this commitment means an increase of EUR 20 billion a year by 2010 and EUR 46 billion a year in 2015."
"In September, the European Union’s intensive preparatory work made the UN World Summit a milestone, a key point in the quest for a more balanced multilateralism and a more just world order."
"I think we can say without any conceit that without the European Union that summit might well have ended in hopeless failure."
"There, too, the European Union made all the difference."
"There is obviously still plenty of room for improvement, however."
"If Europe wants to carry more weight, it must do more and make a qualitative leap in the way we work together."
"That is why in July we put forward the proposal for a European consensus on development, a proposal I have presented and discussed in this House on several occasions."
"The interinstitutional debate that followed this document’s adoption by the Commission shows the diversity and wealth of opinion on the European Union’s role in the world."
"It is also an enlightening debate and one about which I feel strongly."
"I cannot deny, however, that some of the arguments being put forward by major players trouble me."
"Some give the impression that we have to decide between a Community development policy and the policies of the Member States, between those who would like to centralise development policy at European level and those who believe solely in bilateral cooperation."
"That, ladies and gentlemen, is not the issue."
"Europe as a whole today has more than 20 000 diplomats, three times more than the United States; is it acceptable for it to frequently take second place in political planning?"
"When Europe is responsible for virtually 60% of development aid, is it today acceptable for it always to dispense that aid through 26 different programming documents and implement it using 26 different procedures?"
"I believe the answer is no, it is not acceptable."
"Europe’s influence and effectiveness must be on a par with its resources, and that is precisely why I have suggested to the Member States and the European Parliament a common platform for the European Union as a whole, a platform that will bring together its values, its aims, its principles and its field of action and will apply to the European Union as a whole."
"This platform, the European consensus, would be an essential step towards more coordinated, more complementary and more resolute action by the European Union."
"What is it all about?"
"We, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, share the same values, the founding values of the European Union."
"We share one paramount objective: the eradication of poverty wherever it is found."
"We share an international agenda: the Millennium Development Goals and the Millennium Declaration."
"We share principles of partnership: shared responsibility between industrialised and developing countries, the appropriation of poverty-reduction strategies by the partner countries, the involvement of civil society and non-state players."
"We share the principles of aid effectiveness: concentration rather than fragmentation of efforts, coherence of policy, coordination and division of labour between donors, the harmonisation of our procedures, alignment with the partner countries’ strategies."
"The motion for a resolution presented by Mr Wijkman today is remarkable."
"It highlights the key positive elements of the Commission’s communication and makes a constructive contribution to improving the consensus; it was a great help to us in our tripartite discussions and I thank him for it."
"I congratulate him and your Parliament, too, on the exceptional quality of this contribution."
"I would like to give you a brief summary of the points of the resolution, which I support unreservedly, the points that form the basis of our consensus."
"Firstly, a clear reference to the statement on development policy in the regulation that will govern the financial instrument for development cooperation."
"I have no doubt that this response will strengthen the very status of the statement."
"Secondly, the analysis of poverty as a multidimensional phenomenon requiring a range of responses and a balance between the socio-economic and environmental pillars of sustainable development."
"Thirdly, the importance of equality between men and women."
"In this connection, I would like to inform you that the Commission has proposed including Parliament’s text among the guiding principles of the statement."
"Fourthly, it takes a rights-based approach."
"I believe the Commission’s proposal of including human rights and governance as complementary objectives to poverty reduction meets Parliament’s request perfectly."
"Fifthly, all the priorities mentioned in the resolution are covered by the Community’s fields of action: the prevention and treatment of Aids and other diseases, reproductive health, gender equality, adjustment to climate change, trade for development, conflict prevention, good governance, preventing corruption and promoting decent work, which includes preventing child labour."
"Finally, we are very pleased that Parliament is open to a move towards budgetary support, because that will enable us to be effective and to develop countries’ capacities."
"In this way, we can help to improve the management of public finance and support institutions, including national parliaments."
"Those institutions must play their part fully and act as budget guardians."
"At the same time, I am convinced that this is a powerful way of initiating and fostering political dialogue with our partners."
"I therefore thank Parliament, which with this resolution is making a significant contribution to more effective action for development and laying the foundations for close collaboration between us in the future."
". Mr President, I believe that ‘The European Consensus on Development’, the joint statement by the Council, Parliament and the Commission on the European Union’s development policy, is a key document, above all because of the goals it is intended to further."
"This aim of this tripartite statement, which sets out a common vision for the European Union’s development cooperation, is to help achieve greater cohesion, coordination, complementarity, quality and effectiveness."
"One might well say that it will be impossible for our vision of development cooperation to become reality unless these goals are achieved."
"Over the 40 years that development aid has been provided to Africa, the situation on this continent has got worse rather than better."
"We must do something to reverse this trend, and this report and the motion for a resolution are an attempt to bring about such a change."
"Our resolution covers many key issues, and I should merely like to draw the House’s attention to a few of them."
"One example is the weight attached to the role of national parliaments in implementing development cooperation."
"This applies not only to aid recipient countries, but also to certain EU Member States."
"On a related note, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly will adopt its report on the role of parliaments in implementing the Cotonou Agreement next week."
"I would be absolutely delighted if the parliament of my own country, the Polish Sejm, were to devote more attention to development issues."
"This is all the more necessary because it will be hard for us to earmark 0.7% of GNI for development aid in future unless national parliaments show commitment and understanding."
"Another crucial feature of this resolution is that it highlights the key importance of education."
"It is a simple fact that development will be impossible without access to education, and without gender equality in the field of education, though of course not only in this field."
"The report also deserves our praise because it stresses the need to improve the quality and the level of coordination between the Commission and the Member States."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report."
". – Mr President, I would like to express my perplexity and indignation – and that of my group – at the fact that this report, and the one by Mrs Martens on the European development strategy for Africa, have not been given a better place on the agenda or, above all, more speaking time in plenary."
"What we are discussing now is what the European Union’s policy in the field of development should be over the coming years."
"This is a field that directly affects millions of Europeans, many of them committed and public-spirited young people; the kind of citizens whom we should try to win over to the project of European integration."
"Nevertheless, the way we are treating these issues today, as if they were something entirely marginal and insignificant, will increase their indifference, their scepticism and their rejection of what the European Union means."
"Having said that, we support what the Commissioner has said and, in particular, the excellent report by Mr Wijkman, and we would like to acknowledge his good work and his efforts aimed at synthesis and compromise."
"The Socialists voted in favour of the resolution and it was approved practically unanimously by the Committee on Development."
"We believe it to be correct and we hope that it is not changed for the worse by certain amendments, which would oblige us to vote against the final text."
"Something quite different, however, is the document resulting from the negotiation between the Council and the Commission, quite rightly with the participation of Mr Wijkman, on behalf of Parliament’s Committee on Development, a participation which has certainly contributed, as Commissioner Michel has acknowledged, to the incorporation of many of our principal concerns and demands in this field into the ‘European development consensus’ statement."
"In any event, I would like to make it clear that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament believes that approving the resolution proposed to us in the Wijkman report does not presuppose that the text agreed by the Council and the Commission will be approved and that, in order to be endorsed by Parliament and hence be a tripartite agreement, it must have the express support of the plenary of our Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the way Parliament’s debates are organised unfortunately shows its lack of interest in the problem of development. I very much regret the lack of will on the part of the European Parliament to promote a genuine development and cooperation policy."
"Instead of resolutions that tend to be forgotten rather quickly, it would be better if Parliament played an active part in drawing up a definite coherent strategy for the future."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must congratulate and thank Mr Michel, the Commissioner, for his initiative in seeking to define, in a tripartite statement of the Council, the Commission and Parliament, the common principles to which the EU and the 25 Member States will refer in implementing their development and cooperation policies."
"It will give the European Union a document setting out the European consensus on this question."
"We see this as a major advance for at least two reasons."
"First of all, it is the first time that Parliament has been involved to this extent in the process of mapping out this policy."
"Through their representatives, the peoples of Europe are therefore having their say on the major directions of development and cooperation policy."
"Secondly, and this is a real step forward, the hour has finally come to look for synergy between Member States and the Commission when action is taken."
"How can we respond to this initiative if we vote at the end of the part-session and almost in secret, when everyone’s mind has today been focussing on one of the main issues of the legislative period?"
"Mr President, there is no point in going into the substance of the debate that took place in committee; that would not bring anything more at this present time."
"Today I want in particular to congratulate our rapporteur on his commitment to this matter and the successes he has already achieved following his conversations with the Council and the Commission."
"By taking account of the suggestions made by the members of the Committee on Development and managing to incorporate them into his text, the rapporteur has united a very large majority in support of his approach, affirming, for example, the desire that the joint statement should stress questions of education and health."
"Having said that, I would like to make one thing extremely clear: my group’s support for today’s report in no way prejudices our position on the final draft of the joint statement."
"That requires a solemn vote by Parliament."
"If we want this Commission initiative to be fully effective and the joint statement really to reflect the European consensus, it is and will be essential that the European Parliament gives its verdict on the final text in plenary."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we very much welcome the push for a joint statement by the Council, the Commission and Parliament expressing a consensus on European development policy."
"What has emerged from the trialogue is a good initiative, and it is, procedurally speaking – as has already been noted – somewhat uncharted political territory, so we are again particularly grateful to Mr Wijkman for having done such efficient work in the trialogue for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and for this House and for having produced this fine report."
"This report and this consensus can be a significant step closer to more coherence in European development policy."
"There is, after all, a great deal of consensus in this House as to what its objectives are, and on the pre-eminent importance of combating poverty, which is not just about pushing poverty back, but also about uprooting it, establishing social justice, creating equal opportunities for development and achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"So much for the theory: we have to be clear in our own minds that the practice falls a long way short of that."
"The new ‘Human Development Report 2005’ tells us that the number of people living in absolute poverty is continuing to increase dramatically."
"It is right, then, that we should concentrate our efforts on investment in food safety, education, health and social security."
"The developing countries need to be helped to go their own way; they need to keep control over their own development strategy, and so it is right that the principles of ownership and partnership should be centre stage."
"The European Union must scrutinise all policy areas in terms of their impact on development, especially the policies relating to trade, agriculture and fisheries."
"That is the theory; now, in practical terms the policies of twenty-five countries need to be more closely coordinated."
"We would like to see more coordination on the part of the Commission and the Council and more co-decision for Parliament."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not doubt that we are all agreed that the EU’s development policy needs to be of higher quality and more effective and that it should, primarily, be guided by the need to achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"The EU’s efforts at development cooperation must have the overall objective of reducing poverty, and eventually abolishing it, through sustainable development."
"That is what makes it simply vital that the document we have before us today again clarifies the need for countries’ debts to be set aside and for it also to be ensured that they never again fall into the debt trap, for example by increasing the funds supplied to them as grants."
"This summer, both the UN and ‘Global Health Watch’ repeatedly pointed out that the last ten years have seen an extraordinary increase in the inequalities between and within countries, between rich and poor, and that we in the EU need to do more to face up to the situation of the poorest in the world."
"Above all, it is they who are hardest hit by the consequences of privatisation and the increasing exclusion from such resources as land, water and woodland."
"More and more, too, they are denied access to food, health, culture and education, and so we need a development policy that addresses these tasks; the aim of producing a document expressing the consensus of the three institutions of the European Union is one that I can only welcome."
"Mr Wijkman, who is representing the Committee on Development in the negotiations, has our full support."
". – Mr President, during our debates on aid for backward countries and underdeveloped countries we must make a very clear distinction between Asian countries and the countries of sub-Saharan Africa."
"We have all seen evidence of the fact that the former are rapidly leaving poverty behind them, whereas the latter are incapable of extricating themselves from extreme poverty and health problems, in particular HIV-related problems."
"The reason for this can be found in people’s mindsets and a lack of education."
"We should take this opportunity to place particular emphasis on this point."
"Although I believe that Mr Wijkman has drafted an excellent report, I must unfortunately voice my objections once again to the House."
"My question is why this report contains a reference to reproductive health and rights, which after all is just another name for abortion."
"It is no secret that the House is divided on this issue, and yesterday we witnessed incidents in connection with the exhibition held on Parliament’s premises."
"I fail to see the point of this ideological approach, which means that we are confronted time and time again with an issue that divides the House."
"We should hold a separate debate on the issue, instead of bringing it up at every given opportunity."
"I would therefore ask the House to vote in favour of Amendments 3 and 4, which have been tabled by Mr Szymański."
"They seek both to delete the reference to reproductive rights and to highlight the fundamental goals, which include adequate food, clean water, better sanitary conditions and education."
"We have heard Commissioner Michel complain in this House about the fact that there is no such thing as an EU common foreign policy in this area."
"One can only wonder how such a common policy could exist, given that we witness attempts to undermine it at every step."
"Russia engages in policy-making with France and Germany without any regard for Poland, or at least this has been the case with governments to date."
"I hope that the new German government will adopt a different approach, and I also hope that things will change when President Chirac leaves office."
"The solidarity we show to our immediate neighbours in matters of common interest will be a measure of the European Union’s success, both at EU and at global level."
". Mr President, Mr Wijkman, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking you all."
"You have clearly played a vital part in the work that can be presented today."
"I hope that Parliament’s contributions will enable the final document to meet with everyone’s satisfaction, an outcome that would constitute an extremely important step forward."
"Mr Kaczmarek has spoken to us about the role of the national parliaments and I am inclined to agree with him."
"If you recall, moreover, I travelled to a large number of national parliaments in order to defend the increase in public development aid in the various countries, and I would like to take advantage of being given the floor to confirm that I am always willing to go and answer questions or to participate in sittings within the national parliaments."
"I believe, in fact, that in a number of countries it is helpful for the national parliaments to be mobilised, informed and motivated with regard to the issue of development."
"I am therefore fully prepared to dedicate myself to this task."
"Mr Martinez, you say that the current statement is disappointing."
"I readily admit that it is not perfect – that goes without saying – and I hope, moreover, that we will further improve it."
"That said, this statement does, despite everything, already constitute an important step forward, as this would be the first time that the European Union had access to a framework in this area."
"This would also be the first time that a policy was endorsed simultaneously by the Commission, by Parliament and by the Council, and that Parliament, like the Commission, would find itself providing, in my opinion, a more powerful lever for making development policy more effective and better coordinated."
"Therefore, I too of course would like this statement to be far more ambitious."
"Admittedly, it has been toned down at certain times but, believe me, we have not finished with our endeavours, and I am obviously relying both on Mr Wijkman and on certain Member States at Council level to help us to preserve the best and most progressive aspects of the statement."
"As for Mrs Zimmer and the debt issue, we obviously agree on the fact that the debt burden must be reduced."
"On the other hand – but this would undoubtedly be another debate – I am not wildly in favour of simply cancelling the debt without any conditions and in all circumstances."
"However, I am resolutely and fervently in favour of reducing the debt or of cancelling it in very special cases and under very special conditions."
"As regards Mr Libicki, I believe that this is a point on which we will not be able to agree."
"Your approach in terms of reproductive health differs from mine. You look on reproductive health as an ideological issue and I do not, because I, for my part, have a humanist outlook on the issue."
"I do not look on it as an ideological issue."
"Secondly – and I in no way intend to cause controversy here – I believe that you are confining the issue of reproductive health to abortion."
"I can see many other aspects to reproductive health; I can see above all the health and the rights of women and children."
"I am therefore not ideological."
"I simply call on you to understand the reality in certain countries and in certain societies – I, in fact, encounter this reality on a very frequent basis – and I should truly like to be able to convince you that much still remains to be done on that score."
"Certain kinds of old-fashioned, conservative opinions – and I say this fully respecting the philosophical thoughts of others – do not seem to me to be overly generous in their responses to certain human tragedies with which I have come face to face."
"I therefore cannot accept this criticism."
"I am not prejudiced and I can respect everyone’s thoughts, philosophies, religious and other beliefs. I do believe, though, that at some point we should nonetheless go beyond those beliefs in order to see what really constitutes the general interest, in order to see what generosity really is and in order to learn how action should really be conceived for the best."
"This is what nevertheless seems to me to be a goal to achieve over and above any religious, ideological and philosophical divisions."
"During recent months, Mr President, your Parliament has worked tirelessly to respond to the Commission’s offer and to contribute to obtaining a European development consensus representative of the will of the three European institutions: Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"This joint effort is testament to the importance we all attach to development and shows that the institutions are working together to make our action more effective."
"We are right to do so."
"I have said many times over that development policy has the potential to be an important tool in making Europe a presence and a positive force in the world."
"Development policy could also play a crucial role in the Union’s foreign policy on account of its exemplary nature, not necessarily through its interventionism, but through the positive example it sets."
"This is a role based on a long-term view rather than on short-term interests."
"This is a role that is focused on the well being of the people of developing countries, as well as on our own well-being."
"I believe that we are faced with a political decision: either we exploit this capacity in order to combat the negative effects of globalisation and in order to exploit the latter’s full potential fairly, or we stick rigidly to a charitable idea of development and wait for this idea to get completely out of hand, resulting in terrorism, massive and unmanageable migratory flows, pandemics, financial instability, poverty and destitution."
"Globalisation unites the North and the South and, in my opinion, development policy must act so that this union might be a source of justice and shared growth, and not one of dependency and poverty."
"The discussions with the Council are still taking place."
"The new development policy statement has not yet been finalised."
"What is more, I believe that, if everyone makes more of an effort, we are now really very close to a European development consensus."
"It simply remains for me to call on you to make one final effort together to follow up our joint work, in the spirit of the partnership that has united us over recent months with the aim of achieving our common objective."
"As Commissioner, I should, at any rate, like firstly to thank you for your active contribution to the debates concerning my remit and my department, both for your pertinent questions and also, Mr Martinez, for your impertinent questions."
"I believe that it is crucial for the Commission permanently to be under pressure from Parliament because this is how progress is made."
"I believe that progress has never stemmed from consensus ."
"Progress always stems from tensions and from a clash of ideas, and I therefore thank you for having participated in this work."
"I believe that, without Parliament, I would have been very much worse off than I am today, and this without even mentioning the statement we have come up with today, which would have been far drearier than it is."
"I believe that we have here the grounds for drafting a fine text, which will represent a substantial step forward."
"In concluding this debate, Mr President, I wanted, for my part, to thank you once again for this contribution."
"– Mr President, I have a very brief question for the Commissioner, but it is an important one in terms of the vote."
"Can the Commissioner definitely exclude the possibility of the term ‘reproductive health’ including abortion?"
". Mr President, I believe that everyone who has followed this debate knows perfectly well what it covers, namely, Mr Posselt, a humanist view of and approach to people’s lives, everyday life, individual freedom, freedom of conscience and the freedom to be happy."
"That is what the debate covers."
"No, you are not going to trap me."
"I believe that I have been in politics longer than you, so rest assured that you will not trap me by dragging me into a heretical debate, because this is indeed a heretical debate."
"All the Members, all the humanists in this Chamber, whether they are Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or non-believers, are well aware of what we are discussing."
"I will not fall into that trap."
"The debate is closed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the debate is closed and therefore I do not wish to re-open it, Mr Libicki."
"I am happy to give you the floor for a point of order, but clarify for me first the article to which you refer."
"– Mr President, I should just like to ask Mr Michel whether he can confirm that this matter excludes abortion?"
"The debate is closed, we will not re-open it and, moreover, Mr Michel has already replied to this question in his speech and in his reply to Mr Posselt."
"The vote will take place at the end of this afternoon’s debates, unless there is a request for postponement."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on access to humanitarian aid in Kashmir(1)."
". – Mr President, the horrifying images and tragic personal stories following the earthquake of 8 October might have left our television screens and the front pages of our newspapers, but let us not forget the need for urgent aid is just as great, particularly because of the onset of winter."
"Already there have been 74 000 deaths and getting aid to those in need is a race against time."
"The Pakistan Government has put the financial cost of the earthquake at USD 5 billion."
"The EU has already contributed substantially, but we must do more, much more, and so should the rest of the international community."
"But it is not just about money; it is about access; it is about helicopters and other equipment to reach inaccessible areas."
"Access over the line of control between India-administered Kashmir and Pakistan-administered Kashmir is also of vital importance."
"I am very pleased that India and Pakistan have opened the five crossing points for goods and I hope other crossing points will be opened as well, not just for goods: civilians should also be allowed to cross."
"People with relatives and friends on the other side want to help."
"They want to bring much-needed support and relief, and at present they are unable to do so."
"Already, 950 Kashmiris on the Indian side and 2 000 on the Pakistani side have asked for permits."
"I know it is difficult because of the long-standing dispute over Kashmir, but I hope that the applications can be processed quickly."
"This human tragedy demands a compassionate response."
"Let us hope that out of this terrible tragedy something good will come and that the survivors may be allowed to live in peace."
"I hope that, at last, a just solution to this 58-year dispute over Kashmir can be found, involving both Pakistan and India but, above all, the Kashmiri people who have suffered enough already."
". – Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that, due to the previous debates over-running, my colleague Mrs Gill, who is chairwoman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia and the SAARC and author of this resolution, and my other colleague, Mr Moraes, have had to leave and they send their apologies."
"I speak on their behalf, as well as that of my own Scottish constituents, who have asked me to raise their concerns about the issue of how people are being treated after the devastating earthquake."
"It is of utmost significance that the European Parliament expresses its opinion on the Kashmir earthquake of 8 October."
"At the October part-session we marked this tragic event and people passed condolences both to the victims and their families."
"However, six weeks after this event that has destroyed the north-west region of Pakistan and India, the scale of devastation and trauma the earthquake has caused is still being realised."
"It is estimated that 80 000 people are dead, hundreds of thousands of people are injured and 3 million people are homeless."
"Aid workers have many problems to overcome, including landslides, bad weather, aftershocks and generally difficult terrain."
"People in the most remote areas appear to be the hardest hit, with very many not having received aid at all."
"These problems are made worse by the onset of winter and, therefore, it is imperative to get the right type of aid to those who need it."
"Although this is one of the most complex relief operations undertaken, it is no excuse for us not to do our utmost."
"The fact that most of the earthquake victims have been evacuated should be welcomed."
"However, snow levels are already creeping down the mountains day by day and thousands of survivors face a more perilous situation as each day becomes a struggle just to stay alive."
"The conditions in the temporary camps are far from encouraging and it is my understanding that the hygiene level in the refugee camps is intolerable and conditions are primitive."
"Kofi Annan has warned us that a second massive wave of death will hit hard as disease begins to spread amongst the survivors."
"This is a race against time and I want to see the following action points."
"Firstly, although welcoming the Commission’s aid package of EUR 93.6 million, we must give more and we can do better."
"Official estimates state that more than USD 5 billion are needed over a period of 5 to 10 years to restore the infrastructure of the region."
"We need to recognise that a standard relief package is not adequate for a situation as dire as this and we need to deploy the reconstruction phase immediately."
"Secondly, I strongly urge the Commission and the Council to follow the precedent following the tsunami of giving special trade concessions to assist the countries affected by natural disasters of this scale."
"At the very least they should implement the preferential GSP Plus scheme voted by Parliament this year to ease the situation."
"Finally, I applaud the opening of five points along the line of control on the border between Pakistan and Indian-controlled Kashmir."
"Perhaps some goodwill will come out of this tragedy."
"I call upon Member States and the Commission to ensure that we do not fail the vulnerable and traumatised."
"I therefore urge you to all vote in favour of this motion."
"People’s lives depend upon it."
"Just before giving the floor to the next author, I should like simply to clarify the Rules of Procedure, as I believe I sensed surprise on the part of some Members that I am not giving the floor in the usual order, by inviting the largest groups to speak first."
"The Rules of Procedure are as follows: when Members request to speak as author, their turn to speak depends on the order in which they arrived at Parliament’s Sessional Services."
"On the other hand, we resume the usual order when speakers take the floor on behalf of their groups, with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats speaking first, followed by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and so on. I thought I had better remind you of the Rules of Procedure because I believe I sensed a slight hesitation."
". – Mr President, thank you for that very clear explanation."
"I was familiar with the Rules of Procedure and this procedure is, in fact, the one relating to urgent procedure, which has been dealt with in a rather special way."
"As for the order in which the groups take the floor, we are returning to the usual procedure, so everything is as it should be."
"Mr President, I want to make three comments at the opening of this debate, which I and other speakers welcome."
"Firstly it is one of the biggest disasters in South-East Asia."
"Our resolution mentions the figures, which were recalled by the previous speakers."
"This earthquake has killed and seriously injured more than 200 000 people."
"Millions of people are still left homeless, facing extreme weather conditions and all kinds of serious illnesses."
"More than 1.8 million people are homeless, as are about 85% of the population of Muzaffarabad, which I have visited."
"This is a horrifying statistic and we in Western Europe must do as much as we can to remedy this."
"Secondly, in terms of looking at the reaction so far, I applaud the swift action by the Commission and the Member States to give immediate aid."
"In this troubled part of the world, we must also welcome in particular the significant efforts by the Pakistani and Indian Governments to make sure that people can make contact across a line of control that has been impassable for more than 50 years."
"Hopefully this can be put into practice more."
"More importantly, and most urgently, I should like to ask the Commission about recent UN figures that indicate that so far very little of the aid that has been promised has been received."
"We would like to know how much of the aid offered by the European Union and the Member States has reached its destination."
"But maybe we can make additional efforts in the conciliation of the 2006 budget next week so we can make sure that those who are homeless today will at least have some elementary cover as the winter approaches."
"This will supplement those really hard-earned funds raised my constituents among others to help these people who are in serious need today."
". – I speak to you as one of the authors, and as stand-in for Neena Gill, chairman of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the border area between China, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan is one of the most earthquake-prone regions in the world."
"It is also the scene of one of the longest-running conflicts in South Asia."
"The border in the region is not yet properly demarcated or secured by means of bilateral or multilateral agreements."
"Armed conflict still smoulders under the surface."
"In the Pakistan-controlled area, which is virtually inaccessible, several million people have lost their homes and in some cases there is a complete lack not only of food and medicine, but also of any kind of contact with the outside world."
"We therefore call on all countries and organisations to help the victims."
"In the resolution before us, we naturally support the complete opening up of cross-border routes, including the reinstated bus link with India."
"It is certainly a positive development that further bus links connecting people on either side of the border in Punjab are at the planning stage, and further talks on rail links and the prospect of agreement on the joint construction of a gas pipeline in the region are developments that we naturally welcome."
"These measures will help to build up trust between opposing factions."
"Still on the theme of assistance to those affected by the earthquake, the aim is to provide help as quickly as possible to those who need it."
"Indeed, solidarity between the peoples of this divided region can help smooth the path towards solving age-old conflicts."
"The urgent call for local organisations to distribute assistance fairly is entirely justified."
"At the same time, the Commission and EU Member State governments must be called upon to speed up the assistance provided to the victims."
"The needs are well known and we are all aware, particularly with the onset of winter, that the saying ‘he who gives quickly gives twice’ applies more than ever before."
"I wish to thank all of you, ladies and gentlemen, for supporting this resolution."
"I believe that the issue of peaceful conflict resolution in this part of the world is one to which we shall be returning and that the Commission will soon submit to us a report on the measures that have been taken."
". – Mr President, socio-economic context and political conditions often exacerbate what strictly speaking should purely be natural disasters."
"Kashmir is one of these cases."
"Following the earthquake that occurred in October, which caused the deaths of between 70 000 and 90 000 people and made seven million people homeless, we must respond in an immediate, urgent fashion."
"That is the appeal we are clearly making and which must be addressed to the European Union, to the Council and to the Commission."
"We can only stress our condolences and guarantee that we are fully committed to providing this aid."
"At the same time, however, we must not be content solely with the emergency action."
"We must tackle the more structural aspects and, in this regard as well, the European Union must commit itself to supporting the reform and resolving the structural problems that require a response, not just in terms of infrastructure, but also from a socio-economic point of view, so that, when similar events occur, the consequences are not as serious as those we are seeing at the moment."
"We must therefore insist to the governments of the countries affected that this would be a good opportunity to prioritise social and internal needs, to stop spending so much on military aspects and dedicate — and this is where we must support them — all their efforts towards ensuring that the best possible structures are in place and reducing the effects of earthquakes of this kind as far as possible."
". – Mr President, even though this debate centres on a matter of great sadness, namely the tragedy that has hit hundreds of thousands of people in the Kashmir region, I believe that we have every reason to be glad that it is taking place."
"The reason I say this is because it relates to urgent crisis intervention, which in my opinion is an area where the European Union should and can take successful action."
"No one argues with the need for such interventions, and we can achieve our goals in this respect using existing methodological, financial and logistical resources."
"I have therefore been delighted to hear the comments made by all the previous speakers, including those by the Member who had visited Kashmir herself."
"The fact that this debate is taking place a matter of weeks after the tragedy is also to be welcomed."
"I believe that the people affected by this disaster deserve our urgent help."
"There can be no question that they are much more deserving than those regions and countries that recently suffered riots, and I refer to one country in particular."
"Even though these riots were a result of the countries’ own policies, we have heard that the EU wishes to come to their aid too."
"The poor people of Kashmir are far more deserving of help than rich countries that have only themselves to blame for their problems."
". – Mr President, following the earthquake in Kashmir, I saw an appalling headline in one newspaper, which read: ‘Even the earthquake cannot end the hostility between India and Pakistan’."
"What this headline shows is that it is the people, God help them, who suffer when political tensions are in play, even in this extremely dire situation."
"When Germans think of the artificial division of countries, they unfailingly think of Berlin."
"I myself have seen places in the heart of Berlin where people drowned in canals because nobody on the wall could help them, or was allowed to."
"What that means is that people had to refrain from doing something perfectly rational – that is, saving a person from drowning – because, at that time, the Iron Curtain was in place and political considerations prevented them from doing so."
"That sort of thing gives you a feel for what is going on in Kashmir."
"Let us not lose sight of the fact that this earthquake is already a terrible human catastrophe, but a winter is looming in which there will be mass mortality among the civilian population unless the powers-that-be on both sides at last get the better of their inability – which is to some extent their unwillingness – to cooperate and help one another, and unless aid gets to where it is needed."
"Kashmir is a victim of India’s refusal, at the time of its own foundation, to accept the country’s right of self-determination."
"There are now problems with Pakistan as well."
"The conclusion we should draw from this is that Kashmir is not merely a bilateral problem involving these two states, but also, and primarily, a problem for the Kashmiri people, and hence also for us."
"Not only should we carry on dialogue with both the powers there – important though they are as nuclear powers and major states – but we should also step up direct contact with the Kashmiri people and their representatives, particularly those on the local level, which is what this humanitarian catastrophe offers us an opportunity to do."
"First, we must help these people in a way that owes nothing to ideology; then we must work towards a solution for the region."
". – Mr President, on 8 October 2005 the region of Kashmir, which is located on the borders of Pakistan and India, was hit by an earthquake that has had tragic consequences."
"Eighty–eight thousand people are missing, and over 245 million have been hard hit by the aftermath of this disaster."
"Even today, it is still hard to obtain an exact estimate of material losses, but it is safe to say that they are on an unprecedented scale."
"The UN has called on the international community to provide urgent financial assistance to the tune of USD 500 million, but the countries affected by the disaster have received only 20% of the anticipated figure, even though over one month has passed since the earthquake took place."
"Although the region of Kashmir has long been a source of conflict between India and Pakistan, last year the two countries embarked on constructive dialogue with a view to ending this conflict."
"Following the natural disaster, they also decided to set up special crossing points along the Line of Control to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to victims in Kashmir."
"At present, however, only goods are permitted to pass through these crossing points, and not people."
"This makes it a great deal harder to distribute aid."
"Worse still, the mountainous nature of the region, as well as the devastated infrastructure and the lack of access roads, cause further delays in aid distribution."
"The European Parliament has a moral obligation to urge Pakistan and India to agree to allow citizens of both countries, and not only humanitarian aid resources, to pass through the crossing points."
"This would make it possible for the assistance of the international community to reach those who need it most."
". – Mr President, Madam Commissioner, today’s bomb attack in India-controlled Kashmir, which killed 4 and injured over 100, underlines the urgency of this urgency debate and the painful political backdrop to what should be a natural disaster."
"The earthquake which devastated the area came on the back of decades of political violence, and now winter is upon them, when the infrastructure and reserves remain so fragile."
"This House is no stranger to the Kashmir issue."
"Our delegation some time ago reached out to investigate a long-term political solution."
"It has to be acknowledged that local political progress was rather slower."
"Let us please hope that the earthquake can focus minds on cooperation and dialogue."
"Across my country, Scotland, we have seen Scots Asians reach out to their friends and relatives in Kashmir."
"We have seen fund-raising, donations and practical assistance."
"Their generosity of spirit sets us a challenge."
"It is now over to the politicians, and we in this House and the Commission can play our part in urgently coordinating aid, and in the long term, in helping find a viable political solution, because if there is not a political solution what other solution could there possibly be?"
"Perhaps there are some positive signs."
"Yesterday the opening of a fifth crossing across the line of control might be the start of a process that will lead to a peaceful solution."
"The immediate problems of the region are desperate, but as this resolution indicates, we stand ready as we must to help participate in a very long-term rebuilding."
"– Mr President, the region of Kashmir is divided between three countries, India, Pakistan and China, even though this is an oft-forgotten fact."
"Earthquakes know no borders, however, and the recent disaster affected both India and Pakistan, uniting them in misfortune."
"The scale of the tragedy can be gauged from the fact that it claimed the lives of an entire generation."
"The majority of its victims were children and young people, and virtually no schools have remained standing."
"The EU has a moral and political obligation to provide charitable assistance and to help reconstruct the region in the future."
"The USD 20 million donated by the World Bank, and the EU’s donation of less than EUR 4 million, represent only short-term aid for the victims of the disaster."
"Thought should also be given to the more distant future, since the effects of this disaster will be felt for the next few decades."
"Our debate on this issue should act as a reference point for the Commission and the Council."
"I should like to conclude with one final observation."
"According to my calculations, the EU’s financial aid for the victims of the tragedy in Kashmir amounts to 16 times less than the aid that is to be granted to France following the riots there."
"I have to say that I find this truly absurd."
"– Mr President, I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak briefly on what has been an appalling tragedy in north-western Pakistan, Afghanistan, India and predominantly the Kashmir region."
"The devastation caused by the earthquake is hard to comprehend, even after seeing repeated pictures of the suffering on our media screens and newspapers."
"The last 12 months has seen so many tragedies and natural disasters that have hit parts of the world: tsunamis, drought, mudslides, floods, repeated hurricanes, typhoons and now an earthquake."
"It is difficult to keep a focus and priority on the need for generosity and rapid relief, as we almost become conditioned to natural disaster after natural disaster."
"In the immediate term, the need to assemble aid and coordinate its distribution is fundamental, particularly in inaccessible parts of the disaster zones."
"Tens of thousands are still without shelter in inaccessible parts of Pakistan and Kashmir, and the freezing temperatures of winter are approaching."
"The politics of this region must be put aside in an effort to save lives, and this motion welcomes the coordination and opening of new routes between India-controlled Kashmir and the Pakistan side."
"We fully support an immediate and generous response to the call by the UN for donors to contribute more than half a billion dollars in emergency aid, much of which has not materialised yet."
"I hope the Commission will be able to make further funds available during budgetary discussions next week."
"Related to this motion, I believe the EU needs to show some initiative in encouraging the international community to plan for and prepare for natural disasters in the future."
"The reality is that natural disasters in many cases are predictable."
"We know the likely areas where hurricanes will strike next year and where earthquakes may strike, and we need to concentrate on building regional capacity in those regions rather than the kind of dramatic aid efforts that we are now involved in."
"So we need longer-term and future planning as well as the immediate aid requirements."
". Mr President, the Commission has made a rapid and generous response to help the victims of this terrible disaster."
"Indeed, within hours of this devastating earthquake the first funding was made available, and field teams were despatched."
"EUR 13.6 million had been allocated within a few days."
"The first tranche was made available within a few hours of the disaster."
"As the Commission humanitarian funds for 2005 were depleted, the Commission, through the ECHO and Relex departments, requested EUR 30 million from the reserve of the Commission budget for humanitarian aid, and EUR 10 million for reconstruction."
"We very much appreciate Parliament’s cooperation in releasing these additional funds."
"As a result, the Commission has been able to provide an overall financial package, as already mentioned, of EUR 93.6 million in response to the crisis, of which EUR 43.6 million will go to humanitarian relief, and EUR 50 million to rehabilitation."
"The funding to date is mainly for shelter, health – including the Red Cross field hospital at Muzaffarabad – water and sanitation, coordination, and logistics, including 11 helicopters, as was mentioned earlier today."
"Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner is today leaving for Pakistan where over the next two days she will take part in the Reconstruction Conference, along with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and other major international donors."
"I shall share with you some of our main concerns today."
"The Commission is fully aware that the location and scale of this disaster makes it very difficult for all humanitarian organisations to deploy rapidly and deliver aid to the victims."
"An additional constraint on meeting needs and allocating the funds available has been the implementing capacity of the aid agencies."
"There must be a rapid improvement, especially in reaching out beyond the main hubs."
"I fully agree with you that coordination is very important."
"Part of the role of the rapidly deployed ECHO field teams is to ensure or has been to ensure coordination."
"In addition, ECHO is also allocating funds to the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for their coordination role, including civil and military coordination of the use of military logistic support."
"Concerning the issue of special trade measures, which was raised by one of the honourable Members of this House, we are determined to take Pakistan’s trade interests into account within the confines of our international obligations."
"Pakistan will benefit from the new GSP from January 2006."
"For the first time in 10 years, all Pakistan’s exports will be covered."
"This means that Pakistan is getting identical treatment to the tsunami-affected countries."
"We in the Commission are very concerned at the prospect of a secondary humanitarian disaster as winter approaches."
"That is your concern as well, as thousands of injured people remain stranded in isolated mountain areas without food, shelter or sanitation."
"A sustained wide-scale relief action throughout the winter period is therefore to be expected."
"It is a must for all of us."
"In view of this, let me inform you that the Commission, through the ECHO DG, has just received a further EUR 30 million from the emergency reserve."
"I want to thank you for your support in these joint efforts to help those who are in need."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"The next item is the debate on five motions for resolutions on the Philippines (the sentencing to death of Francisco Larrañaga, an EU citizen)(1)."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this initiative is intended to prevent, in time, the execution in the Philippines of Francisco Larrañaga, a young European of Spanish nationality."
"During the long judicial process leading up to his sentencing, Paco Larrañaga strongly, repeatedly and unequivocally proclaimed his innocence at the horrendous crimes of which he had been accused."
"His defence team and recognised human rights organisations have complained that the trial took place without proper guarantees, with no respect for the right to a defence and that the verdict, reached despite an absence of evidence, was arbitrary and unfair."
"Despite that, last July, the Philippines Supreme Court confirmed the death sentence."
"When all possibilities for appeal run out, the only way to prevent the execution and to resolve the extremely serious situation of Paco Larrañaga according to Philippine law is a pardon by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo."
"Many initiatives have sought to secure such a pardon, of which I would highlight those by the King of Spain, the Spanish Prime Minister and the President of the European Parliament."
"Last Monday, the comments of a retired policeman, who had participated actively in the investigation into the crimes, to the effect that Larrañaga was innocent, were made public in the Philippines."
"This information, which has been widely reported by our media, confirms the validity of this resolution."
"The resolution defends the right to life and the fundamental rights of Paco Larrañaga."
"We are also defending our values: to eradicate the death sentence from the world and to restore proper judicial procedures."
"We support the legislative initiative of the Philippines Congress to abolish the death penalty."
"A presidential pardon would demonstrate a commitment to democracy and human rights, which would enhance the international credibility of the Philippines."
"The current certainty demands that we prioritise the objective of achieving a full pardon for Paco Larrañaga and we therefore believe that we should not introduce amendments that do not focus on that fundamental and urgent objective."
". – Mr President, we are dealing with a very important resolution, because, in the case of Francisco Larrañaga, there is no question that we are dealing with a flagrant miscarriage of justice."
"By means of this resolution, we can help to get him released from the prison in which he is unjustly being held, because it is clear that he is innocent."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I visited Francisco Larrañaga in the Philippines last week."
"He has been in that prison for eight years, since he was 19, and he has been on death row for two years."
"There are 18 000 people in that prison, of whom 1 200 are on death row, and the sentence has been confirmed in 250 cases."
"They sleep in the corridors because there are not enough cells there."
"Furthermore, Paco Larrañaga was sent to that prison without any fair, credible or acceptable trial."
"He was not allowed a proper defence at the trial."
"Thirty defence witnesses were not able to speak because the judges did not allow them."
"When Larrañaga’s lawyers asked that the witnesses and Larrañaga himself be able to speak, they were imprisoned for contempt of court."
"On one body, which was found disfigured – allegedly one of the victims – no DNA test was carried out."
"He was five centimetres too short."
"The family did not recognise him and so on."
"As if that were not enough, this case has taken a 180-degree turn this week — as my friend and colleague Antolín Sánchez Presedo has said — with statements by a policeman to the effect that Larrañaga was innocent."
"Despite this, the Philippine justice system has unfortunately closed the case."
"We must therefore support the political groups of Philippine members of parliament who are going to present a draft abolishing the death penalty in that country’s congress, so that that abolition can become a reality and the death penalty in the Philippines can come to an end."
"The aim of this resolution is to save a European citizen who is going to be executed despite being innocent."
"We all know that he is innocent because of the evidence we have seen."
"I would therefore ask you to support this resolution, in order to make the pardon a reality and so that Larrañaga does not have to spend another second in Philippine prisons."
". – Mr President, the Philippine moratorium on the death penalty of March 2000 has for the past three years has gone completely the other way."
"The current government aims to carry out more and more death sentences, even on minors who, by law, cannot be sentenced to death or executed."
"In its pursuit to eliminate as many people as possible, the government puts victims into isolation, tortures them and excludes them from legal assistance."
"The fact that the government of the Philippines is unable to put an end to crime and protests does not justify the use of barbaric means of this kind."
"Among the many people of Philippine nationality who have fallen victim to them, there is Francisco Larrañaga, who also has Spanish nationality."
"The fact that he has been charged with very serious criminal offences does not justify a mock trial that disregards his alibi, nor does it justify a death sentence and the exclusion, so far, of the possibility of this conviction being quashed."
"His dual nationality does, however, help to bring this abuse to the attention of the media in Europe."
"Even if the life of a European citizen is not at risk, we must make every effort to remove the death penalty, wherever it may apply throughout the world."
". – Mr President, the case of Francisco Larrañaga, as previous speakers have said, obliges us once again to analyse and promote the debate on the need for universal abolition of the death penalty."
"The Larrañaga case has all the characteristics of an unfair trial without minimum legal guarantees, which is hard to accept within the framework of the international law in force."
"Unfortunately, the Larrañaga situation is particularly delicate, since there is apparently no means for appealing against the death sentence passed in July 2005."
"The important thing, however, is not just the fact that Mr Larrañaga is a citizen of Spanish nationality, and therefore European, but that there are almost 2 000 other people in a similar situation. I would therefore point out that the fact that, in the Philippines, the indiscriminate detention of suspects is normal, that torture is also common currency and that these people are often kept in solitary confinement, all increase our concern about the particular case of Mr Larrañaga."
"We in this House rarely have the opportunity to analyse and deal with the situation in the Philippines. This is, therefore, a good opportunity to remember this and many other issues that concern us."
"In the European Union’s relations with third countries, the abolition of the death penalty should be seen as a standard that should be spread and respected by those countries that impose it if they are to enjoy normal relations with the European Union."
"I would insist, therefore, that the Larrañaga case offers us an opportunity to state that the death penalty must be abolished."
"In the specific case of the Philippines, I would like to call upon President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to at least restore the moratorium on the death penalty and, secondly, as some of my fellow Members have also said, I would stress the need for the law reintroducing the death penalty to be repealed."
"In this regard, I support the initiatives that have been presented in the Philippine Congress."
"– Mr President, this resolution confuses a number of different issues."
"To begin with, no distinction is made between our calls for the abolition of the death penalty in the Philippines and the matter of the trial of the young man who has been accused of such terrible crimes."
"These are two entirely separate issues."
"Those speakers who claim that this was an unfair trial are making a very serious accusation."
"They are claiming nothing less than that all the successive courts in the Philippines have ruled in error, and that the President of the Philippines does not wish to grant pardons to her people."
"This is a different matter altogether."
"There is a third issue at stake here, namely the question of what we are in fact demanding."
"As I see it, our priority should be to demand a fair trial."
"After all, if the trial in question was unfair, then this would constitute a crime."
"If the trial was in fact fair, then we could demand a reprieve from the death penalty, but we could not demand a complete acquittal for such terrible crimes, provided that they were in fact committed."
"We should therefore call for a reprieve, but we should not call for a complete acquittal until a fair trial has taken place."
". Mr President, the Commission is extremely concerned by the retention of the death penalty law in the Philippines and the omission by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to reinstate the moratorium on the death penalty lifted on 1 January 2004."
"The EU stance against the death penalty is based on the firm belief in the inherent dignity of all human beings and the inviolability of the human person."
"The Member States, together with the Commission, have strengthened their international activities in opposition to the death penalty as an integral part of EU human rights policy."
"They have also adopted EU guidelines laying down the basic principles to be followed in this respect."
"We know that there are currently more than 1 000 inmates on death row in the Philippines."
"Of these, 165 death sentences have been affirmed by the Supreme Court and can be stopped only by a presidential stay of execution."
"We are calling again on the Philippine President to reprieve death-row convicts."
"We are particularly concerned about the Supreme Court’s sentence of 3 February 2004 condemning the Spanish-Filipino citizen Francisco Larrañaga to death and the refusal to reconsider the case in July 2004, thus ending all judicial channels for appeal."
"On 5 July 2004, the EU Troika – consisting of the Netherlands, the UK and the Commission – handed an amicus curiae brief to the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs in support of the motion for the reconsideration of the case."
"Since then, the Spanish Embassy in Manila has had the lead on that specific case, while the Commission is dealing with general issues related to the support of the campaign against the death penalty by various actors in the Philippines."
"The UK Embassy, in cooperation with the UK organisation Reprieve, has sent a lawyer to the Philippines for three months, starting in October 2005, to investigate the case."
"We also support the various internal parliamentary initiatives on the revocation of the death penalty law that are currently being debated in the Philippines Congress, and we encourage the efforts by civil society to work towards that goal."
"It is important to insist on the reconsideration of the Larrañaga case, as he has not had a fair trial according to international legal standards."
"So, even if Parliament ruled in favour of the abolition of the death penalty in exchange for life sentences, the Larrañaga case would remain flawed."
"The EU should continue to insist on the right to a fair trial for Mr Larrañaga."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Burma/Myanmar(1)."
". – Mr President, this is not the first time that a resolution on Burma has been put before this Parliament."
"Only a few months ago, a joint resolution condemning the gross violation of human rights in that country was passed unanimously."
"Unfortunately, as is often the case when dealing with totalitarian regimes, the Burmese dictatorship took only minimal notice of that resolution."
"The brutality and repression practised by the Burmese military against their own people has continued unabated and serious human rights abuses, including rape and pillage by government soldiers, have continued to take place."
"Furthermore, an estimated 1 000 political prisoners are still being held illegally and, on 2 November, 10 prominent human rights democracy and peace activists were given a total of 756 years in sentences."
"Needless to say, their trials were totally unfair; they were denied representation by lawyers of their choice and prevented from having access to their families."
"So the Burmese dictators leave us with no option but to proceed with a tougher resolution, such as the one before us today."
"Amongst other things, we call on the UN Security Council urgently to address the situation in Burma and we insist that the EU’s common policy on Burma be strengthened by taking certain practical punitive measures."
"The resolution also calls for a high-ranking EU envoy to be appointed to work towards securing the release of political prisoners, helping in humanitarian issues and generally assisting and bringing about the much-needed democratic reforms in that nation."
"Let us hope that the Burmese dictators will, on this occasion, take more serious note of our condemnations and concerns and that they will proceed speedily along the only logical avenue open to them, which is the one that leads to the democratisation of their long-suffering country."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I had the opportunity of leading the European Parliament’s delegation responsible for observing the work of the 26th ASEAN interparliamentary Assembly Meeting in September in Vientiane, Laos."
"I was able to observe on the ground the efforts made by Laos and by other countries in the region to improve their mode of governance."
"The European Union supports, moreover, the efforts made by these countries, and work must continue along these lines."
"Burma, for its part, is making no effort whatsoever in terms of establishing democratic rule."
"The repression suffered by, in particular, Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, and by her party’s supporters, requires no further mention."
"This repressive situation is one glaring example proving the lack of democracy in Burma."
"Let us not forget that the party in power took the country’s helm illicitly."
"It seems appropriate to me to state a few facts illustrating the tragic situation of this country and its people."
"Allow me to act as spokesman in this Chamber for Reporters without Borders and bring up the case of Win Tin, a 75-year-old journalist, who is in a critical state of health and who is still in prison when he ought to have been released for good behaviour."
"The list of oppressed people is obviously a very long one and, despite the 250 releases granted a few months ago – a move that should be welcomed – there remain around 1000 political prisoners."
"For over ten years, the State Law and Order Restoration Council, which is nothing more than a military junta, has controlled the various aspects of the country’s political and economic life."
"Human rights are completely lost sight of, access to education has become a privilege reserved for a tiny sector of society and freedom of expression is non-existent to the point where foreign journalists are put in prison."
"Any form of dissidence is forbidden."
"Consequently, members of the resistance, who are still active, are arrested in order to prevent them from undermining the ruling power."
"The situation is all the more serious because this country, which has a large number of ethnic groups, does not respect cultural diversity at all."
"Some ethnic groups are, moreover, enslaved."
"Despite these unmistakeable horrors, certain countries continue to trade with Burma."
"As a Member of the European Parliament, I call for a firmer stance to be adopted in the face of this unacceptable situation, as the sanctions that have been taken are too weak."
"In order to bring about some change in the current situation, I believe that it is vital to prevent trade in strategic sectors currently in the hands of the generals."
"It would be worthwhile to call on the commercial and industrial businesses established in Burma to set an example, so that Burma really develops into a democratic country."
"That is why I, of course, unreservedly support the resolution tabled by the six political groups."
". – Mr President, what continues in Burma is appalling."
"Military dictatorship continues to rule by force, despite recent ceasefire talks and agreements."
"Resistance is still being dealt with by brutal military response."
"I visited the Thai-Burmese border two weeks ago for six days."
"I had the opportunity to visit refugee camps in Thailand that are overflowing with people who have fled from Burma’s Karen province and Karenni province."
"The human rights situation inside Burma within ethnic provinces is hugely concerning."
"The reality of war and military leaders acting with impunity results in repression and abuse: forced relocation of communities and destruction of villages, thousands of internally displaced people living in the forest, the rape of women and girls – many such incidents documented by human rights organisations, forced labour, the use of up to 60 000 child soldiers – I met two young 16-year-old defectors from the Burmese armies, and the random use of landmines by both sides littering the jungle to lethal effect."
"The main focus of this resolution is to nudge the international community forward, to ensure that Burma is put on the UN Security Council agenda as soon as possible."
"The report by Vaclav Havel and Desmond Tutu makes a real, legal and valid case for bringing the Burma issue to the UN Security Council, and I support it."
"The solution to the suffering and repression in Burma is not primarily about aid, although aid is required to relieve suffering."
"A lasting solution must be a political one."
"We need a real ceasefire."
"We need talks between the government the SPDC, the National League for Democracy and ethnic groups, with all groups having an equal level of participation."
"We need the release of all political prisoners, and we need to allow democracy to govern."
"I have no confidence that, without sustained international pressure at the highest possible level, Burma will make the positive transition to democracy."
"I encourage the EU Member States on the UN Security Council to take a more proactive role in getting Burma on to the Security Council agenda, in particular Britain."
"It is somewhat ironic that it is the US that is taking the lead on this issue despite the historic links and relationship between Britain, Burma and its people."
"It takes 9 out of 15 members of the UN Security Council to sign a motion to put the issue on the agenda."
"We currently have eight."
"If the political will exists, a ninth can be found and persuaded."
". – Mr President, shortly after the Second World War, Burma made a reasonable start as an independent state."
"The key problem was that the people from central Burma differed, in terms of languages and culture, from the people nearer the coast and that the indigenous peoples wanted maximum autonomy."
"This demand was not met; they were not even met halfway, and violent conflicts were the result, giving the army the opportunity to become even more powerful and independent, eventually seizing all the powers of the state and also a large proportion of the economy."
"It is a strange kind of dictatorship that does not have any ideological goals that might make them more popular among certain sections of the population."
"Within this dictatorship, there is a continuing battle, whereby leaders are deposed and even imprisoned."
"Within the leading group, there are also conflicting economic interests in the extraction of minerals, in the felling of tropical rain forest and in the production of opium."
"The tactics used in respect of the democratic opposition are also variable."
"The only time when free elections were allowed, the large majority had spoken out in favour of the opposition, and so the result was subsequently cancelled."
"A change in regime has appeared virtually impossible to date."
"For years, foreign companies sought financial gain from this dictatorship."
"Burma can provide cheap raw materials, because the people are kept more or less in slavery and nature and the environment are not protected."
"Under pressure from various international protest movements, those economic contacts have now been cut back considerably, but have not completely disappeared."
"Only continued and strengthened isolation can bring change in due course."
"It is to be welcomed that the proposed resolution calls for a ban on any companies registered in the European Union investing in, or lending to, Burma."
"Only in that way can we help put a stop to the rape and pillaging by government troops, forced labour, forced house moves, the taking of political prisoners and the exclusion of citizens from the government in office."
". – Mr President, as Mr Coveney so eloquently described, the situation in Burma is not getting better."
"This House has passed enough resolutions for Aung San Suu Kyi to wallpaper the house that remains her prison."
"How does this resolution get serious – because it is well past time that this House did get serious?"
"I refer you to paragraph 1 and our request that the UN Security Council investigate sanctions against this regime."
"We in the EU took this decision some time ago, yet EU companies continue to play a full part, in particular in the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise."
"It is argued in the grubby world of realpolitik that implementing our own sanctions policy would leave a vacuum that would be only too happily filled by the Chinese."
"Perhaps."
"So it is appropriate and commensurate that sanctions be discussed and implemented at UN level."
"However, global politics should not be used as an excuse for our own double standards."
"We must enforce our own policy not just against the Myanmar Oil and Gas Company, but also against the Myanmar Timber Company and Myanmar Post and Telecoms, and I regret that they do not appear in this resolution."
"Diplomatic pressure has demonstrably not worked against this regime."
"Our application of economic pressure must be stepped up and we must work with the United Nations to bring this disgraceful situation to an end."
". – Mr President, the blatant violation of human rights in Myanmar has often been the subject of resolutions by the European Parliament."
"Another resolution will be added and I do not know what its effectiveness will be, because the Burmese people are suffering barbaric suppression of their rights through forced labour, prosecution of opponents, the enlistment of children, forced relocation and the extermination of ethnic minorities."
"In addition to all this, Myanmar has a prime position in the production and trafficking of drugs, while HIV is forging ahead and Myanmar has a terrible record in this sector."
"These are issues which certainly need to be addressed by the international community because, not only is the situation not improving, it is getting constantly worse."
"For these reasons, there is a need for the UN Security Council to intervene."
"We believe that Aung San Suu Kyi, who has an international reputation and has been honoured with international distinctions, can unite the political parties and all the opposing political groups and guarantee the independence of ethnic minorities, so that at some point democratic, judicial and political change will come to Myanmar."
"The report drafted recently at the initiative of President Vaclav Havel and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, which confirms with precise data the drastic situation in the country, posits this need for broader dialogue."
"The dialogue, apart from the internal level I mentioned, must also be held on an international scale."
"Consequently, I think that the European Commission should take an initiative towards the UN Security Council, so that a solution can be found for Myanmar to acquire a democratic future, although acute pressure must be exerted beforehand."
"– Mr President, recital A of our resolution says that the people of Burma are subject to human rights abuses including forced labour, persecution of dissidents, conscription of child soldiers, rape and pillage by government troops and forced relocation."
"Have we ever had a resolution before us which was so clear in terms of the abuses that we are seeking to have addressed by the European Union?"
"Despite our diplomatic efforts so far, none of the conditions set by the sixth ASEM Ministerial meeting in Ireland last year, including the release of Aung San Suu Kyi as a minimum condition, has been fulfilled by the Burmese dictatorship."
"While some political prisoners have been released, 1 000 remain in custody and political leaders continue to be sentenced to brutal prison sentences, some of up to 106 years."
"Forced labour continues, despite agreements with the ILO."
"We must strengthen our diplomatic actions in relation to Burma by prohibiting investment or loans to all state-owned companies, not just those already banned."
"We must refuse to accept as legitimate any outcome of the national convention unless the conditions set down last year by the ASEM Ministers are met."
"Finally, we must mount a serious campaign at the United Nations for sanctions against Burma."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, Myanmar, that is Burma, is it not?"
"Several years ago, this was more or less the reaction of one of my colleagues to the press report on the news of new natural gas deposits in the continental shelf of that South Asian country."
"Myanmar is currently subject to EU and UN sanctions."
"What is interesting is that in his report, which we have received, Sergio Vieira de Mello complains about the efforts of the military government to enshrine the role of the army in the newly drafted constitution."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you have not misheard me; in 2005, one of the most fiercely criticised aspects of the situation in Myanmar is the role of the army in daily life and the imprisonment of hundreds of people on account of their political opinions."
"Yet if any of you were to think that we could be talking about Turkey or Afghanistan, you would be mistaken."
"Such things are criticised in Turkey as cautiously as though we were talking about the United States."
"In the case of Myanmar, we refer to the violence as intolerable, and the same is true for the treatment of ethic minorities."
"As far as Afghanistan is concerned, we are lost for words."
"Why not open accession talks with Myanmar and set up a free trade area and such like, as we are doing with Turkey?"
"Is that pie in the sky?"
"If so, then we are nothing but a bunch of impostors, applying different standards to different countries."
"Please do not take it amiss, but I shall not be voting for a resolution of this nature."
". – Mr President, today’s debate on human rights violations centres on one of Asia’s leading regimes."
"The Union of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, is familiar to us from images of exquisite Buddhist temples and gold-encrusted, sumptuous palaces."
"Yet the tragic fate facing thousands of the country’s citizens is being covered up."
"Human rights are brutally violated there, and thousands are either serving time in prison after having been sentenced and persecuted for opposition activities, or are subjected to forced labour."
"Children as young as 11 are forced to do military service, and the majority of citizens live on less than USD 1 per day."
"They also lack access to health care, which exacerbates the problems faced by the many people infected with HIV."
"Burma has been rated 190th out of 191 countries with regard to the quality of access to health care in the country."
"There is no such thing as access to the Internet in Burma."
"Satellite dishes were banned until recently, and the country’s citizens are not allowed into the small number of hotels where foreigners have access to the foreign press."
"All the state structures were dissolved after the in 1962 and 1988, and power was seized by the State Law and Order Restoration Council."
"Ironically, the latter has been responsible for instituting one of the bloodiest regimes in the world."
"Even though a parliament was legally elected in 1990, it has not yet taken up its duties."
"The generals’ junta ignores the interventions of international organisations, whether they are undertaken by the UN or by human rights and labour organisations."
"There are many unanswered questions surrounding the existence of regimes and totalitarianism of this kind. The problems relate not only to the way in which power is exercised by psychopaths who exploit those weaker than themselves, but also to the difficulties involved in providing any kind of aid."
"The latter is an issue because the population of the country, which in any case suffers persecution and extreme poverty, is hit hardest by any embargo."
"The majority of economic aid provided goes into the regime’s pockets."
"The military junta in Burma/Myanmar uses 40% of its revenue to support or even expand its army, which is already sizeable even though the country is not at war with anyone."
"In view of the above, foreign corporations should not invest in Burma/Myanmar, since such investment would effectively amount to tacit and material assistance for the army."
"Wherever a dictatorship exists, ways should be sought to provide help, to conduct negotiations and to cooperate with the opposition."
"This cooperation should take place both with members of the opposition living in the country and with those living abroad, since they will be most aware of the extent of the problem and of the most helpful forms of intervention."
"We are therefore calling for Aung San Suu Kyi and the other opposition leaders to be released, for the National League for Democracy to be allowed to take up its work again and for humanitarian aid to be provided, thus preventing both religious persecution and the destruction of the Burmese nation and national minorities."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that the Commission fully shares the concerns regarding the situation in Burma/Myanmar, as expressed here today by honourable Members of the European Parliament."
"There is no doubt that several issues are of serious concern, in particular the proceedings of the so-called national roadmap, the human rights and forced labour situation and many more issues that have been mentioned today."
"In this context, let me emphasise that the Commission continues to call for the unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political leaders who remain in detention."
"In the past, the Commission maintained contacts with most of the Shan leaders who have now been sentenced, and it goes without saying that the conduct of these politically motivated trials was unacceptable according to democratic and legal standards."
"The Commission continues to urge the regime to engage in a real dialogue with all political actors, including the National League for Democracy and ethnic groups."
"We are convinced that only a transparent and constructive dialogue between legitimate stakeholders can lead to national reconciliation and a return to democracy."
"Probably, the regime will deliver on its roadmap."
"It will probably formally accomplish the National Convention later this year and organise a referendum on the draft Constitution in 2006."
"The result will certainly fall short of our expectations in terms of real democracy."
"It should nevertheless be considered a small step in the right direction."
"Burma/Myanmar is partly isolated from the Western world and partly isolating itself."
"However, we must understand that the country continues to enjoy a comfort zone in the region, especially with regard to its neighbours."
"There is a degree of intra-ASEAN solidarity, despite the position of individual political leaders in ASEAN."
"I mention these issues because they illustrate the difficult background against which we operate."
"Without any doubt, we must voice our concern for the people in the country."
"The EU is called upon to help the people of Burma/Myanmar."
"The Commission therefore strongly supports a significant increase in humanitarian aid and assistance."
"The Commission maintains that our common position generally reflects what should be done."
"We should continue voicing the Union’s criticism of members of the junta and policies pursued by the regime."
"This can be done only if we continue the agreed EU policy by keeping communication channels open and using high-level ASEM and EU-ASEAN meetings, or the margins of such meetings."
"An update of the common position needs to be discussed with and agreed by all EU Member States, bearing in mind the possible positive or negative developments in the country, and reflecting our values and political interests."
"This would also apply if the EU were to nominate a special envoy."
"A year ago, in October 2004, we strengthened the EU common position."
"We introduced a more comprehensive visa ban and prohibited support for international financing."
"Any further change in the common position – apart from the fact that we would need all the partners to agree – would need to ensure the legality of such a measure under international law and ensure that the people of Burma/Myanmar did not become the victims."
"The people of Burma/Myanmar should not pay twice: once for living under a repressive regime and twice as a result of the economic sanctions imposed by the West."
"Then there is the question of whether the UN Security Council should discuss Burma."
"Most of us have seen the recent report, endorsed by Vaclav Havel and Archbishop Desmond Tutu."
"The report concludes that the UN Security Council should deliberate on the Burma/Myanmar issue."
"However, we are all aware that it will prove very difficult to pass any resolution on this subject given the reluctance of some permanent members, notably China."
"I assure honourable Members of Parliament that the Commission will continue its work on Burma/Myanmar, stepping up its assistance for people in need and, at the same time, pressing for democracy, human rights, the release of political detainees and for democratic reform and political transition."
"Without a doubt, the overarching goal of our dealings with Burma is the transition towards democracy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates; that is, now."
"The next item is voting time."
"– Mr President, we would like to suggest that the end of recital A should read: ‘in the region of Kashmir, the North-West Frontier province of Pakistan, Afghanistan and India’."
"I think this would coincide better with the terminology which would normally be expected in the House on this matter."
"Mr Elles, that was not the oral amendment passed on to me by the competent services."
"I thought that you first had an initial amendment on paragraph 11, with a further series of oral amendments coming after that."
"– Mr President, yes, that related to the recitals."
"Paragraph 11 should read 'five' crossing points instead of 'four', because that would bring us up to date with the facts as they are today."
"– Mr President, we are voting on a particularly sensitive matter."
"We are suggesting that where the recital reads ‘the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan, Afghanistan, India and Kashmir’, it should now read: ‘in the region of Kashmir, the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan, Afghanistan and India’."
"That is the text we would suggest and it is actually very similar to the PSE Group text which comes next."
"– Mr President, Mrs Gill said before she left that the PSE Group would back Mr Elles’ oral amendment because it was so similar to her own."
"Mr President, we were all trying to address the same issue concerning the mention of Kashmir."
"We are trying to find a wording that will address the issue: whether to call it Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Indian-administered Kashmir, as I have suggested."
"But I am quite happy to accept the PPE-DE Group’s oral amendment."
"That is perfect, you are making the Presidency’s job easier by sparing it political arbitration."
"– Mr President, forgive my saying so, but the territory of Afghanistan has never been an integral part of Kashmir."
"Therefore, that is a piece of nonsense."
"In fact, I believe that the wording jointly proposed by Mr Elles, Mrs Stihler and Mrs Lynne is quite clear: we are talking about the North-West Frontier province of Pakistan, Afghanistan, India and, in particular, the region of Kashmir."
"The wording does not say that Kashmir is in the country you mentioned."
"I believe that this is quite clear."
"– Mr President, from the interpretation which came through, you were in fact reading out the Socialist amendment rather than the PPE-DE one."
"I would like to be clear that we were voting on the PPE-DE amendment, then we will be happy on our side of the House and I think on the other side as well."
"I read out your amendment in French."
"Perhaps the interpreters, who have all of the texts in front of them, made a slight mistake, but it is indeed your text, in your language, that will be used in the minutes."
"– Mr President, with regard to the next case, what we are really doing is supporting the proposal by the rapporteur, Mr Wijkman, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that the vote be postponed."
"We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament support that proposal."
"With regard to the report by Mrs Martens, I would insist that the vote be postponed until the next mini part-session in Brussels."
"I say this out of respect for Mrs Martens as rapporteur and, of course, out of respect for the importance of the issue."
"I believe that it is a scandal that it be approved with just 79 votes, with 79 participants."
"I do not see how Mrs Martens can believe that that strengthens her position, or that of Parliament."
"If I were rapporteur, I would not think that at all."
"I would therefore ask, on behalf of my group, that this issue be put to the vote at the next mini part-session in Brussels."
"– Mr President, I am very definitely opposed to the vote being adjourned."
"I would also like to make it clear that Mr Wijkman was not speaking on behalf of this group, and have now done so."
"Mrs Martens is herself in favour of her report being voted on."
"What is scandalous, then, is not that 79 votes are enough to adopt it, but that the others are not present."
"It is those who are present who will vote, and that is in order."
". – Mr President, I am in favour of getting the voting process underway, since we knew we would be under pressure of time."
"All groups in the Committee on Development have expressly requested that the voting be concluded, so that the Council can take our position to next week’s meeting."
"If we do not vote now, then everything will be over for Africa."
"There will, of course, still be discussions, but this item will no longer be on the agenda."
"It is not ideal, of course, that we are voting now rather than this afternoon, for example, because a different time schedule applies this afternoon, but now that things are the way they are, I am in favour of the voting going ahead, so that we can take ourselves as Parliament seriously."
"Very well, I believe that the Assembly has been put in the picture; the arguments have been put forward."
"Therefore, I shall submit to our plenary the request made by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to postpone the vote."
"– Mr President, I address the Assembly and I address Mr Posselt: in the minutes for the day, it will be seen that, on two occasions, Mr Wijkman said he was speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Mr Posselt was perhaps not present."
"We were here; we heard Mr Wijkman."
"Given, therefore, that there is apparently a problem, I will only uphold the same position that we held previously: it is no longer a matter of 79 votes, but of 72 at the present time."
"I think that Mr Posselt was in the room when the rapporteur spoke."
"I shall give him the floor straight away."
"Mr Posselt, you are against postponing the vote, I believe."
"– Mr President, I just want to say that I have been here the whole afternoon without interruption."
"I have already heard that and have clarified it."
"For the time being, I have a request for postponement from only one group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"I believe that the rapporteur is no longer present, which simplifies the procedure."
"Are there still speakers for and against?"
"– Mr President, I simply wanted to confirm what was said by my colleague, Mr Posselt."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wants the vote to take place."
"– Mr President, I do not want to speak in favour of voting today."
"I just wanted to bring the attention of the House to the fact that we do not want to create a dustbin parliamentary period on Thursday afternoon as a result of saying that everything which seems to be more important than other things can be postponed to a future date. I do not object;"
"I do not hold strong views on the subject and I certainly do not want to upset my good friend Mr Martínez, but there is a danger that we could create inferior subjects and superior subjects."
"To put it simply, why are we having these debates this afternoon?"
"They were, in fact, initially scheduled to take place earlier but, due to the length of the voting sessions, we were unable to finish in good time."
"As for the order of importance of the reports, everyone makes his or her own judgment about that."
"I believe that the Thursday afternoon debates, particularly on issues of topical and urgent importance, also have a certain political value."
"In any case, the rule is thus laid down; the Members who are not present cannot take those who are present hostage."
"We shall proceed to the vote on the request made by our colleague for a postponement."
"That concludes the vote."
". The Development Strategy for Africa comes on the back of the UK's ""Commission for Africa"" initiative and is designed to introduce a single framework to manage relations between the EU and Africa."
"This strategy is particularly important in the light of the EU's commitment to achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"In that regard I feel the Communication could have been more dynamic and powerful."
"The Commission have not convinced me with this report that they are yet in a position to mobilise funds and political support on the scale necessary to meet the MDGs."
". I voted for this report which supports the Commission Development Policy Statement which aims to provide a framework for all External Actions in the field of development."
"Although hopeful I think the impact of the final statement is questionable."
"I wish all of the brave Members who have stayed until the end an excellent journey home and I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports;"
"– A6-0323/2005 by Mr Becsey, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC on the common system of value added tax, with regard to the length of time during which the minimum standard rate is to be applied (COM(2005)0136 – C6-0113/2005 – 2005/0051(CNS)),"
"– A6-0324/2005 by Mr Becsey, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive laying down detailed rules for the refund of value added tax, provided for in Directive 77/388/EEC, to taxable persons not established in the territory of the country but established in another Member State (COM(2004)0728 – C6-0251/2005 – 2005/0807(CNS)) and"
"– the oral question to the Commission by Mrs Berès, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the expiry of Directive 1999/85/EC as regards the possibility of applying on an experimental basis a reduced VAT rate on labour-intensive services (O-0106/2005 – B6-0342/2005)."
". We are debating two issues, and I shall start with the minimum standard VAT rate."
"We are debating an issue of extreme legal and political sensitivity."
"According to the Commission’s report, an extension of the current temporary regime based on the Sixth VAT Directive – which expires on 31 December 2005 – would be justified."
"What I mean is that we could set the minimum standard rate only, at the current level of 15%, and extend this regime, still with a temporary effect, to 2010."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of our Parliament has debated this proposal, and basically agrees with the approach of the Commission."
"Accordingly, we too agree with the proposal and with its time frame, namely with the extension to 2010."
"We also accepted the necessity of having to debate this issue with extraordinary speed, before the last ECOFIN session on 6 December, to enable the Council to have the opinion of Parliament and make a decision in view of it."
"Based on the debate of the Committee, we amend the original proposal tabled by the Committee in respect of one issue, namely that apart from the minimum standard we would also like to set the maximum rate at 25%, which would be the highest rate currently used in Member States; this would avoid any of the Member States having to resort to legislation amendments or budget course corrections in the very short term."
"However, by adopting this course of action, the majority of our Parliament indicates that we believe in the necessity of preventing divergence of standard VAT rates."
"However, our Parliament has also adopted another significant position on this issue, which does not affect the current prompt decision of prolongation, but it is important to us."
"We would actually like to avoid a situation similar to the current one, where we are pressed for time both in respect of the extension of the minimum standard VAT rate and the intensive employment regime expiring at the end of the year, which has been implemented with the involvement of several Member States who have all gained valuable positive experience in the process."
"Therefore we ask the Commission to prepare a study by the beginning of 2007, to enable Parliament to start a debate in 2007-2008 in good time, without any rush, concerning the direction and depth of the VAT policy to be implemented by Member States, and the European Union regulation required in this respect."
"In our request proposal prepared with the participation of all parliamentary factions, we ask the Commission to evaluate the current standard implicit – that is, converted to one rate – VAT level differentials and their budgetary implications, particularly in respect of the differentiations seen in Member States joining the EU during the last enlargement, which are unable to apply the individual reduced rates, and can only effect transition to the special areas not included in the Sixth VAT Directive (that is, not included in Annex K or Annex H) until 2007."
"Based on the material to be prepared by the Commission, we will be able to define our parliamentary position on the issue of VAT charged at source or charged to the consumer, and then examine whether or not, in the spirit of subsidiarity, we need to set a minimum and a maximum rate at Community level, and if the answer is yes, whether we should use the normal standard or implicit – that is, the actual converted – rate for these VAT rates."
"Another further issue to be debated by Parliament in the following years in light of the efficiency of the Stability and Growth Pact is the extent of freedom to be granted to Member States for the possible reduction of VAT rates, and whether the standard rates or the individual exemptions from standard rates are most likely to distort the market (if they distort it at all)."
"At the same time, we could also examine the issue of whether the priority given to consumption tax – at the expense of direct taxes, and mainly taxes affecting the workforce – can actually assist Member States in achieving the Lisbon employment targets."
"These would be the issues of the next debate, for which sufficient time should be allowed."
"I am convinced that a good background report prepared by the Committee may assist Parliament with this issue, and we will be able to accept a considered position even before 2010, but at this point we still propose extension, with the amendment that we must also set the maximum rate, at 25%."
"My second report concerns VAT refunds."
"The amendment to the Eighth Directive, tabled before us, is part of a highly significant, triple amendment package tabled by the Commission in October 2004, the effect of which has been – rightly – extended by the current Commission, and which has become famous for the single-window system, the so-called ‘one-stop-shop’."
"Parliament has already adopted a position on this issue, as well as on tax cooperation between Member States, in connection with two reports tabled before Parliament, and now I am pleased that at the request of the Council we are also able to express our views, even if retrospectively, on the Eighth Directive addressing VAT refunds."
"First of all, I would state that we fully agree with the approach of the Commission to the entire draft package, including the amendment to the Eighth Directive, as this helps enterprises collect outstanding VAT from other Member States, and it also speeds up this process by the use of electronic methods."
"So far, collection has only been possible if an entity was VAT registered in another Member State."
"Many refused to follow the extended and costly procedure, and in the majority of cases outstanding VAT has not been collected at all, because the administrative procedure would have cost more than the actual amount of outstanding VAT."
"The current amendment will primarily improve the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises, which had the most difficulty in sustaining the apparatus required for refunds in a cost-effective manner."
"The approach of the Council allowing a period of three months for the competent authorities to assess a claim is also small-enterprise-friendly."
"We also support the proposal that a very stiff, one-month late penalty fee must be paid by the competent tax authority for each month after the expiry of the time limit."
"We did not accept the proposed amendment that would have left this to be regulated individually by Member States."
"Our amendment proposals have also been formulated in line with this approach of the Commission, as we have emphasised that alongside enterprise protection, the tasks of Member State tax authorities must also be stated clearly, with rectifications where required, and specific time limits for forwarding, consideration, decision making and refund."
"This is the content of our amendments."
"We also specified separately that the three-month investigation period cannot re-commence even in the event of queries, requests for additional information or any other problems – as we have understood from the Commission’s proposal – as in our opinion the full procedure cannot exceed four months even in the presence of such problems."
"Our proposal aims at avoiding unnecessary delays in the refund period and keeping the moneys in treasury funds."
"Although for legal reasons we were unable to include this in our opinion as a formal amendment proposal, I still hope that as part of the package, as part of the overall OSS package, the speed of cooperation between authorities will increase, as this helps avoid cash-flow problems for small enterprises, problems related to VAT refund entitlement and the determination of ratios, and even abuses, because fraud and the formation of fictitious companies very often arise from an attempt to reclaim fictitious export VAT."
"I hope that in the course of the Council debate, the 10–40-day time limit for electronic data forwarding, given to tax authorities in the country of residence, may be shortened in respect of the upper limit of 40 days."
"However, the priority is to implement the package as soon as possible, and we hope that in a few years (we asked for four years in connection with the OSS) we will be able to evaluate implementation based on the Commission’s report."
"I am convinced that the procedure (and the screening of abuses) may be speeded up in the future by using some kind of a shared database – or by easier access to the databases of other Member States – but this will require the settling of a large number of legal, data protection and other issues, which should be looked into following the first evaluation."
"Therefore, at present, the most important thing is that this constructive proposal is put into effect as soon as possible, and that our enterprises may enjoy its benefits."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we wanted to take advantage of the two reports by our distinguished fellow Member, Mr Becsey, on the subject of VAT in order to table an oral question to this Assembly which, I hope, will be followed by the adoption of a resolution."
"As regards, in fact, the reduced VAT rate system in labour-intensive sectors, we are in an economic, social, political and legal situation that is unpleasant to say the least, if not downright complex."
"We are today faced with a system that has been extended twice."
"Thereafter, a proposal by the Commission dating from 2003 was submitted to us, of which the Members of our Parliament voted almost unanimously in favour on 4 December 2003 and which has since been blocked by the Council."
"Very often we are told that better regulation implies Parliament’s working more quickly, but I sometimes get the impression that we should also see how things take place from the Council’s perspective."
"We are here in the realm of unanimity and, while certain Member States will intervene strictly on the basis of national interests by exploiting VAT rates, they are blocking the extension of this system at the Council, a system that has proved its worth."
"In fact, this system enables us to sustain employment, to combat undeclared work and to organise the tax system more coherently at the level of the Member States."
"That is why our committee wanted to table this oral question, by means of which we fully support both the Commission’s initiative and the successive efforts of the Luxembourg and the UK Presidencies, both of which have put on the table a compromise proposal that is totally in keeping with the wishes expressed by this Parliament from 2003."
"Today we have our backs to the wall: this twice-extended system will expire at the end of the year and, in nine Member States, entire sectors still do not know, at this very moment, which tax system will be applied to them as from 1 January of next year."
"We are today on the eve of an ECOFIN Council at which, I hope, the Ministers for Economic Affairs and Finance will hear the very loud signal this Assembly wants to send out to them through this oral question, as well as through several written statements, which have been submitted at our Parliament’s Registry and signed by a large number of Members."
"The Luxembourg proposal, taken up by the UK Presidency, enables what was, until now, a simple experiment to be clarified, simplified, harmonised and brought into widespread use."
"For the construction sector and the home care services sector, it is primarily a matter of prolonging the reduced VAT rates."
"It is a matter of extending a more flexible mechanism and of making plans for this mechanism to be extended until 2015."
"It is a matter of coherently discarding what is included in the notorious Annex H. On the initiative of the UK Presidency, it is a matter of evaluating the entire mechanism every five years."
"It seems to me that we have here before us balanced proposals that will make it possible, I repeat, to sustain employment in labour-intensive sectors – that is where the coherence of the proposed fiscal mechanism comes in – to combat undeclared work and to contribute to what is in line to become the leitmotiv of this House – and, I hope, beyond this House, of the Council – namely, better regulation and the Lisbon objectives."
"Allow me once again to say to the Council, even though I see that it is not represented in this House this morning, how important it is to obtain the agreement of the Ministers of Economic Affairs and Finance."
"I believe that solidarity, which must also govern this College’s work should, at the very least, if the Luxembourg and UK proposal were sadly unable to obtain unanimous approval, lead to a further one-year extension of the system as it stands."
"This would be the ‘least worst’ solution."
". Mr President, before I start my introductory remarks I would like to offer my apologies to you and to the honourable Members for the delay."
"We had some traffic problems but now I am here and I will let you know the position of the Commission."
"I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Becsey, for his two reports, and to Ms Berès for the oral question on such an important issue which is very close to my heart."
"I will first comment on the proposal on the minimum standard VAT rate."
"I will continue with comments on the oral question and the motion for a resolution concerning the reduced VAT rate."
"Finally, I will comment briefly on the eighth VAT directive proposal, which is part of the one-stop-shop package on which an extended debate took place in this House back in September."
"The Commission thanks the European Parliament for the quick handling of the minimum standard VAT rate proposal and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Becsey, for his active and positive contribution."
"This proposal needs to be adopted as a matter of urgency as the present rules come to an end on 31 December 2005."
"The absence of a timely decision would imply a legal gap in EU legislation."
"The rules concerning the standard VAT rate currently in force combined with the transitional system mechanisms have functioned so far to an acceptable degree."
"It is therefore appropriate to maintain the current minimum standard rate at 15% for a further period of five years in order to cover the ongoing implementation of the strategy to simplify and modernise the current Community legislation on VAT."
"For your information, the proposal has received a positive reaction from the European Economic and Social Committee."
"The committee has acknowledged that in the current environment – i.e. the rule of unanimity – the Commission’s proposal is the best way forward."
"I would like to stress that, while I fully understand the concerns of the honourable Members regarding the absence of a decision in the Council only one month away from the expiry date for the reduced rates for labour-intensive services, I do not think that the current proposal can be used to solve this problem."
"Therefore I would very much urge honourable Members not to make a link between this dossier and the discussions on the scope of the reduced VAT rates which are currently being held in the Council on the basis of the Commission’s 2003 compromise proposal."
"I now come to the oral question and the motion for a resolution concerning the reduced VAT rates on labour-intensive services."
"I would like to thank you for putting this question to the Commission."
"I am conscious that this issue is of high concern to the public and to business."
"I am also very much concerned about this issue as the current regime to apply reduced VAT rates on labour-intensive services is due to expire at the end of this year."
"I very much appreciate the UK Presidency’s efforts to find a compromise on reduced VAT rates."
"This issue was discussed at the Ecofin Council on 8 November and will be discussed again on 6 December."
"The absence of a decision by the Council before the end of this year on the application of reduced rates to labour-intensive services would be a very bad outcome."
"Businesses are very concerned as they need legal certainty."
"I can assure you that the Commission will do its utmost to help the Presidency reach a conclusion on this matter."
"Without going into details about the Presidency’s compromise, I want to explain the difficulties that have arisen in previous debates on this issue."
"Some delegations reject any extension of Annex H as a matter of principle. I must say that I do not really understand that position."
"The reduced rates listed in Annex H are optional, so that, apart from a few categories in respect of which reduced rates are largely applied throughout Europe, there are already today huge disparities between Member States."
"If we take into account the numerous specific derogations granted to some Member States, these disparities become even bigger."
"Restaurant services are a very good example."
"Currently half of the Member States apply reduced rates to restaurant services by way of specific derogations and this has not given rise to any complaints or distortion of competition."
"Why not, therefore, give the opportunity to all Member States to apply a reduced rate in this sector if they wish to do so?"
"Some Member States press for more subsidiarity."
"The budgetary impact of applying additional reduced rates also comes into play."
"In my view only very few sectors are really relevant in this respect."
"In principle, only restaurants and construction services might have a significant potential budgetary impact."
"For instance, regarding the building sector the Council could explore criteria for restricting the scope of the reduced rates in order to limit the possible budgetary impact for example by limiting the reduced rate to buildings over a certain age."
"I want to underline the economic importance of the building sector."
"You know that the Commission has always been doubtful about the positive employment effects of introducing reduced VAT rates."
"This is still the case."
"Nevertheless, we have to realise that at least in this sector the VAT rate plays an important role."
"In contrast to the reduction of the rate, its increase by the reintroduction of the standard rate could well lead to an immediate increase in prices for consumers."
"This would have negative consequences for employment and could even encourage the black economy in the Member States concerned."
"I am aware that businesses, the Member States concerned and the European Parliament have great concerns in this regard."
"Therefore I consider that there are good political and economic arguments to allow at least the preservation of the status quo in this sector."
"However, there are some conditions."
"First, only locally delivered services should be added to the existing scope of the reduced VAT rate provisions."
"The extension of reduced rates to new categories of goods should be avoided, as the risk of creating distortions of competition is too high."
"Second, the mere prolongation of the existing experimental reduced rates for labour-intensive services is neither viable nor desirable."
"Although I was initially tempted by this solution, we have to recognise that it is an illusion to believe that a mere prolongation has more chance of being unanimously adopted by the Council than the compromise currently under discussion."
"Furthermore, this experiment has been limited to nine Member States and a mere prolongation would only prolong the unequal treatment of Member States."
"I have to stress that the Council has already had more than two years to reach a decision."
"It should not duck its responsibilities yet again."
"Third, the compromise must be fair in the sense that it should represent a step towards the equal treatment of all Member States."
"In my view, the UK Presidency proposal for an initial extension of the time-limited derogations for the new Member States to 2015 would precisely contribute to this objective."
"I know that some of the honourable Members might not entirely agree with this line, especially as regards the extension of the labour-intensive services."
"Let me, therefore, take this opportunity to remind them of the fact that when the Council agreed on the second extension of the reduced rates for labour-intensive services for two more years, the Commission considered that the same possibilities should be offered to the new Member States."
"At the time of the pre-accession negotiations, the possibility of applying reduced rates to labour-intensive services was not considered relevant since the experiment was due to end on 31 December 2003, i.e. before EU enlargement."
"Therefore, the extension of measures constituted a new element calling for a review of the situation."
"The situation is clearly not the same as it was in 2003 and it is therefore exceedingly unlikely that the Council will – as it did previously – unanimously request that the Commission propose an extension."
"In addition, a simple extension of the labour-intensive services experiment offers no solutions for the widespread demand to also include restaurant services in the scope of the reduced rates, because currently they are not in Annex K."
"In conclusion, I consider it to be imperative that the Council should now draw up the lines of a viable compromise with a view to a political decision in December during the last Ecofin meeting under the UK Presidency."
"However, the Commission is in the hands of the Council and we can do no more than help the Council as much as possible to reach an agreement."
"As the Commissioner responsible for taxation, I can assure you that the Commission is prepared to do its utmost and show the maximum flexibility during the Ecofin meeting on 6 December in order to help reach unanimous agreement on the basis of the UK compromise."
"Finally, I should like to comment briefly on the eighth directive proposal."
"On several occasions I have underlined that one of the ways of attaining the Lisbon Objectives is to reduce cross-border administrative burdens and compliance costs in order to facilitate Community-wide activities by businesses."
"Today it will be possible to take the next step towards this objective."
"The proposal which is tabled today is part of the larger package known as the one-stop-shop scheme."
"The other parts of the overall proposal – the simplification measures, whereby taxable persons can discharge their VAT obligations in the Member States of establishment, and the rules containing the exchange of information between Member States – were adopted by this Parliament in September."
"This part of the proposal aims at reforming the VAT refund procedure for traders who have to reclaim their VAT in a Member State in which they are not established."
"An entirely electronic procedure will replace the current burdensome paper-based eighth directive refund system."
"As a result of the new proposal, it will become possible to speed up the VAT refund procedure substantially."
"This will be of particular help for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In this respect I welcome the positive contribution of the rapporteur, although I cannot accept the proposed amendments."
"Most of the issues are actually already covered by the Commission’s proposal on the one-stop-shop package."
"I therefore invite you to support the original position of the Commission."
"Now I am eager to listen to your opinion on the three VAT dossiers on the agenda of this meeting and in my closing remarks I shall take a position on the amendments that have been tabled."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I am grateful to you, Commissioner, for giving us hope with your speech."
"I think that we can use all the optimism we can get in VAT legislation, because whilst everyone is full of better legislation and good governance, we notice the opposite is true in two of the three topics that are on the agenda."
"I welcome the simplification of the regulations on VAT refunds to those liable to pay tax who are based in a different Member State."
"Enterprises, including the smallest among them and also all SMEs, will now all be given the opportunity of actually claiming their money back within an acceptable period of time."
"Those of us who are members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats can only endorse this."
"There is also, however, the proposal to extend the threshold of the normal VAT rate."
"It is, of course, a good thing that this extension should be proposed, and we support it, but we do find it a bit dramatic to introduce a measure of this kind less than 30 days before the deadline arrives and the successor enters into effect."
"Anyway, everyone knows what is coming."
"A decision will be taken at a later date, after which everyone will be able to relax for another five years."
"Worse, though, are the difficulties – and I cannot describe them as anything else – surrounding Annex K and, indirectly, also Annex H to the sixth VAT Directive."
"The experiment involving the reduced VAT rate for labour-intensive services has been running for double the amount of time originally planned."
"The Council just cannot manage to make an assessment and take decisions."
"The sectors to which we, the Commission and Parliament, had, in 2003, held out the hope of a reduced VAT rate – the hotel and catering industry, the building industry, but also laundries and garden maintenance businesses – all these sectors remain wanting."
"The Council is not saying ‘yes’ and it is not saying ‘no’; the Council is taking no decisions and is absent from this Chamber."
"We are creating uncertainty, and uncertainty is detrimental to economic development."
"This, at a time when we are desperate for growth and more employment, is unacceptable."
"Commissioner, we are counting on your support in the debate with the Council."
"For the rest, we fully endorse the two Becsey reports and the resolution linked to the oral question."
". Mr President, it was I who applauded, and I did so because I wholeheartedly agreed with what Mrs Thyssen said."
"First of all, let me pay tribute to the rapporteur, Mr Becsey, who has fought his way through this difficult subject matter and who has now become our VAT expert in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"We endorse his report and also what others have said about the VAT refund."
"It really is vital that this should be introduced more quickly and in a simpler way for companies that operate transnationally; otherwise the internal market in Europe is a farce."
"The other report is to do with the oral question that we have tabled and the deadlines within which certain matters must be dealt with."
"I completely agree with Mrs Thyssen when she says that it is ridiculous that now, with only one month still to go, there is still uncertainty, particularly in the labour-intensive services sectors, who still do not know where they stand."
"The Commissioner is beyond reproach in this; it is the Council that is the legal body with responsibility for this and it cannot manage to lay down a regulation."
"I stand here as one who speaks up for those labour-intensive services."
"Ideally, I would like to see them incorporated in Annex H, namely in the structural solution."
"I hope that our appeal here in this House will, in any event, be the last nudge needed to secure an agreement, and that time will be found for this to be debated next year."
"I, for one, am in favour of having this discussion on a much broader footing."
"I think that the whole debate about the shift from indirect to direct taxation, something which your Prime Minister, Mr Verhofstadt, has once again made very explicit reference, has everything to do with the way in which we deal with those VAT rates in a structural manner."
"That is why I join Mr Becsey in saying that I am not in favour of formulating a maximum rate in this interim period and that I am all for making the possibility of using those low rates structural."
"If you want to bring about a shift from direct to indirect taxation, which can indeed be very advantageous, you also need to differentiate the rates."
"Low rates apply on social grounds, employment grounds, and in order to regulate and prevent moonlighting."
"Those are all elements that should be factored in."
"Higher rates should, perhaps, apply to certain luxury or environmentally-polluting factors."
"I think that this structural discussion should really be held next year, and I hope that this Commissioner can give the initial impetus for this."
"I hope that the Member States will not each time hide behind the unanimity rule and the option they have to put up all kinds of blockades and to conclude underhand deals."
"I follow Mrs Berès in what she said earlier when I say that I do not consider this to be good governance or good legislation."
". I would also like to express my gratitude to my colleague Mr Becsey for his work in connection with the value-added tax issue and the related documents."
"Today we are discussing a tax with pan-European significance."
"Although the European Union does not share a common fiscal policy, the value-added tax is a key source of funding for the European Union’s budget."
"It was as early as 1977, upon adoption of the sixth value-added tax directive, that attempts were made to create, in a general sense, a common value-added tax base in order to ensure the stability of payments into the European Union’s budget."
"The work in this area has yielded significant results; however, the current system of VAT rates still foresees exceptions in the form of considerably lower VAT rates applied to certain goods and services."
"Moreover, the issue is not only of the specific products subject to these VAT rates in different Member States but also the varying terms of validity of these exceptions."
"Such a complicated system poses problems of forecasting long-term budget flows and also creates potentially different conditions under which Members States would apply the provisions of the VAT directive."
"Therefore, I would like to propose and support those proposals, that the European Commission review and draft a common list of goods and services that would be subject to lower rates; in addition, the Commission should evaluate the macroeconomic impact on and experiences of different countries in order to ensure that the list is valid in the long term rather than being temporary, unless otherwise specified by mutual agreement."
"The introduction of a common list would help avoid the flawed practice on the part of some countries of applying lower rates as exceptions, while other countries cannot apply such rates."
"A common list would also undoubtedly ensure the stability of inflows into the European Union’s budget, as it would facilitate the forecasting of long-term financial flows."
". Mr President, on the subject of reduced rates of VAT for labour-intensive services, it is almost a year since Parliament approved a report, for which I was rapporteur, that overwhelmingly supported the principle that all Member States should have the right to implement the scheme."
"It is disappointing to see that no progress has been made in the past year."
"I stated at the time that we should, of course, have equality amongst the Member States, but also that we should be pressing the Council to make this principle a permanent feature of our hopes of achieving the Lisbon Strategy."
"I accept that it can be difficult to quantify the positive benefits in terms of job creation, but I am also convinced that suddenly reapplying VAT to labour-intensive services will have a negative impact."
"I know from personal experience in a small business in the construction sector that having to charge VAT at the full rate has an impact on consumer choice."
"In a significant number of cases consumers choose to go where VAT is not applied."
"This resolution, which all the groups have supported and which will be voted on today, is reasonable."
"This is the least we can expect from the Council if we are not to see a sudden shock being triggered by the end of this scheme, in which I would hope Member States can be encouraged to participate more fully so that we can build up data on the beneficial impacts, which I am sure can be quantified."
". – Mr President, indirect taxation is a basic lever for fleecing grass-roots income and is therefore anti-grass roots."
"Constant tax exemptions for big business and its profits, on the pretext of increasing investments, are accompanied by a simultaneous increase in indirect taxes and a reduction in grass-roots income."
"That is why we are expressing our opposition to all forms of indirect taxation and, in particular, to the value added tax system as it operates today."
"Just recently in my country, the Greek Government, implementing faithfully the dictats of the Stability Pact, increased VAT by one percentage point."
"At the same time, some people are saying that, under pressure from the Commission, there may be a further increase."
"Of course, for the profits of companies a tax cut of 10 percentage points has been promoted."
"It is ironic, but we may ultimately arrive at the paradoxical position of being in favour of a ceiling of 25% on VAT, because then we can be sure that it will not go up any further."
"The rates of 15 to 25%, which allow no distinction between immediate necessities and luxuries, the uniform rates which require the poor worker and the rich businessman to pay the same excise and tax toothpaste at the same rate as a yacht, are often higher than the rates at which big business is taxed directly."
"There are even proposals to abolish graduated direct taxes and create a standard rate which will be the same rate as for indirect taxes."
"The fact that the experimental directive allowing a lower rate of VAT for labour-intensive services cannot be applied generally is typical of the uniform strategy of big business and of capitalistic infighting."
"The period of application of this directive, which allows the Member States to apply reduced VAT rates to certain activities so that the corresponding jobs can at the same time be maintained, has been extended twice."
"It has not been possible so far to apply it generally to all the Member States, which is precisely why it is representative of the disagreements."
"We are fighting together with the workers for the protection of grass-roots income, for the abolition of indirect taxes and the application of a progressive income and capital tax policy in order to stop the workers, pensioners, unemployed and grass-roots classes in general from picking up the tab and to stop taxes from being one of the tools for redistributing the workers' income for the benefit of big business."
". Mr President, Mr Becsey’s report on the minimum standard rate states that the European Parliament’s ultimate goal is to contribute to boosting economic productivity and growth rates in the EU."
"Whilst these are noble sentiments, I hope you will allow me to offer a few words of general advice."
"The current growth projection in 2006 for the eurozone is estimated by the IMF at 1.8%, with the largest economies being the worst performers."
"This weak growth is far from sufficient to sustain the EU’s social programme."
"The Commission suggests that a cut in income tax of 1% of GDP would produce a greater than proportionate rise in growth."
"A harmonised VAT scheme, therefore, should be used to shift from direct to indirect taxation."
"Unfortunately, there is no undisputed evidence that this growth would occur."
"Moreover, this shift implies a redistribution from the poor to the rich, like the common agricultural policy, which rewards landowners rather than farmers."
"Is this really what we want?"
"I should like to suggest that instead of trying to harmonise taxation, our partners in the Commission should rather leave it alone."
"Do they not realise that their obsessive pursuit of the illusive level playing field and their inward-looking regulation-led policies are damaging growth rather than stimulating it?"
"The working time directive, the temporary workers directive, the common agricultural policy: are all examples of a European Union that refuses to wake up to the reality of global markets, free trade and efficiency, but is instead intent on pursuing an outdated social model, which has no place in the global economy."
"Harmonisation should be the last thing on the agenda of any national government that wishes to see its country’s economic growth rise."
"In contrast, a dose of genuine deregulation would bring wondrous results."
"I would remind Mr Whittaker that worldwide surveys indicate that Europe is the most attractive region in the world as a whole."
"Most of the world’s people would rather live in Europe, even preferring it to America."
"It follows that the European system cannot be that bad!"
"Mr President, your use of your leadership position to deliver yourself of political statements can be said to be an image issue, but these things, technical though they may sound, do touch upon the fundamentals of our life as a Community."
"It is also always the case that issues of VAT have to do with justice."
"It cannot fail to be noted that this European Union of ours is resorting, in its weakness – for our organisational teeth no longer bite – to the artificial aid provided by VAT in order to be able to build up a certain amount of tax revenue worthy of the name."
"This is a very unfair way of going about things, since, as we know, VAT very often hits the wrong people."
"There are two Austrians who might be able to give you an example of how to do things."
"With one of them – Bruno Kreisky – you will already be familiar, whilst you probably have yet to become acquainted with the other, Karl-Heinz Grasser."
"It was Kreisky who, all those years ago, saw very clearly that we would get nowhere with approaches of this kind."
"Instead, we must focus our efforts – above all with regard to VAT rates – on the VAT applied in areas where we can get back some of what we lose elsewhere, for example the things that the rich really like: luxury limousines, yachts and second homes."
"The aim of the amendment is to put a stop to such things, and I regard this as wrong-headed. Karl-Heinz Grasser is trying, in Austria at least – and in this I think he is exemplary – to prevent companies operating at an international level from shifting their input tax around without ever actually having to hand over any VAT."
"One opportunity for the next Council presidency might be to move forward, at least on the European level, with regard to the shutting-off of VAT loopholes."
"Mr President, most of the previous speakers have demonstrated that the way this matter is being handled is unprofessional, betrays an irresponsible attitude towards market participants – both businesses and their customers – and makes for more uncertainty than clarity."
"There does not appear, to my mind, to be any security to plan ahead, nor do either the Council or the Commission appear to have done enough of their homework."
"Had they done so, there would not be in the timetable such a mishmash of reports, deferments and extensions of provisional arrangements, without any real solution being found."
"In German, the word has a dual meaning: it is associated not only with taxation but also with steering."
"Taxes steer."
"Taxation policy is a political instrument for steering the economy, and if there is not greater clarity about it at European level, if we are not given more powers to deal with it, if there is no wide-ranging debate about it, if we are not given a uniform basis of assessment for the taxation of businesses, if we do not close the tax loopholes, if there are no uniform tax arrangements for occupational pension schemes – then we will be unable to achieve many of our policy objectives for growth and employment, for we will not be in possession of the wherewithal to do so."
"I therefore call for a comprehensive debate on taxation – one, moreover, that is not limited to individual aspects of the subject."
"What I advocate is a long-term approach to taxation, something that is agreed between the Member States rather than put together at three minutes to twelve, is eventually extended and therefore fails to achieve any solution."
"Both examples show us that the outcome of what we are debating now will be no more than a provisional arrangement that will get us no further forward."
"Mr President, we are currently faced with a situation in which VAT rates vary widely within the European Union."
"The Member States have different standard rates, different reduced rates and different rules for applying these rates."
"The end result of all this is price distortion within the European Union."
"These different rates also have a negative impact on resource allocation and, in the long run, reduce the EU’s growth potential."
"At the same time, however, many doubts have been raised over whether VAT rates need to be harmonised, and indeed we have heard such sentiments voiced today in this Chamber."
"As I see it, the time has come for us to hold a serious and comprehensive debate on the tax system in the European Union."
"I would suggest to the Commission that it should undertake a detailed study of the impact, whether positive or possibly negative, of a gradual EU-wide approximation of VAT rates and their application."
"We need sound analytical data as a basis for serious consideration of this matter."
"Moving on to reduced VAT rates for labour-intensive services, I should like to reiterate the point that these rates were introduced six years ago on an experimental basis."
"I am genuinely astonished that the Member States have not yet been able to assess the results of this experiment."
"The current state of affairs leads to blatant discrimination against the new Member States in this field, and it must not be allowed to continue."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is – as the previous speaker, Mr Rosati, said – pretty astonishing and disappointing that we should, four weeks before the end of the year, be debating something that actually should have been sorted out ages ago."
"The fact is that the special rules introduced in 1999 – for three years in the first instance – on reduced rates of VAT applied only to a few Member States and to certain labour-intensive services."
"The original timeframe was, following its expiry, extended repeatedly, indicating that it was not possible even in the past to come up with a definitive solution."
"Failing another decision, this rule will cease to apply at the end of this year."
"What we do know is that the expectations raised by the introduction of the special rules were met – if at all – only in part."
"It was in 2003 that the Commission established that the reduced rates of VAT were not being reflected in lower prices and that they had practically no perceptible influence on the employment situation."
"It was this that led my group to make its support for the joint, all-party, motion for a resolution dependent on the fulfilment of several conditions."
"The first of these was that the extension should be a one-off event, effective only until the end of the next year."
"Secondly, there was the condition that the Commission should initiate a comprehensive study of the measure’s effectiveness."
"Thirdly, after the end of the extension period, that is to say, with effect from the end of next year, the only areas to benefit from the reduced VAT rate would be those where the reduction had had a demonstrably positive effect on prices and employment."
"In those, then, the special arrangement would become permanent, and other areas, those in which it had proved ineffective, would be excluded from it once and for all."
"New Member States would also be allowed to apply the reduced rate so that there would be no distortions of competition in the EU."
"We demand a split vote on paragraph 2 of the joint motion for a resolution, as the rules have been in force for some considerable time, and the report referred to is, in our view, sufficiently detailed and explicit."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, who would dare announce today the slashing of 170 000 jobs in the countries long established in our Union?."
"Is this madness?"
"An aberration?"
"No, this is simply what is taking place. In actual fact, if the ECOFIN Council on 6 December does not extend the reduced VAT rate, this catastrophic situation will begin in 2006."
"The implementation in 1999 of the experiment of reduced VAT rates for labour-intensive services has proved its effectiveness."
"It has created jobs."
"In France, for example, the BTP (public buildings and works sector) estimates that 60 000 long-term jobs have been created."
"The experiment has also contributed to combating illegal work."
"Still on the subject of France, the number of offences committed in the construction sector has been halved."
"Furthermore, this measure is beneficial in combating global warming."
"Applying reduced VAT rates in the context of energy saving work would benefit consumers and businesses alike and represents a potential source of jobs that cannot be relocated."
"What more convincing arguments could the Council therefore present in favour of rejecting the extension of reduced VAT rates?"
"In France, ladies and gentlemen, the people have already expressed their anger towards a Europe that no longer meets their expectations."
"We therefore genuinely await positive signals from the Council in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 4 May, only a few days before the referendum on the European Constitution, the EU Presidency announced an imminent agreement on reduced VAT rates for the catering sector in France, rates that would decrease from 19.6% to 5.5%."
"In order to make people vote in favour of the Constitution, the French Government had boldly to confirm this promise throughout the entire campaign, a long-standing promise, in reality, since it had already featured in the programme of the Presidential candidate, Mr Chirac, in 2002, and even in 1995."
"Likewise, in its draft finance act for 2006, the French Government, gambling on an agreement at EU level, announced and provided for a one-year renewal of the reduced VAT rate for renovation work."
"It is clear that this two-faced promise fuels a permanent sense of uncertainty with regard to taxation, unsettling consumers and, above all, the professionals of the sectors concerned."
"Now that our people have rejected the superstate, has the time therefore not come to tell Europeans the truth?"
"Seeking to do everything and anything with 25 Member States, no matter what the cost, has crippling effects."
"Has the time not come to envisage another kind of Europe: a ‘Variable-geometry’ and ‘Variable-geography’ Europe?"
"Mr President, I entirely agree with Mr Becsey’s speech, and I will therefore focus entirely on the reduced rate of value added tax applied to highly labour-intensive services."
"All the opinion polls carried out in Europe indicate that the Europeans have two concerns: finding work and being certain that there will be resources to maintain the Welfare State."
"A lot has been written with a view to reassuring the citizens in this regard, but little has been done. Plenty of words and no action."
"Probably one of the few concrete initiatives to have been taken in this area has been the establishment of a reduced value added tax on services that create employment, services that promote the contracting of workers, in particular the least qualified."
"A reduced VAT rate that also brings to the surface resources which were previously submerged, and which can be used to fund future pensions."
"And a reduced VAT on work that enables us to rebalance the unstable relationship between taxes on capital and taxes on work."
"The situation at the moment is that this experiment, which began in 2000, may come to an end unless it is extended."
"And the Council still has no opinion; the Council does not know and has no reply."
"I would like to say to the Commissioner that he can do much more than he has said in his speech."
"The Commissioner can put pressure on the Council: he can tell it that it is not a good idea to end this experiment just when new States are being incorporated, States in which the problems we have been resolving — the lack of jobs, the black economy — are more pressing than in the old States; that it is not a good idea to end an experiment, and thereby risk an increase in prices and a reduction in employment; that it is not a good idea to end this experiment just when we are about to discuss the Directive on services, which has created such concern in terms of employment in the Member States, and the Commissioner can tell it that this Parliament is unanimous and that this Parliament does not like to be treated as a joke, especially when the Council is not offering any well-founded opinion in return."
"Mr President, thank you Mr President."
"I have the impression that here we are preaching to the converted for the simple reason that the Council is not here and the Commissioner is agreeing with the strong position which we are taking, even though he is saying that he does not think that the extension of the experiment is a good enough solution."
"I think we should, at this moment, at the beginning of December, also consider that solution."
"There is no doubt that the Council should take note of our position which is strongly in favour of the renewal of this facility which is strongly labour intensive and which seemed to be an experiment which succeeded and which created new jobs."
"Apart from this, this experiment should also be widened and should be given as a possibility to new Member States."
"The irony of all this is that while here we are speaking about having lower rates, to experiment with these low rates, there are some governments in other countries, including that of my country, Malta, which, since joining the European Union not only did not experiment with low tax rates, but increased VAT from fifteen to eighteen percent."
"I also believe that the range of services should be widened and should apply also for other services such as environmental services and restaurants."
"This experiment has proved successful, and in order to ensure our credibility with the people who elected us and whom we represent, the Commission and the Council should place greater value on one of the few experiments that have been truly successful."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I add my voice to those of my fellow Members, at the risk of repeating the same arguments and opinions."
"The experiment of reduced VAT rates has been carried out in some Member States, but unfortunately for all of those countries, it has been carried out at a time when the European economy has not been particularly impressive, especially in many of the largest Member States."
"In labour-intensive sectors, this experiment has, in fact, made an even greater contribution than could have been envisaged, in so far as it has sustained significant employment levels."
"Among other things, another argument in favour of continuing this experiment is the fact that Europe’s overall economic situation is changing slightly, if only very weakly at the moment, meaning that an end to the experiment would have disastrous effects."
"Secondly, the experiment has been positive inasmuch as it has brought about changes of an all but structural nature in some countries in the space of six years."
"In my country, Italy, for instance, the experiment of reduced VAT rates has coincided with a measure providing incentives for building renovation via income tax – something that has met with enormous success."
"It is a genuine success because it has both enabled a large part of Italy’s building heritage to be renovated quickly and improved the country’s economic and financial situation."
"From a financial point of view, the ‘income tax-reduced VAT’ formula has exposed an enormous amount of undeclared work – which can be taxed for the benefit of the country itself – whereas, from an economic point of view, this formula has probably been the most important ingredient in sustaining the country’s overall demand at a time when, in Italy, consumption is slack, productive investment is down and exports are falling."
"Among the very many thoughts expressed, I add my own two in favour of the experiment."
"I therefore hope that, with the support of the Commission too, the Council will at last listen to the voice of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, while I support the report’s conclusions with regard to the minimum standard VAT rate, it is my duty to share a few problems I have with some of our rapporteur’s arguments, and I am pleased to have the support of the great majority of my group in this matter."
"After much thought, the idea of proposing a maximum 25% for the standard VAT rate seems wise to me."
"We would therefore have a kind of corridor between 15% and 25%, somewhat like the currency snake in its day."
"Let us recall that the starting point in 1992 was indeed one of moving in the direction of converged VAT rates in the context of the single market."
"This convergence did not actually take place, but Parliament’s proposal to set a maximum rate of 25% could decisively encourage us to move in that direction and thus prevent too great an imbalance between rates, something that is disadvantageous."
"That is why I support this proposal, which has been adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and endorsed on two occasions by the European Commission."
"I will not disguise my reservations, either, regarding the general idea, outlined by the rapporteur in his explanatory statement, to fundamentally restructure the tax systems by increasing indirect tax at the expense of direct tax."
"For the time being, I can see many more disadvantages than advantages to doing this: the danger of stimulating even more the inflationary pressures that are already too much in evidence; the danger of taking the momentum out of an often lifeless internal demand; and the problem in terms of the social equity of such restructuring."
"In short, let us be very careful before embarking on such paths."
"Allow me, finally, to say something about reduced VAT rates in relation to labour-intensive activities, among other areas."
"The non-renewal of this measure, which has positive effects on employment, whatever Mr Klinz’s and others’ views on the matter, would not only be regrettable, as you said, Commissioner, but would also be a real catastrophe for all of the sectors concerned."
"I support Mrs Bérès, who very competently explained our concerns in order to press the Council, when it convenes for the last-chance meeting on 6 December, to reach a solution on the basis of the Luxembourg proposal, which has been taken up and enhanced by the UK Presidency."
"I therefore hope that our resolution on this matter will at last make an impression on the Council, which still has no representatives in this Chamber."
"With things as they stand, Mr President, I believe that it should be possible for the Member States to have a great deal more scope to determine which sectors will benefit from a reduced rate, and the cause of the French catering workers, to give just this one example, seems, in my opinion, to be one of the most worthy."
"I therefore send out an appeal for the new German Government to demonstrate greater flexibility."
"Mr President, I wish particularly to emphasise the need to reimburse non-profit organisations or charities for the VAT they pay."
"I would ask Commissioner Kovács to reiterate his support for this idea, which he expressed at a conference of the European Charities Committee on VAT here in Brussels two months ago."
"Charities like the Home Farm Trust – which supports 900 people with learning disabilities and has shops in Braintree, Colchester, Newmarket, Saffron Walden and Sudbury in my own constituency – cannot recover huge sums of money as they do not charge VAT, and provide their services heavily subsidised or for free."
"Studies in Ireland and Denmark, as well as the UK, show that this eats up some 4% of charities’ total expenditure."
"Given that charities almost invariably provide services at a local level, they are a prime case for subsidiarity and national decision-making on the VAT rates they pay."
"This principle has already been accepted by the European Parliament in the Randzio-Plath report, and I call for the Commission’s support in the decisions to be taken before the end of this year."
"Without it charities will lose millions of euros each year."
"Mr President, I welcome this package of proposals from the Commission, particularly in the context of achieving a reduction in the administrative burden for businesses, especially the small and medium-sized enterprises, which supply goods and services to other Member States."
"Streamlining VAT procedures for these businesses will enhance efficiency and encourage increased activity within the internal market, feeding to the Lisbon Agenda, which is supposed to be the focus and aim for all of us at the moment."
"The one-stop-shop schemes, which are at the heart of the package, will ultimately enable new rules for cross-border businesses and business-to-consumer services to be introduced."
"This will have particular benefits in my own country for Irish companies that deliver services electronically over the internet to consumers in other Member States."
"The current minimum standard rate of VAT fixed at 15% is due to end at the end of this year."
"The Commission is proposing to extend it to 2010."
"I support that generally and, in particular, I support the decision of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to have an impact analysis on implicit and standard rates of VAT in the Member States, which should also consider allowing all Member States the same opportunity to apply reduced rates on certain goods and services."
"We need to revisit the issue of special exemptions on reduced rates."
"My own country never applied for reduced rates."
"I think there are only nine Member States – if my facts are correct – that have the benefit of this."
"We need to do something here."
"Restaurants, catering and hospitality services need particular attention in all Member States."
"In terms of jobs and services, these are areas which could really ignite economies throughout Europe at the moment, given that tourism is one of the growing areas."
"Currently, VAT rates on food in some Member States are prohibitive and need to be looked at urgently."
"I note that the report on the one-stop-shops and the refund of VAT generally was only referred to Parliament because of a change to the legal basis."
"I have ongoing concerns about the number of times issues around a legal basis arise in this Parliament."
"These are consultative-only as far as Parliament is concerned."
"However, what is happening with legal bases?"
"What is happening in terms of Commission proposals on different legal bases and the Council subsequently changing or amending them or, in many cases, introducing a dual legal base?"
"We need certainty in our law."
"Uncertain law is bad law."
"We need to have an open debate on the legal basis issue in this House urgently."
". Mr President, I once again express my thanks to Parliament for rapidly examining the proposal on the minimum level for the standard rate – considering that the current rules come to an end on 31 December 2005 – and for the positive contribution by the rapporteur."
"I understand the concerns of the honourable Members that we are running out of time, but wish to remind you that the Commission tabled its proposal as early as 2003, and it is the Council that has been unable to come to a unanimous decision."
"I shall briefly comment on some of the amendments."
"The first amendment concerns a restriction on the level of the standard rate by setting a maximum level of 25% to prevent growing divergence in the standard rates of VAT applied by the Member States."
"This would require a new proposal from the Commission, thus preventing the adoption on time of a minimum rate to be applied as from 1 January 2006."
"Moreover, given past experience it has no chance of being unanimously adopted by the Council."
"The second amendment aims at allowing more flexibility in VAT provisions in order to enable Member States to react to the changing economic situation."
"This is not in line with the first amendment, which tries precisely to prevent such flexibility as regards the standard rate."
"Generally speaking, this proposal is not yet the appropriate vehicle for carrying out a general assessment of the macro-economic impacts of VAT rates and the associated revenue and budgetary implications for the EU Member States."
"I am pleased that part of the one-stop-shop package concerning the VAT refund scheme has the support of the honourable Members."
"Unfortunately the Commission cannot accept the proposed amendments, for the following reasons."
"Amendments 1 and 2 relate to the regulation and cooperation arrangements for the refund procedure, which forms another part of the one-stop-shop proposal."
"Amendment 3 seeks to extend the deadline, which I believe is not necessary."
"Amendment 4 is not workable as, on the one hand, a strict deadline of four months for refunds would be imposed on the Member States, but on the other hand, there would be no deadline for a taxable person to hand in the requested additional information."
"The amendment is, furthermore, in contradiction with the second subparagraph of the same article, which mentions that a new period of three months starts to run as from the moment the additional information is received from the taxable person."
"I am convinced that the positive opinion of Parliament will contribute to a timely decision in the Council on the standard rate proposal, and will facilitate the discussion on the one-stop-shop proposals with a view to their adoption under the Austrian Presidency."
"Concerning labour-intensive services, I have listened carefully to all the contributions and I can only remind you that the Commission has already taken the necessary steps to support their inclusion in the scope of reduced rates as defined by Annex H. However, the current discussions in the Council are not easy."
"I extensively explained in my introduction why I consider that an extension of the experimental arrangements is not really a viable way forward."
"Moreover, we need to be very cautious, since a unanimous agreement in the Council on such an extension would seem as hard to achieve as a genuine agreement on the scope of the reduced rate as such."
"I support the consensus expressed in Parliament’s resolution."
"This is a very important signal to the Council of the need to reach an agreement that takes into account the interests of the European Union as a whole, as well as those of all the Member States."
"I have received one motion for a resolution(1), tabled pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11 a.m."
"Mr Chirac deliberately lied to French catering workers by making them believe that it was possible for him to reduce the VAT on their work without asking for Brussels’ permission."
"It is not certain whether the Council will reach an agreement before the end of the year on the recasting of the VAT Directive, and particularly on the application of a reduced rate for labour-intensive services."
"If the authorisation of these reduced rates is not extended in one way or another on 1 January 2006, then entire sectors, with construction foremost among them, will feel the full force of the consequences."
"Why have we ended up here?"
"In terms of the labour-intensive services, this is a ploy to pressurise the Council into adopting a comprehensive reform of the VAT Directive."
"In terms of the catering sector, the Annexes of the directive must be changed."
"Germany is opposed to this."
"It does not want to see similar demands sprouting up on its soil at a time when it plans to increase its indirect tax by 20%."
"Is Germany wrong?"
"No."
"These problems would not exist if the Member States had held on to their fiscal sovereignty and were able to use it to stimulate employment."
"The real mistake and the real errors lie with those who sought to strip the Member States of their sovereign powers."
"The European Union has made employment its priority and yet it is unable to make a decision regarding the application of the reduced VAT rate in labour-intensive sectors."
"As a result of the Council continually blocking this decision, it is impossible today to modify in the Member States the list of sectors able to benefit from the reduced rate."
"Rushing to renew a Council decision year after year is not a responsible way of approaching matters."
"The legal and economic uncertainty hanging over these sectors of activity is no longer acceptable."
"In the buildings and public works sector, the reduced rate applied to renovation works has enabled thousands of small businesses, which are most affected by this measure, to increase their activity and to recruit workers."
"In the home care services sector, this reduced rate has made it possible to reduce the amount of illegal work and to improve recruitment conditions."
"As regards the catering sector, which is an important source of jobs in Europe, there is no doubt that the application of the reduced VAT rate will produce the same advantageous effects in the Member States seeking to apply this measure."
"I therefore call on the Council to assume its responsibilities and to reach an agreement that makes it possible to free the potential for job creation in labour-intensive sectors."
"The next item is the Commission statement on developments in Slovakia regarding police forces."
". Mr President, the Commission is well aware of the concerns raised by honourable Members in relation to the Slovak police force."
"Given the complexity and sensitivity of the matter and the time needed for the Commission to take a position, further time is required to analyse the issue and acquire objective and impartial information."
"The Commission services responsible have been in contact with the Permanent Representation of the Slovak Republic here in Brussels and they are seeking the required information."
"In addition, the Commission was informed extensively on the matter by the European Confederation of Police."
"I regret that we cannot give you a more complete answer at this stage."
"The Commission is doing all it possibly can to reach conclusions on this matter as soon as possible and it will promptly report to you on its findings."
"The Commission would therefore be ready to reply to the oral question at a subsequent part-session, should Parliament decide to add it to its agenda."
"Discrediting one’s own country in pursuit of one’s political goals."
"That is how we might characterise the intervention of Mrs Beňová and her proposal to place a discussion on the situation in the Slovak police force on the agenda."
"Political manoeuvring of union bosses in the police force has nothing to do with the protection of working conditions and human rights."
"Their lies, half-truths and suppression of the facts regarding the salaries that, by the way, were raised two weeks prior to the meeting in question had the aim of manipulating decent police officers and undermining the effectiveness of the police, thereby depriving citizens of their right to protection and security."
"The prospect of the Slovak Government caving in to union bosses dangerously draws the police into the political strife."
"The political shenanigans of union bosses must not detract from the excellent results achieved by the police in the fight against organised crime and corruption in Slovakia."
"The slogans put up at the most recent meeting, such as ‘If the government will not pay the police, the mafia will be happy to’. go beyond all the accepted principles of independent trade union activity."
"The assembly right of the police has never been curtailed or questioned, as proven by the rally scheduled for next Saturday."
"Neither the European Parliament nor other institutions of the European Union should allow themselves to be drawn into these unsavoury political manoeuvrings, which have been orchestrated with the aim of discrediting the achievements of the governing coalition in Slovakia."
"Commissioner, your response has disappointed rather than surprised me."
"I will continue to insist that the Commission pursue this matter very closely."
"I can make no further comment on what you have told us, since you have in fact told us nothing."
"Please do not take this as a personal attack, as it is intended rather as an attack on the content of the material submitted by the Commission."
"My colleague Mr Hudacký, who like myself is from Slovakia, spoke of how a political squabble has been escalated to the Chamber of the European Parliament."
"I would like to state categorically that what happened at the Interior Ministry has been roundly condemned even by the deputy chairman of the Committee for Defence and Security, who is a member of the governing coalition, from the party of Premier Dzurinda."
"This indicates that the affair cannot be dismissed as an internal political squabble."
"It is now a question for the European Commission to state whether it is acceptable to suppress the rights of police officers in Slovakia."
"For, a police officer is an EU citizen and an employee just as any other EU citizen or employee."
"We have placed two important questions before the Commission."
"These questions are all the more important for us because there may have been a breach of the European Human Rights Convention and of the Code of Police Ethics of the Council of Europe."
"We believe that the European Commission has a duty to give its opinion on whether or not the rights of citizens of an EU Member State have been breached."
"Parliament yesterday allowed this question to be referred to the Commission, thereby giving a very strong signal that it does not agree with the use of such practices by any EU Member State."
"Therefore, Commissioner, I ask once again that this matter not be sidelined and that we return to it at the next sitting of Parliament, and that you inform the MEPs about the opinion of the Commission."
". Mr President, Commissioner Kovács, my group – the Greens – was in favour of us having this debate today."
"We take this line because of information received from Slovakia, in particular from the ‘European Confederation of Police’, which has been in our hands since June."
"It is because we are deeply concerned about something that we do not regard as an internal matter for Slovakia that we urge you to examine these accusations as soon as possible."
"Making Slovak police subject to military jurisdiction quite self-evidently goes against what has been laid down by the Council of Europe, not to mention police ethics."
"Treating police and soldiers as one and the same is in breach of the Geneva Convention and the United Nations Convention."
"Civilian status for the police is one of the things democracy has achieved in Europe; it is something we have fought for, particularly in the Balkan countries, where police were involved in military actions during the ethnic conflicts."
"If the reports we have received are to be believed, we have to require the Slovak Government – and the country’s parliament as well – to reverse this misguided decision, which constitutes a reversion to an era and a type of politics that is not compatible with European democratic principles, and to return to the democratic community."
"Police officers have a right to demonstrate too!"
"Their freedom to do so is emblematic of the freedom of our society and of democracy."
"It is for that reason that we ask the Commission to examine these accusations with the minimum possible delay and to state its position on them."
". Mr President, this is a two-spheres issue."
"It appears that, in Slovakia, the police were returned to military jurisdiction, which amounts to remilitarisation and is not acceptable."
"The police and the armed forces are, to put it quite simply, two different pairs of boots."
"It has to be said, though, that it is precisely this sort of confusion between the civilian and military spheres that is characteristic of the European Union when it deploys the military or the police abroad."
"The forthcoming Austrian presidency has gone so far as to define this as one of its priorities."
"Secondly, there is also, in this context, the issue of the limitation of police officers’ trade union rights, which is not acceptable either."
"This House always makes a big thing of the violation of human rights in countries outside the European Union, but it also needs to call by their proper name manifest infringements of human rights within the European Union, and this is where your statement, Commissioner, did not go far enough: there is room for improvements here, and it is in this area that you need to make them; it is about this that you need to provide more information."
"Nor should we be reticent about highlighting human rights abuses in other countries;"
"I will give you one example from Germany, for there, too, people are currently being excluded from certain jobs and there is excessive police violence and this needs to be said openly in this House."
"I have been following the recent activities of the Slovak Interior Minister, Mr Palko, with great concern and disquiet."
"These activities directly undermine the basic principles of democracy and civic freedoms in Slovakia."
"The Interior Minister has interfered and continues to interfere with a legitimate trade union protest by Slovak police officers."
"By dismissing the chairman of the Police Federation and demoting him to the rank of ordinary police officer, he has interfered not only with personal rights of a police representative, but has thereby threatened the constitutionally guaranteed rights of citizens, citizens’ associations and trade unions to freely express their opinions."
"Our People’s Party – HZDS perceives Minister Palko’s threats of imposing disciplinary measures against the protesting police officers as a preposterous manifestation of the arrogance of power."
"Esteemed colleagues, Mr Palko is a senior representative of a political party belonging to the European People's Party."
"I would therefore urge the leadership of this group not to stick its head in the sand, but to investigate the matter closely."
"On behalf of independent members of People’s Party – HZDS in Slovakia, I express our support for the call made by the European confederation of police EUROCOP to change the system of management of police forces in Slovakia, and convey our request that the matter be investigated by the European Commission."
"Our discussions today about the issue and expressions of support for protesting policemen are part of the opposition’s election campaign and of a smear campaign against a successful Slovak Government minister."
"It is not true that at time of war policemen will be tried in the same way as soldiers."
"It is not true that from 2006 Slovak police will be overseen by the military."
"It is not true that policemen will be deprived of their rights, because military tribunals will conduct proceedings under the civilian legislation and, at time of war, policemen will be tried in the same way as ordinary citizens."
"The Slovak police work under the same set of rules as the gendarmerie in France and carabinieri in Italy."
"The practice of military prosecution handling the criminal offences committed by policemen has been long established."
"Any claims that the police service is being remilitarised should be dismissed – if you excuse the use of such terms – as nonsense and demagoguery."
"I would like to point out to my esteemed colleague Mrs Beňová that a majority of the MPs from her own party supported this draft legislation in Slovak parliament, and indeed withheld their support from an amendment proposal aimed at changing the system."
"Mr President, I must insist that the Commission give a full reply at the part-session in Strasbourg."
"I thank the Commissioner for his offer."
"Unfortunately, he cannot give us his response today but we must have a clear response."
"I would like to say to the previous speaker that this is not a question of propaganda."
"What we are talking about here is Slovakia, a new Member State of the European Union, which, under the Copenhagen criteria, has exactly the same duties and rights as any other member."
"Article 6(1) of the EU Treaty provides for democratic rights and fundamental freedoms."
"In Article 6(2), the European Union guarantees rights under the European Convention on Human Rights."
"In that Convention, we talk about equal access to the legal system and equal treatment in court."
"A military court does not consist of independent judges: it is appointed by the government and is in contradiction to the fundamental values of the European Treaty."
"I therefore ask the Commissioner to answer two questions: first, are we right in saying that the police in Slovakia do not have the same access to a fair treatment in court as any other citizens in Slovakia?"
"Second, am I right in saying that every Member State – including Slovakia – should fulfil the Copenhagen criteria and that the Slovak Government, in opposing a free trade union for the police, denying it the right to negotiate, to gather and to act, is acting in contravention of the Copenhagen criteria?"
"These are the two fundamental questions which I would like the Commissioner to answer clearly."
"I do not doubt that Slovakia and its government – in particular its government – have to respect these fundamental rights."
"That is why I fully agree with Mrs Beňová that this is a serious case and we need to have a serious and correct answer from the Commission so that the Slovakian people know that the European Union is on their side."
". Mr President, I just want to respond to those honourable Members who urged the Commission to give an adequate answer."
"I would like to tell you that we need more information."
"In order to get more information we need more time, and certainly before any Member of the Commission comes before this House to give an adequate position, we need to have a debate in the College, on the basis of the information we need."
"That is my answer for the time being, but it is certainly not the Commission’s last word on the matter."
"The House has clearly expressed its wish that the questions raised here today should be answered at a later date, and I hope that the Commissioner will pass on this wish."
"Mr President, I would just like to ask a formal question on procedure."
"From what I understood from Commissioner Kovács, the Commission would be prepared to answer the question at the part-session in Strasbourg in two weeks’ time."
"Have I understood that correctly?"
"It is important and it is urgent that we receive a reasonable, rapid answer."
"The people of Slovakia really need a clear answer from the Commission, so it is an urgent matter."
"I would just like to ask you whether we can expect such a timescale – after all, it is two weeks we are talking about."
"I would point out that the agenda for Strasbourg part-sessions, and indeed for all part-sessions, is decided by the Conference of Presidents."
"As I understand it, therefore, if the Commission is prepared to answer this question in Strasbourg, it will be the Conference of Presidents that is able to decide whether or not to include this item on the agenda."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is voting time."
". Mr President, the proposal before us seeks to merge economic objectives with development objectives."
"It seeks to remove codecision, for which Parliament fought for 20 years, by taking 16 regulations away and replacing them with one regulation that writes Parliament out of the script."
"A strong and unanimous approach by the Development Committee, supported by three other committees, has seen some sense prevail."
"We can now seek to amend this proposal by referring it back to the Development Committee, and I very much appreciate the work done by the Presidency and those in the Commission who proposed a new draft."
"In Irish one would say , which means be ready, be vigilant."
"Parliament is not a rubber stamp, it has the power of codecision."
"That is a principle."
"It is not a product for sale."
"37 Members of my Committee have signed a recommendation, on my own advice, to refer this proposal back for amendment."
"I hope the House will agree to that."
"Mr President, I would like to give this proposal my wholehearted support."
"It is not acceptable that the Commission should propose that we should lose powers, and so I endorse the proposal that this be referred back to committee."
"."
"Mr President, it is possible that some confusion may have arisen as a result of a number of errors that have crept into the nominal list prepared by the Bureau, and this I would like to eliminate by making it clear that all those who endorse the compromise that we have struck with the Council and Commission is supporting the amendments in Block 1, while rejecting all the others."
"During yesterday’s debate, the Commission and Council made it clear once again that there is no compromise unless the whole of Block 1 is approved, without any other amendments."
"All groups, except the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, declared themselves in favour of this compromise yesterday."
"It is crucial that we, on the eve of the WTO Conference in Hong Kong, should have a regulation in place."
"This compromise is the result of hard work."
"Thanks to the cooperation of the shadow rapporteurs of the other groups, we have managed to reach a compromise that is accepted and endorsed almost unanimously."
"It strikes me as important that this should now be approved and that if, as a result of possible confusion, it is not, yet another vote should be held, and this is something that may not be what we want but is on the cards nevertheless."
"I would therefore repeat that if we support the compromise, we must approve Block 1 to the exclusion of all other amendments."
". Mr President, I very much welcome this directive from the Commission to control and monitor avian influenza in the EU."
"We need a strong contingency plan to keep the disease out of the EU and if we are unfortunate enough for the disease to enter Europe we will need the right procedures in place to stamp it out quickly."
"What is new in this directive is the monitoring of low pathogen avian influenza for the first time in Europe."
"I very much support this because the low pathogen form has the potential to mutate into the highly pathogenic form of the disease, which is highly contagious and fatal for poultry."
"I disagree with the Commission on one point, however."
"Once low pathogen avian influenza is found in poultry, that poultry needs to be disposed of very quickly so that the potential for the disease to spread and mutate into a highly pathogenic form is stopped immediately."
"The directive maintains that meat from poultry found to have LPAI is safe to enter the food chain."
"I do not argue with the scientific advice, but the processing and marketing of this meat will be almost impossible."
"Furthermore, it would destroy public confidence in the very high quality of European poultry meat."
"I ask all Members in this House to support the amendments put forward by the PPE-DE Group in order to establish a common sense approach to stamping out LPAI in the European Union and maintain full public and consumer support for the industry."
"While I am on my feet, I would like to add an oral amendment presented to me by Mr Ebner, which I fully support."
"I understand he has spoken to other groups in Parliament and gained their support."
"It is to involve hunters in the monitoring for LPAI."
"The Commissioner was also supportive of this last night."
"The oral amendment is to insert a recital 11b (new), which would read: ‘whereas hunters in Europe should be encouraged to assist in the monitoring of avian influenza outbreaks in wild birds by informing the competent authorities when they suspect that birds may be infected’."
"I would like to put that to the House."
"Mr President, item 4f has to do with the composition of the boards of directors of the European agencies."
"The text reads as follows:"
"‘Parliament, for its part, should two representatives to the board of directors’."
"I propose that it should read as follows:"
"‘Parliament, for its part, should two representatives to the board of directors’."
"What is the justification for this?"
"Although Parliament, being part of the legislative power, should not claim the right to have two official representatives in all executive agencies subordinate to it, it should retain the right to delegate trusted experts to agencies of its choice, as it does with the European Environmental Agency in Copenhagen or the Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna."
"My amendment enjoys the support of the draftsman of this paragraph, Mr Florenz of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and also of the rapporteur on the regulatory agencies, Mr Papastamkos."
"I ask for the House’s backing for it."
"Mr President, there has been a translation error, so it is the English version that is deemed authentic."
"By voting in favour of Amendment 3, we are not deleting the part of the sentence in paragraph 13 that states that an exception in the field of services must be made of the health care, education and audiovisual sectors."
"By voting in favour of Amendment 3, therefore, we are clearly saying that a distinction must be made between commercial and public services and that public services such as water, sanitation and energy must be neither dismantled nor weakened, and we stand by the fact that the education, health care and audiovisual sectors must also be made an exception of."
"Mr Désir, this means that the original English version is deemed authentic."
"We shall check all the translations in order to bring them into line with this original."
"Mr President, I wish to make an oral amendment to Amendment 19."
"I realise that the Socialists may wish to have a split vote on this."
"It is a clarification point on TRIPs and TRIMs."
"You might say that we have been tripped up by the acronym of TRIMs."
"They are the wrong way round."
"I shall read the amendment with the technical changes: ‘calls for a permanent solution to be found, as a matter of urgency, in the field of TRIMs – trade-related investment measures – and of TRIPs – trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights – to ensure access to medicines for countries with no manufacturing capacity facing public health concerns’."
"It is a question of turning those two words around."
"Mr President, I am afraid there has been a slight mix-up. There is one point on which I agree with Mr Sturdy."
"Paragraph 19 in fact mentions the agreement on investments, and this is an error, because this paragraph relates to the measures for accessing medicines and, therefore, it is definitely the agreement on intellectual property – the ADPIC Agreement in French and the TRIPS Agreement in English – that should be mentioned and not the TRIMS Agreement, the agreement on investments."
"That is why we requested a separate vote in order to delete the part of the sentence relating to the agreement on investments."
"I do not believe that this part of the sentence can be re-inserted at the beginning of the paragraph because this paragraph really has nothing to do with this agreement on investments."
"Mr President, in the interests of making the wording of paragraph 5, indent 2 clearer and less clumsy, I would like to replace: ‘undertake political reforms leading to democracy and the rule of law starting through a multiparty system and the right for all currents of opinions to express their views’, the ending of which is rather clumsy, with the following: ‘to draw up and implement as soon as possible all the necessary reforms required to democratise the country, guarantee the peaceful expression of political opposition and ensure a speedy holding of multiparty elections under international monitoring with a view to national reconciliation’."
"Mr President, for clarification I will first read the amendment, ‘recognises the full right of women to participate freely in sports and encourages a greater participation of women in sport’."
"Mr President, the aim of my amendment is to clarify and improve the text."
"In my opinion, it is crucial that Parliament and the European Union should recognise the right of women in developing countries and in Islamic countries, for example Saudi Arabia, to participate fully in all sporting activities."
"I hope that the male Members in the Chamber today, as well as the female Members, will vote in favour of my amendment."
"That concludes voting time."
". I voted in favour of sending this flawed proposal on Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation back to the Committee."
"Since the Commission has now made it clear that it does not intend to come forward with a new proposal, substantial amendments will be needed to ensure that Parliament can maintain its right of scrutiny over the formulation and implementation of development policy."
"I believe it is vital that the European Parliament stand united on this issue in fighting for co-decision over the development cooperation policy, currently undermined in this proposal."
"Poverty-alleviation should rightly remain the central focus of any development cooperation instrument and therefore further discussion is needed by the relevant Committees (Development Committee and International Trade Committee) in this context."
"I remain unconvinced of the merits for developing countries of splitting the development and economic chapters of this instrument, since the majority of EU development policy has a joint legal basis in the treaty as development assistance and external economic cooperation."
"I voted in favour of the motion on the basis of my professional experience with Slovak-Polish cross-border cooperation within the framework of the Tatra Euroregion."
"Several Euroregion initiatives have come into being naturally, as bottom-up initiatives."
"The Euroregions of today are associations with legal personality and their own cross-border structures, and they have the best expertise in the field of sustainable regional development."
"They have also become important instruments of cross-border cooperation, which is of fundamental importance for European cohesion, under the terms of the European Outline Convention On Transfrontier Cooperation Between Territorial Communities or Authorities."
"In view of their knowledge of the problems facing border areas, it is vital that the Euroregions participate in the development of strategies for 2007-2013, and that they play a greater role in cooperating with national institutions in the management of EU programmes."
"This report is an important initiative of the European Parliament, since our support for the Euroregions will speed up the fulfilment of one of the key EU objectives – elimination of regional disparities."
".Thanks to the commitment of the UK Presidency and of the European Parliament’s rapporteurs, it has been possible to reach an agreement on this regulation relating to the compulsory licensing of patents for pharmaceutical products."
"This agreement enables a new balance to be found for the European Commission’s proposal which, in the context of the WTO decision, made it still more difficult for countries faced with serious public health problems to gain access to medicines."
"This compromise with the Council is satisfying because the compulsory licensing system is extended to NGOs, international organisations and non-WTO members."
"The compromise authorises exports to countries forming part of the same regional bloc."
"I regret the refusal to promote technology transfer to the countries of the South, as well as the continued ability of the Member States to prescribe additional requirements."
"This legislation, which will, however, only enter into force two and a half years after the adoption of the WTO decision, proves necessary for a large number of developing countries faced with serious public health problems."
"I am delighted that this decision coincides with World AIDS Day."
". Although they introduce some improvements to the regulation proposed by the Commission, Parliament’s proposals do nothing to tackle the market stranglehold that the practice of patenting drugs confers on the multinational pharmaceutical corporations, which is the key issue at stake here."
"The proposals put forward by Parliament make a point of ‘legalising’ and imposing a ‘compulsory’ model for dispensing essential medicines to vast numbers of people. The professed aim is regulation, yet this is a deeply cynical move, as the proposals fail to provide mechanisms for promoting research, and fail to develop a capacity for research, manufacturing and supply – by and for these communities – of the medicines that are essential to them and to which they are entitled."
"The idea is to ‘regulate’ access to medicines for so-called underdeveloped countries, in such a way that the multinationals can charge less, thus enabling them to increase their markets without losing the privileged status that they enjoy."
"This strategy, however, runs counter to the conclusions of the World Trade Organisation’s Doha Conference, which stated that countries should ‘break’ patents on the grounds of public health, Brazil and South Africa being cases in point, as they have succeeded in providing medicines to AIDS patients free of charge."
"Hence our vote against."
". This regulation marks an important milestone for improving access to medicines in developing countries and it has my full support."
"It moves the EU beyond the current stalemate at the WTO regarding the granting of 'compulsory licences' to pharmaceutical products to combat diseases which afflict millions of people in the developing world."
"Its adoption means that the EU, the world's largest single market, can now provide not only the vital medicines needed by poor people at affordable prices, but can support the all-important development of local manufacture through the transfer of technology and know-how to public health systems in developing countries."
"I particularly endorse the attempts by the Rapporteur and Draftsman to extend the applicability of this regulation to non-WTO members, of which at least 40 are developing countries."
"Attempts to ensure that this new regulation can also allow for the important role of NGOs and UN agencies as providers of healthcare treatments also have my backing."
". Although I feel that we have yet to find ideal solutions, I applaud the efforts made in the proposal for a resolution before us."
"I particularly welcome some of the amendments adopted by Parliament aimed at empowering the poorest countries to pursue the fight against serious diseases that cause appalling loss of life, in the most effective and least expensive way possible."
"The protection of copyright, and in particular intellectual copyright, is certainly not incompatible with health protection, and with the commitment that we must make to improve the access of the poorest countries to the medicines that they need most."
". I welcome this proposed Directive on measures for the control of avian influenza."
"The proposed Directive aims to update EU measures based on lessons learned from recent epidemic scares and new scientific knowledge on how the disease spreads and risks to human health."
"The existing directive only establishes control measures against the 'highly pathogenic' avian influenza viruses, i.e. those causing major disease outbreaks in poultry and that may also occasionally infect humans."
"However, there is evidence that these highly pathogenic viruses actually originate from the so-called 'low - pathogenic' avian influenza viruses as a result of virus mutation."
"In order to prevent major avian influenza outbreaks, the new legislation would also establish compulsory surveillance and control measures against the low pathogenic avian influenza viruses that can be transmitted to domestic poultry from wild birds, such as ducks and geese."
"The low pathogenic viruses cannot be eradicated from wild birds, but the infection of domestic poultry can be effectively controlled and virus mutation into the risky forms of the virus can be prevented."
"I fully back the aim of the new legislation as it will ensure that the most appropriate surveillance and prevention measures against avian flu are in place and that the health risks, economic costs and the negative ......."
".As far back as 1989, the dangers of humans being contaminated by the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent were foreseeable."
"The Commission and Member States such as France waited until 1996 before taking protection measures."
"In the same way, the ultraliberalism of Mrs Thatcher’s Government had led the British Government to dismantle its national veterinary networks."
"When foot and mouth disease swept through Great Britain’s cattle and pig farms in 2003, there was no longer any kind of health barrier."
"Millions of animals were slaughtered as a precautionary measure and gigantic pyres burned everything."
"Only the ideological foolishness of ultraliberalism and of misguided free trade remained intact."
"After the laxness of policies, we are now moving in a direction whereby, in the case of avian influenza, an attempt is being made deliberately to obscure the issue by exploiting people’s basic fears."
"All of this is dressed up as a precautionary principal that is nothing more than the regressive reaction of an Amish-style European elite."
"A virus, non-existent at the present time and dreamed up by a political world seeking to make amends for its past weaknesses in the field of health care by implementing health protection measures left, right and centre, is meant to be threatening humankind with a Hollywood-style pandemic on a par with Spanish flu."
"Taking this as a starting point, we stockpile ineffective antivirals such as Tamiflu at the same time as increasing people’s fears to make them forget about the inadequate measures taken in relation to relocations, Islamisation and other genuine problems that, for their part, remain overlooked."
". As the rapporteur correctly points out, the best way of preventing a potential human pandemic of avian influenza is by completely removing the disease from birds."
"The Community must therefore channel its efforts into research and into making funds available, for the purpose of developing and obtaining oral vaccines, effective in all relevant bird species, to combat various strains."
"We also welcome the amendment to the directive currently in force, advocating measures to cover low pathogenic viruses in poultry, to prevent the risk of mutation into the highly pathogenic form."
"The report covers a range of measures aimed at preventing human infection, and we accordingly voted in favour."
". I am delighted that my report has been adopted."
"Greater Community support is needed to develop research into an oral vaccine to combat the various strains and to promote the use thereof should the need arise; the total cost of vaccines should be borne by the Community."
"Community support must moreover be given to the Member States to develop a system for monitoring the disease, including laboratory diagnosis and research into suitable vaccines. Measures should also be taken involving cooperation and technical support for third countries, in particular Asian ones, in order to enable preventative and screening action to be taken in the countries in which avian influenza originates;"
"With regard to Community financial assistance, I am disappointed that my proposal to raise support from 50% to 60% in respect of the costs borne by the Member States in cases of both high and low pathogenic avian influenza was rejected."
"The proposal for 50% support in respect of loss of income until a new holding is up and running, without of course undermining the workings of the market, was also rejected."
"These considerations aside, I trust that the Commission and the Council will take due heed of the adopted proposals to protect public health."
". Public health measures cost money."
"They are designed to help a huge range of people, and involve research, prevention and control. In the case of avian influenza, the method of providing financial assistance to cover costs incurred in taking the necessary veterinary measures needs to be updated."
"There is a possibility of a worldwide pandemic, but some Member States are more at risk than others owing to their location on the migratory flight path of wild birds."
"If one factors in prevention, in particular regarding the development of monitoring systems, laboratory costs and research into new vaccines, one appreciates the enormity of the financial commitment required."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report."
". The purpose of this Commission proposal is to amend Regulation 974/98, which was the legal framework during the change-over period in the context of the adoption of the euro in all current euro zone countries."
"The intention is now to use this legal framework for the countries that joined the EU on 1 May 2004, and were under the legal obligation to become part of the euro zone."
"One of the key proposals is to reduce the time taken by the change-over and to find a ‘Big Bang’-type solution, with the introduction of euro notes and coins at the same time as the adoption of the euro as the single currency."
"This report follows that path and seeks to ensure that no Member State can leave the euro zone."
"We feel that that is unacceptable and that Member States are perfectly entitled to leave the euro zone should they wish to do so."
"Attempting to impose such a restriction on the new Member States when two countries, Denmark and the UK, have an opt-out clause and another, Sweden, has decided not to join, is tantamount to discrimination."
"Hence our vote against."
"We maintain our opposition in principle to the euro."
"It is clear that monetary policy has led to economic stagnation and unemployment, which also ..."
".What, then, does the euro zone have to offer today?"
"The lowest growth rate of the industrialised countries."
"Unemployment."
"Increased living costs."
"Absurd budgetary constraints."
"A dramatic rise in government debt."
"A non-existent exchange policy and an overvalued euro."
"A European Central Bank focused on inflation fears to the extent that it is today preparing to increase its leading rates at the risk of jeopardising economic activity and employment."
"The euro has caused a great deal of disillusionment and damage, which will worsen if the economies in the zone move further and further apart."
"In the wake of the new Member States’ joining the European Union, surveys published in the Western press showed that, while the citizens of these countries were in favour of a membership tying them once and for all to the democracies, they did not understand everything that such membership would involve."
"A number of them were, and undoubtedly still are, convinced that the shift to the euro was an option and not an obligation."
"It is less a question of whether a country can or cannot bring in euro notes and coins as soon as it adopts the single currency."
"It is more a question of whether its people agree and have understood all the consequences of such a move."
"It is imperative that they be consulted via referendum."
". I welcome this report which looks at the previous national strategies of the introduction of the Euro and suggests how they can be improved and implemented in the Member States who may wish to enter in to the Euro zone, as and when they decide."
"I hope one day it will be relevant to the UK."
". There are some ways in which it is understandable that the new Member States should be so keen to introduce the euro without much delay."
"What needs to be borne in mind, though, is the fact that a mere 38% of the public in the 10 new Member States are persuaded that the introduction of the euro would be beneficial in its effects and that nearly half favour its introduction at as late a date as possible."
"It is this latter choice that we should accept, since it does offer the countries concerned the opportunity to carry out the necessary reforms at a more leisurely pace and allows the people more time in which to get used to the idea of the position changing."
"It is also a fact – and this is not the least of the considerations to be borne in mind – that past experience, whatever the attempts to deny it, shows that the introduction of the euro leads to increased prices, since companies endeavour to recover the costs they have incurred in the course of the changeover."
"The Commission should demonstrate that it has learned from the failure of the EU’s constitution by supporting referenda to discern the popular will – such as the one planned for Poland – rather than arguing against it by claiming that Poland is obliged to introduce the euro."
"When such states as the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden retain their monetary independence, we should allow others to do likewise."
". The concept of voluntary cross-border cooperation is one that I support and that deserves to be encouraged."
"Broadly speaking, I warmly welcome cooperation on various levels between the administrations of different Member States, especially when this is the result of a voluntary initiative undertaken by these administrations (although this can be encouraged) and when it does not lead to a new administrative and bureaucratic entity."
"I also welcome the fact that, in this specific case, this includes cross-border neighbourhoods outside the EU."
"I therefore voted for this report."
"There is one aspect, however, that I must make clear."
"These initiatives must not be encouraged or conceived on the basis of an approach that runs counter to that of the central powers."
"In other words, the EU must not, by means of such encouragement, seek to bring about the internal breakdown of individual Member States, which can only be harmful to them. This is not, and must not become, the Union’s role or purpose."
". The regulation on the introduction of the euro has proved to be a sound legal framework during the change-over period in the context of the adoption of the euro as a single currency in all current euro area countries."
"It can therefore be considered a suitable basis for future participating Member States, although some technical adaptations are needed."
"More importantly, following the experience of the change-over to the euro, there needs to be an improved communication strategy, in order to provide for the dual display of prices to inform the citizens, changes to the dual circulation period for the two currencies, and an extension to the deadlines for banks to effect the change-over."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Rosati report."
". Since October 1992, and following three extensions (until the end of 2005), the Council has retained a minimum standard rate of VAT in the EU of 15%."
"The purpose of this Commission proposal is to further extend this rate until 31 December 2010, and this is something which we endorse."
"The original idea behind establishing a minimum rate was to create a band with a maximum rate that would be harmonised to a single rate of VAT throughout the Community."
"Although no Member State has a rate below 15% or above 25%, the establishment of this band would affect the tax sovereignty of the Member States and their financing options under the Community budget."
"The report also contains an issue that has reared its head yet again and led us to vote against."
"Attempts are subtly being made to speed up debate on VAT harmonisation, which would undermine other flexible elements of the current arrangements, such as reduced rates of VAT in line with the different social and cultural needs of individual Member States."
"This lends further weight to our decision to vote against."
". I support this report which agrees with the Commission proposal to extend the 'Annex K' experiment of applying reduced rates of VAT to certain labour intensive services."
"I regret that the European Parliament has an opinion on VAT and that this issue keeps being blocked by the Council."
"The controversy surrounding this proposal is that if the Council fails to reach an agreement before the end of December, the experimental reduced rates system will cease to be legal in 9 Member States."
"This does not affect the UK and the UK applies their reduced rates through Annex H. Nevertheless, I would be disappointed if this scheme collapses."
".Fifty years ago, two Frenchmen, Maurice Lauré and Georges Egret, invented the greatest piece of technology in the history of taxable humankind: the VAT system, applied by more than 123 countries, including EU countries from the time of the first directive in 1967."
"In the 1990s, the monotheistic religion of the single market sought a single VAT rate whose cross-border legal system had to be that of the Member State of origin of the transaction and not the Member State of consumption or of destination."
"The danger was that a Continental compensation fund would be created, a huge labyrinthine system distributing the VAT receipts from intra-Community trade."
"The unanimity of the Member States enabled the Council to impose taxation on a ‘temporary/permanent’ basis in the sovereign country of consumption."
"The intelligent move to make today would be to put European labour on an equal footing in terms of taxation with international labour, by turning the page on a century of mistakes and doing away with the idiotic tax on labour."
"Likewise, the inspired system of reduced VAT rates must be used to clone import duties in order to levy deductible input tax on them, for the benefit of exporters, thus curing the economic and social diseases of globalisation, with its relocations and unemployment."
". This report which I support, develops the cross border VAT refund system for SMEs stating time limits for data to be received and monies to be refunded."
"I hope it leads to a reduction of the administrative burden on SMEs"
"Mr President, on behalf of my colleagues I wish to state that we voted in favour of this resolution on the WTO on the understanding that the reference in paragraph 6 to the CAP reform relates to the 2003 CAP reforms under Commissioner Fischler."
". I support this joint resolution on preparations for the WTO conference and hope it will facilitate international trade in playing a major role in the promotion of economic development and the alleviation of poverty."
"I particularly support the Amendment calling for: the phasing-out by 2010 of all forms of export competition, including food aid, export subsidies and state-trading entities, by all industrialised countries in parallel."
"It is crucial that a distinction should be made between commercial services and public services, and that public services such as water, sanitation and energy should not be dismantled or undermined in the GATS."
"The Doha Round must succeed in order to strengthen the multilateral trade system to ensure the progress and harmonious development of the world economy."
"Trade coupled with aid and debt relief is essential to the achievement of the 2015 Millennium Goals so concrete results with regard to the development aspects of the Doha Round need to be achieved during the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference."
". – The Commission is preparing to sacrifice our agriculture and our food security at the Doha Round."
"It is preparing to support the Agreement on Trade in Services – the notorious GATS – which is nothing more than a Bolkestein Directive on a global scale."
"The Commission intends to further reduce our import duties, which are, however, already the lowest in the world, and it will only half-heartedly defend European interests against dumping in all of its guises, against pirating and counterfeiting, or the necessary requirement for Europe’s competitors to respect a minimum of social and environmental standards."
"It is with remarkable steadfastness and short-sightedness that this Parliament welcomes the benefits of globalisation and that it reserves solely for developing countries its thoughts with regard to the protection and diversification of economies, the necessary acknowledgement of national interests, the freedom to choose the rhythm and speed of liberalisation or, furthermore, the preservation of jobs."
"Since this Assembly repeats itself, I too will repeat myself. World trade is unequal."
"It is unfair."
"Yet, its main victims are the countries of Europe and their people."
". With this resolution, the majority in this House, including the Portuguese Socialists, Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, has reaffirmed its desire to liberalise world trade, or in other words to open up markets to competition between hugely disparate countries in terms of economic development, much to the delight of the large economic and financial groups, which stand to gain enormously."
"The majority has sought to pull the wool over people’s eyes, by asserting that development can only happen by liberalising trade, within the framework of the capitalist onslaught, when in fact what has happened is that poverty has become worse, along with inequality around the world, a trend that will only get worse, as the United Nations Development Programme has warned, if we continue further down the current path of liberalisation policies."
"The effects of liberalisation are as follows: the gains made by the workers are undermined, the sovereignty of the people come under attack, large multinationals appropriate natural resources and biodiversity, environmental destruction, higher unemployment, millions of small farmers going to the wall and food sovereignty and safety being put at risk."
"What is needed, therefore, is a different international order, which, on the basis of mutually beneficial cooperation, meets the needs of every community; ensures that people can enjoy their most fundamental rights to food, health, housing, education, culture and leisure; leads to each State achieving its full potential, with its sovereignty respected; and ensures that environmental protection is promoted."
"That is all that is at stake ..."
". I reject the resolution, in the version jointly agreed and submitted, on the preparations for the 6th Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Hong Kong."
"The demands and arguments contained therein are too narrow and I would like to see its demands in respect of the social dimension in the WTO go much further."
"The Doha round should include consideration of such non-trade-related issues as society, the environment and culture."
"Internationally recognised social minimum standards should not be regarded as a form of trade protectionism; on the contrary, they make ‘fairer’ trade possible, given that there is an interaction between trade and social affairs."
"In my view, fair and just economic and social development are dependent upon the incorporation, as binding provisions, of minimum labour norms in the WTO Agreements."
"The prohibition of child labour, the right of men and women to receive equal pay, the abolition of forced labour, the legitimacy of trade unions and what is termed the freedom to conclude collective agreements are among the most fundamental minimum labour standards, and the ILO requires most countries to implement them already."
"If a fair system of world trade is to be developed, binding minimum labour norms such as these, along with compliance with international environmental standards, must be given parity alongside the prevailing WTO trade law."
"Laying down stipulated labour norms can have nothing but a positive effect on a country’s economy, and they must not be regarded as a hindrance."
". I voted for a statement on the WTO Ministerial Conference which sends a strong signal out that development should remain the focus of discussions in the Doha round."
"This means that richer players, such as the EU, should complete the necessary reforms to end distorting subsidies in agriculture and open our agricultural markets to products from poorer, agriculture-dependent countries."
"At the same time, no unfair demands should be made on the very poorest countries to open their domestic markets in other areas."
"There is a great deal at stake in Hong Kong, not least the need to demonstrate our commitment to encouraging trade between developing countries."
"South-South trading remains an important vehicle for long-term development of countries as 70% of tariffs paid by developing countries are paid to other developing countries."
"Further, developing countries stand to make great gains in this area since trade between developing countries is estimated to be growing twice as fast as global trade and already represents some 40% of developing country exports."
"After Seattle, Doha and Cancun, now comes the turn of the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference to continue 60 years of philosophical and technical mistakes with regard to the reduction and, in the long run, abolition of import duties."
"This is done in the name of a Ricardian theory that is not only devoid of any serious scientific foundation, but is above all constantly contradicted by the facts."
"The continuous decrease in import duties is supposed to promote economic prosperity."
"Well, following decades of non-existent customs barriers, Africa continues to grow poorer."
"The abolition of import duties is supposed to create ‘the wealth of nations’. Well, in North America, the free trade agreement – the so-called NAFTA – of 1994 destroyed Mexican farmers."
"The people are supposed to want this decrease in import duties."
"Well, in November 2005, the indigenous people of the Andes – in Ecuador, for instance – rejected the FTA – the Free Trade Agreement – which the Bush Administration seeks to impose on Colombia, Peru and Ecuador."
"The World Bank, the OECD, the IMF and the WTO explain at length that lowering customs barriers means increasing living standards."
"Well, the ‘banana affair’ is there to dispute that."
"The WTO and the WTO conference together represent the slave market embellished by Ricardo, Adam Smith and other fraudulent preachers of the jungle Bible."
". The opinion that the development of international trade contributes to economic growth, development, jobs, and indeed a better environment in international relations, is, I am pleased to note, a widely held one."
"Even now, however, some groups still put forward programmes and agendas that form part of a common fight against a freer and more open world when it comes to trade."
"While it would be unwise to sing along to their tune, we also need to understand the origin of that discontent, because politics cannot be done by turning one’s back on reality."
"Against this backdrop, the present Common Resolution meets the most significant concerns and makes some highly relevant points."
"As far as I am concerned, the EU needs both to adopt a clear and firm negotiating position, and to demonstrate a sincere desire to support economic development and world trade growth."
"I therefore welcome the fact that this resolution advocates support for economic growth in developing countries, and that emphasis is placed on social, environmental, work, cultural and, last but not least, economic concerns."
"What is required is more, and fairer, international trade, without losing sight of our responsibilities to our citizens."
". – The decisions by the ΕU for the Ministerial Conference of the WTO are characterised by the ambition of the imperialists, especially the USA and the EU, to use the rules of international trade in order to plunder the markets of the developed and developing countries, to the detriment of the peoples and with catastrophic consequences on the environment."
"The joint motion for a resolution, which was supported by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, ratified the aggressive policy of the ΕU, to the detriment of the peoples."
"The liberalisation of services being promoted under the 'Bolkestein directive' in the Member States of the EU is being selected as an international strategy within the framework of the WTO by the EU in order to strike collective agreements and workers' rights in general."
"The drastic cuts in subsidies for agricultural products, on the basis of the review of the EU CAP and the general restructuring of agricultural production for the benefit of the monopolies, are intended to wipe out small and medium-sized farms."
"At the same time, the dominion of the pharmaceutical group monopolies continues."
"The WTO is an imperialist international body which serves to ensure that the dominion of big business and its profitability are perpetuated."
"It is for these reasons that the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the motion for a resolution on the WTO, thereby contributing to the development of the fight of the workers and strengthening the anti-imperialist and anti-monopoly fight for the peoples themselves to decide on their own future by drawing up agreements on the basis of mutual benefit."
". – The joint motion for a resolution endeavours, in an insulting and unacceptable manner, to slander the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, by accusing it of human rights violations."
"The objective is to exert pressure and create a climate for overturning socialist and grass-roots achievements, in order to create the preconditions for plundering the country."
"The intervention strategy of the ΕU by creating a financed 'opposition' is well known."
"It is brazen-faced impudence to cite the 30th anniversary of the tremendous victory of the Vietnamese people against American imperialism and to accuse the government of a lack of democracy."
"The heroic people of Vietnam won their independence at the cost of the lives of the millions of people murdered by the imperialist interventions."
"Where is the sensitivity to the human rights of the tens of thousands of Vietnamese who were murdered, of the thousands of children who are born with huge problems because of the use of 'agent orange' chemicals?"
"Why does the otherwise sensitive EU not ask the USA and the Monsanto multinational group to pay for the victims of chemical and biological warfare?"
"The European and American imperialists will never forgive the country that managed to crush three major imperialist powers, the USA, Great Britain and France."
"We express our support and solidarity for this heroic people, which symbolises the history of mankind."
"Mr President, I greatly regret the fact that Mrs de Palacio, on behalf of the Commission, has already stopped the Olympic truce from being enforced in the Suze Valley during the 2006 Winter Olympics."
"Even the Piedmont region requested this truce in order to put a stop, during the Games, to the tensions and disturbances created by the popular opposition in relation to the works under way on the high-speed Lyon/Turin line."
"Independence for the Suze Valley, free Piedmont!"
". I welcome this resolution on the Olympic Truce in the context of the Turin Winter Olympics 2006."
"The Truce is an essential symbol of the Olympic spirit and one that must be retained and respected."
".I gladly voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on development and sport tabled and supported by my colleague, Mrs Martens, as sport is one of those disciplines bringing people together and moving them forward along the road to greater wisdom and progress."
"This resolution should be the starting point for an ambitious EU sports policy, by relying on the Member States’ national sports federations, particularly at youth level."
". I voted for this resolution."
"I believe more must be done to encourage young people to take an active part in sport."
"We should also do more to encourage women to take part in previously male dominated activities."
"Finally, although not an EU issue we must encourage Member States to do more to retain green spaces and playing fields in major urban conurbations."
"Mr President, to my mind, something essential is missing from Mr Duff’s report on guidelines for the approval of the European Commission."
"Indeed, I would remind you of how, last year, Mr Buttiglione, the Italian candidate Commissioner, was positively crucified as a result of being briefed against in a scandalous manner."
"In much the same way as in the Spanish Inquisition, the reason was not the policies that Commissioner Buttiglione might pursue, but the question as to whether, in his deepest and innermost belief system, he did not harbour opinions that fly in the face of this appalling political correctness."
"Mr Buttiglione’s butchering was yet another step in the repression by our new Left-totalitarian priests."
"If this House were honest and consistent with itself, then this report would state that European Commissioners are not allowed to think in ways that political correctness does not permit."
"Mr President, the Duff report reminds me of William Shakespeare’s immortal words ‘much ado about nothing’."
"Independence, competence, European commitment, these are all fine qualities, but in practice, I notice that this House has no problem with accepting people such as Louis Michel, who, in his former capacity as the Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister, ran counter to the very notion of European cooperation by demonising Austria; Mr Michel, in respect of whom it is generally known that he regards the European code of conduct for weapons export as no more than a scrap of paper;"
"Mr Michel who, in March, during a flying visit to Cuba, said that things were not that bad over there and that the human rights organisations should stop defying Mr Castro. How fortunate that ethics and respect for human rights are not express criteria for the appointment to the post of Commissioner."
". Regardless of the assessment of the principles, criteria and standards that the Commission must, as a college, follow, it is unacceptable that Parliament should adopt reports stating that ‘the Constitution is to enter into force on 1 November 2006’."
"Only an unhealthy obsession with federalism and neoliberalism would lead Parliament’s majority to persist with this idea, even after the defeats in France and the Netherlands blocking the adoption of the so-called European Constitution."
"As regards the assessment criteria and principles, there are some welcome points, but we must not lose sight of the fact that, beyond the candidates’ competence, commitment and suitability lie their policies, be they individual or collective."
"This is the key criterion on which we base our assessment."
".I would point out that the French and Dutch citizens’ rejection of the European Constitution – by a large majority and via a referendum - rendered this text definitively null and void."
"The repeated references to this text in Parliament’s reports is a denial of democracy."
"Those who claim to represent Europeans should be the first ones to take account of Europeans’ desires when they are clearly expressed."
"Secondly, this Parliament, which is not representative of European public opinion, given that it supports, for example, the accession of Turkey, immigration for the purpose of reinforcing the population and, furthermore, the country of origin principle in the Bolkestein Directive, sadly does not guarantee Europe’s smooth functioning."
"Parliament did not sanction the Santer Commission."
"It carried out a selective witch hunt during the appointment of the Barroso Commission – not for the good of Europe, but for ideological reasons and on account of power struggles between institutions."
"The bottom line is that Europe is not a State."
"The Commission is not, and categorically must not be, a government."
"It is just a College of civil servants."
"Parliament’s approval of the Commission’s composition and of its President remains a mere pretence."
"It grants the Commission absolutely no democratic legitimacy whatsoever."
". There are lessons that need to be learned from the failures and mistakes in the appointment of the Commission last year."
"It was worthy of criticism not least in that a competent candidate was required to withdraw because he held fast to his conservative religious convictions, while an incompetent Stalinist remained in office."
"It is not in the least acceptable that dubious candidates – those, for example, who hush up their involvement in the murky side of party finance – have no problem getting through."
"After all, future members of the Commission should meet the highest moral standards – those condemned by a court of law have no place in it."
"It is also embarrassing to see that there is no agreement as to how the competence and suitability of a future Commissioner are to be evaluated, with the consequence that different benchmarks are applied."
"All the more is this the case when uniform criteria and requirements would have put other candidates out of the running."
"Not only must we at last be given the chance to pass judgment on the designated Commissioners as individuals, instead of being fobbed off with one vote on them all, but it is also essential that we in this House agree to uniform criteria for evaluating them."
"The Member States, too, must take greater care in selecting them and put up only those contenders who really are up to the job."
"What certainly would achieve this would be the drawing up of a shortlist from which the most suitable applicants could be chosen."
"This is the only way in which future farces can be prevented."
". Maritime transport is of vital importance to Portugal, given our significant coastal area."
"It is similarly important to the entire Union, which has a massively extensive sea border."
"I therefore feel it is crucially important to ensure that Europe’s seas are viable and competitive, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy."
"Community measures covering competitiveness in the area of maritime transport must take account of the appearance of new maritime nations, such as China, Korea and Taiwan."
"We therefore need instruments protecting the new framework for business cooperation between operators of liner services into and out of the Union."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Kratsa report."
". Without wishing to become embroiled in a debate on tax harmonisation and the common VAT arrangements, the main purpose of this resolution is to extend for a further year – until the end of 2006 – the trial period for those Member States that chose to do so to apply a reduced rate of VAT to certain labour-intensive services."
"We feel that, as this is a one-off measure, it can help to promote job creation and to reduce the parallel economy."
"It is too early at this stage to assess the socio-economic impact of this measure, which will also lead to greater flexibility in terms of indirect taxation."
"It should be borne in mind that, were this measure to end suddenly, prices could rise."
"These arrangements should apply to all current Member States, as new Member States should not be subject to discrimination, which would be unacceptable."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 1 December 2005."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this is a good opportunity for the President to make a statement on the death penalty."
"I say that this is a good opportunity because, as you know, on 10 December — two days ago — we celebrated the anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights."
"These rights include one fundamental right: the right to life."
"Regrettably, however, a few days beforehand, in the United States, the execution took place of the 1 000th person since the death sentence was restored in 1976."
"The magic of round figures — 1 000 — and the fact that this coincides with the anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights make this situation particularly meaningful."
"It was not just in the United States that an execution took place, however."
"Somebody was executed in Singapore as well, on the same day."
"This is a good time to recall that the European Union campaigns against the death penalty, because it considers it contrary to our values."
"The abolition of the death penalty is a condition for the accession of any country to the European Union."
"Fortunately, progress is being made with the abolition of the death sentence in the world: in 1977, 16 countries had abolished the death penalty and now that figure stands at 84."
"In 76 countries, however, the death sentence remains, and, in 24 countries, although it is effectively abolished, since there have been no executions for 10 years, it remains on the statute books."
"Although the number of countries applying the death penalty has fallen, the number of executions has risen dramatically."
"According to Amnesty International, in 2004, 7 400 people were sentenced to death and in 25 countries almost 3 800 people were executed."
"We should therefore not just focus on the figure of 1 000 in the United States, and we should retain a global view of what is happening in the world as a whole: 3 800 people executed during 2004."
"Nevertheless, 95% of these executions, almost all of them, took place in China, in Iran, in Vietnam and in the United States."
"The United States is therefore the only democratic country that still applies the death penalty in a significant manner; 3 400 people are awaiting execution in its prisons."
"One significant fact is that 120 people sentenced to death have been released before execution because their innocence has been proven."
"That is the situation."
"There is, however, a glimmer of hope, because United States society is turning against the death penalty, as well as popular juries, and the Supreme Court has abolished it in the case of minors and the mentally disabled."
"It has been abolished in twelve States; in 20 others, executions no longer take place."
"Unfortunately, however, China is the country that holds the record in terms of executions."
"It appears that there are around 6 000 executions per year, though Amnesty International puts the figure at 3 400."
"I wished to remind you of this situation, because I believe that we parliamentarians must work to convince our counterparts in all countries that the death penalty must be abolished, because for us Europeans life is an inalienable right and nobody can be deprived of that right regardless of the crimes of which they are guilty."
"That is what inalienable means: it does not depend on anybody’s responsibility, but on their very existence and essence as human beings."
"Thank you very much for your attention."
"The final version of the draft agenda, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 8 December 2005 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"Mr President, I have a request to make in relation to the agenda for Wednesday."
"It has to do with the statements made by President Ahmadinejad of Iran."
"I believe that the statements made by the President of Iran over recent days to be something on which either you, as President of this House, or the President of the Council should take up a position."
"I find it unacceptable that a Head of State should come out with utterances, in more or less plain and frank language, questioning the right of a state, and of a whole people, to exist, and going so far as to incite a breach of the peace in the region and the opening of the door to violence in it."
"Let me tell the House, on behalf of my group – and I do think that the applause shows that I am, perhaps exceptionally, speaking on behalf of all Members here – that anyone who argues along the lines adopted by the President of Iran with regard to Israel is offending against the fundamental laws and rules of the international community, and I think that a multinational parliament such as our own should repudiate what they say in the most forthright terms."
"That is what we expect the Council to do on behalf of the Council of Heads of State and of Government!"
"Mr President, it might have been lost in translation that what Mr Schulz was asking for was that the Council Presidency, in its Wednesday statement, should take a view on this issue and make it perfectly clear where the Council stands on it."
"Alright, I shall therefore communicate Mr Martin Schulz’s request to the Presidency of the Council so that it can be incorporated into its statement, but we are not formally altering any item on the agenda."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has made a request calling for the title of the debate ‘Detention of monks and closure of a monastery in Tibet’ to be replaced with ‘The Human Rights Situation in Tibet and Hong Kong’."
"Mr President, I would be pleased to justify the request very briefly."
"My group had sought a motion on Hong Kong in view of the recent statements there by the government of the territory, which suggest that there is not to be any movement towards universal suffrage."
"I think the House will be aware of the extremely large demonstration that took place in Hong Kong ten days ago – the Hong Kong people demonstrating in favour of universal suffrage and full democracy."
"This House has always supported them in the past and it seems to me a good opportunity to use this occasion to do so again."
"Mr President, we want to endorse this request, for, if we are talking in terms of matters of urgency, this very definitely is one, a fact reinforced by the demonstrations to which Mr Watson has referred."
"We see it as the fly in the ointment that developments in Hong Kong are not going the way we would wish or the way that the Government of the People’s Republic of China did, to some degree, promise that they would."
"Our support for a justifiable cause is not something intended to be detrimental to China or to the People’s Republic, but rather something that we want to do for the people of Hong Kong as they attempt to build democracy."
"China needs to understand that this attempt to build democracy in Hong Kong would also bring great benefits to China itself."
"With this in mind, we endorse this request."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is also asking that the title of the debate on ‘Ethiopia’, as it appears in the debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, be replaced with ‘Ethiopia and new border conflicts’."
"Mr President, my Group should like to propose changing the title to: ‘Ethiopia and new border conflicts’."
"As the House is aware, the problems in this region relate not only to Ethiopia but also very much to other border conflicts in the area, and it seemed to us that we might extend the scope of the resolution to take account of that."
"(1)"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"I shall give priority to those Members who have not yet spoken."
"– Allow me to express my delight that the Andrei Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought has been awarded to the 'Damas de Blanco', a movement of Cuban women peacefully striving for domestic and foreign support for the proclamation of a general pardon in Cuba."
"I have personally received detailed information on the activities of the mothers and wives of political prisoners from Mrs Gisela Sánchez Verdecia, the wife of Cuban prisoner Antonio Díaz Sánchez, whom I have symbolically adopted together with my colleagues, MEPs Peter Šťastný and Milan Gaľo."
"This heroic woman is fighting for her husband, who is serving a twenty-year sentence and is in a critical state of health as a consequence of inhumane treatment."
"I would like to express my deep solidarity with this group of Cuban women in their valiant fight for the liberation of all political prisoners."
"I hope that the European Parliament will not rely exclusively on the Sakharov Prize as a means for raising awareness of Cuba’s failure to uphold the Declaration of Human Rights."
"I urge Parliament to continue pressing for an early return of democracy to Cuba."
"Mr President, the UK Presidency has presented its proposals broken down into figures for the financial perspective 2007-2013."
"We feared the worst. We were not wrong."
"Following nine months of work by the temporary committee on the financial perspective, the European Parliament had reached a satisfactory compromise, enabling Europe to be guaranteed an ambitious and coherent future."
"In contrast, Mr Blair is proposing drastic cuts and jeopardising the European Union project."
"He is attacking the Structural Funds, rural development, youth and culture, and is making the funding of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund downright precarious."
"We must reach a mature position, for the sake of European integration."
"Let us put a stop to national self-interest and to the anachronistic benefits enjoyed by certain Member States."
"The United Kingdom must re-evaluate its contribution to the budget by doing more than just implementing a cosmetic measure."
"Europe is a joint project, not a trading floor."
"Let us also use the borrowing options available to us to provide ourselves with the resources to succeed."
"The European project and the solidarity we require with our new partners depend on our doing so."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a cement carrier, the , sank on 2 December off the port of La Spezia, in the Poets’ Gulf, which is a magnificent gulf in the Mediterranean."
"The crew was rescued, and the SeaDarQ system indicated that around 90 000 litres of hydrocarbons had leaked out."
"The safety operation will cost at least EUR 2 million and work will continue for some months."
"The rescue services’ efforts and the professionalism shown were both excellent but, nonetheless, the urgent need for stricter controls has been highlighted since this ship was a rust bucket, which was registered with the Ukraine Register of Shipping and sailing with its documents in order."
"The possibility of carrying out a post-incident technical investigation to ascertain the causes of the incident and those responsible should therefore be reviewed, and this case should also be considered within the Erika II policy package, so that it can genuinely be said that those responsible for carrying out the checks will themselves be checked."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though the report on the request for defence of immunity and privileges of my colleague, Mr Gollnisch, will be debated shortly, I take the liberty of bringing up a particularly topical point."
"Last week, the French Prime Minister, Mr de Villepin, stated with strength and conviction that it was not up to the legislator to establish historical truth."
"He said that there was no official history in France."
"A few days later, the Head of State, Mr Chirac, made similar remarks by saying: ‘In the Republic, there is no official history."
"What, then, are the French political and judicial authorities accusing Mr Gollnisch of?"
"Of having said exactly the same thing a few months beforehand, namely that it was up to historians to study the issues relating to the Second World War, whatever the views of some of my French fellow Members, who set themselves up as the thought police, going so far as to exert unacceptable political pressure so that Mr Gollnisch’s request for defence of immunity will be rejected."
"In these conditions, ladies and gentlemen, I urge you not to plumb the depths of absurdity by adopting this report."
"– Mr President, I wish to draw your attention to an episode which took place last week in Miami in the United States and on which I believe that, as a Chamber, we need to take a stand."
"A 44-year-old American with a history of psychiatric illnesses was flying with his wife from Miami to Orlando. Suddenly, for reasons as yet unknown, he felt the need to leave the aeroplane."
"He ran off the aeroplane and was followed by a policeman, who shouted at him to stop."
"When the passenger failed to comply with his orders, he was executed in cold blood in the embarkation area."
"Eye witnesses say that they heard up to six shots."
"This is the second execution which has taken place within a few months, following the unfortunate incident involving the Brazilian national in London."
"We therefore need to ask ourselves if this is the society that we wish to create, where the authorities shoot first and ask questions later."
"We are creating an unhealthy climate of fear for citizens which will result in unfortunate developments in the future."
"I therefore believe that, as a Chamber, we need to condemn such action and do our best to ensure that any legislation passed by this plenary is in favour of the citizen and not in favour of the use of violence."
"Mr President, the ‘Women in White’, who have been awarded the Sakharov Prize, as has been pointed out here this afternoon, have not been able to use the tickets that the European Parliament has made available to them so that they could come to pick up the prize on Wednesday, because they have not been authorised by the Cuban Government, which is a flagrant violation of these people’s rights and ignores, Mr President, the majority will of this Parliament."
"Mr President, the only way these people can be here on Wednesday is if they can catch tonight’s flight."
"I would ask you to do everything you possibly can to make this possible."
"Their only crime has been courageously and peacefully to defend the rights of their relatives and I therefore believe, Mr President, that we, as representatives of the European Parliament, should make every effort to ensure that they can be here and collect the Sakharov Prize on Wednesday."
"Mr Salafranca, you may rest assured that the Presidency and all the bodies of Parliament have done everything they can to put pressure on the Cuban authorities and ensure that this permission is granted."
"Minutes before entering the Chamber, I spoke once again to the recently appointed Cuban Ambassador to the European Union, who has presented his letters of credence this morning to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, and I hope to be able to speak to the Cuban Foreign Minister this afternoon."
"I cannot guarantee any result, but I would like you to rest assured that the Presidency has made every possible effort to ensure that the winners of the Sakharov Prize can come here to receive it."
"Mr President, the tasks that the EU has set itself include in particular the promotion of harmonised, balanced and sustainable development throughout the Community and the achievement of a high level of employment and social welfare, better quality of life and greater economic and social cohesion, together with increased solidarity between Member States."
"Anyone reading this list could be forgiven for thinking that we will soon live to see another heaven on earth."
"Yet the above-mentioned guiding principles bear no relation to the actual state of affairs, especially given the substantial cuts that have been made to the budget."
"This is particularly true as regards the situation in Poland, where unemployment stands at 20% and Polish people have lost their jobs as a result of the removal of obstacles to the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital."
"Such unemployment leads to poverty, hunger and despair, which are made all the worse by proposals to extend the transition periods."
"Such musings are truly paradoxical in the run-up to Christmas, particularly in view of the fact that Christian values are being rejected, along with the knowledge of the truth that sets us free."
"I hope that this truth will be fulfilled, and that this Christmas and New Year will be filled with hope and love."
"Mr President, at this time of looming budget crises and an increasingly depressing outlook for the Hong Kong talks, I would like to bring to the attention of the House an EU success story."
"The internet domain name ‘.eu’ has been available for businesses across Europe to register for since only 7 December and there have already been 100 000 applications from across our European continent."
"To my mind, this demonstrates an interest in a European designation for our companies and I look forward to many more applications when citizens can individually register in spring next year."
"As a proud Scot, I would like to see a specific Scottish presence in cyberspace and I believe your own country, Mr President, has shown us the way with the ‘puntCAT’ designation, which you so recently achieved for Catalonia."
"I would like to lend my support to the ‘.sco’ campaign, as a wider presence for Scottish language and culture in cyberspace could only be helpful for us."
"I look forward to us joining you in cyberspace, if not geographically."
"Mr President, I recently monitored the presidential election in Kazakhstan with a group of senior British politicians and academics."
"I have some experience in these matters, having monitored the election in Indonesia last year, which was probably the most complicated election the world had ever seen."
"The British group came to the conclusion that the elections in Kazakhstan were free and without coercion."
"Several other groups from Belgium, France, the CIS, the USA and Indonesia came to the same conclusion."
"The spokesman of one of the opposition candidates said after the election that the opposition had blown it by concentrating on personalities rather than policies."
"We completely disagreed with the conclusions of the OSCE monitoring group, which produced an expensive, dismissive and academically pompous report condemning the election process."
"The OSCE also contradicted the previous statement of the Members of this House following last year’s parliamentary election, which concluded that the Kazakh electorate is now sophisticated and beyond coercion or intimidation."
"I believe the OSCE report was influenced by its internal bureaucracy on the future chairmanship of the organisation."
"Bureaucrats should not attempt to play politics, nor try to dictate who the chairman should be."
"It will bring the OSCE into disrepute, a state of affairs not desired by this House."
"I would now call on this House to have an inquiry into the workings of the OSCE."
"Mr President, on my own behalf and on behalf of Mrs Madeira and Mr Pittella, I would call upon Mr Blair, represented on the Council’s bench, to put right the insult to our intelligence and to European democratic values of the discrimination in his financial proposal against the regions of the Algarve, Basilicata, Asturias, Murcia, Ceuta and Melilla compared to three German , three Greek regions and an Austrian region, which are suffering the same statistical effect, but which are being given better treatment."
"On 20 December, in Brussels, we will speak to you once again."
"Let us hope that, by then, this shameful and unacceptable discrimination has not materialised and that we will be able to congratulate him."
"– On 30 November, the Commission unveiled its proposals for fishing quotas and attendant measures for 2006, within the framework of the common fisheries policy, to be adopted by the end of the year."
"The Commission announced the objective of introducing, as far as possible, a gradual approach to the recovery of fish stocks that allows fishermen to pursue their activities."
"The Commission’s proposals for reducing the fishing effort do not, however, include any assessment of the economic and social costs to fishermen."
"The fisheries sector, particularly in Portugal, has already been severely hit by, among other factors, the increase in fuel prices."
"I therefore call for Community-level measures to be implemented in order to safeguard the future of the sector, not least because this is a common policy for supporting the income of fishermen, in particular those involved in small-scale coastal fishing."
"Mr President, work began several days ago on the construction of the Northern Gas Pipeline."
"This pipeline will harm the economic interests of the Baltic States and the Central European countries, including Poland, yet despite protests it will bypass these countries."
"Instead, it will link Russia and Germany directly, thus putting the energy security of one third of the EU at risk."
"The construction of this gas pipeline could cause an environmental disaster in the Baltic region."
"Stockpiles of German chemical weapons were dumped in the Baltic Sea after World War II, and these could be disturbed during work on the pipeline."
"The poisonous chemicals would pollute the waters of the Baltic."
"Even the conclusion of the agreement on this pipeline was nothing short of scandalous."
"According to media reports, Gerhard Schröder will head the company’s board of directors, with Matthias Warning taking the role of company chairman."
"Until 1990, Mr Warning was an officer in the Stasi, East Germany’s secret police, and it was during this period that he allegedly got to know Vladimir Putin, who was a KGB agent at the time."
"The fact that a former chancellor is to be involved in a company whose interests he defended so vociferously is suspicious in the extreme."
"I propose that a parliamentary committee should be appointed to investigate the issues surrounding the construction of this gas pipeline, as well as the threat that it poses to the environment and to the energy security of many EU Member States."
"You are aware of the procedures in place for calling formally for the creation of such a committee."
"If you wish to do so, you know how."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to take this opportunity today to say something about the debate that the Commission has instigated – a term that I use deliberately – on the Austrian ban on the use of wild animals in circuses."
"Paragraph 27 of the Austrian federal law on the protection of animals stipulates that no wild animal species may be kept by circuses, variety shows and similar forms of entertainment or used by them in performances."
"Far from congratulating Austria on doing something positive and taking the lead in this area, the Commission’s response was to send the Austrian Government an admonitory letter, in which it threatened to overturn the ban on circuses keeping wild animals – imposed not only by Austria but also applying to some degree in other EU Member States – on the grounds that the ban on performances by wild animals went against the free movement of services."
"One would have thought that the protection of animals was meant to be a value that was in the general interest and that this would be an argument justifying a restriction on the free movement of services."
"Traditional circuses are not meant to be founded upon the use of animals; there are highly celebrated circuses that manage to draw the crowds without performances by wild animals."
"Priority must be given to the protection and well-being of animals, whether we are talking in terms of the keeping of wild animals by circuses or the conditions under which animals are transported, which defy description."
"– Portugal has been devastated by company relocations, which have raised unemployment to alarming levels, a phenomenon that affects women in particular."
"On this occasion, the US multinational has just announced the closure of one of its units, the Linhó cable-making factory, which had employed 1 200 people and is now pressuring the remaining 300 to take redundancy."
"This is happening at a time when , a multinational corporation, was making a profit on its operations in Portugal, and an overall profit of millions of euro."
"Mr President, I should therefore like to call on the Council and the Commission, once again, to show solidarity with these workers and to take urgently-needed steps to prevent unemployment from becoming any worse and to put a stop to these brutal relocations of multinationals in various EU countries, not least in Portugal."
"Mr President, Italian colleagues will know that, a few days, ago, the international football player Marc Zoro had to leave the football pitch because of persistent racist abuse."
"This is something within the beautiful game, the European game, which is making the game ugly."
"Every day we see incidents across all our Member States of racist abuse: some of it organised, some of it isolated."
"There is no country in the European Union which is exempt from this phenomenon."
"UEFA and MEPs are determined to stamp it out."
"We have practical measures, working with the media, to stamp out this cancer from the game."
"Recently, Italian television played some of its matches in black and white rather than in colour to make the point to Italian society and to all of European society that we must not tolerate racism in football."
"We have the World Cup next year: let us send a unified message from this House that we will not tolerate the beautiful game becoming ugly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, given that it will soon be Christmas, it is only right and proper to wish all the Members of this House the very best."
"I wish you every good fortune, and I hope that a spirit of honesty and truth will guide us in our policy-making."
"Faced as we are today with the British Presidency’s proposals, which quite clearly operate against the basic interests of the 10 new Member States, we have no choice but to ask ourselves a searching question."
"How can it have been possible for one of the richest countries in this European Union, a Union which is still being developed, to have devised a system whereby the poorer countries have to give money to the richer ones, and whereby development programmes are designed in such a way as to ensure that poor countries foot the bill?"
"Poland spent 150 billion in order to come into line with EU requirements before accession, and I must therefore register my protest in the name of honesty, truth and cohesion."
"The European Union cannot develop further without solidarity."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make an appeal to the Union’s institutions, be they the Commission, Parliament or the Council, because the Italian Court of Appeal – which is, accordingly, a high judicial authority in Italy – has just considered, in a judgment issued following an act of aggression by an Italian towards some young Colombian girls, that the term ‘dirty nigger’ did not constitute a racist insult, but merely a generic show of hostility."
"It is pointless telling you that those words are particularly alarming."
"My colleague who spoke before me brought up the issue of football terraces."
"For his part, the Italian Minister for Institutional Reform, Mr Roberto Calderoli, believes that immigrants should return to their desert to speak to the camels, and to the jungle to dance with the monkeys – and this from a minister who sits on the European Union’s Council of Ministers!"
"There are, I am afraid to say, a large number of verbal , and we must not tolerate them."
"Something else is taking place here: a judicial institution is clearly underestimating a racist offence."
"I believe that this is extremely serious as far as our history is concerned."
"I should therefore like a reaction from our institutions."
"Mr President, early yesterday morning I was present at the unprecedented fire near Hemel Hempstead."
"It is perhaps worth recording that not a single fatality was reported as a result of this extraordinary incident."
"I would hope that the Commission might find itself in a position to liaise with the British authorities when it comes to investigating what might have been the cause, so that any wisdom that emerges could be shared throughout our 25 Member States."
"Let me, on behalf of my constituents, send my thanks to the emergency services – firemen, the police and ambulance crews – and indeed to local residents, who behaved, as you might imagine, with tremendous courage and dignity."
"Those British people who queued up at petrol stations, fearing that there might be a shortage of petrol, behaved with rather less dignity."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Italy has been at the centre of today’s debate; in the wake of the Zoro case, it is not considered an offence to say ‘dirty nigger’."
"The political responsibilities in all of this are clear."
"A footballer even came on to the pitch exalting fascist symbols."
"I believe that all this comes down to a clear responsibility on the part of the political authorities, which increasingly tend to criminalise immigration."
"By way of example, I should like to mention a very serious incident that took place only two days ago: in Italy, a Moroccan citizen, who was suspected of being a dangerous terrorist and had been subjected to two trials and acquitted both times, was expelled from Italian soil because he was judged to be a threat to national security."
"I believe that this is a serious matter, insofar as we have no precise details about where this Moroccan citizen ended up; it would appear that he is now being held in a Moroccan prison in which human rights are notoriously overlooked."
"I believe that the Member States must not be party to acts of torture carried out in non-EU countries."
"Mr President, I wish to make some remarks concerning the enlargement of the WTO."
"In November 2005, the Russian state-owned pipeline company Transneft terminated the long-term transport agreement with the Kazakhstan company KazMunaiGaz, as it is now negotiating the acquisition of the shares of a Lithuanian oil refinery and a long-term contract for oil transit, which appears in contradiction with Russia’s expansionist plans."
"Russia recently placed a ban on imports of plant products from Lithuania and now from Poland."
"Both are being openly punished for their support of Ukraine."
"The notorious Yukos case shows the lack of rule of law, an independent judiciary, guarantees for private business and predictability of trade."
"Then there is the expropriation of the lifelong savings of ordinary Lithuanian people by Moscow in 1990."
"These facts challenge any credibility Russia has in international finance and business matters."
"The EU might feel that Russia is not yet mature enough to be a member of the WTO."
"Mr President, I simply wished to point out that, four weeks ago, we spoke in this House about the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor imprisoned in Libya."
"Since then, the judgment they were awaiting has been pushed back to 31 January."
"Since then, we have learned that, in 2005, as part of the fight against AIDS, the European Union sent more than EUR 1 million for the children who had been contaminated in Benghazi Hospital."
"Since then, we have learned that Libya is awaiting even more money before it makes a gesture."
"Since then, no authorisation has been given to go and visit these women and this man in prison in Libya."
"Since then – and this is my final point – four weeks have gone by in the lives of this man and these women who have been accused and tortured and who, for seven years, have been waiting to be treated fairly, in accordance with their human rights."
"Mr President, for as long as they remain imprisoned, we must go on pointing this out."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, almost 18 months have passed since the last elections to the European Parliament."
"Enough time has therefore gone by for us to have formed opinions on the way Parliament operates, and on the role and significance of the European Union."
"Although we have no problems passing resolutions supporting democracy and human rights in third countries, I regret to say that unfortunately we are not capable of enforcing our own rights as effectively."
"One of the European Union’s fundamental principles is partnership, and yet this is the principle that is most frequently overlooked."
"The principle of consultation was also violated during the recent scrutiny of the planned sugar market reform."
"Decisions were taken on this matter while the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was still drafting Parliament’s opinion."
"A large part of the responsibility for this dismissive treatment of Parliament and its Members lies with the main groups in the House."
"These latter are so embroiled in petty squabbles that they are blind to the fact that Parliament’s importance is waning."
"A situation has arisen in which the work carried out by Members from small or new Member States is increasingly meaningless."
"Members from these countries find it enormously difficult to get their names onto the list of speakers, and their proposals and amendments are more often than not rejected, either by the leading delegations within the House or by the European Commission."
"This gives rise to some fundamental questions, such as where we are heading and what the point of our work is."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the last few days, dumbfounded European citizens have been following accusations about the CIA's secret detention centres in Europe, about the kidnapping of terrorist suspects, about secret flights by American aeroplanes and about torture chambers."
"The illegal action of a major state such as the United States of America on an independent continent such as Europe and the violation of human rights are an insult to Europe, which gave birth to democracy and secured freedom, the presumption of innocence and security three centuries ago with the declaration of human rights."
"It is, at the same time, ironic that these discoveries coincide with the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"The century we are living in has a great many achievements to show."
"Nonetheless, this is the first time that two of the most important rights – security and freedom – have clashed in the international arena to such an extent and intensity, crushing human rights between them."
"Someone once said that democracy is when someone knocks on your door at dawn and you know it is the milkman."
"The European Parliament, the institution that represents European citizens, has at the very least an obligation to raise itself up to its full height and safeguard the feeling of freedom and security of the citizens of Europe."
"Forgive me for interrupting you, but the time scheduled for these speeches has run out."
"Mr President, on a point of order, may I suggest that you extend the time available for this one-minute speech?"
"Yes, I believe it is right to do that, but we have already done so: we have already extended it for half an hour; we can extend it further, if necessary, but we have already, rather than half an hour, extended it for three quarters of an hour in fact."
"Twelve more people wish to speak and I cannot carry on giving the floor to Members who have spoken during previous sittings."
"I would ask for your understanding."
"We must move on to the next item on the agenda."
"Members who have not been able to speak will have priority next time."
"Mr President, I do not propose to prolong this issue, but I believe that the rules you are implementing in relation to these one-minute speeches are undermining their effectiveness and importance to individual Members of this House, many of whom, because they come from small delegations, have little or no opportunity to put on record constituents’ current concerns."
"I am one of those who most often use the one-minute interventions, with good reason."
"I do not have other Members from my delegation to stand up on my behalf, as larger delegations do."
"I feel, therefore, that there is unfairness in the way this matter is being addressed."
"I will write to you about my concerns on this, but I believe in the importance of the one-minute interventions."
"It was a new arrangement, introduced in the last parliamentary term – indeed, I was one of those who proposed it – in order to ensure that this House could be relevant to the day-to-day concerns of citizens."
"Often this Parliament is not, because of the long lead-in time for issues to be debated in this House."
"I would appreciate it if you would be open to amending the way in which this matter is being handled."
"Mr De Rossa, I am prepared to change the rules we have established."
"I would like to remind you that I sent a letter to all of you some time ago now, explaining how I intended to manage this difficult point in our proceedings."
"I did not receive any objections, but we can review the rules at any time, that is to say, if you feel there is any way to improve them, please believe me that I will be delighted to listen."
"I have not given you the floor today, Mr De Rossa, because you have been lucky enough to speak during the two previous sittings, as you are very well aware, and I have taken the view that I should give priority to Members who have spoken previously."
"The next item is the report by Diana Wallis, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the request for defence of the immunity and privileges of Bruno Gollnisch (2005/2072(IMM)) (A6-0376/2005)."
". Mr President, I use this time as rapporteur to report to the House the decision of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"I make no secret that this was a difficult case for the committee."
"It was one where our colleague, Mr Gollnisch, came to us to ask us, as a Parliament, to give him the benefit of this Parliament’s immunity."
"I should also like to thank him for his courtesy and cooperation with the committee’s inquiries."
"Mr Gollnisch has found himself prosecuted under French law – the law of his home Member State – for words he used at a press conference which, it is alleged, form something like Holocaust denial."
"The committee considered this matter over several meetings and finally came to the decision, by a large and persuasive majority, that it would not be appropriate in this case to give him the benefit of this House’s immunity."
"The committee felt that the circumstances in which he had used the words complained of by the French prosecutor were not circumstances where it could be said fairly and squarely that he was only exercising his mandate as a Member of this House or carrying out his duties as a Member of this House."
"That being the case, it was not within the remit of the committee to enquire any further, and the committee made its decision on that basis."
"Therefore, we decline to give Mr Gollnisch the benefit of parliamentary immunity of this House, and that is the committee’s recommendation to the Presidency and to the House."
". Whether or not Mr Gollnisch holds on to his immunity is a delicate subject."
"I decided not to shirk my responsibilities in order to tell Mr Gollnisch, publicly and quite frankly, why I will not defend his immunity."
"There is a strong temptation to express an opinion about the content of the remarks attributed to the member."
"There is a strong temptation to want only to remember the martyrdom of the Jewish people, by dismissing the only debate worth having, that of the conditions governing the application of parliamentary immunity."
"There is a strong temptation to reject the defence of Mr Gollnisch’s immunity by regarding him solely as the representative of an ideology which nearly all of this Assembly rejects and in opposition to which the European project was conceived on the basis of the European idea."
"Conversely, there may well be a strong temptation to call for this defence of immunity as part of a corporatist reflex to make sure that no remarks can be held against any one of us."
"I call on you not to give in to these temptations and not to transform a technical debate into a debate belonging to historians."
"Our Assembly is not a court."
"Mrs Wallis’ report is balanced."
"She reminds us that immunity is not designed to protect Members of the European Parliament, but to protect the integrity of the European Parliament, through its representatives, and to give them the independence with which to carry out their tasks."
"There is no doubt that, in Lyon, in the heart of the university where he teaches, far from his constituency in north-east France, Mr Gollnisch was not speaking as a Member of the European Parliament."
"Mr Gollnisch lives dangerously, constantly on the razor’s edge."
"This form of political life is, in reality, peculiar to the extreme right-wing in France and Germany."
"Mr Gollnisch is far too cultivated and intelligent not to have realised that his remarks were in danger of being condemned by French law."
"If he must rush headlong into a legal tussle in order to remain faithful to what he believes is right, then it is advisable that he does not drag our Parliamentary institution into the matter by involving it in a debate in which it does not belong."
"The request for defence of immunity, which was put together with your consent, Mr Gollnisch, is halfway between a call for help with no legal basis, given that this procedure does not in any way threaten to prevent you from carrying out your duties, and, as I see it, a baffling attempt to shirk your responsibilities, just as though you were at last overcome with panic at the thought of what you knowingly triggered off and clearly no longer control."
"I feel no hatred for you, any more than I wish to support you, as a Member of the European Parliament, in this ordeal that you knowingly brought about."
"It is down to you, on your own, to accept the consequences."
"It is not perhaps too late for you to change and to make peace with France, Europe and our painful past."
"I hope that you succeed in doing this."
"The European Parliament cannot do it for you …"
". Mr President, let me start by expressing profuse thanks to our rapporteur, Mrs Wallis."
"There are various members of the Legal Affairs Committee who deal with immunity cases, but I believe that this case was a particularly difficult and delicate one, which demanded very careful consideration on the Committee’s part; nor do I believe, if I read the signs rightly, that this was particularly easy for her personally."
"We, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, supported the rapporteur’s conclusions."
"We too believe that the immunity conferred by membership of this House should not apply in this case."
"I would also like to add a personal observation."
"What was once the Mauthausen concentration camp is situated on my home patch, which is also my electoral district."
"If you still have any doubts about whether these concentration camps actually existed, I am more than willing to invite you to join me on a visit to it."
"You will find people who survived it still living in the area; where I come from is also home to people who helped the few who managed to escape from it; one woman who did so is being honoured here today."
"I would like these remarks to be taken as honouring her memory."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mrs Wallis on Mr Gollnisch’s request for defence of immunity is, both in its form and its content, truly scandalous."
"It is scandalous because the legal rules and the settled case-law of our Rules of Procedure and of the Committee on Legal Affairs have never before been so warped and violated."
"It is scandalous because the matter presented before the Committee on Legal Affairs was the subject of unprecedented politicisation and political pressure on the part of Mr Gollnisch’s political opponents."
"It has taken no less than four draft reports, all differing each time in their conclusions and reasoning, to come up with the report presented before us today in plenary, which is not, I might add, the report of which the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs had voted in favour, as the reasons behind the decision proposed by Mrs Wallis have subsequently been amended."
"The argument put forward by the report in support of the decision not to defend Mr Gollnisch’s immunity and privileges is that he was not using his freedom of expression in carrying out his duties when he spoke at the press conference held in his political premises in Lyon on 11 October 2004."
"What hypocrisy and what lies!"
"The written invitation to Mr Gollnisch’s press conference mentioned, next to his name, his status as a Member of the European Parliament."
"The majority of the press reports referred to his status as a Member of the European Parliament."
"Moreover, the subjects successively addressed by Mr Gollnisch were connected with Europe, whether they were the issue of Turkey’s joining Europe, the ratification process of the European Constitutional Treaty or, furthermore, the so-called Rousso report mainly related to certain academics’ political opinions on the history of the Second World War in Europe."
"The settled case-law of the Committee on Legal Affairs in relation to opinions voiced by Members of the European Parliament tends, in this case, towards the systematic protection of immunity."
"Far more serious precedents involving prosecutions for libel, slander, uprisings against the police or even contempt of court have resulted in the immunity of a Member of the European Parliament being upheld."
"Yet, this has not been the case for our colleague Mr Gollnisch, thus undermining the independence and the freedom of expression of all Members."
"Make no mistake: if this report were to be adopted in plenary, the freedom of expression of all Members of the European Parliament would be restricted and subject to the discretion of others; a new interpretation of the waiver of immunity for opinions voiced by Members in the course of their duties would be adopted; and Europe’s oh so precious democracy and fundamental values would lose their hauteur."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that it should at last be possible for us to voice our opinions on Mr Gollnisch’s immunity, as this series of postponements of our vote has lasted too long."
"We have spent long enough evaluating the facts."
"I will not repeat in this House these facts exactly as they stand, but I want to emphasise that it is entirely right to support Mrs Wallis’ report, which proposes waiving Mr Gollnisch’s immunity for several reasons."
"The first, and by no means least important, reason is that Mr Gollnisch did not make the incriminating remarks as a Member of the European Parliament."
"The immunity enjoyed by all Members of the European Parliament is designed to protect their freedom of expression in the exercise of their duties. In this case, Mr Gollnisch was not exercising his parliamentary duties."
"Immunity does not equal irresponsibility, just as freedom of expression cannot be used to justify intolerable behaviour."
"The second reason is that, in the case in point, the values of the European Union that we, as Members of the European Parliament, are supposed to defend, have been scorned."
"Far – very far – from these humanist values, Mr Gollnisch, who is a good pupil of Mr Le Pen, tried to rival his master in the provocation stakes with the remarks he made at that press conference."
"We must therefore strongly condemn these remarks."
"Finally, the third and final reason is that, in the arguments put forward by Mr Gollnisch, there is no indication whatsoever of Being unable to accept the consequences of his remarks, Mr Gollnisch claims to be a victim of petty political proceedings designed to remove him from the political scene."
"That is a bit rich when viewed in the light of the extremely shocking remarks he made in, I am convinced, full knowledge of the blows he was dealing to our democracy."
"Mr President, Article 7 states that I cannot speak in the debate."
"I do not intend to speak in the debate, but Article 7 allows me nonetheless to correct an inaccurate allegation."
"The third subparagraph of Article 7(8) allows me to speak on the basis of Article 145, and Article 145 gives me three minutes in which to make a personal statement."
"If you will allow me, Mr President, and without my speaking in the debate, the outcome of which is, in any case, a foregone conclusion, I should like, as provided for by Article 7, to speak for three minutes on the basis of Article 145 in order to voice my opinion on accusations directed at me personally."
"Consequently, I am not speaking with reference to the content of the debate, but simply with reference to allegations made about me by some of the speakers."
"Mrs Bachelot believed she could say – and this is a widespread opinion – that I had spoken in the heart of the university."
"That is totally incorrect."
"The remarks for which I have been criticised were made at a press conference organised in the context of my political duties, during which, as another speaker, Mrs Schenardi, said, I answered journalists’ questions, a point that is not seriously disputed."
"If I do not have the right to give these kinds of answers, then journalists should not have the right to ask questions about the history of the Second World War."
"That seems quite clear to me, and I did not say those words as an academic even though the academic authorities, by order of the French Government, tried to undermine my presumption of innocence and were condemned for doing so by the Council of State, our highest court."
"Secondly, Mrs Berger suggested that I had denied the fact that the concentration camps, and particularly the Mauthausen camp, ever existed."
"Mrs Berger, I have never denied the fact that the concentration camps existed, and certainly not the Mauthausen camp."
"The existence of the gas chambers at Mauthausen was denied by Mr Lanzmann, the director of the film ‘Shoah’, and not by myself who, on the contrary, said loud and clear that they existed."
"I believe that these two clarifications are, Mr President, extremely important."
"As for any possible recantations and procrastinations by the Commission, I personally played no part whatsoever in this affair."
"I will point out, as my colleague said, that the President of the French Republic, Mr Chirac, recently asserted that there could be no official historical truth."
"I question how it is that I can be criticised for remarks that have just been repeated by the Head of State, the head of the judiciary, and how it is that I can have the legal proceedings against me justified on the basis of a communist law, the Gayssot law, which Mr Toubon described as a Stalinist law when it was adopted."
"It will be interesting to see what Mr Toubon has to say on the subject of my immunity."
"That is all I had to say to this Assembly."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators and repealing Directive 91/157/EEC (5694/5/2005 – C6-0268/2005 – 2003/0282(COD)) – Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Rapporteur: Joahnnes Blokland (A6-0335/2005)."
". – Mr President, the report on batteries and accumulators has been adopted by a large majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"This Committee is of the opinion that the 41 amendments to this report have changed the Council’s common position for the better."
"We in the Committee are yet to agree on one key aspect, though, namely the reduction in the use of the heavy metals mercury, cadmium and lead in some batteries."
"This House adopted a clear stance in this area at first reading, after which apparently, objections were raised, or should I say, after which the battery producers engaged in some serious lobbying."
"In order to reach agreement after all, I tabled an amended proposal, namely Amendment 42, which is a watered-down version of the amendment adopted at first reading."
"I would like to make three points in connection with the restriction of the ban on heavy metals."
"First of all, Amendment 42 confines the cadmium ban to portable batteries; the ban does not, therefore, apply to any industrial batteries whatever."
"The exception made for industrial batteries at first reading proved insufficient for industry, because it believes that an unacceptable number of these batteries would end up in the risk zone."
"For the sake of clarity, my Amendment 42 takes industrial batteries out of the risk zone completely."
"Secondly, thanks to Amendment 42, the ban on lead is also restricted to portable batteries, which means that industrial lead accumulators also completely fall outside of the scope of the ban."
"Thirdly, a number of categories of portable batteries are exempt from the ban on lead."
"This applies to button cells, and batteries for hearing aids are no longer at risk either."
"We have thereby taken on board the comments made by the Foundation for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing."
"Fourthly, since the cadmium ban on portable tools has been suspended for four years, this will give us plenty of time to make the complete switch to Li-ion- and NiMH batteries as alternatives to NiCd batteries."
"These alternatives have been widely available for nearly 10 years."
"I have noticed that both the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have tabled a similar amendment to Article 4, the gist of which I can endorse."
"Finally, I should like to turn to three other areas, namely definitions, producer responsibility and batteries integrated in appliances."
"With regard to definitions, I take the view that these should be included in an article and not in a recital."
"That is why I am opposed to Amendments 46, 48 and 50."
"The Council’s common position remains vague in some aspects of the definition of portable batteries."
"The phrase ‘portable’ is subjective and the Committee on the Environment would therefore prefer a definition that sets a clear limit."
"Amendment 12 specifies a maximum weight of 1 kg for portable batteries."
"Moreover, Amendment 12 makes the link with consumer applications as defined in the directive on electronic waste."
"In order to avoid both a loophole and an overlap in the definitions, the Committee on the Environment has proposed in Amendment 13 a mirror definition of portable batteries by way of defining industrial batteries."
"The Committee on the Environment is of the opinion that Amendments 12 and 13 afford most clarity about those definitions."
"As for producer responsibility, I have to say that this is a guiding principle for various other directives as well as for the battery directive."
"In this respect, I agree with the Council’s common position."
"In Amendment 44, though, the suggestion of shared responsibility is mooted."
"This leads, in practice, to much confusion and its implementation is very complex."
"I take the view that we must uphold producer responsibility and am therefore opposed to Amendment 44."
"Amendments 18 and 40 ban the integration of batteries and introduce the requirement that batteries should be easy to remove."
"This appears to be a good thing on the face of it, but I gather that many applications will get into difficulty as a result, especially if the battery outlives the appliance."
"Moreover, this provision is superfluous, since the directive on electronic waste already stipulates that batteries should always be removed before electrical appliances are collected."
"On behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I would advise the plenary, while giving due consideration to the remarks I have made, to endorse the amendments to the report tomorrow."
". Mr President, I would like to thank the European Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, for this report."
"Today, the existing Community legislation on batteries only covers a small part of all the portable batteries sold annually in the European Union."
"This has hindered the setting-up of efficient national collection and recycling schemes."
"Consequently, many batteries placed on the Community market today still risk ending up in the environment, in incineration or in landfills."
"To address that problem, the Commission presented a new legislative proposal for batteries in 2003 that would extend the scope of existing Community legislation from batteries containing certain dangerous substances to all batteries placed on the Community market."
"In its proposal, the Commission introduced the concept of a ‘closed-loop system’, on the basis of which all batteries would have to be collected and recycled and their metals re-introduced into the economic cycle."
"At the same time, the proposal aimed to contribute to a proper functioning of the internal market for batteries and create a level playing field of all economic operators involved."
"At first reading, the European Parliament did not embrace this concept of a closed loop."
"Instead, Parliament preferred to have a ban on certain heavy metals used in batteries."
"The Council also considered that the proposed closed-loop system would be difficult to achieve in practice and favoured a ban on the use of cadmium in portable batteries."
"The Commission has accepted the overall package of the common position as a well-balanced package, on the condition that the level of environmental protection should not be lowered compared to the policy measures contained in the Commission’s original proposal."
"Even though the Commission has embraced the common position as it stands, there are several issues that could benefit from further improvements, in particular regarding the definitions of different battery types and the collection targets."
"However, the Commission remains convinced that the dual legal basis in the common position is the right approach and will not give rise to problems foreseen by some in Parliament."
"I am confident that the rest of the codecision process will allow a further fine-tuning of the right mix of policy measures, which are needed to protect our environment from battery pollution in the most eco-efficient way."
". Mr President, my group welcomes the batteries directive as an important first attempt to take these potentially environmentally damaging substances out of the waste stream."
"Starting first with the collection targets, my group doubts whether there is any point in pretending that many Member States can go further than the collection rate set out in the Council common position."
"Let us be frank about this: as the Commission impact assessment states, only six Member States currently have a national system of collecting small batteries for recycling – Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Holland and Sweden."
"Austria has achieved 40% collection after 14 years."
"The common position calls for a collection rate of 25% after 6 years and 40% after 10 years."
"In the context of what we know about the countries that do collect batteries, that seems reasonable."
"The report now calls for higher targets: 40% after 6 years and 50% after 12 years."
"From the point of view of Member States which, for whatever reason, have never given battery recycling a high priority, these totals are unrealistic and, if set, will simply not be reached."
"This is neither the time nor the place for gesture politics."
"Delaying the directive by wrangling over unrealistic targets does nobody any good."
"Secondly, the rapporteur is moving his Amendment 42, calling for bans on lead and cadmium in power tool batteries."
"We believe that any such moves need to comply in the first instance with the common approach to impact assessment, recently agreed between the Commission, Council and Parliament."
"In this instance, Parliament, at my instigation, asked outside experts to draw up an impact assessment, but this was itself limited in its scope."
"We need a full assessment of the social, environmental and economic impact of any such bans before we agree to introduce them."
"Until we have that full assessment, it would be irresponsible to follow the rapporteur’s lead, because we would be law-making in the dark."
"Finally, as far as the legal base is concerned, we support the proposal that the directive should be based on Articles 175 and 95."
"We believe that basing this directive on Article 175 alone would run the risk of distorting the market, because individual countries could strengthen the prohibitions contained in it."
"I am confident that this directive represents a major change of direction and of public habits for many European countries."
"We should have turned to specific battery collection long ago."
"I hope we can now put this proposal into operation as soon as possible."
"Mr President, because our shadow rapporteur, Mr Jørgensen, cannot be in the Chamber today, it is I who have the pleasure of speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"I wish to begin by thanking Mr Blokland for his very constructive work."
"He has tabled many amendments supported by our group."
"Battery use is increasing more and more, and it is therefore that much more pressing a matter to react now in order to ensure that the most environmentally friendly technology is used and that those batteries that are most dangerous to the environment are banned and phased out."
"That is why we are well disposed to the proposal before us, even though we believe that the level of ambition should be higher than that proposed by the Council."
"The use of the heavy metals mercury, cadmium and lead in batteries must be limited as far as possible."
"Parliament must therefore tighten up the Council proposal now before us."
"Cadmium, mercury and lead are already banned in materials and vehicle parts marketed after 1 July 2003, as well as in new electrical and electronic equipment etc marketed after 1 July 2006."
"It is therefore quite natural that we should now go further in banning the use of cadmium in batteries."
"It is particularly important that the exemption relating to cadmium in batteries and accumulators used in hand tools be changed into a ban after a four–year transitional period."
"There are sound alternatives to using cadmium in such tools."
"I have one here in my hand , and – as I hope everyone can hear – it works splendidly."
"You only have to take a closer look at it in order not to swallow what the lobbyists in the corridors are trying to delude you into believing."
"There are practical alternatives, produced by quite a few manufacturers."
"These include not only tools for private use but also heavy-duty tools for professional use."
"Be in no doubt about this."
"You only have to go onto the manufacturers’ own websites to see for yourselves."
"Why should we release a whole lot of cadmium unnecessarily?"
"Why should we not demand that the most environmentally friendly alternatives be used?"
"A ban on the use of cadmium in the batteries for these tools would produce great environmental benefits."
"Moreover, it is important for European competitiveness that when the time is ripe - as it really is now - we boost the development of new technology through legislation on environmentally friendly technology."
"We also think that the collection targets proposed by the Council have been set too low."
"We wish to raise these, and we think, just like the rapporteur, that it is the legal base constituted by Article 175 that has to apply in this draft legislation because the legislation is aimed precisely and solely at bringing about a better environment."
". Mr President, I would like to concentrate on the three core aspects of this directive, those being its legal basis, the ban on cadmium, and the collection targets."
"This directive has as its priority objective the reduction and avoidance of waste batteries, but we cannot overlook the fact that it is also an example of product-oriented legislation for the internal market."
"The fact that it has Article 175 as its sole legal basis could result in varying standards and hence in distortions of competition and of the market."
"It is for that reason that the Liberals support Articles 95 and 175 as a dual legal basis, and in so doing we are doing as the Legal Affairs Committee has recommended."
"In both the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Council, a ban on cadmium and mercury was adopted only in relation to portable batteries."
"Our group is not in favour of there being any further bans on marketing or of the ban on cadmium being extended to, for example, tools without cables or medical equipment."
"The example of power tools is always being quoted, and I will say now, particularly for the benefit of Mr Schlyter and also Mrs Westlund, that there are of course alternatives to nickel-cadmium available for those, but every kind of technology has its advantages and disadvantages."
"In the case of rechargeable batteries and accumulators, which amount in any case to only a very small quantity of waste, we have to consider other characteristics as well, such as energy efficiency, useful life and, of course, the price that the consumer has to pay for them."
"The presence of an alternative on the market does not necessarily mean that it is an adequate substitute."
"The actual amount of cadmium that we in Europe absorb through our environment is considerably below the level regarded by the WHO as harmful to health, and it is worth noting that only about one per cent of it comes from batteries."
"Let me conclude by considering the collection targets."
"The Council is not aiming very high with its targets of 25% after six years and 45% after ten, but it has to be said that the 40% and 60% respectively on which we agreed in the Committee are not realistic; the quotas in some Member States are under 10%."
"In Germany, over ten years of all-out effort have enabled us to achieve 35%."
"It follows that it is important that we review the collection targets in six years’ time and, in so doing, learn from the experience and best practice in the Member States."
"Finally, I would like to emphasise that all stakeholders bear a responsibility for this; while we must not dump the costs of collection on the retail trade, we do have to oblige traders to collect!"
"Mr President, thank you, Mr Blokland, for trying to improve this proposal."
"It is about an environmental issue, and Article 175 is the natural legal base."
"It is also about consumers and the confidence they can have in the products they buy."
"I therefore want to see Amendment 38 on guaranteed capacity labelling applied to all batteries."
"I have these two items with me today."
"On this one , it was impossible to see from the packaging how long the batteries would last. It was, however, possible to do so on this one ."
"This screwdriver contains nickel cadmium, while this one ( contains nickel metal hydride."
"This blue one only manages to put in this many screws , with each screw representing ten screws."
"The red nickel metal hydride screwdriver managed to put in all these screws – more than twice as many."
"That is not, however, something one could have known when buying this one."
"This is a case of consumers’ being sold poor and old-fashioned technology by companies that are at present duping them."
"When products are not labelled, consumers are duped even more."
"I am not the only one to have carried out this test."
"Swedish consumer organisations have looked at nickel metal hydride batteries after 500 chargings."
"What, then, we are concerned with here are lifespan and economy, its being apparent that these batteries last on average more than twice as long after 500 chargings."
"Why should Europe lag behind in terms of technology transfer?"
"What kind of export market are we to have with poor, old-fashioned technology?"
"It is time to dump nickel cadmium and time to vote in favour of Amendment 54."
"The industry says that nickel cadmium batteries are necessary in these types of machine."
"The best machine on the market is capable of being used for a maximum of 18 minutes and 20 seconds as opposed to 2 minutes and 45 seconds."
"It is new battery technology that benefits the consumer and is good for the environment."
"In contrast, old technology makes things worse for consumers and the environment."
"Seventy-five per cent of all refined cadmium is, in actual fact, used in batteries. This is a small portion of the total amount of cadmium."
"Other use of cadmium is not, however, intentional."
"It is a side effect that we must deal with and eliminate in other ways."
"What we are concerned with at present is batteries, and cadmium in batteries needs to be got rid of."
". Mr President, the process of storing and releasing energy requires the presence of many metals and toxic compounds that play a part in the functioning of batteries and accumulators."
"Batteries constitute a particularly hazardous category of municipal waste, since many of their components have an adverse impact on both the environment and human health."
"The binning of billions of spent batteries, which then end up in municipal landfills and in groundwater, represents a particular threat when they contain cadmium, lead or mercury."
"Battery collection schemes have been a success in several Member States thanks to diverse and long-standing endeavours."
"Poland is starting from a much less advantageous position where such collections are concerned, however, as it is less advanced in terms of technology and information provision."
"This situation is aggravated by the fact that manufacturers and distributors prefer to pay a product fee rather than to take steps to collect and recycle batteries."
"Thanks to the efforts of environmentalists, containers for spent batteries can now be found in many institutions, and even more progress has been made with the collection of accumulators."
"The amendments to the Directive ensure that any negative impact of batteries and accumulators on the environment is kept to a minimum, as well as prohibiting the use of cadmium and mercury."
"At the same time, however, some of the changes could make accumulator manufacturers in the EU much less competitive than manufacturers outside Europe who do not have to comply with such restrictive regulations."
"This will mean not only lower-quality batteries and accumulators, but also lower prices."
"The end result of this could be a threat to the environment and to the health of users, in particular young children."
"–The primary aim of this directive is to minimise the negative impact of batteries and accumulators and their waste, in order to help protect the environment and improve the quality of the environment."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for raising this issue and for producing the report."
"The primary emphasis of the directive should be on the stimulation and development of research for suitable substitutes, not on the restrictive prohibition of batteries containing dangerous substances, such as lead, nickel, cadmium, or zinc."
"Our decision must be based on scientific knowledge, and we should carefully consider the consequences before taking it."
"It is not sensible to rely on mass as the sole indicator of restriction, and simply to ignore the issue of battery use."
"We need to know what constitutes the greatest risk: using a hazardous battery or removing it from circulation."
"As an example of this, consider the batteries used in aircraft safety lighting or lift safety systems, both of which would be prohibited under the current proposals."
"We should focus our attention on collecting all used batteries and on raising public awareness."
"We must improve the current figures for used battery collection in EU Member States, which are truly alarming."
"Our best contribution to the protection of the environment would be to make people realise that batteries are not ordinary waste."
"Finally, I would like to voice an opinion on the issue of legal basis."
"Of course, it is necessary to protect the environment, but reliance on Article 175 as the sole legal basis may lead to unfair competition through the application of different legal standards in different Member States."
"In my view a dual legal basis would combine both objectives: the protection of the environment and the free and unrestricted movement of goods."
"These days our lives are surrounded by accumulators and batteries."
"As our energy and even renewable energy consumption increases and our mobility requirements escalate, we use an increasing number of accumulators and batteries."
"Obviously, this is not the problem – the problem is that these materials and technologies often have complex components and often contain toxic substances, as well, which we do not collect or dispose of safely after use."
"With our current waste material technologies, these substances, when burned or disposed of, will sooner or later find their way into our bodies, accumulate and cause severe diseases."
"Many countries, including my own, have only started to collect these materials recently, and thus the collection targets proposed by the Commission and Council seem to be realistic."
"It is another question whether distributors ought to have an obligation to collect, as well, or whether compulsory collection should be restricted to manufacturers only."
"The latter has proved to be a successful system for the other recyclable materials in our country, but this may obviously be a matter of different waste management practices in each Member State."
"However, collection is not sufficient – these materials must be recycled, a requirement that involves considerable technology advancement and significant research and development."
"The current practice of a few Member States in this respect is strongly questionable."
"My country has not yet managed to set up any accumulator-processing plants, and our accumulators are disposed of in Slovenia and Italy, while Hungary purchases large amounts of lead for its battery and accumulator manufacturing industry."
"I do not think that this is sustainable, either, and each Member State should have its own facilities not only for collection, but also for disposal."
"And our task is to encourage technology development and promote the replacement of dangerous substances."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has wanted the ban on cadmium and the restriction on the use of this heavy material since 1988."
"With each piece of legislation, such as those relating to end-of-life vehicles or to electric and electronic products, our Parliament has highlighted one basic principle: the use of cadmium must be prohibited, and this product must only remain in those instances where there is no alternative."
"Ever since the beginning, that has been the substitution principle, the principle underpinning the draft REACH Directive, which mobilised us some time ago."
"Like other sectors, the REACH Directive excludes batteries, on the grounds that a suitable directive must precisely enable us to gauge the work done by Parliament."
"I therefore strongly urge us to apply the substitution principle to batteries containing cadmium."
"Mr Blokland explained at length the difficulties he had in winning acceptance for an ambitious point of view, and his willingness to make compromises must be welcomed. We support it."
"Nevertheless, it seems to me that it should be possible for our Parliament to accept a basic principle."
"If a technology exists on the market that can offer an alternative to nickel-cadmium batteries or to batteries containing cadmium – be they, for that matter, what are known as portable batteries or industrial batteries – then we must ban cadmium."
"Mr Blokland tried to list what was already available on the market."
"There are emerging technologies, particularly nickel-zinc technology for industrial batteries."
"I therefore call on you to accept Amendment 4, tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, which proposes that, in the event of an alternative technology for industrial batteries appearing on the market, a revision of the directive be got under way."
"This seems to me to be the absolute minimum requirement if we are to remain faithful to our environmental ambition and, above all, to the desire to promote technological innovation in the European Union."
"– Dividing batteries into three categories, as proposed in the common position, seems to me a sensible compromise."
"Taking into account the fact that some cadmium batteries cannot be replaced at the present time, it would be inadvisable to impose a blanket ban, since some success has been achieved in collecting and recycling certain of them in recent times, particularly industrial versions."
"It would be rational, however, to impose a complete ban on portable batteries as it is highly likely that they will end up in landfills."
"As for the minimum targets for collecting spent batteries and accumulators, for which the target of 25% after six years seems an achievable goal, it strikes me as a sensible suggestion that in the enlarged European Union the feasibility of the second, ten-year target be tested in the meantime."
"This would be done on the basis of actual experiences going back several years in the 25 countries, among which there are now marked differences in the systems of collection and recycling."
"To this end we would need to set up a system of verification."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Blokland, and to underline the enormous significance that a directive on batteries and accumulators and spent batteries and accumulators holds for environmental protection."
"There are many instances of metals similar to those used in batteries and accumulators being found during tests carried out on people living in environmentally sensitive areas and on the water sources in such areas."
"By analysing the origin of these metals, it is possible to state conclusively that some of them come from batteries and accumulators that have been deposited in rubbish dumps."
"Discarded batteries and accumulators take a very long time to decompose."
"Several problems arise in this connection, such as the following."
"People underestimate the need to collect batteries, and so they must be made more aware of it."
"Legal and financial measures must be put in place to promote the collection of batteries, and we must foster a culture in which the public acquires the habit of doing so."
"Issues relating to organisational matters and to the disposal of these pollutants are further problems."
"A number of issues that have been raised will only be resolved over time, provided that battery collection schemes continue to be publicised and that improvements continue to be made to collection and disposal systems."
"In particular, technical progress must be promoted in the field of battery production, in order to ensure that batteries are safe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Blokland deserves our warm thanks for this good, thorough and careful report for second reading."
"The basic problem with batteries and accumulators has nothing to do with the energy they produce, but rather with the materials that they contain – cadmium, lead and mercury."
"It is a matter of general knowledge that these components are toxic and do the environment no good at all."
"As I see it, the first priority is recycling rather than management; the next is that they be replaced by less toxic contents wherever this is technically possible."
"This alteration now further renders harmless, reduces and, to some degree, prohibits these materials and their percentages by weight in batteries of whatever kind."
"This I regard as the great benefit of this directive."
"It has to be admitted that the collection quotas are very high, and the demands made on industry, the general public and the trade very considerable."
"This is a challenge, and it is one that I regard in an extremely positive light; it will involve putting into practice a learning programme that will get our fellow human beings treating the environment better and becoming more aware of it."
"Even if it proves impossible to achieve the high quotas everywhere and always, the requirement is evidence of how the European Union leads the world in its awareness of the environment and in the way it treats it."
"The debate as to whether it makes more sense to define collection targets in terms of weight or number of items strikes me as purely academic."
"I have no objection to the joint legal basis using Articles 95 and 175 of the Treaties, or to the Council’s Common Position."
"Looking at the big picture, the fundamental question that presents itself to my mind is whether the promotion of research and of modern technologies will, over the coming years, enable us to replace many of our conventional batteries with such alternatives as fuel cells."
"If it does, then this directive, like the materials we have problems with, will have a limited lifespan."
"Mr President, I very much welcome this legislation which, I think, will help clean up our environment."
"However, I also want to comment on the three key issues that colleagues have commented on, the first of which concerns prohibitions and in particular compromise amendment 42."
"The problem I have is that it still involves the idea of an automatic ban on nickel cadmium batteries after four years; the Commission is not asked to carry out an impact assessment to see what we should do."
"I do not agree with an automatic ban."
"If we are going to ban things, then we should do so in full knowledge."
"We should also do things that are proportionate: there is cadmium in our atmosphere but less than 1% is caused by batteries – much more comes from pesticides and other uses – so we must have legislation that is proportionate to what we are trying to achieve."
"We need a study on this issue before we move to any further legislation."
"I will support the common position."
"As regards the targets, I agree with what speakers have said about realistic targets."
"There is no point pretending we can automatically run to big leaps forward when in fact only a handful of countries collect batteries at all."
"We need to get targets down to a level that countries can meet at some point in the future and work out how to get there."
"Someone pointed out that, after 9 years, Belgium has reached a level of 56% and Austria, after 14 years, still lies somewhere at around 40%."
"Finally on the legal base issue, I shall be supporting the rapporteur and the Socialist Group on a legal base, but we have to bang heads together on this issue of Articles 175 and 95 because we have kept coming up against this issue in environmental legislation over the past few months."
"We should be looking at this and having the legal experts from the three institutions talking about the legal base."
"We do not want to see legislation on the environment that undermines higher standards in those Member States that choose to have them."
"– Mr President, a simple ban on nickel-cadmium accumulators seems appealing to me at first glance, but a more in-depth analysis prompts me to recommend real derogations in terms of the industrial use of these accumulators."
"In particular, these accumulators are used in the security and transport sectors – in aeroplanes and trains, for example."
"These accumulators are much sought-after for their operational reliability in critical conditions, which makes it difficult to introduce alternative products."
"The rules are already very strict."
"The risks connected to the end of life of this type of accumulator are controlled, not least by means of the producers taking responsibility for the collection and recycling of their accumulators."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I draw your attention to the definitions adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which give precedence to the physical characteristics of the battery over the way in which it is used."
"Certain batteries would therefore, in all likelihood, become de facto casualties of the ban, such as those used in breathing apparatus systems employed in toxic atmospheres, lamps for individual or collective use in the mining sector, and so on."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank Mr Blokland for his very interesting report."
"It is obvious that a society without batteries has become unthinkable, and as some Members have already pointed out, the use of batteries is on the increase: worldwide, there is an annual increase of 9%."
"If we consider the use that consumers like ourselves make of electronics on a daily basis, there is plenty of reason to get all Member States to step up their efforts so as to reduce future environmental risks to a minimum."
"Clearly, the present directive of 1991 leads to insufficient results in this field, precisely because it does not contain any firm targets for collection and recycling."
"Moreover, the results are very difficult to compare in the different Member States."
"I certainly do not want to keep from you the frequently quoted success story of my own region, Flanders, where the government has, in tandem with this very sector, made huge efforts to set up an efficient collection system, as a result of which no less than 60% of batteries are in fact collected."
"The key to this success is shared responsibility."
"Without a well-developed, dense network of collection points, collection targets are unachievable."
"As I have already said, I would like to put the case for higher collection percentages, and our committee has, in fact, approved my amendment to that effect."
"Secondly, I should like to urge all parties involved to take on their share of responsibility."
"I have tabled a fresh amendment to that effect."
"Finally, I should like to appeal for legal certainty for the sector, as regards the use of cadmium in both batteries and power tools, for which I propose a transitional period of four years."
"I hope that many Members will be able to endorse this package."
"Mr President, I would like to start by extending warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, for the work he has done."
"Important though the protection of the environment is – as one who concerns myself with environmental policy, I have set it as my declared objective – we must find a way of balancing the environment against legitimate business interests."
"My particular concern today is with the ban on nickel-cadmium batteries in power tools."
"To ban them outright, whether now or after a transitional period of four years – which is what the rapporteur proposes – would be going too far."
"As a substitute for that, I prefer to back the Common Position and Mr Krahmer’s Amendment 45, which make provision for a review of the derogation from the ban for nickel-cadmium batteries in power tools after four and seven and a half years respectively."
"It would then be considered whether equivalent alternatives existed and whether a ban on nickel-cadmium batteries was reasonable and justified – which, as things stand at the moment, it is not."
"While there are already, in many areas, technological alternatives to nickel-cadmium on the market, nickel-metal hybrids being one example, these alternatives cannot as yet be regarded as equivalent to nickel-cadmium, as demonstrated, , by various differences, for example the fact that the lifetime of nickel-cadmium batteries is longer than that of their nickel-metal hybrid counterparts, and they are less susceptible to faults and defects."
"Nickel-cadmium batteries can be charged up more quickly and discharge themselves much more slowly when out of use."
"It is also worthy of note that nickel-metal hybrid batteries do not function when the temperature falls below 10° Celsius."
"It is the desire for a consolidated market position that motivates manufacturers to develop more and more new technologies, but a ban at the present time or in four years’ time would be counterproductive, for they would have to change over their production methods to handle a type of technology that is not yet fully developed, while the research and development sector would not be able to come up with financial resources that this would demand."
"A ban would therefore do nothing to foster innovation in the field of new technologies nor, consequently, anything to benefit the environment either, and we surely cannot want that."
"I will close by expressing my support for Articles 95 and 175 as a dual legal basis."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"I believe that the persistent shortcomings in terms of collection are due to the lack of ambition that we sometimes demonstrate."
"If it is possible to collect batteries in some Member States, then what is stopping the others from increasing their efforts?"
"Mrs Jackson quoted some figures."
"She forgot about Luxembourg."
"In 2001, the country boasted an 89.5% recycling rate."
"The text submitted to us for adoption refers to a minimum recycling objective per inhabitant per year of 160 grams; in 2004, this proportion stood at 245 grams per inhabitant in Luxembourg."
"These are the results of a large number of information campaigns and of a great deal of work in the field of prevention and awareness-raising, organised by the Luxembourg Government and by the town councils and supported by the retail sector, which actively participates in the collection efforts."
"Mr President, this is indeed proof that collection with a view to recycling is possible, and I do not see why what has been achieved in Luxembourg could not be achieved in other countries."
"As for replacing cadmium, I believe that Parliament’s final objective should be the substitution principle, although an adjustment period is necessary."
". Mr President, I will focus now only the amendments relating to three key issues in this file: firstly, the legal basis; secondly, the definitions of ‘portable’ and ‘industrial’ battery types and, thirdly, collection targets."
"Firstly, on the legal basis, the preamble and Recital 1 – Amendments 1 and 2: the Commission continues to support the concept of a dual legal basis for this directive as the correct one."
"This dual legal basis reflects the dual objective of the proposed directive."
"Indeed, the directive aims at achieving both a high level of environmental protection and contributing to the proper functioning of the internal market."
"Moreover, it should be noted that the proposed directive specifies that each individual article has only one legal basis."
"Indeed, the articles laying down provisions for the environmental protection are based on Article 175 of the EC Treaty."
"The articles laying down provisions related to the proper functioning of the internal market – namely Articles 4, 5 and 18 of the proposed directive – are based on Article 95 of the Treaty."
"Consequently, this dual legal basis cannot lead to any legal incompatibilities of procedures."
"Secondly, on the definition of the different battery types – Articles 3(3) and (6) and Recitals 8 and 9, Amendments 5, 6, 12 and 13: the definitions of ‘portable’ batteries and ‘industrial’ batteries are important since they determine the scope of the cadmium ban and the type of collection requirements."
"Therefore, the Commission is of the opinion that definitions should meet the following criteria: they should be clear, they should be workable in practice for the Member States to implement in a harmonised way, and any overlaps or gaps should be avoided."
"Taking into account the above, the Commission supports the first two parts of Amendment 12, in particular the introduction of the weight limit for defining portable batteries."
"However, the Commission does not support the other changes proposed to the definitions of the different battery types – Amendment 12, third part, and Amendment 13."
"The Commission welcomes the deletion of the non-exhaustive list of examples in the recitals, which considerably improves the drafting of the legislative act."
"Thirdly, I turn to the collection targets – Article 9(2) and (4) and Amendments 26 to 28."
"The Commission believes that setting collection targets in the proposed directive is necessary: firstly to ensure a minimum level of environmental protection in all Member States and secondly to monitor the efficiency of the national battery-collection schemes."
"It is important that the collection targets are ambitious in environmental terms, but they should also be achievable, realistic and cost-efficient."
"The Commission’s extended impact assessment carefully analysed this issue and came to the conclusion that the collection target of 160 grams or 40% would be the most cost-efficient target, which corresponds with part of Amendment 26."
"The appropriateness of an increase in the target in the longer term will be carefully reviewed, as foreseen in Article 20(2)(b) of the proposed directive."
"In this review, the Commission will take account of technical progress and practical experience gained in Member States."
"The Commission thus in principle supports Amendment 26 but reserves its opinion on Amendment 56."
"The Commission supports the amendment which deletes the possibility for Member States to derogate from the proposed collection targets – the ‘transitional arrangements’."
"The Commission had proposed this possibility since, in its initial proposal, the collection targets were based on weight per inhabitant."
"Since the collection targets are now based on sales, it is no longer necessary to provide for this possibility of transitional arrangements."
"Since the proposed directive already foresees a review of the long-term targets in Article 20(2)(b), the Commission does not see the need for a specific review obligation to increase the targets by a specific date."
"I will give a voting list to the Secretariat, indicating which amendments are and are not acceptable to the Commission."
"I should like to point out that the Commission reserves its opinion on the additional 18 amendments tabled before the plenary, since more time is needed to fully assess the environmental, economic and social impacts thereof."
"I believe that the European Parliament and the Council can now start moving towards agreement on this file."
"I look forward to an early conclusion of the codecision process so that the directive can be implemented by the Member States and we can achieve a high level of environmental protection in this area."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"In some Member States, such as Hungary, the collection of spent batteries and accumulators may be a newly introduced activity, but at the same time, it is also a long-term environmental protection investment."
"In order to enable the implementation of the law, collection targets must remain realistic both in terms of time and quantity."
"Excessively ambitious targets (such as 50-60%) would lead to stipulations that cannot be implemented."
"Switzerland’s consumer culture needed 12 years to reach the 60% level."
"In our country, where carbon-zinc batteries still have a 40-50% market share due to poor consumer purchasing power, distributors would be unable to finance, and consumers would be unable to pay the cost of a too vigorously enforced collection."
"This would not only lead to the liquidation of enterprises and job losses, but it would also boost the already thriving black market battery import, which presents an increasing environmental risk."
"This means that a law that cannot be complied with would achieve the opposite of its objective."
"What we need is regulations – even with a potential review within five years – that can ensure the achievement of environmental targets in the long term, and the preservation of jobs in the affected industry and distribution sectors for the next five or ten years."
"The next item is the report (A6-0334/2005) by Mrs Kauppi, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments, as regards certain deadlines [COM(2005)0253 – C6-0191/2005 – 2005/0111(COD)]."
". Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Piia-Noora Kauppi and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the efficiency and speed shown on this dossier."
"This proposal is an essential complement to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive – known as ‘MiFID’, which is most probably the most important piece of EU legislation recently adopted in the field of European securities law."
"The proposal is a simple one, namely to postpone the date of entry into force of the directive, with half of this extra time for industry to prepare, the other half for Member State transposition."
"This proposal responds to a justified and legitimate request expressed by the industry and supported by all Member States and securities regulators."
"It is clear that additional time is needed to put in place the necessary arrangements so that the MiFID will work from the start."
"The Commission proposed, in June 2005, the extension of the transposition deadline for Member States for six months and we added a further six months’ deadline for the industry to apply the directive in practice."
"A series of improvements and clarifications concerning the various deadlines have been made, during negotiations in the European Parliament and the Council, to the text proposed by the Commission, and cooperation has been excellent between the three institutions."
"The European Parliament and Council propose that the extension becomes nine plus nine months, instead of six plus six."
"The Commission can go along with this, particularly because the technical implementing measures for the MiFID are essential for the effective application of this directive."
"These technical rules are complex and will not be adopted before May 2006."
"Member States and investment firms need to have the complete picture of the new framework, including the technical implementing details, before they can effectively apply them."
"Let me stress that adoption of the ‘MiFID extension’ directive is a matter of urgency and we need a single reading."
"If the EU institutions are not able to conclude this debate quickly, or if a second reading is needed, the MiFID will enter into force in April next year and no one will be ready."
"There will be a lot of uncertainty because of the legal void that will be created, since the old ISD regime will be abrogated and the new regime will enter into force without the new MiFID having been transposed."
"We will have new rules without the necessary technical implementing details – not a good formula!"
"This codecision proposal is about extending the date of entry of MiFID, not about the wider question of the powers of the Council and the European Parliament in the comitology procedures."
"This House knows my views on the comitology issue and how important it is to resolve these matters as soon as possible in a balanced and fair way."
"Discussions are under way in the Council and I understand the European Parliament is working on its negotiating position."
"I welcomed this and I hope we can arrive at a good outcome as early as possible next year."
"So, with the greatest respect, and in full understanding of Parliament’s overall position, I consider that the amendments put forward on comitology and on the sunset clause are neither necessary nor appropriate in the context of this proposal."
"And, as a matter of legal conformity, they do not explain any article of the text."
"The European Parliament’s requests for additional co-legislator powers are known."
"They are already recorded in the Capital Requirements Directive recently adopted."
"The broad substance of Amendment 2 is already included in the original MiFID, and Amendment 4 merely advances the date for the expiry of the Commission’s delegated powers by 29 days."
"So I would urge you to consider again these amendments, which the Commission would prefer ideally to be withdrawn before the vote."
"I understand that the Council would also prefer this outcome."
"The Commission believes that a solution for this matter can only be found through a revision of the comitology decision."
"As a result of Parliament’s justified persistence, the Council has taken up work on the revision of this decision through a ‘Friends of the Presidency’ group."
"Progress is being made and I reiterate my invitation to Parliament to set out clearly its expectations and proposals for the ongoing discussions."
"That said, the Commission will not stand in the way of an adoption at first reading of this proposed directive."
"Should Parliament maintain its amendments on comitology, the Commission will accept them in the interests of ensuring a smooth transposition and implementation of the MiFID."
"The Commission, from its side, will assist wherever it can to ensure that a real sense of urgency is given to this matter."
"The Commission has long recognised the need for a solution to be found and I believe the conditions are now ripe for this."
"I look forward to hearing your comments."
"Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by conveying to the House the apologies of the rapporteur, Mrs Kauppi, who regrets her inability, due to travel problems, to be here on time for the debate on her own report."
"That does not mean that she has washed her hands of it, far from it; she has done a fine job of work, and I would like to thank her warmly for it."
"What is this about?"
"In the first part of his speech, the Commissioner, in effect, presented the draft report – thus demonstrating that rational explanations find Parliament with an open mind and ready to listen – and went on, in the second part, to point out that we both have a problem with comitology."
"I am glad that he concluded by saying that he is on our side if we adopt it as proposed – and I can tell him that we will."
"Where issues of this House’s fundamental rights, of democratic fundamental rights, and of right of codecision are concerned, it is good when Commission and Parliament pull together, especially in their dealing with the Council."
"The same can be said about the comitology procedure and the sunset clause."
"My colleague Mr Radwan will go into that in greater detail."
"So what is MiFID – the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive – all about?"
"Not everyone understands it."
"Firstly, it is intended to amend a Parliament and Council directive on markets in financial instruments."
"Secondly, it has to do with extending the deadlines for transposition."
"Why do we want to extend them?"
"The reason is that the directive results in considerable changes for the participants in the market and for the national authorities, since transposition is dependent on the necessary technical measures being worked out and put into effect, the former of which is, unfortunately, only now being done, and the package of measures to implement the 17 provisions is due to be adopted only in 2006."
"The fact is that the implementing measures to be taken at Level 2 are being delayed, and they will actually only be completed at a time when MiFID ought already to have entered into force."
"What makes us favour the extension of the transposition deadlines is the fact that we are dealing here with what is termed the Lamfalussy procedure, and that the process has to be completed by means of comitology."
"So what do we do now?"
"What we do now is to extend, and for this reason, the transposition deadline, also keeping the old ISD directive in force until MiFID becomes effective, in other words until 1 November 2007."
"It follows that the changes we are making to the directive on markets in financial instruments are of form rather than of substance."
"The effect of these transposition deadlines is to prevent a legal vacuum."
"Alongside these outward adaptations to reality, though, we are also altering the comitology procedure within MiFID."
"Why is this so?"
"I have to tell the Commissioner that I find his first objection incomprehensible."
"We are doing this because we want to adopt, in precisely the same form, the provisions on comitology that we agreed with the Council for the ‘Basel II’ directive on capital adequacy, which can be summed up in the word ‘sunset clause’."
"What that gives us is legal certainty, along with clarity about what we want."
"The proposals we have received to date do not take account of this House’s legislative prerogatives, and it is right and proper that any agreement reached by us be extended to cover other directives dealing with the same subject matter."
"I therefore ask all the Members of this House, in the plenary vote tomorrow, to stick with the Committee’s resolution, for it will enable us not only to achieve a practical solution but also to strengthen this House’s hand."
". Mr President, Commissioner, there has already been frequent reference in this debate to the Lamfalussy procedure."
"One ought really to be grateful to the British Presidency, for the tenacity with which the British, whose country is regarded as the cradle of democracy – something to which Mr Karas has already alluded – have fought over a point already agreed on in the ‘Basel II’ directive by the Commission, the Council and Parliament is astounding."
"If, though, you want to reinforce Parliament’s rights and campaign for that, you cannot but be grateful that every further action of this kind makes this House even more firmly united in the conviction that this is something about which we cannot give way."
"The issue is that of how we handle the Lamfalussy procedure in future."
"There is also the question as to how seriously the Council is taking this."
"Had the British Presidency made even an attempt at doing something – perhaps with the aid of the ‘Friends of the Presidency’ – about sorting out the new inter-institutional agreement, and expended less energy on getting this through as it stood, we would be a good deal further ahead today."
"What I have to say to the Commission is this: we inserted a date into the ‘Basel II’ directive; that date was 1 April 2008, and until then this House will be backing the Lamfalussy procedure and comitology."
"We want to support it even after that date, but we do need agreement by then."
"Let me say, for the benefit of all those whom the news has not yet reached, that we will incorporate this sunset clause in all subsequent directives."
"When new proposals come from the Commission, we will not allow ourselves to be limited to considering only whether or not individual dates should be changed, but will instead claim the right to consider any directive that gets as far as this House in its entirety."
"We hope that the Commission will exert appropriate influence on the Council – indeed, we rely on it doing so."
"I am looking particularly to the Austrian presidency to secure us a solution that at last does justice to all the institutions and enable us to get back to doing our work properly."
". Mr President, Commissioner, with this report, we are in the first phase of the European Parliament’s return to this Investment Services Directive, which has since been renamed the MiFID Directive."
"There is a procedural issue here: you are aware of the conditions in which the European Parliament accepted the Lamfalussy Process."
"There is a fundamental question: in what conditions will the principles we enacted at level 1 be upheld by the measures being prepared at level 2?"
"Something tells me that, for the first time, the European Parliament, as a result of having examined the level 2 measures contained in this directive, will have the opportunity to exercise its rights in full, hence the importance that we give, in this text, to pointing out the conditions in which the European Parliament can, through the sunset clause and the right of call back, intervene again following the implementation of the level 2 measures."
"I believe that we are right to examine these measures because, when we observe the manner in which the debate has unfolded, there is clearly, following the European Parliament’s adoption of the measures, a legal ‘creativity’ that requires us to be vigilant."
"As regards the timetable, in fact, we observe that what was initially just a deadline has become a transposition deadline and an enforcement deadline."
"In other areas, I believe that the overall balance in this directive between transparency and opening up to competition is a sufficiently serious matter for Parliament to use all the resources necessary to examine, in credible conditions, the proposals that will be made at level 2 by the Commission."
"It is for this reason, Commissioner, that I hope to be able to take advantage of your spirit of openness towards this Parliament and of your willingness to engage in dialogue with it so that I might, at the time when this directive – which is a directive aimed at changing the timetable – is adopted, fully reassert Parliament’s rights in a procedure in which, quite frankly, Parliament’s intervention has always focused on the principles and has never led to an extension of the deadlines, although we can quite imagine the difficulties involved in the other levels intervening on such a complex issue."
"Well, quite frankly, Commissioner, I can put your mind at ease: Parliament will indeed vote in favour of the proposed amendments, and I am delighted that you can, in these conditions, support them."
". The document under consideration is very important not only for the European financial market, but also for the European Parliament itself for two reasons."
"First, with this document Parliament makes it clear that it is able to respond promptly to the reasoned requests of market participants to review the terms of the coming into effect of the directive."
"Second, which is equally important, Parliament asserts the possibilities and the rights to waive certain provisions of the directive should it become evident that the chosen strategy does not meet the needs of the market."
"The directive is an umbrella instrument."
"In a way, it summarises all the achievements in the market and enforces its regulation; however, increased attention should perhaps be paid to the drafting of this specialised legislation."
"Therefore, I would like to support the submitted proposal, but let me point out, on the other hand, that the present consideration has revealed significant flaws in the process of adoption of legal documents governing financial markets."
"We need to review the strategy for drafting these legal acts of the financial market: currently we frequently focus on technical details, while the real question here is about the process by which financial legal acts are approved."
"A number of options have been proposed, and yet none of them are adequate."
"Consider, for example, the changing of the deadline for the enforcement of a certain provision of the law even before it becomes operational."
"This means that during the preparatory stage market possibilities and needs were not properly considered."
"I would like to address the Commissioner on this point."
"He has been promising to reduce legal burden on the market, but I believe that this legal burden would abate provided we worked closer with market participants."
"We would then need fewer amendments to directives before they come into effect."
"Mr President, the June List supports the proposal concerning the internal market’s four freedoms."
"The free movement of capital is fundamental to an efficient internal market."
"If all this is to operate satisfactorily, common regulations are required."
"These must be designed simply and must not undermine the possibility of institutional competition between the Member States."
"It is a good thing that the deadlines in this report should be extended, as this will facilitate the preparations in the run-up to the regulations’ entering into force."
"We shall therefore vote in favour of the report."
"Parliament’s proposed changes state, however, that the European Parliament has requested that Parliament and the Council be given an equal role in supervising the way in which the Commission exercises its powers to implement the changes."
"Parliament is again trying to increase its own power at the expense of the Member States."
"The Commission must not be some kind of federal government, and it should in the first place be supervised by the Member States."
"As it is important that an acceptable compromise be reached with the Council, it is unfortunate that Parliament should have chosen in this way to put an intra-institutional power struggle into the mix."
"We shall therefore vote against Amendments 1, 2, 4 and 11."
"Mr President, as has already been said, the MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive), previously known as the ISD (Investment Services Directive), is a major legislative programme for the internal capital market."
"The aim is to introduce a level playing field for different kinds of investment services, with top priority given to enhancing transparency before and after, to consumer protection and to the promotion of keen prices at maximum liquidity."
"In Europe, those instruments will allow us to make a huge stride in the direction of a better investment climate, which is desperately needed at the moment."
"The complexity of the directive requires careful consultation with the different market operators, much of which work is done by supervisors under the watchful eye of the CESR (Committee of European Securities Regulators)."
"The European Commission, with its limited manpower, cannot do this on its own."
"I am a big fan of this careful approach and of this considerable role for the supervisors."
"They are our main allies in the service of the public interest and in preventing us from being guided by a handful of large market operators or national markets that serve their own interests, which, sadly, was what did sometimes happen at the time when the groundwork for this dossier was being done."
"The European Parliament has struck a balance between the different interests and must now ensure that this balance is kept."
"This means that we must be able to continue to play our role."
"That is why we demand that an important right in the context of checking comitology, namely the right of revocation, be upheld."
"The Commission has indicated on a number of occasions that it will support us in this, and so has the Council, albeit somewhat reluctantly, except that this point in the treaty was not corrected in the course of the debate that was held on the subject."
"Now that things have ground to a halt, there is no reason why that point should be put on ice as well."
"Since the Lamfalussy procedure increasingly applies to financial market dossiers, Parliament’s right of revocation should, as a matter of urgency, be regulated structurally."
"This is not a prestige project or prestige fight. It really is about remaining involved in what we laid down in broad lines at level 1 and seeing them reflected at the implementation stage that we have delegated."
". Mr President, I want to thank all Members for their observations."
"It is clear that we all want MiFID to enter into force under the best possible conditions, and an extension of the transposition and implementation deadlines is necessary and justified."
"While the Commission considers that the amendments relating to comitology are legally inappropriate in this context, the Commission will accept them to allow an adoption of this proposal in a single reading."
"I understand that this issue will come back and that you will continue to include these amendments in future proposals."
"I attach high importance to finding a solution and in no way do I want the sense of urgency to be lost."
"I will therefore continue to take an open approach to the amendments."
"They are an important political signal of the strongly felt and legitimate requests of this House."
"However, flagging a problem politically is not enough: we need to solve it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A6-0382/2005) by Mrs Fourtou, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the alleged abuse of the Valencian Land Law known as the LRAU and its effect on European citizens (Petitions 609/2003, 732/2003, 985/2002, 1112/2002, 107/2004 and others) [2004/2208(INI)]."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over many years, the mild climate, the beautiful countryside, the low prices and the warmth and friendliness of the locals have encouraged thousands of Europeans to buy property in the Spanish region of Valencia."
"In response to soaring demand and in order to discourage speculation, the Autonomous Government of Valencia adopted a land development law called the (LRAU) in 1994."
"The European Parliament has since received thousands of petitions against the application of precisely that law."
"The petitioners are complaining about improper encroachment, as they see it, on their property rights by urban amenity and land development projects."
"The criticisms relate both to the substance – legal, economic and environmental legitimacy of such projects – and to the form – poor information, lack of transparency, excessively short deadlines for lodging challenges and proposals, and too low a level of compensation."
"They feel powerless in the face of a situation that is highly complex, since it should be remembered that legal and political responsibility in this area is shared between the Spanish Government as regards land law, the autonomous community of Valencia as regards local legislation concerning planning rules, and the municipalities which, on the basis of both Spanish and regional legislation, implement the programmes which they deem legitimate."
"In order to familiarise itself with the situation on the ground, the Committee on Petitions sent two delegations, one in 2004 and one in 2005, to gather information from the various parties involved."
"As rapporteur, I was in the second delegation, and I was very impressed by the number of petitioners and found not only what they said but also their trust in Europe’s response very moving."
"I also valued the attention paid to us by the Valencian authorities and their willingness to cooperate."
"The Community of Valencia is aware of the problems, and is currently in the process of drafting a new law, called the (LUV), which will address the complaints raised by the petitioners."
"In a spirit of openness, the Valencian Government has also invited the European Parliament to put forward any suggestions it considers necessary."
"Europe is often criticised for being remote from its citizens, and this is a good opportunity to show the opposite: the European Parliament, via its Committee on Petitions, is listening to the citizens."
"The problem, however, is that we cannot overstep our authority because we absolutely cannot give the citizens false hopes that will inevitably be dashed."
"With regard to the facts and Community competence, we therefore call on the European Commission to continue to ensure that the tendering procedure is followed and to monitor any breaches of the environmental directives."
"It already started to respond to our calls on 21 March, by opening infringement proceedings against the Kingdom of Spain for failure to comply with the directive on public procurement."
"We have insisted to the regional government and to the municipalities that they should provide everyone affected by the LRAU with assistance enabling them to plan a possible process of rectification and compensation."
"We are calling for the environmental issues so crucial to the future of Europe to be taken into account in all projects."
"I would like to thank my fellow Members who have shown such enthusiasm for this subject and who have improved my initial report, but I would remind them that we can only act within the bounds of our Community competences and that we have little room for manœuvre."
"Our response depends, and has depended, on our temperaments and on our commitments."
"Some tend to do a great deal, others not enough; I myself have tried to strike a happy medium, and it is in that spirit that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will table some amendments intended purely to refocus our efforts."
"I am tempted to tell the European citizens affected by the LRAU that we have heard them, that we are appalled by the situation and that we are here not to judge, but to try to bring pressure to bear to ensure that they are all listened to and respected, and that, in the end, a fair and balanced solution will be found."
"I hope that this report will be successful, that the situation will ultimately be made fair for everyone and that the Committee on Petitions will once again be able to show that we are an important link in the chain of the relationship between the citizens and the European Parliament."
". Mr President, the rapporteur, Mrs Fourtou, and her fellow members of the Committee on Petitions have worked very hard on this report, an initiative from this House in response to thousands of petitions received by the committee."
"I would like to thank all those involved for their work and valuable contributions to this difficult and delicate debate."
"This is indeed of concern to many EU citizens, as shown by the number of petitions received."
"Two fact-finding missions were sent to Valencia, which gave the committee members an opportunity to meet with representatives of all those concerned and to have a first-hand experience of the situation on the ground."
"You know better than anyone else the issues at stake."
"Mrs Fourtou’s report touches upon a number of important topics which have attracted the political attention of this House."
"The Commission, within the limits of its competences, has looked into this matter mainly from an internal market perspective."
"In concrete terms we have analysed the public procurement dimension of the Spanish law."
"I shall concentrate on that."
"The Commission takes the view that the approval of integrated action programmes under the Valencia Land Planning Law involves the award of public work and service contracts."
"Early in this process the Commission considered that the Valencia Land Planning Law raised questions with respect to EU public procurement legislation."
"Contracts were awarded without transparency or publication of notices in the EU Official Journal."
"There were no objective selection or award criteria, no appropriate price clauses, and no equality of opportunity for all those interested in the business opportunity."
"The Commission therefore decided to launch infringement proceedings against Spain on this issue and sent a letter of formal notice on 21 March 2005."
"Since then, we have been working together with the relevant authorities to correct the defects that were detected with the application of the existing law."
"However, the draft new law that was submitted to my services does not correct all problems identified."
"In addition, the practical situation has not changed."
"Public authorities continue to award public contracts without following appropriate tendering procedures."
"In view of this lack of progress, in a few days I plan to send a letter to the competent authorities in Spain asking them to take appropriate measures to remedy the situation."
"Reconciling planning requirements and procurement laws can be highly complex."
"However, this must not be an excuse for not applying the EU procurement rules."
"These rules bring benefits for public authorities, by increasing competition for public contracts and lowering the price of works, supplies and services."
"Therefore, you can count on my commitment to ensure that EU public procurement rules are respected, both in the letter and the practice, of whatever legislation is approved in the future."
"Mrs Fourtou’s report also raised a number of other issues of concern, but as they fall outside the scope of Community competence, the Commission is not in a position to address them."
". – Mr President, as a member of the second European Parliament delegation which visited the Spanish authorities in Madrid and the regional and local authorities in the autonomous region of Valencia in June 2005 and met with groups of petitioners, I am obliged to state publicly that all the key players demonstrated an excellent willingness to cooperate with the MEPs and confirmed their understanding and concern for the legitimate, but not for the illegal claims of the citizens."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Fourtou, has achieved a feat in drafting her report on behalf of the Committee on Petitions and has made masterly use of all her subtractive powers in order to retain the most fundamental elements which it makes sense to put forward in a report which the House is called to vote on, by adhering to the Rules of Procedure and her legal obligations and not exceeding them."
"Unfortunately, when the Fourtou report was voted on in the Committee on Petitions, amendments were slipped into the text which touch on the principle of subsidiarity, together with complaints not accompanied by the relevant proof."
"We therefore support the amendments by the rapporteur and her group deleting a number of details."
"These amendments restore the dignity of the non-legislative text which, of course, has no repercussions."
"Moreover, we too are trying in turn with our series of amendments to improve the unacceptably didactic and overbearing tone, especially of paragraphs 6 and 11, which are insulting to a Member State."
"The amendment to paragraph 11 in particular highlights the more general problem of excessive urbanisation of the shores of the Mediterranean in general and stresses the general nature of environmental protection."
"As for recital Ι, our amendment corrects the vague tone of the text and recalls the infringement proceedings already exercised in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty and European legislation, as you mentioned Commissioner, and this is why we call on everyone voting in favour of the report to vote in favour of these amendments."
"As to whether the honourable Members will vote in favour of the report, that is up to them."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by apologising for the absence of Mr Cashman, who is unable to take part in this debate this evening because of travel problems."
"He would have been leading for the PSE Group in this debate otherwise."
"This report is extremely important for a number of reasons, because it seeks to demonstrate to the citizens of Valencia that this European Parliament is not only a law-making body – which of course it is – but also a voice of the people of Europe when their rights are threatened."
"I also wish to say that the PSE Group will not accept amendments to this report which seek to weaken it."
"The report is already a compromise report and is not as strong as I certainly would like it to be."
"It is intolerable that residents of parts of Valencia face the fact that their property has been and may be expropriated by the local state with the consequent enrichment of developers."
"It is particularly important to insist on the application of directives which come under a Commission remit other than the internal market."
"I refer specifically to the 2001 directive which deals with strategic environmental impact assessments and the 2000 directive which deals with the prudent use and protection of water resources – all of which are the subject of this complaint."
"Indeed, it is also important that we should seek ways to press the Valencian Government to put a moratorium on new projects, pending the implementation of a satisfactory new law which meets the full requirements of the European Union."
"It is also essential that citizens have the right of redress and that they are not kept in the dark as to proposals relating to their property, either when they are buying property or when they are in possession of it."
"It is not appropriate that any citizens should be unilaterally dispossessed of the property that they enjoy."
"Let me refer to another issue."
"I am sure my colleague would not object to my drawing Commissioner McCreevy’s attention to the fact that last Friday 100 000 people in Ireland marched to express their anger at the Bolkestein directive for which he currently has responsibility."
"As he is in the Chamber tonight, I want him to appreciate that serious statement of concern by European citizens."
". Mr President, I congratulate my colleague Mrs Fourtou on her balanced report."
"We in the ALDE Group will support our own amendments, of course, but not other amendments that seek to weaken this report further."
"This is about citizens’ rights. More importantly, perhaps, this is a right that goes to the centre of the European Union."
"Freedom of movement in the European Union has been a real success story, and when our citizens choose to exercise that right by living in – and often retiring to – another Member State, they deserve our protection and support."
"Many of them make the biggest financial investment they will ever make in their lives by purchasing real property."
"That is what happened to citizens in one region of one Member State."
"They have come to us in their thousands to explain that something has gone disastrously wrong."
"The value of their property is being wiped out by a development control law that does not seem to be working."
"We have produced, I believe, a balanced report that will continue to put pressure on the authorities in Valencia."
"There are three elements that we need to achieve."
"We need to make sure that you, Commissioner, continue to enforce EU law where you can; we need to make sure that those citizens who have come to us can benefit from some form of compensation or redress mechanism – and for that we must continue to exert pressure on the Spanish authorities."
"I must also ask you this, Commissioner: we ask our citizens to move and live elsewhere, and we do not want to see this kind of scenario again."
"So, without interfering in Member States’ land law – which is their own affair – can we please look for some sort of advice, guidance and information for our fellow citizens who buy property in another Member State?"
"We do not want to see this again."
"We do not want to nanny our citizens, but we want to support them when they exercise the right to freedom of movement that is so precious to all of us."
". Mr President, we are dealing with a profoundly European issue, a question of rights: we cannot apply European legislation without dealing with the land-planning scandal in the Mediterranean."
"We cannot even apply the Treaty in relation to human rights, neither can we apply the directives on public contracts, the framework directive on water, the strategic environmental assessment directive, without dealing with what the President of the Higher Council of Colleges of Architects this very morning described as the land-planning horror: he said that the Mediterranean coast is bursting at the seams, that the territory is suffering from great overcrowding and an irreversible impact that will leave an excessively serious ecological mark."
"We must put an end to this horror as soon as possible, which is violating people’s rights: thousands and thousands of people — the great majority are Valencians — are suffering as a result of this situation."
"A sustainable environment is not compatible with this model."
"I believe that Europe must respond firmly and quickly to these infringements of European directives."
"To this end, amongst all of us we have produced a report, thanks to two years of exemplary work by the Committee on Petitions, which unanimously adopted this report."
"Now, certain people who voted in favour in the Committee on Petitions want to spoil this report irreversibly."
"I do not believe that that is a very honest way to behave."
"I believe that the environmental interests of the citizens are more important than the interests of bricks and mortar, which want to cover the entire Mediterranean coast."
". Mr President, while we sympathise greatly with the citizens who find themselves in this invidious position, we in UKIP believe that the situation in Valencia over land grab is one which should have been dealt with by bilateral agreements between Spain and the individual countries concerned."
"Instead, I suspect the European Parliament is once again using a sledgehammer to miss the nut."
"Town planning is a field that needs to remain at local level in order for the needs of local areas to fall on understanding ears."
"A centralised policy would compound, not ameliorate, the problem."
"We have seen that time and time again with so-called European projects."
"Let me remind you of a few examples."
"Firstly, we have the common fisheries policy, with its seriously damaging quota system."
"Hailed as an environmental project, it has done near irreparable damage to fish stocks."
"A huge proportion of fish processing plants in the United Kingdom have been forced to close and local fishing economies have been devastated."
"And how can we talk about disasters without mentioning the CAP, which created wine lakes and butter mountains and is now giving Commissioner Mandelson as much of a headache as it is the farmers in the developing world?"
"In essence, Chirac, by protecting the little French farmer, is holding the world to ransom."
"Instead of stabilising the prices of primary product markets, the EU is harming the very people it says it wishes to help."
"The situation facing those non-Spanish nationals in Valencia, including many UK citizens, should be dealt with on a government-to-government basis."
"I lament the fact that the British Government has failed to reach a bilateral agreement with Spain on this issue."
"Instead, we see the EU octopus bureaucracy once again using private misfortune to plunder the sovereignty of Member States."
". Mr President, I should like to start by expressing my wholehearted thanks to all those who played a part in this success story, the final chapter of which should be the adoption of the report."
"Above all, I am delighted that the petitioners placed their trust in the European Union and in the Committee on Petitions, which I have the honour of chairing."
"I am also very glad that the Ombudsman for the region of Valencia offered his assistance during the drafting of the report and during our successful search for a solution to this issue."
"Furthermore, I am delighted that the work carried out by the members of our mission, which visited the region in June, was so productive."
"This mission was led by Mr Cashman, the Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, and also included Mrs Fourtou, whom I should like to thank for having drafted the report."
"Other members included Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, whom I should also like to thank, and the head of our Committee’s secretariat."
"The considerable amount of work that was carried out has borne fruit in the shape of this report."
"The petitions, which were initially submitted by Charles Svoboda on behalf of the Valencia-based campaign, and by Mr and Mrs Schuckall and Mrs Perret, were subsequently signed by over 10 000 people."
"To begin with, one could have been forgiven for asking whether the petitions merited further scrutiny, but it soon became apparent that they did."
"The reason for this was not only because the principles of environmental protection and the rules for awarding public tenders had been violated, but above all because a fundamental human right had been infringed."
"By this I mean the right to property, and moreover the right to property of people whose circumstances were frequently very modest, and who wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of their lives in the small homes they had built for themselves."
"The conversations we held with the petitioners, both during the fact-finding mission and during our meetings, revealed to us the full extent of the tragedy facing these individuals, who had had so much of their property taken away from them."
"The experiences of these people, who had discovered that they had been stripped of part of their possessions without their knowledge, and that their fundamental rights had been grossly violated, were truly appalling."
"Our Committee adopted the Fourtou report unanimously, with only one abstention."
"This report was the outcome of a compromise, and of debates within the Committee on the amendments."
"I therefore believe that this report should now be adopted by the House without any amendments that could distort its meaning."
"Since it has already been adopted unanimously once, I would be very glad if the House were also to adopt it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, our aim is that Valencia should adopt a new law."
"It has already promised to do so, which is a testimony to the effectiveness of Parliament’s work and that of its Committee."
"This law should take due account of human rights and of the rules on environmentally-related public tenders."
"Compensation for the injured parties is a further issue that needs addressing."
"We are therefore calling on the Valencian Government to keep detailed records on each individual case, and, where necessary, to offer appropriate compensation."
"I hope that Commissioner McCreevy, who is here on behalf of the European Commission, will do his best to ensure that no further injustices take place, and that past wrongs are redressed."
"Mr President, I must naturally begin by thanking Mrs Fourtou for producing this report, a report — as we have said — which has been the subject of much debate and work; let us not forget that this report ― as has also been said here ― has been given exceptional treatment in the Committee on Petitions: two parliamentary delegations have visited the Valencian Country to discuss and deal with this issue."
"I believe, however, that this issue is being brought to an end today and also that, by means of this report, the Socialist land-planning model that existed in the Valencian Country, which the Socialists implemented when they were in government, is going to be called into question."
"Such are the consequences."
"I am therefore pleased that, as Mr Libicki said, from now on, as a result of this new report, which I imagine the European Parliament will approve, this Parliament is going to applaud, amongst other things, the initiative that the current Valencian Government should negotiate and draw up a new law that replaces the previous Socialist law."
"In particular, I would like to stress that this new law, which will be drawn up and applied, will contain, amongst others, two fundamental points: firstly, that this new law will be approved in accordance with competences in the field of land-planning which fall exclusively to the Valencian Government, and, secondly, that the report also approves a series of recommendations so that the rule of law can deal with any complaints which, in application of the former LRAU, may have arisen or which may arise."
"In other words, all the rights of the citizens who have complained to this Committee on Petitions are now going to be safeguarded."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that the proper solution will come with the disappearance of the LRAU created by the previous Socialist government, and I am convinced that the proper solution will be found through the application of the new law that the People’s Party Government of the Valencian Country intends to create."
"Mr President, I would like firstly to thank Mrs Fourtou for the work she has done in the Committee."
"She has taken an open approach and we have been able to discuss many compromise amendments, and we also know that she has had a difficult job to do, because this is an issue in relation to which you cannot imagine the number of different interests at play and hence the pressure we face."
"I would like to make it clear that, firstly, thousands of European citizens have lived in the Valencian Country for decades, millions visit us every year and that these people are happy to live in our Community and are happy with the high-quality services which they generally receive in their daily lives."
"We are therefore talking about a welcoming Country."
"The majority of people there and those who want to come feel that it is a fortunate thing to be able to share their lives with us."
"It should also be noted that the majority can resolve their problems properly before the courts and be dealt with by certain local authorities in many places."
"But many people’s problems are not resolved, and we are currently faced with huge numbers of people whose problems persist."
"I am therefore dismayed about the fact that, over the last three years, complaints about land-planning abuses have increased very considerably."
"As a European citizen, born and resident in the Valencian Country, I sincerely regret that we need to hold this debate, but we must remember that, if this is the case, it is due to the fact that the complaints presented in this Parliament have been from thousands of European citizens who feel themselves to be victims of land-planning abuses."
"I wish to state clearly that we are facing an exceptional situation in Spain and in the rest of Europe, which, we should remember, has led to formal protests by seventeen European Union ambassadors."
"Other Spanish regions have laws similar to the LRAU; the head of the Autonomous Secretariat for Land-Planning and the Environment came here to say that that law was very good."
"Despite having similar laws, they have clearly never had a problem of this scale."
"I would therefore like to say to you that it is right that we should deal with the citizens’ concerns, I believe that the authorities wanted the delegation that went there to make proposals, and I believe that that is what the Committee has done."
"I believe that we must demand respect for the citizens in the face of economic groups with immense power, and against which the citizens often have little defence."
"I believe that we have the power to make a contribution to what Mr Iturgaiz suggested: not to have to repeat this debate and to be able to put an end to this situation."
"If we do not promote these solutions now, it is clear that in the future, unfortunately, we will have to face this problem all over again."
"As I said, as a citizen of the Valencian Country, I want these problems to be resolved and for the incompetence of a regional government not to spoil our image, as is happening in the eyes of many European citizens, because our Community does not deserve that."
"Mr President, please allow me first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Fourtou, on the work she has done, while regretting that that work was then altered during the final process of approving certain amendments, thus undermining what was originally a reasonable report."
"In the end, what we are being presented with today, ladies and gentlemen, is a mixture of irresponsible populism on the part of Members who wish to satisfy their fellow citizens resident in Spain at any cost and on the part of Spanish Members who have decided to play local or regional politics in the European Parliament — from one side and from the other: you have just seen a demonstration of this."
"That combination of two kinds of irresponsible populism leads to aberrations such as those which may be voted for here if this text is not modified."
"It is sad to see the European Parliament turned into a regional legislator, entirely distorting the principle of subsidiarity and telling an Autonomous Community what it must do, how it must do it, how it must legislate, when it can grant planning permission and under what conditions."
"I understand and agree with the criticisms of this law, unquestionably, and I naturally agree with the criticisms of its application by the Valencian Government — of the law and of its application."
"The European Parliament, however, ladies and gentlemen, is not the Sanctuary of Lourdes, to which people can resort when all hope has run out everywhere else."
"This is a serious institution and all that is achieved by bringing a resolution of this kind here is to create a false image to the citizens, since resolutions are approved that will be entirely sterile, because it is in the Valencian Parliament that this issue will be resolved, and this creates a reputation which in no way enhances the work of this House nor increases the respect that we are asking the citizens to feel for our work."
"I therefore entirely agree with the criticisms of the land-planning situation in Valencia: the criticisms of the law and the criticisms of the government."
"Dealing with it in this House is like protesting here about delays on the London underground."
"I do not believe that the European Parliament is the proper place to do this and what we are doing, by approving a document like this, is distorting the institutional system itself."
"Mr President, I am not intending with my speech to express any sort of disrespect to the autonomy of the Valencian Country."
"In any case, I believe that its autonomy is insufficient considering the real need of this area of the Catalan Countries."
"Having said this, I believe that it is necessary to introduce a requirement for a common European vision regarding territorial planning and environment protection."
"It is my assumption that real estate speculators take advantage of the feeble nature of Valencian autonomy."
"This is a breeding ground for large-scale corruption."
"A consensus is necessary in the EU in order to avoid policies that threaten rational European planning and the environment."
"States, regions and autonomous communities should play a role in the definition of this consensus."
"The failure to move towards this goal will cause areas such as the Valencian Country and the Balearic Islands, where construction is the main economic activity, to see their whole territories jeopardised."
"It is already a major anomaly that the building sector is the main profitable activity in our part of the world."
"Not putting an end to this will mean that certain business groups will become richer, bringing about massive social, environmental and economic troubles in the near future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, let me say at the very outset that this matter was the subject of a report, as long ago as May 2004, by the Committee on Petitions, in which grave violations of human rights and infringements of Community law were illustrated by reference to actual cases."
"In June of this year, a delegation from this House went on an information-gathering trip to Valencia, where they interviewed various parties, members of the public, and residents in the region, as well as representatives of the regional governments and of the constitutional court."
"We must bear in mind the fact that current land law in Spain accords landowners 90% of the building rights and that it is a peculiar characteristic of the law under consideration – the law on the expropriation of land – that it compels owners to hand over 10% of their land, without compensation, to any local body with a plan to develop it."
"We must also be aware that many owners have sustained real detriment as a result of these development processes, and that some planned developments have had devastating effects on the environment and the ecological balance of many coastal areas and especially on the future prospects for water supply, which is something else about which the European Union is concerned."
"I am, then, very glad to learn that the Region of Valencia has revised this law and has already produced a new one to replace it."
"We must take care to ensure that the law includes, above all, an unambiguous definition of what is meant by ‘public interest’, in order to obviate, beyond all doubt, the overwhelming likelihood of the ‘public interest’ defence for expropriations being deployed to benefit private rather than public interests."
"There must also be binding criteria for the calculation of compensation for expropriations, and these must be founded upon standards and principles recognised in the case law of the ECJ and the European Court of Human Rights."
"This is, however, a special case, and this House must be careful not to raise the public’s hopes too high, since they may, in the event, prove impossible to fulfil."
"Mr President, I would like to make two preliminary points before getting into the issue in question."
"Firstly, the complaints we are discussing here are directed at a legitimate law, approved by a regional parliament in accordance with its competences and not invalidated by the Constitutional Court."
"Secondly, the judgments that we are issuing in no sense relate to illegal acts: Spain is a country with guarantees, with an open legal system, which culminates in the European Courts, and it falls to them to make moral judgments according the clear principle of criminal law of"
"I understand the considerations that Mr Guardans has expressed and I would not have tolerated an encroachment of the competences either of the regional Parliament or of the national Parliament or the Spanish courts."
"It does fall to this Parliament and Mrs Fourtou has done this with unrivalled elegance to deal with the citizens’ petitions and to make recommendations; recommendations, incidentally, that the current government of the Valencian Country have taken up with great generosity and intelligence."
"What this Parliament cannot do is try to take over the job of land-planning that is the responsibility of the regional authorities, which is the impression I got from the speech – in English I believe – by my compatriot Joan i Marí."
"Secondly, a moratorium cannot be established either, because that falls to the regional Parliament."
"Thirdly, this Parliament cannot establish compensation: an administrative authority cannot pay compensation without a judicial judgment or an administrative resolution without being guilty of the misappropriation of funds."
"Finally, this Parliament is not the place, as Mr Guardans has said quite rightly — and I address this to Mr Calabuig — for a political trial."
"Mr Calabuig has not said that the law that we are discussing was decided upon by the Socialist majority to which he belongs, and not by the majority to which I belong."
"Secondly, he has not said that he is the author of an amendment that states that the petitions focus on the last three years, a period during which Mr Camps’ government has been in power; the petitions come from a long time before that and his politically-inspired intention is for the regional government to be blamed, because it is that government — so far with little success, by the way, and long may that continue — that he wants to bring down."
"In this regard I agree with Mr Guardans: it is not proper, it is not morally correct, to use this Parliament to blacken the name of a Community, of a legitimately elected Parliament and of a government supported by the citizens."
". Mr President, I wish to thank Members for their comments."
"The sheer number of people who have supported the petitions covered by Mrs Fourtou’s report demonstrates that the application of the LRAU law in Valencia is raising problems."
"As I indicated at the beginning of this debate, most of the problems encountered fall outside the scope of Community law."
"While the Commission understands the concerns raised, it is not in a position to provide a solution."
"Where problems of compatibility with Community law are identified, the Commission will not fail to act and will take the necessary steps aimed at rectifying the situation."
"This is the case for public procurement aspects of the LRAU law."
"We have identified a number of problems in this area, and infringement proceedings against Spain were opened."
"We are pursuing these procedures with a view to ensuring a correct application of Community procurement legislation."
"Colleagues in various departments of the Commission have looked at the report covering areas such as environmental policy, justice and home affairs, consumer policy and regional policy."
"It would be wrong to raise expectations that, in these areas, the enforcement of Community law will offer the petitioners a solution to the problems they have encountered."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"For more than two years, the European Parliament has received tens of thousands of petitions from European citizens, including many Dutch people, about the misuse of a law on urbanisation projects (LRAU) in the Valencia region."
"That law entitles project developers to take land from house owners illegitimately, with the latter receiving very little, or no, compensation, only to be expected to cough up again for the construction of roads, sewage and street lights."
"Fortunately, Parliament has addressed this problem and will, tomorrow, be voting on the report on it by the Liberal Member Mrs Fourtou."
"In so doing, it will be urging Valencia to improve the law – a process that was set in motion after a visit by a European inquiry committee – and to set up a procedure for assessing the situation of house owners on a case-by-case basis, including compensatory measures."
"I have, on previous occasions, spoken with Dutch people in the region and I am pleased that the urgency of the situation is finally being recognised."
"It is a good thing that Valencia has, at Europe’s request, started to review the law, but those words will now also need to be translated into action to prevent more owners from being treated unfairly."
"The right to property is a fundamental right."
"Property owners in Valencia have had their property and land confiscated on a massive scale and built on by often unscrupulous property developers and local authorities, acting with the connivance of the Valencian authorities under the terms of the LRAU. Petitions to the European Parliament and two fact-finding missions attest to this fact."
"This is totally unacceptable in a free society."
"There should be a moratorium on all current and planned urbanisation projects in the region until new legislation which fully respects property rights is adopted by the Valencian Parliament."
"For those that have lost land and property to development by Valencian authorities a new law should establish as a matter of urgency a legal administrative structure with the power to review development plans and to assess proper compensation for victims."
"Property owners who have lost out through collusion between property developers and the local authorities in Valencia must be properly compensated."
"While I welcome the Valencian authorities reviewing the policy of land appropriation, there is still a need for justice for citizens who have already lost land and property."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0343/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Industry, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy end-use efficiency and energy services and repealing Council Directive 93/76/EEC (10721/3/2005 – C6-0298/2005 – 2003/0300(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Rothe)."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am glad that we will, tomorrow, be adopting the directive on energy end-use efficiency and energy services."
"That is not a matter of doubt now that the compromises reached with the Council seem certain to be supported by all the groups in this House."
"I would like to extend the warmest of thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs and to those who assisted us, cooperation with all of whom was excellent and certainly made an essential contribution to our achieving a result."
"While this result is less than what the Commission proposed and certainly far less than what Parliament sought at first reading, I do assert that it is a credible one."
"It requires the Member States, over a period of nine years, to make energy savings of at least 9%, which is less than the 11.5% that Parliament was asking for."
"It is also the case that these targets – contrary to what both the Commission and Parliament wanted – are not binding."
"Even so, I think we were right not to let this stand in the way of an agreement."
"Although we have not been able to agree on binding targets, the directive does contain specific requirements for action at the national level."
"With effect from mid-2007, the Member States will be required to draw up, on a regular basis, that is to say initially every four years and thereafter every three, energy efficiency action plans, which they must then send to Brussels."
"These action plans shall contain the Member States’ planned measures to achieve the targets, which might well include projects to renovate buildings, the promotion of energy-efficient equipment or of energy audits, car-free days and major educational and information campaigns."
"These action plans are to lay particular stress on the public sector, to which the directive gives an exemplary role."
"The intended result of this directive is the establishment, by means of indicators and benchmarks, of new energy efficiency standards throughout Europe."
"There is enormous potential for us to make savings, and it really is high time that we made better use of it."
"Between 20% and 30% of our present energy consumption could be cut without our sustaining any economic losses whatever; that amount is equivalent to the energy consumed by six Member States, namely Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Greece and the Netherlands taken together."
"At a time when energy prices are high, it is incomprehensible that better use is not being made of this potential, and another remarkable thing about this is that it was very difficult to achieve this result, with a number of Member States being unwilling to go any further."
"This directive can and must usher in a real drive for energy efficiency."
"Where demand for energy is concerned, there is considerable ground for us to make up."
"While there are some Member States – Denmark is one of them – that have exemplary energy saving policies with binding targets, there are others that will have to start virtually from square one."
"The directive also aims to create a real market for energy services, which would be offered by distributors and vendors of energy as well as by independent service providers."
"The new European legislation will also have the important effect of affording consumers greater transparency, with, for example, energy meters tailored as closely as possible to the individual’s needs, and a regular account of consumption that makes it possible to compare one’s own consumption with that of a control group."
"Commissioner Piebalgs deserves a great deal of congratulation for declaring energy efficiency to be his priority."
"This directive is a vitally important element in any strategy to that end."
"What matters now is that it be transposed and implemented, and I hope that the Commission will cast a critical eye over the Member States to ensure that this really is done in a satisfactory manner."
". Mr President, I agree with the rapporteur on the importance of this directive."
"For me, it is an umbrella directive for all that is being done and should be done on energy efficiency."
"Parliament made significant progress on this directive at first reading."
"Now, at second reading, the rapporteur, Mrs Rothe, and the shadow rapporteurs have continued to improve the proposals."
"They have further developed a number of essential elements in the common position and have successfully negotiated a package of compromise amendments which will reshape and improve the proposal even further."
"Regarding the question of targets, I, like most of you, regret that a compromise has only been possible without binding targets, but the final version of the amendments introduces a number of binding measures, which strongly compensates for the loss of binding targets."
"While the targets are now indicative, Member States must still commit to adopting and aiming to achieve national energy savings targets, and to taking cost-effective measures designed to achieve these targets."
"Moreover, impacts of the measures taken to meet the targets will be quantified using a harmonised measurement system."
"Member States will also have to plan their measures and report their results in national Energy Efficiency Action Plans."
"These will be assessed by the Commission, and for the Commission, this is an acceptable construction."
"We would like to assure Parliament that the mandate given to the Commission to develop a system of benchmarks, top-down indicators and bottom-up measurements, will be used wisely and effectively."
"For the public sector, there is no separate target in the compromise, but a number of binding measures."
"Member States must publish mandatory public procurement guidelines for energy efficiency improvement."
"Furthermore, they must select and use a number of public procurement requirements."
"While the Commission would have preferred a separate public sector target, we feel that these elements, and the requirement to include the public sector in the national action plans, will compensate for the lack of a separate target."
"Article 13 on metering and informative billing of energy consumption has also been improved compared to the common position."
"The reporting requirements for Member States and the Commission in Article 14 have been strengthened and these, together with the measurement system, will make Member States’ achievements quantifiable and visible."
"Although this activity will put an increased burden on the Commission, we welcome the challenge."
"I can promise Parliament an adequate internal allocation of resources for this task."
"To conclude, I have on earlier occasions said that energy efficiency is one of the main priorities of this Commission."
"That will remain so throughout our mandate period."
"This new directive is expected to be a valuable tool for achieving that goal."
"I would like to thank Parliament for that and assure it that the tool will be used as effectively as possible."
"Last but not least, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Rothe, and the shadow rapporteurs for their commitment, their very constructive cooperation and hard work in reaching an agreement at second reading."
". Mr President, at this point in time it is necessary for the European Union to take immediate measures to improve energy efficiency."
"We must therefore take pleasure from the fact that we have been able to reach an agreement amongst the institutions which has the majority support of this House."
"Within this context, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Mechtild Rothe, on her magnificent work and the other shadow rapporteurs on their constructive attitude throughout the procedure."
"This directive is intended to promote the development of an energy services market which, although it is already in existence, is not sufficiently well known to the final customers."
"We are presenting options that do not require additional investments, such as energy savings contracts, the amount of which is paid with the equivalent of the energy bill saved following the alterations."
"This directive also attempts to influence the consumer habits of the citizens."
"In this respect, it is the appropriate approach to take in order to provide them with detailed information about their real consumption and savings potential, if certain measures are taken, such as the use of intelligent meters."
"In relation to the public sector, we must stress the exemplary role that the Member States must play by including energy efficiency criteria for public contracts."
"Over the first nine years they will draw up three energy efficiency action plans, which will detail the measures taken and the future objectives."
"Mr President, I would like to end by reiterating that our group is entirely satisfied with this agreement, since we believe that realistic objectives, accompanied by economically viable and technically possible measures, are the ideal formula for achieving positive results."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate my colleague, Mrs Mechtild Rothe, on an excellent report."
"She has done much excellent work and we in our group strongly support her."
"Europe, which actually invests in energy use efficiency, is once again an example for other continents to follow."
"We are setting an example to the rest of the world, because serious and effective measures need to be taken, with climate change threatening us all."
"The target 1% per annum in additional savings will be tough."
"In my country, for example, it will be thought impossible as a goal to be achieved every year unless the initial energy-effective situation we already have is taken into consideration."
"It is obviously unfair that some of the energy savings work that has already been actively carried out should be ignored just because it has been carried out too early, so to speak."
"It is therefore reasonable not to punish those who have already invested in efficiency before leaving it too late."
"Moreover, in my country we already refer to guidelines for energy-efficient public procurement and buildings."
"Fortunately, then, the Kyoto negotiations may be continued on the basis of the outcome of the Montreal Summit."
"May we work effectively in negotiations, as they will not succeed just with the help of technology: people, leaders and politicians will also be needed."
". Mr President, my group is supporting the second reading compromise with the Council because it represents a step in the right direction, even though it does not go quite as far as we would have liked."
"In particular we were disappointed that the target for energy-efficiency savings has been set at only 9% over 9 years, instead of the 11.5% proposed by Parliament at first reading."
"We would also have liked the targets to be binding, but it is good that the compromise at least lays down certain mandatory actions, including public procurement requirements and the introduction of energy-efficiency action plans, which will be used to measure Member States’ progress towards the energy-saving targets."
"I would like to say a particular word about the metering and billing proposals in Article 13."
"These are essential because they establish the fundamental principle that consumers have a right to information about how much energy they are using."
"It is only when people have such knowledge that they can start to adapt their behaviour and choose energy-saving options."
"I am very pleased that the compromise text requires electricity and gas customers to be provided with individual meters that accurately reflect their actual energy consumption and give information on the time of use."
"The text also includes a requirement for information on energy use and cost to be provided with customers’ bills and crucially it requires billing to be provided on the basis of actual consumption, not estimated consumption, and to be frequent enough to enable people to work out for themselves how to be more energy efficient."
"Now that bills will have to be based on actual consumption, utility companies will no longer be able to issue estimated bill after estimated bill, which has led to widespread debt problems."
"I believe this directive marks the start of a new era in which across Europe we will all become much wiser about the way we use energy and I hope the House will support the compromise wholeheartedly."
"I thank the rapporteur, Mrs Rothe, very much indeed for all the work she has put in to get this agreement."
"Mr President, of all Europe’s energy sources, energy efficiency is the most important, and the fastest and cheapest way to achieve our Kyoto targets; not only that, but it also gives us a chance to invest in Europe and create jobs, rather than handing over money to foreign countries or to the Arab world in return for oil and gas."
"This directive not only brings the day closer when we can develop this potential, but also complements the opening-up of Europe’s gas and electricity markets."
"Alongside competition in the production and sale of electricity and gas, this directive will make for more vigorous competition in relation to investments in energy-saving technologies, in what are called ‘negawatts’."
"Particularly to small and medium-sized enterprises, this market is potentially worth billions."
"What is good about this directive?"
"One good thing in it is the concept of national action plans, the first of which has to be submitted by June 2007, after which the Commission will have six months in which to suggest any improvements that it thinks necessary."
"After three years, an assessment or evaluation will be carried out, and the next plan will then be drawn up, which will incorporate the lessons learned, not only from the successes and failures of one national plan, but those learned from the successes and failures of 25 or 27 of them."
"That means that we, in Europe, can really get serious about saving energy."
"We should not, however, harbour any illusions about this: when debate turns to energy efficiency, it is often the case that people invoke a general consensus – one that I, however, do not believe actually exists."
"The real reason why the big energy companies, like RWE and E.ON, fought this directive tooth and nail behind the scenes in the Commission, in this House and in the Council, right up to the very end, is that the prospect of a market in the saving of energy terrifies them."
"It is for that reason that these companies, aided by their sympathisers in parliaments and governments, have seen to it that none of the targets are binding."
"While I do regret this, I have not yet given up hope that all of them – particularly, in future, the members of the national parliaments – are capable of learning and will imitate the Danish model: a binding 1.7% is what we need in the other countries too."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the energy issue is a global issue."
"For Europe, that means guaranteeing security of supply, an area in which we are too dependent on third countries."
"We need to address the massive increase in costs, which will have repercussions on the Union’s economy, and to reduce the environmental impact and greenhouse gas emissions with the aim of meeting the Kyoto targets."
"To do this, concerted efforts at European level can no longer be put off, and the first line of defence is to focus on energy saving and energy efficiency."
"The directive is not as forceful as we might have hoped; the compromise is far from being perfect and there are no binding targets, only indicative ones."
"The target of 1% per year over nine years is far short of the recognised potential savings, which exceed 30%."
"The public sector will not have more stringent requirements, as Parliament had requested."
"The transport sector is only marginally affected by the directive."
"Nevertheless, the decision to endorse the compromise reflects more general thinking."
"The directive can create incentives aimed at immediately reducing energy demand."
"It has been accepted that there is a need for more transparent energy billing systems, which can help users to adopt an energy-saving approach."
"The information contained in the energy efficiency action plan can act as an incentive to make the Member States behave properly, particularly if the review system can guarantee that the results will be evaluated on the basis of bottom-up calculation models."
"The hope is that the directive might contribute to creating a real energy services market, guaranteeing equal opportunities and quality in terms of services through the use of targeted incentives."
"A decisive political decision in favour of technologies that increase energy efficiency is crucial to give fresh impetus to innovation and European competitiveness, that is to say, to make this directive an effective instrument for fulfilling the Lisbon Strategy."
"What we are talking about is a means of investing resources to create new jobs, instead of continuing to pay out to the large oil companies."
"I take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Rothe, and all of the shadow rapporteurs for this successful outcome."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is terrific that we have achieved a compromise that has improved the situation as it was."
"While it is true to say that energy efficiency is a most important instrument for solving Europe’s energy problem, it is not the only means to that end."
"Finding the right ways in which to do this is something that needs to be worked at, and that has been achieved outstandingly well in the compromise reached between first and second readings."
"For that I wish to extend warm thanks to Mrs Rothe."
"This compromise has managed to take a more realistic view of things, to take differences seriously and to refrain from imposing the same targets on everyone."
"It is very important that we should take seriously the differences in the Member States, the options and differences in the various areas, fields and markets, and so I am very glad that the benchmark approach has been adopted and that the Commission has been mandated to further develop it in order to take the various motivations into account."
"There is a need for incentives to foster transparency, and a need for less cumbersome bureaucracy, since data for many areas is already available, along with market-oriented thinking, since the suppliers of energy-efficient equipment would then have a sales pitch and a vested interest in the markets for energy-efficient products in the individual states becoming more like each other rather than drifting further apart."
"The ability to compare sales figures in each market segment with those of the previous year would then equip them with a readily usable instrument."
"The energy efficiency sector affords us a massive opportunity to work towards what is, in principle, a shared goal."
"We can now try to move this process forward in another way, and perhaps even faster, in that we rely on the self-interest of the parties involved, treating each as individuals rather than adopting a ‘one size fits all’ approach."
"It is for that reason that I hope we can end up achieving better results than we might have done with requirements imposed by a central authority."
"Firstly I would like to congratulate our rapporteur for the excellent work."
"It is no mean achievement to work out around fifty compromises with the Council and the five different factions of Parliament."
"In view of the forward-looking and very positive results, I would like to indicate that this draft is only the first step in enhancing energy consumption efficiency."
"This is something that we should not forget when we start addressing the financing issues of the implementation."
"In Hungary there are 800 000 prefabricated flats, where heating constitutes 54% of the household running costs."
"The individual modernisation of these flats is an absolute necessity if we want to improve energy efficiency."
"This would cost in excess of 40 000 euros per flat, with a payback period of 25 years."
"In view of the low financing capacity of the population and local governments, the Hungarian state has started a large scale, long term refurbishment project of prefabricated flats."
"Basically this means that the state advances the funds required for the modernisation work to the consumers, and the population repays them from their energy savings."
"We spent 15 million euros on this project in 2004, and 32 million euros in 2005."
"It will be very important to remember, when we work on the 2007-2013 budget of the European Union, that in order to reach the important energy efficiency targets stipulated in the currently debated draft, more than half a million, mostly modest households will need financial assistance from the European Union in Hungary only."
"Thank you for your attention, on their behalf, too."
"– Climate change poses a threat both to the people of the world and to the environment."
"At the same time Europe is becoming increasingly dependent on imported fossil fuels, and this has a serious impact on its energy security."
"For this reason the European Union is wrestling with two major challenges in the area of energy: how to reduce its dependence on imports, and how to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in line with the commitments of the Kyoto Protocol as well as after its expiry."
"In both cases we can make use of the as yet unexploited possibility of efficient energy use."
"In formulating the directive on energy end-use efficiency we had the choice of two approaches."
"The first approach would have involved opting for slightly more ambitious indicative targets, and the second for less ambitious, very realistically attainable binding targets."
"I take the view, however, that the current proposal contains a combination of the two approaches – indicative as well as very realistic targets."
"I would like them to be a little more ambitious."
"It makes sense to me that we should set ourselves binding targets."
"I also believe that targets set higher for the public sector would set a good example for the private sector."
"I am well aware, however, that current European reality has a somewhat bitter aftertaste – we are neither able or skilful enough to reach agreements, and we have no support for our work."
"We must therefore be especially careful to define the targets in such a way that they can be fulfilled."
"Only in this case can the directive encourage individual countries and people to implement appropriate measures."
"People’s confidence in the rationality contained in the substance of Europe’s legal system must be improved, while the directive must also serve to improve the reputation of the European Union."
"The proposal that Member States draw up three reports on efficient energy use, and that the fulfilment of commitments be closely monitored, will require more work and impose a greater administrative burden."
"Yet it is only this kind of approach that is responsible, serious and able to produce appropriate results."
"Commissioner, I welcome the goal that you have chosen as the most important in this term, and I support the directive on energy end-use efficiency."
"I believe that this very directive is a prime example of how joint European action can yield added value, and not simply in financial terms."
"Transparent operations, continuous exchange of information and the formulation of good practices in this field throughout Europe are indeed essential if the targets are to be met."
". Mr President, over the past few months energy issues have grabbed the headlines."
"We have seen the debate on the north European gas pipeline."
"We have also had headlines on the transit agreement between Ukraine and Russia concerning gas supplies."
"There has been an accident at a depot storing oil products near London."
"These issues usually grab the headlines."
"Energy efficiency is now attracting attention but has not yet made the front page."
"However, there are indirect indications that the policies the European Parliament and the Member States are pursuing are producing results."
"I shall mention just two examples that are encouraging."
"Firstly, China has started to use the target approach: it aims to decrease its energy intensity by 20% by 2010."
"That is not a huge step, but it is the same target-based approach."
"It is ambitious, but perhaps it could be even more ambitious."
"Secondly, I am encouraged by the reaction of the OPEC countries on the oil price forecast for the near future."
"They forecast strong growth in consumption in the United States and China."
"They have avoided mentioning Europe."
"So, from their point of view, Europe is doing reasonably well."
"However, we must not be complacent."
"This directive is really necessary."
"I would also like to make a few comments on what has been said."
"I am really grateful to both representatives from the new Member States, Mrs Herczog and Mr Jordan Cizelj, because the biggest difficulty we had in the Council was with the new Member States."
"That was paradoxical because the issue had been seen as perhaps an obstacle to growth."
"In fact, it is the opposite: it gives a chance for growth."
"I will continue to explain to the new Member States that they do not in fact need to consume a lot of energy per capita, and can even now gain the benefits."
"I agree with Mr Reul that this is a huge opportunity, and we should use it."
"I agree with Mr Guidoni that perhaps we could be more ambitious in the air transport sector, but it is there in the directive, and this will also provide an opportunity to deal with energy efficiency in that sector."
"Concerning the Danish example, I believe that, in this directive, all other Member States will follow because the suspicion will not be there."
"I think that industry will discover that its profits will not decrease because of energy efficiency being in place – indeed, perhaps the opposite, as it provides new chances for growth in that sector as well."
"I believe that metering and billing are important because transparency will make a real difference to the consumer."
"We need to change not only the approach of the supplier but that of the consumer."
"That could be done through clear, transparent and correct information."
"Only then will the consumer start to change."
"The directive also takes into account the initial situation on energy efficiency."
"We will not punish the countries that started earlier."
"They could use this for achieving the target."
"But at the same time, I think that, with the development of new technologies, there will be a huge opportunity for energy savings and energy efficiency even in the most progressive countries."
"The strange thing is that the country that had been supporting mandatory targets was Denmark – from which, in other circumstances, we could have expected bigger opposition – and the countries that have done most in terms of end-use potential said that they had no particular difficulties with mandatory targets."
"So, by doing, you learn something."
"I think that the energy services market is extremely important."
"It gives opportunities not only for energy efficiency, but for employment and growth in the Union."
"With this recommendation amending the text of the common position, we are very close to finalising the legislative process on the energy end-use efficiency and energy services proposal."
"I am pleased to confirm that the Commission can accept the outcome of the compromise between Parliament and the Council."
"I would like to invite Parliament now to support the compromise package which reflects important changes that the rapporteur, together with the shadow rapporteurs, has achieved during a long and difficult process."
"Although, given the challenge to Parliament and also the Council, it was not so long, it was a very difficult compromise."
"But, at the end of the day, there were very fruitful negotiations, and I think the proposal, as it stands now, is perhaps even better than the initial proposal."
"I would again like to thank the rapporteurs for this achievement."
"Now we need to deliver from the Commission side and also from the Member States’ side."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday."
"The next item is the report by Pier Luigi Bersani, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on taxation of undertakings in the European Union: a common consolidated corporate tax base (2005/2120(INI)) (A6-0386/2005)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a very important and positive discussion on this report took place in committee, and for this I should like first of all to thank all my colleagues."
"The reasons for suggesting the introduction of a common consolidated corporate tax base for businesses operating in various EU countries concern the removal of the obstacles hindering the completion of the internal market, and are inspired by the Lisbon Strategy."
"There are two reasons in particular."
"The first relates to the need to simplify and reduce the management and administrative costs for businesses, which are today faced with 25 different tax bases."
"As a consequence of this measure, they will instead be able to pay their tax burden more easily, and will also receive encouragement to invest and to work in a European, and not exclusively national, dimension."
"The second reason relates to transparency, because harmonisation of the tax bases will make any kind of opportunistic behaviour more difficult, insofar as a common tax base – while in no way interfering in the tax rates set by the various Member States – will at last make the various tax rates fully understandable and comparable."
"These two reasons, which are fully acknowledged by experts and company representatives whose opinions we sought while drafting the report, have convinced a very large number of the committee’s members."
"This is, however, a very difficult undertaking from both a political and a technical point of view."
"The political difficulties are due to the fact that a certain number of countries – albeit a smaller number than a few years ago – express difficulties with, and opposition to, tackling taxation matters, even though, in this instance, it is not a matter of tax rates."
"The main technical difficulties lie in identifying a common base of indicators with the aim of progressing to a common tax base."
"The Commission has already been working along these lines for some time and has set up the technical groups."
"With this report, we want to show our appreciation for the work done by the Commission, by giving it encouragement, by spurring it on and by providing a number of suggestions."
"The purpose and commitment of the committee’s members has been to encourage Parliament to voice its opinion loud and clear, something that I hope is possible, even though this will obviously entail some sacrifices and self-control from the political groups."
"Fiscal matters are very problematic."
"It is no secret that the positions of the various groups and the various Member States are very far apart."
"That is why in committee we drew up some possible compromise ideas that might focus attention on the core aspect of the issue, that is to say the common consolidated corporate tax base, without entering into the broader area of tax competition or convergence, which remains open and which has not been addressed here."
"This approach has enabled us to draft a practical report and to provide a number of useful and specific suggestions."
"The report calls for a regulation to be drafted and points out the subject-matter that should be included."
"It also provides for the possible use of enhanced cooperation in the event of a unanimous agreement not being reached, and suggests a gradual approach to the introduction of the – initially optional – common tax base, with a medium-term assessment to consider the practicality of making it compulsory at a later date."
"The subject we are presenting therefore has clear boundaries, but it is nonetheless an important subject that I hope can involve a large majority of Parliament."
"For this reason, and even though I can also see a number of my own opinions in certain of the additional amendments tabled, I believe that it is crucial, both in this debate and in the vote in Parliament, to maintain the profile of the report – a balance achieved in committee – which I believe is invaluable to the success of this initiative."
". Mr President, I am pleased to contribute to this debate on company taxation."
"I read with great interest the report from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and I participated in an extremely interesting hearing which the committee held recently on the subject."
"I am particularly pleased that the draft report is so supportive of the current Commission company taxation policy and I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Bersani, on this thorough piece of work."
"The draft report includes an excellent summary of the current situation as regards the taxation of companies in the internal market."
"Its conclusions are very similar to those of the Commission."
"The main objective of a common consolidated corporate tax base is to remove the remaining tax obstacles to the proper functioning of the internal market."
"These obstacles were catalogued by the Commission in its company tax report in 2001, and the Commission’s response was to promote the introduction in the longer term of a comprehensive solution: a common consolidated corporate tax base."
"This project has recently been given additional support during the review of the Lisbon Strategy."
"To achieve the Lisbon goals – growth, jobs, competitiveness and investment – and to promote administrative simplification and cost reductions, we need appropriate tax policies."
"In my opinion, the common consolidated corporate tax base will go a long way in providing the EU with the tools it needs to progress."
"In October the Commission adopted a communication that outlined the base on which taxation and customs policies could contribute to the Lisbon Strategy."
"One such measure is to present a Community legislative measure for the common consolidated corporate tax base by 2008."
"I know that it is an ambitious timetable, but I understand that you are proposing an even more ambitious one for 2007."
"I am pleased that Mr Bersani’s report is so supportive of some of the more radical elements of the common consolidated corporate tax base, such as consolidation and the sharing of the consolidated tax base between individual Member States."
"I am equally pleased that the report supports the Commission’s position that the new tax base should be optional for companies and that the report avoids the trap of becoming involved in tax rates."
"Our current work is directed at the tax base and does not touch upon the tax rate."
"As you know, not all Member States are currently enthusiastic supporters of the common consolidated corporate tax base."
"Our aim, however, is to have a proposal for all 25 Member States, so your report will be an important additional tool for the Commission to use in future debate on the subject as we attempt to persuade the current dissenters."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by thanking Mr Bersani for his cooperation in drawing up the report."
"What has come into being really is a compromise, and that is something I want to emphasise, since there are of course other opinions represented in our group, and I can tell the Commissioner that resistance to this policy at European level comes not only from the Member States but also from among the ranks of our group, that of the European People’s Party."
"There is resistance not only to the single tax base for businesses, but also to the idea of a single corporation tax in Europe, which keeps on resurfacing in this particular debate."
"So where do I, speaking as the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, think there will be particular problems?"
"I believe that if you start by talking about the tax base, it is virtually inevitable that you will end up next discussing the Member States’ tax rates, and that is something we will have nothing to do with."
"If we are to harmonise the tax base, we must be aware of the fact that we are, by so doing, obliged to make a deep incursion into the nation states’ tax-raising competences, and we want nothing to do with that either."
"If a tax base for European enterprises is to be created, it has to be borne in mind that businesses – DAX companies, for example – are even now operating in accordance with international accounting standards, and that is something that we have to accept."
"If, Commissioner, we are to make tax policy at the European level, we have to be aware of the fact that that is not far removed from competence in tax policy as described in the European Communities Treaty."
"That is something that needs to be borne in mind."
"Finally, the fact that the European Court of Justice is due, tomorrow, to hand down a judgment in the case of Marks [amp] Spencer, cannot do other than emphasise the obvious truth that the case law of the Court of Justice in Luxembourg is now extending ever wider the influence of Brussels."
"That is something else of which this debate should take account, and I want to stress that we would be mistaken to allow the European Union’s common system of law to become a community founded on laws made by judges – something that I, for one, would regard as unacceptable."
". Mr President, Commissioner Kovács, ladies and gentlemen, taxes on undertakings in the Union affect the operation of the internal market, the competitiveness of European companies and tax relations amongst the Member States."
"It is crucial to the launch of the Lisbon Strategy and the achievement of its growth and employment objectives."
"The application of twenty-five different taxes on companies creates obstacles to cross-border activities, reduces the efficiency of companies, over-burdening them with greater costs, and causes many fiscal problems for the Member States, as well as greater complexity in the fight against fraud and tax evasion, dealing with double taxation and relations between groups with a presence in different Member States."
"The diverse nature of the existing regulations prevents the economic coordination of the States in this field, encourages companies to seek to profit through fiscal optimisation practices, which may affect equal conditions in terms of competition amongst companies, and creates legal uncertainties, which is leading to increasing recourse to the legal system."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Bersani, on having dealt with all of these aspects in his report with balance and rigour, achieving a significant degree of consensus within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The creation of a legal framework that establishes a common consolidated tax base for Community undertakings is an essential instrument for dealing with the problems raised."
"It will provide transparency with a view to carrying out homogenous comparisons between States and promoting their coordination in the field of tax in accordance with the approved integrated guidelines for relaunching the Lisbon Strategy."
"The report is ambitious."
"Its aim is the first fiscal harmonisation in the field of direct taxation, calls upon the Commission to present a legislative proposal between now and 2007 and tries to put an end to the damaging lack of legislative progress in this field."
"Achieving a common tax base has great value in itself, quite apart from being essential to further progress."
"For all of these reasons, we support the report fully and we believe Parliament’s broad support to be a very positive thing so that there can be no doubt about our will to make progress on this historic milestone."
". Lately, we have increasingly been paying attention to tax policy, despite it being more of a national policy issue."
"Unfortunately, such discussions are limited to the examination of individual taxes and not the assessment of the aggregate impact of each tax type upon the economy."
"The purpose of the profits tax is to promote supply, or, as it is often put, entrepreneurship."
"These characteristics vary from country to country and depend on a number of factors, such as traditions, education and historical experience."
"Thus, it is obvious that different degrees of effort are needed to promote entrepreneurship in different countries, and, therefore, different rates of tax on profits must be applied."
"My group will not approve the amendments proposing, in one way or another, to achieve the equalisation of rates of tax on profits."
"Nevertheless, we support the proposals in the report of Mr Bersani to develop a common tax base calculation and enforcement procedure."
"We believe that the introduction of the common tax base will, first of all, allow greater exploitation of the single market advantages, and, secondly, will enable the talents of businessmen to be manifested not only in their countries, but also in the entire European Union."
"This will also contribute to the development of an entrepreneurial tradition and make it easier to meet the challenges of globalisation."
"What causes the concern then?"
"There are two issues that are of concern and should probably be further considered in our legislative activities."
"First, ways to prevent unfair competition, where small enterprises use the wider tax base of their home countries, while larger enterprises operating in several countries will be able to opt for the most favourable tax base among those countries."
"Second, how to distribute tax revenues on profits between individual countries when an enterprise operates in several countries and uses a uniform profit tax calculation."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I see the arrival, as a topic on our order of business, of the topic of the Europe-wide harmonisation of business taxation."
"The co-existence side by side within the EU, of 25 different tax systems, with marked differences not only in terms of the tax rates levied, but also of the manner in which profit is calculated, has, over the past ten years, led to one result above all others, in that the share of business tax in the funding of public budgets is on the way down, and a growing proportion of the tax burden is placed on the person who earns ordinary wages for working for someone else, or on the consumer, the latter of which is the worst possible solution in terms of its impact on society and on economic growth."
"It is in this way that big multinationals in particular are given every opportunity to minimise their tax burden."
"Transfer pricing and the shifting of losses are just two of their favourite ways of making sure that profits appear in the accounts at the precise place where the taxman is least inclined to stick his hand in."
"Quite apart from this sort of fiscal dumping, the co-existence of tax systems has prompted a competitive approach to cutting tax rates."
"The average corporation tax rate, for example, fell by a total of 15 percentage points across the old EU from the end of the 1980s onwards."
"One demonstration of the fact that these cuts are not by any means nominal is to be found in a long-term study by the University of Mannheim, according to which the amount of tax effectively paid by the 50 biggest European conglomerates fell from 36% in 1988 to a mere 31% in 2000, which means that billions of euros in public revenue have been given away and wasted."
"Bizarrely enough, the European leader of the tax dumping pack – particularly where company taxes are concerned – is neither an Eastern European state nor Ireland, but the Federal Republic of Germany, supposedly a high-tax country, where a tax reform forced through by the former Schröder Government – which justified its action by reference to fiscal competition across Europe – brought corporation tax yield to an utter standstill."
"Only the harmonisation of taxes across Europe can put a stop to this lunacy, which sees companies making enormous profits while taking less and less of a part in funding the community as a whole and people on average and low incomes – and, via taxes on consumption, even pensioners and the unemployed – ending up having to make good the shortfall."
"I do not, however, believe that it is enough to harmonise the tax base."
"What we need, as a matter of urgency, is a Europe-wide minimum tax rate for company profits of at least 40%, and on a broad tax base."
"Tax dumping is omnipresent, and this is the only way to stop it in its tracks."
". Mr President, one of the principles of good taxation is certainty, both of the bases of assessment and the tax rate."
"Yet the only certainty about the proposals to harmonise the base for company tax is that they create uncertainty."
"If the negotiations follow the pattern of development of the European company statute, for instance, it will be decades before we have a settled position."
"Continuing changes in tax rates and tax rules and the prospect of future changes are bad for business."
"In this report, as in early Commission reports on this subject, it is accepted as a matter of faith that the single market must be pursued without question, with the elusive level playing field as the means to achieve it."
"If we are to harmonise the base for corporate tax, why insist that tax rates should not be harmonised too?"
"It does not make sense."
"Like Mr Konrad, I suspect that uniform rates are on the future agenda, despite the denials."
"There is much to be gained from simplifying tax rules in the individual Member States, particularly the older ones, but this has to be a matter for those Member States."
"If the Member States see a need for cross-border cooperation on tax matters, this too should be their concern and not that of the Commission or the European Court of Justice."
"My recommendation is leave it alone."
"Then the countries that prosper and attract investment will be those with the lowest tax rates and those with the simplest and least bureaucratic methods of assessment and collection."
"If taxation is to be made more business friendly, this will be at the initiative of the individual Member States and driven by market forces."
"I fear that coercion by the European Union is the wrong way to achieve tax reform."
"Mr President, it is quite clear to me that the Commission’s proposal is indisputably an assault upon taxation as an exclusive competence of Member States."
"A common tax base would inexorably lead to common tax rates."
"By the stealth of this proposal, it is clear that Brussels aspires to replace the nation state as the deciding authority on company taxation."
"National control of corporation tax has been a key weapon in the arsenal of many countries in fighting for international investment."
"Estonia, with its growth economy, well illustrates the point, as does the experience of the Republic of Ireland."
"Thus, harmonisation of tax would rob Member States of the right to adjust their tax regimes to suit their own needs and would bestow across Europe yet another stultifying one-size-fits-all suppression of national initiative."
"For economic growth, independence and freedom of action are essential with more, not less, national flexibility."
"For example, corporation tax in my area of Northern Ireland should be radically reduced as a means of stimulating investment, thereby moving us away from over-dependence on the public sector."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the subject of our debate today is a single base for taxation, something that is, in principle, surely to be welcomed, certainly from the point of view of small and medium-sized businesses and particularly in terms of making life in a single internal market easier for them."
"We cannot always draw a strict distinction between the tax base on the one hand and the tax rate on the other, as the tax base has undoubted effects on the classification of taxes and on the internal balances, and that is something that certainly has to be borne in mind when considering the Commission’s next steps."
"We do not want some sort of approximation of the various tax systems introduced through the back door, and I think the Commission has a vested interest in that not happening if it is to make headway with the Member States."
"Finally, I want to say – and I am speaking on behalf of my group when I say this – that we are, without doubt, in favour of fiscal competition."
"You need only imagine what would happen if we were to lock the 25 European finance ministers in a room and let them out only when the white smoke had appeared and they had agreed on tax harmonisation; if we were to do that, we would be turning Europe into a high-tax region, and that is not what we want."
"Before I sit down, there is just one other point I would like to make, and it is in the form of a question, namely: how do we arrive at a single tax base?"
"The answer invariably given to that is that we should draw on the international accounting systems."
"I do not propose to address the question of whether these systems are good or bad or of how they are implemented, but it is, in any case, a process on which European policy-making has scarcely any influence."
"It is all the more extraordinary that politicians should recommend this system as a guide to how to bring in a single tax base."
"If this were to be done – and I warn this House, the Council, and the Commission against it – it would mean that policy-makers would have capitulated and surrendered essential competences in this area, and that cannot be the road down which we go."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome the Commission’s proposal and the proposal in the Bersani report for the introduction of a common base for company tax."
"It leads to more transparency, which benefits our economy and employment."
"It has to be said, though, the Marks [amp] Spencer dossier, to which reference has already been made, will, whether we like it or not, very quickly lead to the debate turning to tax harmonisation."
"I would therefore like to draw Members’ attention to the amendments that I, together with some forty fellow Members, have tabled, not with a view to harmonising taxes, but in order to introduce a minimum company tax rate."
"This amendment allows for fiscal competition between the Member States, but one that is fair, not least to enterprises."
"It ensures that sufficient funds are raised to finance our social model and that sufficient funds are left for the government to finance such things as corporate infrastructure."
"I would, in this connection, like to quote the Hungarian Social Affairs Minister, Kinga Göncz, who takes the view that ever-lower taxes do not fit in the European social model and imperil the social protection funds."
"Despite the short-term benefits that they bring, it is possible that they will soon cause us to run out of the funds needed to guarantee prosperity and to implement the social model, and this is something we want to avoid."
"We already have minimum capital gains tax, and we want minimum corporate tax tomorrow."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by clarifying what we are talking about, because, on the basis of a speech by Commissioner McCreevy, it seems to me that his ideas do not coincide with those of Mr Kovács, within the Commission itself, and of course do not coincide with those of this Parliament, not even with regard to the subject of the discussion."
"What we are talking about now is establishing common rules for defining the tax base."
"We are not talking about harmonising or approximating tax rates, which will remain in the hands of the Member States."
"Having clarified that, why am I in favour of consolidating the tax base and why do I approve and applaud the report by Mr Bersani?"
"Firstly, because I believe in an internal market that works."
"And in order for an internal market to work, companies that operate throughout the market, multinational companies, cannot be subject to twenty-five different rules when it comes to defining what is taxable income and what is deductible spending."
"Secondly, because I am in favour of the European citizen, and the European citizen who wishes to invest his or her savings in a company will be able to judge the assets of companies with more clarity if they are all defined according to the same rules."
"Thirdly, because I do not like tax fraud, and I believe that by consolidating the tax base we will be able to eliminate transfer pricing and the location of company operations in those countries that are most permissive in terms of not taking account of an item of spending or being able to deduct an operation."
"Finally, because if we say here that we advocate fiscal competition amongst the Member States, competition will be cleaner, more transparent and, if I may say so, more brutal, if the different States apply different rates — the rates they want to apply — to homogenous realities."
"Because that will be the only way to calculate it"
"I would like to end with a warning, Mr President: if we do not do it, as we have done in the case of the code of conduct, the Court of Justice will do it, to the shame of this Parliament."
"Mr President, I hope that Parliament, when it votes on Mr Bersani’s excellent report, will give you its strong support for the discussions before you, Commissioner, be it in the Council or within the College of Commissioners itself."
"I am aware of how much progress we have made since this matter has been up for discussion and I know that you are considering enhanced cooperation procedures."
"Let us hope that we will not be forced to go down that route."
"But we think that your approach to this subject and your desire to make real progress are very positive signs."
"My second comment would be that taxation can influence the internal market, and all those here who spend their whole time telling us to make the internal market work better should concern themselves with the fact that excessive tax competition can have a fundamental impact, particularly in terms of cross-border effects, on the operation of the internal market."
"In a way, this report presents us with a paradox: I hope that we can reach agreement on the Bersani report, but it nevertheless conceals some differences of opinion."
"Whether you support tax competition or harmonisation of tax rates, we all need this harmonisation of the tax bases."
"So, let us take this first step together, in the knowledge that - as we saw during the expert hearings - there is still much to be done regarding tax rates and that thinking in terms of a range does not completely rule out any competition."
"It simply enables us to create healthy, viable conditions for the internal market, in line with the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Mr President, in large measure I am pleased to support Mr Bersani’s report."
"He has been very helpful in agreeing compromises with us in the PPE-DE Group."
"I will, however, support a couple of group amendments to delete the last clause of recital I – regarding unfair tax competition – and paragraph 2, also regarding tax competition."
"This proposal has nothing to do with harmonising tax rates."
"I want there to be competition between Member States in terms of rates of tax."
"However, I believe that a common base for corporate tax will be in the interests of competition between Member States and to the benefit of enterprises in the European single market."
"Only with a common tax base will it be possible to compare the relative fiscal advantage of locating or investing in a particular Member State rather than another."
"It will put pressure on Member States to provide an attractive tax environment for our businesses and to be efficient and careful in their public spending and budgeting."
"Some finance ministers might complain that it could limit their ability to provide particular incentives, for example for research and development."
"I would consider these to be consistent with a common tax base so long as they are fully transparent."
"They would be no different from varying general rates of corporate tax and should be permitted within clear and simple rules."
"I would ask the Commissioner to confirm that such clear and transparent tax incentives would still be permitted under any proposals he brings forward."
"With that clear understanding, I am pleased to support and congratulate Mr Bersani on his report."
"Mr President, one consequence of the lack of a single strategy for tax is that the standard of the state’s welfare provision at the heart of Europe can no longer be maintained, and this is becoming more and more the prime cause for jobs being moved elsewhere and lost to us."
"Harmonising the regulations in trade and tax law relating to the calculation of profits must now be given high priority."
"Nowadays, even tax experts can get no overview of what businesses that operate across national borders are actually doing."
"The tax bases must be harmonised; the business tax systems must not only be harmonised but must also become transparent and comparable, and fiscal giveaways and special enterprise zones, which have lost any connection with fiscal competition, must become things of the past."
"The Council can no longer look on from the political grandstand while we cope with the unhealthy distortions of competition that result, to an ever-increasing extent, from its fiscal policies."
"One could just about cope with what Ireland is doing, but Ireland multiplied ten- or twelve-fold would be too much; who, Commissioner, is to foot the bill for this – the workers?"
"Mr President, there is a misunderstanding in this Chamber if it is believed that it is high tax rates that provide social protection."
"That is not the case."
"It is growing investment, new jobs and high and increasing tax income that creates social protection."
"The European country that has some of the highest corporation tax rates of all, Germany, receives less tax income in relation to the national economy than, for example, Slovakia, which has a low rate of corporation tax but a flat tax rate."
"It is not the countries with the low tax rates – which obtain new investment and new jobs – that threaten social protection."
"I believe that, in a Europe in which we have 20 million unemployed, there is reason to be self-critical about the way in which our policy has operated."
"The fact of the matter is that a tax system that is clear, transparent and predictable creates good basic conditions for investment and new jobs."
"We see this in countries that have the highest growth rates in the European economy."
"Having a common tax base and a common method for calculating tax does not mean harmonising taxes."
"On the contrary, it is good that each country be able to choose the level of corporation tax that best suits that country’s basic conditions."
"It is good that we should have competition."
"Transparency is also very much to be desired, so that we see which countries in reality have the high tax rates and which the low ones."
"It is not the case that some of the new Member States are dumping their tax, as the former German Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, said they were."
"On the contrary, it is those countries that have lots of loopholes and variable and unpredictable tax systems that make things difficult for small enterprises and that prevent new investment."
"I therefore support this report and congratulate Mr Bersani on a good piece of work."
"Mr President, as the last of the speakers of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I should obviously like to join in congratulating Mr Bersani on his report, but I should also like to thank a number of shadow rapporteurs and members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for the way in which they have handled this issue."
"I should also like to join Mr García-Margallo y Marfil in saying that I am pleased that it is Commissioner Kovács who will be handling this dossier, rather than his fellow-Commissioner Mr McCreevy, who paid us a recent visit."
"Direct taxes, as we have noticed in this debate, are a subject that stirs up huge emotions and controversy, and it has always been very difficult for this House to reach common positions in that area, not least in the previous part-session."
"Even so, I have a feeling that we will succeed this time and I hope that Commissioner Kovács, will also succeed in reaching agreement with the Council or at any rate with a large number of Member States."
"I am pleased that common sense will prevail over ideological sabre rattling."
"Common sense also obliges me to consider the modest role that the European Union plays in this."
"I want to dissociate myself completely from the comment that was made earlier, among others of the kind, about Brussels taking power away from the Member States."
"I think it is quite simply necessary in this area to guarantee an internal market and a level playing field and to ensure that these are not disrupted, along with the simplicity and certainty that will allow enterprises to operate in the European Union."
"It is not without reason that the call for this common consolidated foundation originates from the entrepreneurial ; it comes, without exception, from companies, including UNICE and the Round Table."
"This has nothing to do with seizing power at European level."
"It is simply about accommodating the wishes of industry."
"I think it is important to consider what the win-win situation can be."
"If everyone is clear what foundations we are working from, then enterprises will have a smaller administrative burden and governments will not need to compete for rates indiscriminately."
"Many of the new countries enjoy low tax rates, while also basing them very broadly. I therefore think that the solution to this process of harmonising the tax base lies in bringing rates much closer together than they are at present, and we need that kind of transparency."
"The discussion as to what will happen subsequently, also about possible minimum rates or forks or whatever, will not be held until later."
"For now, it is crucial to make this first step, and I can tell Commissioner Kovács that he can count on our support."
"Mr President, first of all let me say that it seems there is no more a case for harmonising corporate tax rates or bases than there is for harmonising property taxes, wealth taxes or capital gains tax."
"Firstly, a common consolidated tax base cuts across national sovereignty and subsidiarity."
"Secondly, the Commission maintains that it is not trying to harmonise tax rates, but how is it possible to separate the issue of tax base from the issue of tax rate?"
"Would the harmonisation of the base not lead to a harmonisation of the rate?"
"Some colleagues may have confused harmonisation of the tax base with the harmonisation of company accounts and requirements for transparency between companies and their accounts."
"This is erroneous."
"Accounts can, of course, be harmonised, but harmonised accounts can then be adjusted for tax purposes in Member States and that is an issue for Member States."
"Thirdly, the European Commission’s proposal for corporate tax harmonisation is based on the assumption that harmful tax competition results in a shift in taxation away from taxes on mobile capital and towards taxes on comparatively immobile labour and that this development is harmful for employment and ordinary EU citizens."
"This assumption is open to question in my view."
"Whilst there has been a downward trend in corporate tax rates in some Member States, this has been accompanied by both a widening of corporate tax bases and an improvement in the underlying company profitability."
"In my own country, for example, the lower tax rate has meant a multiplication of the tax take."
"We went up from EUR 385 million in 1996 to a EUR 5 707 million take in 2004."
"Finally, let us not forget that the Lisbon Agenda is about making the EU the most competitive economy in the world by 2015."
"Paving the way for minimum tax rates or corporate tax plans will not prevent companies from looking outside the EU for more competitive rates."
"–It is widely accepted that the current state of the EU economy is in part due to the fundamental problem of a lack of competitiveness in comparison with advanced countries such as the United States."
"Tax competition has a considerable effect on the state of the European economy, and this is currently reflected most noticeably in the low economic growth recorded by some of the older and larger Member States, as against the more rapid growth of the majority of new Member States that are implementing vigorous structural reforms, including tax reforms."
"The lack of political will for implementing structural reforms is often brushed over by accusing new Member States of tax dumping and then claiming a need to address any imbalance by harmonising direct taxes."
"This debate on corporate tax base harmonisation is a consequence of such efforts."
"The argument that tax base harmonisation will have no impact on tax rates and therefore no direct impact on tax competition is not entirely correct."
"The tax base and tax rate are to some extent interrelated, depending on the breadth of the harmonised tax base and the scope of exclusions and deductibles."
"For instance, taking the present German model as the basis, Slovakia would be forced under current circumstances to increase its tax rate in order to maintain current tax inflows."
"On the other hand, I understand the argument that tax base harmonisation should lead to greater transparency among the individual systems in the European Union, providing for simpler comparison between individual countries."
"A reduction in transaction costs for businesses and in the number of court disputes would also constitute considerable advantages."
"Commissioner, I believe that the European Commission should consider carefully all of these arguments in respect of the tax base harmonisation proposal in order to maintain an appropriate degree of tax competition between Member States as a necessary prerequisite for increasing the overall competitiveness of the European Union."
". Mr President, I have listened to the House’s debate with great interest and I am impressed not only by its knowledge but also by its enthusiasm for and interest in the subject."
"As I said earlier, I am pleased that the draft report is so supportive of Commission policy on the common consolidated corporate tax base."
"I should like to comment on the proposed amendments."
"Mr Konrad’s proposals do not pose any problem for the Commission, so we support them."
"However, the Commission does not support the amendments that deal with a possible minimum tax rate and the common consolidated corporate tax base as an instrument for bringing tax rates more closely together."
"The Commission has no intention of limiting fair competition and harmonising the tax base."
"It just wants to increase the transparency of the tax burden."
"Tax rates should remain within the competence of the Member States."
"If we were to favour a minimum rate, I suspect we would lose valuable support from both Member States and business, which will, after all, be the major beneficiaries of a common consolidated corporate tax base."
"As they benefit, so will consumers through the general economic benefits."
"I appreciate the amendment concerning research and development and acknowledge that this is an important subject."
"Nevertheless, it is not an amendment that the Commission would welcome, as the fiscal treatment of research and development is just one of the issues that we will be discussing as part of our work."
"I believe it would be wrong to highlight it in this way."
"I will say no more at this stage."
"I welcome the European Parliament’s interest in the subject and I look forward to learning the outcome of the vote on the report."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A6-0366/2005) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and the Council on the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All (2007) – Towards a Just Society [COM(2005)0225 – C6-0178/2005 – 2005/0107(COD)]."
"Mr President, the European Union can be proud of its achievements in the field of non-discrimination, which place it amongst the most advanced regions in the world in this respect."
"In 2000, we adopted two key directives: one which outlaws racial discrimination, and another that bans direct and indirect discrimination in employment on the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation."
"However, legislation alone is not enough to counter discrimination effectively."
"Many Member States are falling behind with their transposition schedules, and where national legislation complies with the European directives, it is unfamiliar to the general public and not properly implemented."
"The Commission has therefore proposed, inter alia, to declare 2007 the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All."
"It is intended to make the public aware of the benefits of a just society that offers everybody the same opportunities, irrespective of sex, ethnic or racial origin, religion or belief, capacity, age or sexual orientation."
"It will highlight the benefits of diversity as a source of social and economic vitality, which Europe must acknowledge and make use of."
"This diversity enriches the social fabric of Europe and is a vital component of its economic prosperity."
"The discussions and activities during the year will be organised around three main topics."
"Firstly, the right to equality and protection against discrimination."
"A key element will be to make the general public aware of the fact that equal treatment does not necessarily mean identical treatment, but that, sometimes, different treatment is required in different situations."
"Secondly, recognition of the positive contribution that everybody, whatever their personal characteristics, makes to society."
"The aim will be to make the public aware of the rewards and advantages accruing in Europe through diversity."
"Thirdly, better representation in society of disadvantaged groups: a debate will be initiated on ways to rectify the under-representation and under-participation of certain groups in society."
"Fourthly, respect and tolerance and among the various communities that make up European society."
"Civil society and the social partners will be fully involved in implementing the European Year."
"One of the key principles of implementing the Year will be that activities will be decentralised at Member State level."
"To get this message across effectively, the Year must be implemented as closely as possible to the citizens."
"Finally, it must be ensured that, during the Year and in all the Member States, equal importance is attached to all the grounds for discrimination set out under Article 13 of the Treaty, namely discrimination based on sex, ethnic or racial origin, religion or beliefs, disability, age or sexual orientation."
". Mr President, there are no institutional barriers separating one group from another, and there is nothing to prevent anyone from demonstrating their worth and being rewarded for it."
"Specific systems, in the form of examinations and competitions leading to qualifications, have been set up to assess the aptitude of each individual."
"Access to the highest offices is, in principle, open to all, without distinction."
"However, although people are equal in the eyes of the law, they are not always equal in reality."
"At the very least, we do not seem to have achieved equality of opportunity."
"Despite a few examples of spectacular social advancement, cited with particular smugness given that they are such exceptional cases, people do not have equal chances of success, and a society that does not allow all its members to demonstrate their capabilities harbours the seeds of serious frustrations and tensions."
"Neither effectiveness nor justice benefit from this state of affairs."
"If that is indeed the situation, around two centuries after the publication of the Declaration on the Rights of Man, we need to understand why."
"Should we conclude that we have no prospect of success?"
"Are our democratic principles merely a mirage, an ideal that recedes as fast as we can approach it?"
"We refuse to accept this."
"It is true that inequalities tend to mount up."
"The children of poor families are, on average, less likely to reach a high level of education."
"People with a poor level of education are less likely to achieve a high social standing or to have a well-paid career."
"The number of women in high-level positions, of whatever kind, is still very limited, if not infinitesimal."
"Power still remains, in general, the privilege of men."
"Disabled people still do not have the right to a proper place in our societies."
"Homosexuals still suffer discrimination far too often, and some still consider this to be a normal state of affairs. Many men, women and children are left by the wayside because of their skin colour or ethnic origin."
"Do we have the right to put up with this situation?"
"Do we have the right to conclude that nothing can be done to bring reality closer to the democratic ideal?"
"The obstacles may seem huge, an inherent part of society itself."
"But denying their existence will not help us to overcome them."
"We need to face the facts and condemn them."
"For example, discrimination often forces people into unskilled labour and insecure jobs that almost always provide poor pay and therefore a poor standard of living."
"People suffering such discrimination find it very difficult to access decent accommodation and healthcare."
"They have virtually no chance of promotion via continuing vocational training, and they have few leisure opportunities."
"Under such conditions, their children’s education is mortgaged right from the start."
"They are deprived of the material conditions, relationships and emotional environment that they need in order to plan their lives."
"And there is a considerable risk that they will end up in the same situation as their parents."
"In short, one disadvantage engenders another."
"Someone who suffers from one aspect of the effects of social inequality is at serious risk of suffering from other aspects."
"Although we can intuitively recognise this phenomenon of the accumulation of disadvantages, it has not yet been extensively studied."
"I would therefore like to call on the Council and the Commission to make a firm commitment to combat all forms of discrimination in all countries of the Union, particularly as part of the Year of Equal Opportunities for All."
"We want you to make a firm commitment, Commissioner."
"We listened to what you had to say just now."
"We were happy with it, but you will understand that we will be keeping a close eye on how it is put into practice, and I will conclude by reminding you that, on 28 August 1963, in Washington, in his famous speech ‘I have a dream’, Martin Luther King evocatively expressed the hope, the dream of a world of freedom and justice for all."
"‘I have a dream’, he said, ‘that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character’."
"Let us have a common dream that, by the end of the decade, we will finally have a Union without discrimination, a Union that gives every child a chance."
"Let us have a common dream, Commissioner."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Roure for her work on this report."
"The European Union has made a commitment to promoting basic rights and equal opportunities for all."
"We have some of the most comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation in the world."
"But ask yourself this: are our fellow citizens aware of the European anti-discrimination directives?"
"Unfortunately, I think the answer is no."
"That is why the initiative of launching the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All is a very constructive one."
"A media event on this scale is an effective method of increasing awareness and providing information."
"Equality of opportunity is a policy involving specific measures that aim to help the disadvantaged by establishing fair access to rights, goods and services."
"For equality to become a reality, we need to combat all types of discrimination."
"Every day, men and women suffer discrimination when they try to access jobs and services, particularly due to their sex, their origin or their religion."
"That is unacceptable, and we cannot continue to tolerate such practices."
"The activities that the EU will support in 2007 and the awareness and demonstration campaigns are a step in the right direction."
"It is also vital to have a real political will for this, and all the Member States must join forces, without exception."
"Full implementation of our anti-discrimination legislation therefore remains a top priority."
"It is distressing to see that certain Member States have been condemned for not having correctly transposed the European directives in this field."
"Tomorrow, Parliament must send a strong message to our fellow citizens by adopting this report by a large majority."
"The fight against discrimination is not just fought by the left or by the right."
"It is fought by men and women of conviction with a common objective: fighting for respect for human rights and, more specifically, against discrimination of all kinds."
"The key message of the European Parliament in response to the proposal of the Commission is to fight against all forms of discrimination, and this is why I am particularly pleased to congratulate Mrs Martine Roure on this report."
"I would like to emphasise that the equality of opportunities – as the first human right formulated by the European Union – is a horizontal area stretching across all sectors."
"Therefore the enforcement of equal opportunities cannot be of utmost priority for Parliament only, but also for the EU, and for all government bodies of the Member States."
"I particularly welcome that President Borrell has set up the high-level Committee on Equal Opportunities, and I am proud to work as one of its members."
"I would like to call attention to a recently published important work of the Committee, which mentions the benefits arising from applying the principles of diversity when a workplace interviews and employs its workforce."
"Workplaces that implement such a policy, companies that take into account cultural diversity are more competitive in the long term, and in some cases also experience increased efficiency in the short or medium term."
"Therefore equal opportunities are not an obstacle to the increase of economic competitiveness, but act as a strengthening factor."
"I would also like to stress the individual responsibility of Member States in preparing for the Year of Equal Opportunities, and would like to propose a number of initiatives myself."
"I have organised the first public Parliamentary hearing in Hungary, which will take place next week, when participating citizens will talk about their personal experiences to illustrate the discrimination they have suffered."
"A blind girl who has not been admitted to university because of her blindness, and a young Roma man will talk about their lives."
"I would like to make this customary in Hungary, and to introduce in my country the personal hearings that we experience here."
". Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur for all the good work she has done: it was not an easy task."
"The Year of Equal Opportunities for All is very welcome because fundamental rights are the close to the hearts of the European citizens and they must be made a reality for all citizens."
"Against this backdrop there are two issues I would like to raise."
"First, there is the budget."
"I think that everybody in this room will agree that it is embarrassingly insufficient – EUR 15 million for fundamental rights!"
"If I compare that to the money we spend on a lot of other things that are less valuable than fundamental rights, I have to say it gives me stomach pains."
"The second issue is decentralised implementation."
"That is very good, but I am rather worried about the possibility of cherry-picking by the Member States."
"I am not entirely reassured by all the warm words we have heard in recent years about fundamental rights, because the reality is different and the Commissioner himself mentioned that some Member States are still lagging behind in the implementation of anti-discrimination legislation."
"There is still a hierarchy of discrimination and I think that with this programme for the Year of Equal Opportunities for All we should not be encouraging this."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner to commit the Commission here and now, publicly and on the record, to ensuring that Member States will use the funds available for this Year to target all forms of discrimination equally."
"This is not to say anything about the way the money is distributed, but we want certain – let us say – more ‘awkward’ groups that are currently suffering discrimination – homosexuals, certain reglious groups or the Roma, for example – to have equal access to this programme with all the other groups that are suffering discrimination."
"I am looking forward to a positive answer."
". Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for her work, and I appreciate the need for maximum preparation time if the Year of Equal Opportunities is going to have any meaningful impact."
"That constricted timing has meant that there are one or two areas, as my colleague has just indicated, where we might have liked to tighten things up a little more but have not been able to."
"We all hope that the Year will provide an incentive to those Member States that are being particularly tardy on implementing the Article 13 Directives to make progress."
"Those directives reflect the more positive dimension of the European Union and people need to be aware of their rights."
"As we have seen on issues such as the Working Time Directive, people all too often do not realise that they have rights, let alone that they can enforce them."
"I agree with Mrs Roure that equal opportunities are an important factor in social inclusion and that we need to combat bigotry and prejudice at all levels, whether that is on the street or in government, as it prevents so many people from reaching their potential and prevents society benefiting from their talents."
"I also echo the comments made about the money being totally inadequate."
"When you think about the amount that we, as political parties, spend on our election campaigns to try and persuade people of something different, it is going to take more than the money in the current budget to persuade people that others in their society have rights which should be recognised as well."
". Mr President, I too would like to commend the rapporteur for her work in this very important area and to lend my voice to support the call for designation of 2007 as the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All."
"We must commit ourselves not just to the concept of equality of opportunity, but equally and crucially to the attainment of equality of outcome."
"All people should be entitled to their full social, economic and cultural equality."
"This, of course, encompasses the equality of all people, irrespective of gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, age, marital or family status, sexual orientation, disability, socio-economic status or indeed political or religious affiliations."
"If we are serious about the attainment of equality, we must, on an ongoing basis, not only guarantee equality of opportunity across those categories, but we must be in a position to measure accurately and adequately outcomes as against each of those categories."
"We all know that societal inequality is not a natural phenomenon; it is the direct result of power inequalities, and so to address inequality itself, we have to address issues of power in our society, we have to challenge the way things are."
"I think 2007 as the Year of Equal Opportunities for All can become a platform for just that."
"I also think that the very fact that this initiative is being suggested is an explicit recognition that we have failed so far in our journey towards equality."
"In my own country of Ireland, we are still coming to terms with the legacy of British rule and the continuing partition of our country, along with decades of discrimination in the electoral process, in housing, employment and policing."
"Celtic Tiger Ireland should be a success story for all the Irish people, and yet we remain one of the most unequal societies not just in the EU but in fact globally."
"The Roure report’s focus on both migrants and women is commendable and particularly relevant again to my home country."
"The European Year must be about much more than raising awareness simply about discrimination."
"Equality legislation alone will not succeed in tackling the deep-rooted inequalities that exist without the political will of politicians, of policymakers and others to grasp the nettle and comprehensively tackle discrimination."
"To that end, may I finish by echoing Mrs Roure’s call for both the Commission and the Council to put their money where their mouth is as regards tackling inequality across the Union."
"2007 is a very important year for the issues to be resolved in the area of equal opportunities and the implementation of equal opportunities throughout the European Union."
"Equality of opportunity forms the basis of the common European system of values, and its implementation will promote the enforcement of basic human rights."
"This report, which is being prepared with a codecision procedure, addresses all areas of implementation – from the creation of the legislation framework to the definition of financial means – including possibilities of participation of Member States and civil organisations."
"My honourable colleague Martine Roure has done a considerable amount of work."
"The most important thing is to apply the regulations already approved and accepted, and to make sure that those affected are aware of the laws enacted in their interest."
"Therefore we need action, not words."
"It is not sufficient to implement the principle of equal opportunities at Community level – we must make sure that everybody is aware of the fact that all citizens, regardless of their sex, race or ethnic origin, religion or views, disability, age and sexual orientation, are entitled to equal opportunities and equal treatment."
"Continuous information, education, cooperation with civil organisations and European citizens are important."
"We need campaigns that win over public opinion, and lively social dialogue."
"A social Europe is inconceivable without the protection of vulnerable social strata and groups that are most exposed to discrimination."
"Discrimination or exclusion has a hundred faces: it can be based on race, ethnic origin, religion, age group, sex, physical and mental disabilities."
"Everybody plays a role in the implementation of equal opportunities, from government bodies to national authorities, from the civil society to individual European citizens."
"Solidarity is the most appropriate and the most expedient approach to the fight for equal opportunities."
"We are all responsible to ensure that every person has equal opportunities to achieve their potential in any area of life."
"In my amendments I also emphasised that we must make every effort to implement equality, not only at Community and individual levels, but also at regional, national and local levels."
"I propose that the report be accepted."
"Mr President, like other speakers, I agree with the Commissioner that the EU must have one of the most advanced legislative frameworks to combat discrimination."
"Therefore, I appreciate that Parliament’s amendments to the Commission proposal enforce the demand that the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All should speed up the transposition process of the two anti-discrimination directives, for which I thank the rapporteur, Mrs Roure."
"I have to say, with regret, that my country, Latvia, is among those states that are delaying transposition."
"New Member States have to be subject to infringement proceedings for violations of Community law in the same way as the old Member States."
"In that context, NGOs have a vital role to play in raising awareness."
"The Commission should ensure that especially NGOs representing the groups that suffer discrimination are involved at all stages of the work in connection with the European Year."
"I hope that the Commissioner will also agree with this."
". Mr President, first of all I would like to express my thanks to the honourable Members for the support voiced in this debate."
"I would like to underline that the Commission shares your commitment to fighting forms of discrimination in Member States."
"The Commission is prepared to urge all Member States to allocate the financial resources accordingly."
"Generally speaking, the Commission accepts all the amendments proposed by Parliament."
"I will not go through them individually, but will concentrate on the key issues."
"We support the amendments aimed at reinforcing the involvement of civil society and the implementation of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All."
"This will be a key factor in its success."
"We can accept the increased references to gender mainstreaming."
"We are fully in agreement with the fact that, during the Year, Member States should attach equal importance to all the grounds for discrimination set out under Article 13 of the Treaty, namely discrimination based on sex, ethnic or racial origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation."
"It is acceptable to set up a simplified system for administrative management of the funds at national level, as proposed."
"We agree to the increase in the budget from EUR 13.6 million to EUR 15 million."
"To sum up, the Commission can accept all the amendments proposed."
"I conclude by warmly thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Roure, whose commitment to non-discrimination issues was instrumental in bringing the negotiations with the Member States to a successful conclusion."
"These went very quickly and were very rewarding."
"The text, which is submitted for your final approval, reinforces the Commission’s initial position and gives us the means to take action in favour of diversity throughout the European Union."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of the Committee on International Trade’s draftsman, Mr Sjöstedt, who is on Hong Kong with virtually all the other members of the committee apart from me."
"I am the only one left here."
"The Commission has requested urgency for an increase in commitment appropriations to Georgia for 2006-2007, to the sum of EUR 10.5 million."
"The Commission has already come to us asking for urgency at a very late date, on the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"Frankly, if we were dealing only with the issue of the Commission, we would say ‘no’ to urgency, but in this case the people who would lose out are the people of Georgia."
"It has taken the Commission 10 months to carry out an impact assessment, without even warning Parliament that the issue might be on the agenda."
"However, we welcome the ‘velvet revolution’."
"We recognise that the Georgians need increased help."
"On that basis we will support urgency, but warn the Commission that, if it tries to do this again, we may have reached the limit of our tolerance."
"If we approve this, the consequence will be that it will be debated on Wednesday evening, with an opportunity to table amendments tomorrow – which is Wednesday – until 10 in the morning, and the vote on the report itself would be on Thursday."
"We have now heard one intervention in favour of that, and now is the opportunity for someone to speak against it."
"Mr President, this is not actually an intervention in favour, but just an expression of the opinion of my committee, which is in favour."
"I would just ask, further to what Mr Ford said, that the Commission and the Council be urged, when moving urgency debates, not only to explain why they are matters of urgency, but also why the motion for an urgency debate is being tabled only now."
"The situation really does need to be avoided in which a considerable period of time goes by before a motion for an urgency debate is tabled, without, perhaps, it being necessary."
"Perhaps you or the Bureau might ask the Commission and the Council to justify this practice."
"(1)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"– the report (A6-0396/2005) by Mr Pitella and Mr Dombrovskis on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2006 as modified by the Council (all sections) (14864/2005 – C6 0415/2005 – 2005/2001(BUD)) and Letters of amendment Nos 1/2005 (14862/2005 – C6-0413/2005), 2/2005 (14863/2005 – C6 0414/2005), 3/2005 (00000/2005 – C6 0000/2005) to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2006,"
"– the report (A6-0395/2005) by Mr Böge on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument in favour of the European Union's external actions according to point 24 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 COM(2005)0278 – C6-0211/2005 – 2005/2137(ACI)) and"
"– the report (A6-0397/2005) by Mr Garriga Polledo on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on draft amending budget No 8/2005 of the European Union for the financial year 2005 (14861/2005 – C6-0412/2005 – 2005/2179(BUD))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, we have concluded the budgetary procedure with a success."
"It is a success for everyone but, if I may say so, it is above all a success for Parliament, which has been able to fight for its political priorities."
"I should like to thank all the political groups, all my fellow Members, the committee Chairman and secretariat, and all those whose competence and generosity have helped to bring the procedure to a successful conclusion."
"The outcome speaks for itself."
"We had asked for a decent level of payments in line with strict control over spending but also with the need to have sufficient funds available to carry out the Union’s essential policies."
"We have achieved a budget of EUR 112 billion and a joint declaration that an amending budget will be put forward, particularly for the Structural Funds, if spending picks up in the new Member States, as we think it will."
"We had asked for the budget lines for growth, competitiveness, education, research, small and medium-sized enterprises, and youth, environmental and cultural policies to be prioritised, and we have achieved renegotiated sums for a good half-dozen codecided programmes and the allocation of EUR 100 million in additional resources."
"I feel particularly pleased that we have achieved our aim of sending out a strong political message to the youth of Europe through the reinforcement of the Socrates, YOUTH and Leonardo programmes."
"We had asked the Council to reflect on the inadequacy of the Berlin spending levels for external actions, and we provided indisputable evidence in that regard."
"We reminded it of the solemn commitments made by the Heads of State or Government on issues such as Iraq, the tsunami, sugar and Afghanistan, to which Parliament intends to make its own contribution, without, however, sacrificing geographical programmes, humanitarian actions, essential initiatives on human rights and democracy, and inclusive development actions."
"What we have achieved is that for the first time we have broken through the fateful EUR 200 million ceiling for flexibility in external actions."
"Let me be quite clear: having an extra EUR 275 million available for external actions and a protocol that better acknowledges Parliament’s competence in foreign and security policy is not a trophy for us to show off but a necessary response, a decision warranted by everything that we, together, are expected to do in the world."
"We are also pleased on other, more general grounds."
"In recent years the European Union has gained historic prominence; it has made and maintained peace on its soil; it has brought down borders without resorting to the use of force; it has proposed its values without imposing them; and it has promoted growth and cohesion in an often troubled and unstable world."
"Today we are experiencing a profound crisis in the European project, but it is not an irreversible crisis."
"As Henri de Saint-Simon wrote, at such times what is needed is a force able to unite desires, to focus movements and to make interests mutual and commitments firm."
"Our political project was rocked by blustery winds back in the 1980s as well; despite the impending storm, however, strong political leadership enabled us to weather the elements and emerge even stronger than before."
"None of us is pretending to be a new François Mitterrand or a new Helmut Kohl but, if we cast aside selfish attitudes and if we adjust national budgetary priorities to the priorities of our European duties, we shall, all together, be able to stop the European project from drifting and crumbling."
"The right response to a downturn is a change of course and, after our setbacks, we have together scored a positive point this week – we have put the ball in the net – with the annual budget."
"As Minister Lewis and Commissioner Grybauskaitė know, we could have used the annual budget for leverage on the financial perspective, but we did not want to do so because we have a sense of responsibility and realise that the European Union does not need conflict among the institutions."
"The Council should understand, however, that it cannot offer us a tiny little Europe; nor can it think that the European Parliament will settle for miserly compromises that mark the end of the European dream."
"The European Parliament has made an important contribution to the debate on the budget for 2007-2013 in the excellent Böge report, which has so far been unfairly ignored."
"The proposal from the UK Presidency, on the other hand, I am sorry to say, is unacceptable because it is the exact opposite of the worthy project that Mr Blair himself set out before Parliament, in that it releases the Member States from their duties towards Europe and gives out little sweeteners here and there, without setting a process of budgetary reform in motion or providing the Union with greater financial leeway."
"It is not just a case of Robin Hood in reverse, as somebody suggested: there is also the danger, which I should like to avert, that we shall be responsible for burying any hope of a European revival."
"With the annual budget, however, we are making a positive response, and for that I am also grateful to Minister Lewis and Commissioner Grybauskaitė."
"We remain convinced that, at a time of uncertainties and concerns, the empowerment of Europe’s financial conscience is the only basis for fruitful and confident European integration."
"Perhaps I might also point out that it is made very clear in the relevant paragraph of the Inter-Institutional Agreement that the use of the flexibility instrument this year would have yielded up to us easily more than EUR 400 million, if we had adhered strictly to the wording of the Agreement."
"That being so, agreement to EUR 275 million for the use of flexibility also amounts to mutual , and I ask the House to vote to adopt this report on the use of the flexibility instrument in relation to the 2006 Budget in its present form."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to point out that this House did, in the course of negotiations on the Financial Perspective, make a proposal as to how we might in future take a more flexible approach, albeit one based strictly on budgetary discipline, and also observe that it is not only the issue of a globalisation fund that is on the agenda, but that we also have to respond much more rapidly and consistently in many important categories of European Budget policy."
"This House made it perfectly clear, on 8 June, that its negotiating position on this is in fact not itself subject to negotiation."
"Let me add in conclusion that, for the British Prime Minister Mr Blair, as President-in-Office of the Council, to say, on the subject of the negotiations on the Financial Perspective, that either there is a deal in December or there will be no more agreement under the Austrian or Finnish presidencies, is for him to threaten a blockade."
"I note with satisfaction that, in interviews, he adduces Parliament as what one might call an argument, along the lines of: if the Council will not come to an agreement, then the decision on the budget will have to pass to Parliament."
"I can tell him that Parliament is ready for it."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this year we are once again debating the Community budget at second reading."
"It is my duty to present amending budget No 8."
"As in other years, as we Members of this Parliament well know, we are facing the same budgetary problems relating to execution and political representativeness."
"With regard to the 2005 budget alone, 10% of payment appropriations have not been able to be used, appropriations that you, ladies and gentlemen, voted for in December of last year. Furthermore, we are going to have to return EUR 3 800 million to the Member States, since it has not been possible to commit that money in the decisions that we MEPs had voted for."
"It is difficult to establish the extent to which the European Commission, the Member States or this Parliament are responsible for this situation, which is repeated year after year."
"We in this Parliament vote every year for budgetary appropriations in accordance with our own political debate and the interests that we believe our electors bring to this Chamber, and that is why we are here."
"We vote according to what we believe are the Union’s interests, in terms of foreign policy, internal policy and the Structural Funds."
"We must acknowledge that the European Commission makes more effort every year to better implement policies, the budgetary mandates that we are given as European parliamentarians."
"And we are aware that the Member States make an effort year after year both in order to fund the budget and in order to implement Community policies."
"But it can be deduced from the execution figure every year that something is still failing in the process of budgetary allocation of the appropriations that we vote for and in their final application, both in the Member States and in Community programmes."
"Amending budget No 8, which I am presenting for your approval, includes, amongst other things, returning EUR 3 800 million to the Member States."
"We know that this is good news for the Finance Ministers of the Member States, since this is a sum that they do not have to incorporate into the Community budget in order to fund the 2005 financial year."
"Nevertheless, from a European point of view, it is not good news, because the saving results from a very significant under-execution in payment appropriations corresponding to the Structural Funds."
"During the 2005 budgetary procedure, we agreed with the Council a significant reduction in the Structural Funds, below our first reading of the budget, and also below the preliminary draft budget presented by the Commission."
"We also agreed a joint statement with the other two institutions, in which the Council committed itself to presenting an amending budget which would include the payment appropriations necessary to pay Structural Funds, in the event that the execution was as expected."
"During October, the European Commission presented us with a first draft of amending budget No 8, which talked about certain real budgetary needs; it also talked about EUR 600 million in Structural Funds, which should have been included in the Community budget."
"In the end, none of that happened."
"During November, the Commission altered its figures on the basis of the news about budgetary execution reaching it from the Member States and, in the end, what were funding requirements have been turned into surpluses."
"Even with this return of EUR 3 800 million, there could be a surplus of payment appropriations in the Structural Funds at the end of the year."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we can only interpret this as a bad thing."
"It is bad news, both for the 2006 budget of Mr Pittella, and for the negotiation of the financial perspective."
"The Union’s budget can never be drawn up solely according to the principle of saving, but rather according to the principle of effectiveness and European added value."
"Mr President, where is the European added value in returning payment appropriations to the Finance Ministers year after year?"
"This is not a good way to produce a Community budget or to build a truly effective Europe."
"The political message we are sending to the European citizens every year is very disappointing."
"Commissioner, representatives of the Council, when this Parliament votes for budgetary appropriations, it does so with the hope and desire that they are correctly executed by everybody."
"I believe that this is the lesson that we must learn this year, and let us hope that the execution is better during 2006."
". Mr President, it is an honour and a privilege to be back in this Chamber to represent the Presidency of the Council in this important debate on the budget of the European Communities for 2006."
"The European Parliament’s second reading of the annual budget, culminating in the vote on Thursday, is a key part of the European Union calendar and is probably more important this year than ever before."
"The agreement between the Council and the parliamentary delegation on the main elements of the 2006 budget was reached in the end in the best spirit of cooperation and compromise."
"By putting that agreement into effect in the adopted budget, the European Parliament has the opportunity to send a clear signal to the people of Europe that, despite the challenges we face over the Constitution and future financing, the European Union is still operating effectively and in their best interest."
"I do not need to remind honourable Members of the historical importance of this budgetary procedure."
"They will be acutely aware that the last procedure under the current financial perspective has a special role in bridging past priorities and future objectives to provide a measure of continuity and the basis for coherence between two financial perspectives."
"I believe the agreement we reached in Brussels two weeks ago broadly satisfies those objectives."
"But it does something more than that."
"The difficulty of reconciling our policy priorities with the core principles of budget discipline and sound financial management highlights the fact that the current budget structures are stretched to breaking point."
"The next financial perspective must offer the prospect of real reform and renewal in the future if the EC budget is to remain relevant and genuinely meet the needs and expectations of European citizens in the 21st century."
"It will not be easy, but if the two arms of the budgetary authority – the Parliament and the Council, which I represent today – can build on the spirit of cooperation we found in the end to deliver a 2006 budget, we have a chance to create a shared vision in the next few days for a better future in 2007-2013 and beyond."
"Returning to 2006, honourable Members will be aware that the budget agreement between the Council and the parliamentary delegation focused primarily on three key elements."
"Each required some compromise from both sides, in some cases, frankly, going into uncharted budget waters, which perhaps explains why it was necessary to take a little longer over negotiations than has been the case traditionally."
"I stress that in each case, the parliamentary delegation drove a hard bargain and, as a consequence, several members of the Council felt unable to support our final compromise."
"But I believe that we reached a fair and balanced outcome in the end, one which I was able to steer through Council by a qualified majority."
"Firstly, we agreed to amend upward the financial envelopes for six codecided programmes in heading 3: Internal Policies."
"The Council did not see the need to propose these increases in its draft budget; however, the parliamentary delegation argued strongly that the six programmes concerned would be severely constrained without additional resources."
"In the spirit of compromise and consistent with the Interinstitutional Agreement, I was able to persuade the Council to accept these changes."
"This is the first time that has been agreed in the current financial perspective."
"It is perhaps fitting that it happened in the final year of that perspective, and I am sure that both arms of the budgetary authority would want to consider it as an exceptional event."
"Secondly, we agreed to mobilise the flexibility instrument for programmes in heading 4: External Actions, for a total of EUR 275 million."
"The Council took the initial view that it ought to be possible, with some reprioritisation, to finance all external actions within the budget ceiling."
"However, I stress that the Council remains firmly committed to meet the urgent needs of external partners consistent with promises made and commitments undertaken."
"Member States recognise the tight budgetary constraints in heading 4, demonstrated no more clearly than the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and the Council was ultimately persuaded of the need to mobilise the flexibility instrument to ease these constraints."
"I believe the outcome, which exceeds the Commission’s proposals by more than EUR 110 million, represents a fair compromise, ensuring resources for key urgent priorities, such as Iraq, tsunami reconstruction, traditional assistance for sugar protocol countries, and CFSP."
"It also recognises that further demands on the external actions budget are likely during 2006."
"However, I stress that this is the first time it has been necessary to exceed EUR 200 million in a single year."
"The Council considers this an exceptional event and some Member States remain convinced that it is an unnecessary step."
"I hope that honourable Members will appreciate the significance of this outcome and share with me the hope that more effective use of the principle of reprioritisation and reallocation will prevail in similar circumstances in future years."
"Finally, as required by the Treaty, the Council and the parliamentary delegation agreed to set the level of overall payments for 2006 at EUR 111 969 million."
"This represents the Commission’s original proposal which, after taking account of Amending Letters 1, 2 and 3, is more than half a billion euros above the Council’s original position."
"I recognise that this figure is somewhat lower than some Members of Parliament would have liked."
"However, it is firmly based on the Commission’s estimates of what it is able effectively to spend."
"I am sure honourable Members will share my concern not to create an unnecessary budget surplus and so would recognise the case for prudence. Of course the budgetary authority stands ready to consider an amending budget to amend the level of payments, should that prove necessary during 2006."
"As I said earlier, I believe that this compromise agreement represents a fair and balanced outcome for all three institutions – Council, Parliament and Commission."
"There are no doubt elements of it that each of us might like to improve, but that is the essence of compromise."
"No one is entirely satisfied, each of us has made a sacrifice and modified our positions."
"Both the Council and Parliament had tough mandates this year and it was no easy matter to find common ground."
"Consequently, I commend this solution to you and look forward to your vote."
"I should now like to touch very briefly on other aspects of the Council’s second reading, which honourable Members might like to take into account."
"In heading 1: Agriculture, the Council reinstated the EUR 150 million reduction from the first reading and accepted instead the Commission’s Amending Letter 2, which reduces expenditure on subheading 1a by EUR 361 million compared to the preliminary draft budget."
"In heading 2: Structural Operations, the Council reinstated its first reading position for a reduction of EUR 150 million for payments compared to the PDB."
"This reflects the Council’s view of the expected implementation rate and is based on past evidence of implementation shortfalls, including amending budget 8 for 2005."
"In heading 3: Internal Policies, the Council largely reinstated its first reading position but made some modest changes to a few key budget lines, including an increase in the payments for research lines, reflecting the increased emphasis on Lisbon from Hampton Court and entrusting the Commission to improve the implementation record in this area."
"This allows a 16% increase to research payments, compared to 2005."
"In heading 4: External Actions, the Council reinstated its first reading and also accepted the Commission’s Amending Letter 1 concerning traditional assistance for sugar protocol countries, allocating resources from its first reading margin."
"In heading 5: Administrative Expenditure, the Council partly accepted Parliament’s first reading amendment to the Commission budget in light of new evidence about vacancy rates."
"It also accepted the proposal to reduce EUR 20 million from Parliament’s budget."
"Otherwise it reinstated its first reading position, recalling the need for savings in operating costs from interinstitutional cooperation and economies of scale."
"Finally, in heading 7: Pre-accession Strategy, the Council reinstated its first reading position."
"Of course, Parliament will need to make changes to the Council’s second reading position to implement our agreement on payments, codecided amounts and mobilisation of the flexibility instrument."
"I very much hope that Parliament will take account of the Council’s position, especially concerning commitments in headings 3 and 5, where there are clear opportunities to make savings and ensure there is a margin for the unexpected during 2006."
"In conclusion, the agreement we reached on 30 November provides adequate funding for the European Union’s various priorities."
"It broadly respects the important principles of budgetary discipline and sound financial management, of which the Council and Parliament are joint guardians."
"It deserves the confidence of the citizens of the European Union and will contribute to rebuilding public confidence in the Union and its institutions."
"I hope honourable Members will forgive me if I do not remain in the Chamber for the duration of this morning’s debate, as I need to return urgently to London."
"However, I will be staying to hear as many speeches as possible, which I am sure will be of the usual thoughtful and constructive nature."
"I intend to return to Strasbourg on Thursday for the vote and the adoption of the 2006 EC budget."
"Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I wish to say that it has been a privilege and a pleasure to work through this process – although not on every occasion – and we can be rightly proud of the agreement that we are seeking to conclude during the course of this week."
". Having successfully reached this culmination point of the budget cycle, we can conclude that a constructive approach, realism and political responsibility have prevailed in the budget negotiations."
"It is due to prudent and inevitable compromise that we are near our goal today – an EU Budget for 2006 that may play a decisive role not only concerning the financial possibilities of the coming year, but also in shaping the further financial fate of Europe."
"The approval of the budget may, and I hope will, become a vitally important message to the European Union that its institutions are still operational and able to function constructively, to make important decisions together and to achieve positive results."
"I consider the results of the 2006 EU Budget negotiations to be one of those optimal successes."
"Mr President, regarding the positive outcome of the negotiations for 2006: overall, a successful result has been achieved and one with which Parliament can be satisfied and proud."
"I would like to thank Mr Pittella, Mr Lewandowski – the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and all the rapporteurs involved in the process."
"From the very beginning, the Commission strongly supported Parliament’s interpretation of the flexibility instrument which the Council, after hard negotiations, has now accepted."
"Despite the Council’s refusal to go over EUR 200 million, now, with the final outcome, EUR 275 million has been made available under the flexibility instrument, creating essential room for manoeuvre in heading 4."
"Turning to the co-decision programmes, you have achieved an important EUR 100 million over 6 programmes."
"From the earliest stages, this was a strategy supported by the Commission in the process of negotiation, and now that agreement has been reached by both arms of the budgetary authority, the Commission will do its utmost to ensure implementation of the new amounts."
"I would like also to thank Parliament, and in particular, Mr Pittella, for taking into account so many aspects of the Commission’s letter of executability of the amendments from the first reading."
"I would now like to turn to the level of payment appropriations."
"It is important that the payment appropriations in the budget can cover the incoming bills, and ensure that beneficiaries receive the payments they are expecting."
"The level of payment appropriations agreed for 2006 is accompanied by the agreed declaration, so that, if necessary and on the basis of the most up-to-date information, this will allow for any additional appropriations needed to be made available as soon as possible."
"In order to facilitate the deal between the two arms of the budgetary authority, the Commission has proposed Amending Letter 3, which is technically well founded, but the Commission will keep a close watch on the implementation of the 2006 budget and will not hesitate to use the budgetary tools at our disposal, if certain areas need to be reinforced."
"In the first instance, appropriations can be transferred, and, notably, we can also call on the provisions of the declaration agreed at the trilogue, should an amending budget be required."
"I would finally point out that the total payment appropriations figure on the table today represents an increase of almost 6% compared to the 2005 budget."
"The budget agreed is optimal and fair, and it is necessary for Europe."
"I wish Parliament a constructive debate and successful vote on Thursday."
". I am pleased that an agreement concerning the EU Budget for 2006 has been reached."
"Significant concessions were made by both the European Parliament and the Council, and thus, today we can expect that on 15 December the European Union budget for 2006 will be approved."
"The European Parliament Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, of which I am a member, should be satisfied with the results of the agreement, as we have succeeded in achieving our main goals."
"In 2006, allocations will be increased for codecision programmes, such as scientific research, SOCRATES, LIFE, small and medium-sized enterprises, youth programmes and European cultural organisations."
"Growth, competitiveness and support for SMEs have always been and will continue to be the priority areas of the European People’s Party."
"It is also very important that we have come to an agreement to use the flexibility instrument for external policies and new needs, allocating EUR 275 million to Iraq, reconstruction efforts in tsunami-affected countries and consequences of sugar reform in the ACP countries, of which EUR 40 million will go to the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"The level of appropriations for 2006 was a very important subject of negotiation for the European Parliament, and the agreement reached on EUR 111.969 billion, or 1.01% of GNI, is within the limits of the Financial Perspective and therefore should be seen as a positive outcome of the negotiations."
"Although at the first reading Parliament voted for significantly higher appropriations, the compromise reached with the Council 2006 provides a good foundation for agreement on the new Financial Perspective, as well as for negotiations on the EU Budget for 2007."
"I congratulate my colleague and main rapporteur Giovanni Pittella, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets Mr Lewandowski, the Commissioner and the Council for having reached this solid agreement."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like today to thank all those who participated in our work, beginning with our general rapporteurs, Mr Pittella and Mr Dombrovskis, before moving on to Mr Böge and Mr Garriga and to the entire Committee on Budgets led by Mr Lewandowski. I also do not wish to leave out our administrators and assistants."
"In actual fact, we have ended up today with a smaller budget than we were hoping for, but one that has been drawn up quite legally and that adheres to the current financial perspective, namely 1.09% of commitment appropriations."
"That is important and exceeds the results obtained last year."
"Furthermore, we can use the flexibility instrument to adhere to the promises made by the Council."
"We will remember, though, the problems we had in securing this option when we embark upon the forthcoming negotiations."
"What is more, all the margins have been adhered to."
"In short, we have attained a modest and reasonable budget, which will do no damage to the revenue provided by the Member States."
"The budget adheres to the priorities we set and, thanks to several policies adopted under codecision, it mainly enables us to anticipate the Lisbon Strategy and to hold on to the bulk of external aid, the aid that we give to the poorest countries and that we value highly."
"I should like, however, to return to a number of points close to our hearts, which relate to the implementation of the budget."
"Today, the budget that we are presenting has a political dimension to it."
"It is up to the Commission, however, to make sure that this political dimension is maintained when the budget is implemented."
"Clearly, we must avoid having any surpluses next year."
"In fact, if the budget headings continue not to be implemented, then the European Parliament’s political commitment, as budgetary authority, is likely to dwindle."
"Commissioner, we no longer want to see returns of EUR 2 billion on whichever Fund it may be."
"Everything must be implemented; we have given you the resources for this."
"If you encounter difficulties, let us know in due time."
"Finally, I should like to say to the Council that, admittedly, we now have a proper budget for 2006, agreed upon in the wake of a whole host of problems."
"We are in this situation because the promises made by the Council are not often backed up with funds and because you had made a commitment, more than two years ago, to implement an information system on security policy."
"We are one of the two branches of budgetary authority, and we consider it disgraceful that the European institutions, and the Council in particular, seem to be unaware of this fact."
"The Committee on Budgets approved of the Council’s wisdom in seeking to make strong political decisions for this 2006 budget."
"We will harbour the same concerns where the forthcoming financial perspective is concerned."
"Today, we have the only legal proposal: the vote on 8 June, widely adopted by our Parliament."
"Since then, we have been awaiting a genuine proposal from the Council."
"When this reaches us, we will be ready – ready to work and to negotiate, in view of our shared years of experience."
"The Committee on Budgets will work for a budget benefiting Europeans."
"It will adopt a similar approach in the negotiations on the financial perspective, and Parliament will support it with a view to providing the European Union with a budgetary framework that will enable it to fund the activities in which it is required to engage with a view to developing quality jobs and protecting the environment."
"We want this to be done in the context of real solidarity not only among the nations of Europe, but also with the poorest people."
"As regards the 2006 budget, Parliament rejects the intergovernmental approach in relation to the financial perspective."
"Our Parliament wants to represent Europeans."
"It wants us to be united in diversity."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lewis, I wish to start by also thanking the rapporteurs, headed by Mr Pittella, for the constructive outcome we have now achieved following the negotiations."
"I think it good that we were able to reach a conclusion concerning the 2006 Budget, even though there is no clarification of the financial perspective for 2007-2013."
"It does show that, despite everything, the Council’s and Parliament’s positions on the 2006 Budget were not so far removed from each other, even though the negotiations were quite tough."
"My group does not, then, wish to support the proposal to reject the 2006 Budget in protest against the British Presidency’s proposals concerning the financial perspective."
"We too are angry that the British Presidency has proposed cutting back on aid to the poorest EU countries in order to give to the rich countries, but that is of course a debate to which we shall return later."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is particularly pleased that increased appropriations to development and research programmes – over and above what has been agreed in the past, moreover – were successfully obtained."
"We are delighted to have obtained more money from the flexibility instrument so that we can fund the post-tsunami reconstruction, together with reconstruction in Iran. Regarding the size of the payments in 2006, which in fact remained at 1.01% of gross national income, it will of course be the actual level in 2006 that will determine the budget over the next few years, if it should turn out that we do not obtain an agreement on the financial perspective."
"That is something we could, of course, easily live with. We should then approve annual budgets with only the Treaty as a framework, and we should then see how things went."
"My group wants a financial perspective, but not at any price."
". – Mr President, Mr Lewis, Commissioner Grybauskaitė, ladies and gentlemen, we too believe that we have succeeded in achieving a defensible and credible compromise."
"Our aim was to exercise discipline over expenditure while nevertheless showing an ability to shape policy, and I think we have succeeded in doing that."
"Mobilising the flexibility instrument for an amount of EUR 275 million has given us the leeway to help the victims of the tsunami to rebuild their countries, to promote reconstruction in Iraq and also to bolster the new market organisation for sugar."
"I am equally glad that we have been able, through our codecision on the programme, to do more for young people and for education, for that too is all about the ability to shape policy."
"Our strategy of moving away from oil and towards more renewable energies, of benefiting research, small and medium-sized enterprises and culture too is the very thing for reaching people where they are – reaching, that is, their hearts and not just their heads."
"That is what makes me glad that our negotiations have produced this result."
"The prospect of the 2006 budget’s commitment appropriations amounting to 1.09% offers us the opportunity for an appropriate basis for the next financial perspective, and means that we are going beyond the figures proposed by the Luxembourg Presidency this summer."
"I do, nevertheless, want to remind the House that difficult negotiations in the Council on the financial perspective lie before us."
"I appeal, as a matter of urgency, not only for the same single-mindedness in pursuing a single Europe as in the 2006 budget, but also for an awareness at Council level that it is our common Europe and its ongoing development that is at stake."
"What matters is that any agreement should be made with a view to the needs of the new countries and also to the way in which Europe can be made fit for the future, with new ecological products on the global market to give hope to young people and to us."
"The negotiations that are about to begin must not be characterised by the sort of repellent haggling that gets up people’s noses; instead, all parties must see themselves as negotiating for the Europe we share and in a European spirit."
"I therefore appeal to France, to the United Kingdom, to Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands, to give a little bit of ground and come to a real agreement that makes for a better future for us all and does not ruin Europe’s image."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, Parliament and the Council have arrived at a conciliation solution for next year’s budget."
"It came just prior to the negotiations to be held tomorrow and the guidelines for future budgets in the period 2007–2013 to be presented the day after tomorrow."
"Neither party negotiating the budget wanted to take the risk of allowing these talks to founder on account of the 2006 budget."
"There are probably not many Members in this Chamber, apart from those representing the United Kingdom, who, within the context of those talks, would like to see Great Britain’s special rebate continue in the years to come."
"There are no good arguments for it."
"Next year’s budget will follow the guidelines indicated by the Council."
"In payments the 1% limit is to be approached from above, without Parliament being able to defend its own territory."
"The very fact that there might not be budgetary harmony would, under Article 272 of the Treaty, have given Parliament the use of more payment appropriations than the proposal which the negotiating parties have agreed on."
"At first reading, Parliament blew up the biggest balloon by increasing Structural Fund payments by more than EUR 3 billion."
"The Council burst this bubble in conciliation, without any special negotiations or Parliament keeping to its position."
"It is strange that the Commission did not feel the need to defend its own original proposal, but instead took the side of the Council."
"We in Parliament will remember this if there is not enough cash in the Structural Funds to make payments."
"Under the EU Constitution the Union will be militarised to an astonishing degree, even though no EU Constitution yet exists nor will ever exist in the form which was rejected by the people of France and the Netherlands."
"In this way the EU will increase its powers, even though the Member States have not legally bestowed them."
"Our group takes a very critical view of next year’s budget."
"It may be that some members will agree with the proposal to reject it."
"We want a more social and less military Europe."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to pay tribute to Mr Pittella, the rapporteur, and to Mr Lewandowski, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets."
"Mr President, the 2006 budget is a poor budget, and it should be rejected."
"A justified proposal to this effect has been tabled by members of the Independence and Democracy Group and of other political groups, and we would call on all Members of the House to lend it their support."
"The facts are as follows. In 2004 10 new Member States joined the EU, which meant a rise of 20% in the number of EU citizens."
"A constantly increasing number of these Member States are in need of assistance, solidarity and subsidies because they are not sufficiently advanced."
"The European Union will gain another two Member States in 2007 when Bulgaria and Romania join, and the number of citizens will increase by 6%."
"The second point I wish to make is that the European Union has been experiencing falling growth rates of below 2% for many years now, whereas the growth rate of the US and South-East Asian economies is many times faster."
"The competitiveness of EU businesses is declining."
"Yet the 2006 budget fails to take account of these factors."
"The budget will increase by around 2% after inflation, which means that there will be less and less money for each EU citizen."
"What is more, no changes have been made to the way in which budgetary expenditure is structured, so as to provide more money for backward countries and regions, and for sectors that are highly effective in economic terms."
"The budget keeps the old mechanisms in place, and rewards economic sectors that are both costly and inefficient."
"A budget of this kind will turn backward countries into net payers."
"In addition, there are special reasons why the 2006 budget should be rejected."
"It is being used as a threat to force the less advanced countries to consent to the adoption of the British proposal for a reduced 2007-2013 Financial Perspective."
"If they do not adopt this Financial Perspective, they face the prospect of having to agree to an interim annual budget based on the 2006 figures, which would mean even less money."
"If the 2006 budget is a forerunner of the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, then it should also be rejected, because Parliament proposed expenditure of around EUR 1 000 billion for this period, whereas the current proposal refers to a figure of around EUR 850 billion."
"Given a difference of this magnitude, it is hard to believe that any Member of this House could fail to see that Parliament’s opinion counts for very little and that it is being treated with contempt, or that the interests of individual countries are being given precedence over common interests."
"I think I can safely say that I speak for all the Members proposing that the budget be rejected when I say we believe that the declarations and slogans proclaimed by EU leaders and the actual policies they implement stand in fundamental contradiction to each other."
"Their policies are in fact simply an expression of the selfishness of the rich."
". – Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group."
"Our group will vote in favour of the agreement reached by the Council and Parliament on the 2006 budget, even though it is far from satisfactory."
"We find it hard to accept that the level of payments has been set at 1.01% of GNI."
"The compromise that has been reached on this issue is in fact nothing less than a capitulation to the Council."
"The latter cuts the EU’s spending with a tenacity worthy of a better cause, in so doing violating the principles of solidarity and cohesion in order to further the local interests of the net payers into the EU budget."
"The concessions granted by the Council on the flexibility instrument and on programmes adopted under the codecision procedure do not compensate in any way for this propensity to make cuts."
"We have been disappointed by Commissioner Grybauskaitė’s position."
"During the conciliation procedure, she did not even remain faithful to the Commission’s previous stance on the budget level."
"This latter is now worryingly close to 1%, or in other words the symbolic, and indeed real, threshold below which achievement of the EU’s basic goals cannot be safeguarded."
"This is all the more alarming because the 2006 budget may become a point of reference for the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, which has been extremely difficult in the making."
"The risk that this may happen increases the likelihood that negotiations on the Financial Perspective will end in fiasco, which would mean the 2006 budget serving as a basis for future annual budgets."
"The solidarity and cohesion policies could therefore suffer as a result of the Council’s position for many years to come."
"We must ask ourselves whether this is the kind of EU that we want."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the most inadequate of all the proposals tabled has been adopted."
"We must realise that a small budget cannot be a good budget."
"I agree that a large budget may not necessarily be a good budget, but it is impossible for a small budget to be a good one."
"This House has heard comments along the lines of, ‘the budget before us is small but good’."
"There is no consensus that this is the case, however, just as there is no consensus on a budget that will ignore the needs of countries, especially the new Member States."
"Solidarity is a basic concern for these latter."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there are certain incidents that cause many EU citizens to lose their enthusiasm for Community policies, and their belief in the momentous idea which is the European Union."
"An example of one such incident is the position recently adopted by Mr Schröder, the former German chancellor, on the construction of the gas pipeline along the bottom of the Baltic Sea."
"There is much controversy about this pipeline in many of the new EU Member States, and it has received a lot of negative publicity in these countries."
"Indeed, it is not only in the new Member States that the publicity has been negative, for I have before me a list of German newspapers that have been extremely critical of the former chancellor’s decisions."
"If the intention is now to tell the new EU Member States that there will not be enough money for them to achieve their fundamental goals, even though the aim of these goals is to promote what could be termed a natural impulse of the European Community, and if such incidents, which ruin the reputation of leading EU politicians, are accompanied by cuts to funding for the new EU Member States, we must realise that this impulse of the European Community, which also goes by the name of solidarity, will be weakened rather than strengthened."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a poor budget."
"I say this not only because it is small. As I said before, it is a poor budget because it has implications for the future, and because it will destroy the natural inclination and impulse of the European Community, which should be the first concern of every one of us."
"The 2006 budget figures proposed by Parliament provide a clear message when viewed dispassionately."
"Commitments, or potential expenditures, as a share of gross domestic product exceed 9%."
"This is a good springboard for negotiations on the long-term financial perspective."
"Payments increased by almost 6% compared with 2005, which is a substantially higher increase in budgetary resources than in many Member States of the European Union."
"Considering the fact that the expected rate of inflation and economic growth in the European Union in 2006 is around 2%, it is apparent that the proposed budget is also reasonable from the macroeconomic standpoint."
"The problem that continues to dog us is that the gap between commitments and payments is too wide."
"This gap is again nearly EUR 10 billion, which reduces the flexibility and efficiency of the EU’s budgetary instrument."
"I therefore still consider it crucial that issues regarding the effective use of budgetary resources be resolved, that mechanisms for accessing financial resources in structural and cohesion funds be made more flexible and that the extensive ‘cushion’ between resources available those that are actually used be greatly reduced."
"I would like to conclude by expressing my appreciation for the work of my fellow Members and of the rapporteurs from the Committee on Budgets."
"The results of their work also give us hope for the long-term budgetary outlook."
"Mr President, the enlarged European Union’s second budget is in the process of becoming reality."
"The broad consensus reached within Parliament means that the final vote should hold no surprises, and so I will start by saying some ‘thank yous’, for which I will otherwise run out of time."
"I should like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Pittella, Mr Dombrovskis, Mr Böge and Mr Garriga Polledo, the political group coordinators and our secretariat, headed by Maria Fialho."
"Our partners in this undertaking, or in other words Mr Lewis and Commissioner Grybauskaitė, are both well aware of the fact that this year’s budget was a challenge, and that tensions ran high during the negotiations."
"This does not diminish the mutual respect shared by the players in this EU institutional triangle, however."
"Parliament had to fulfil its mission and the commitments it entered into upon being elected, and indeed it did so."
"This was apparent from its endeavours to defend its priorities under the headings of internal and external policies, which was a far from easy task in the final year of a financial perspective."
"I am delighted that we have managed to find extra funding for six of the programmes adopted under the codecision procedure."
"It has also been necessary to mobilise the flexibility instrument, and even to exceed its annual ceiling."
"All these decisions were taken in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement, which is proof of the value of this latter."
"I am quite sure that it will be a long time before we forget the team spirit demonstrated by the members of Parliament’s delegation during these nerve-wracking negotiations."
"This was an example of genuine unity in diversity, and a good sign for the future."
"Yet our joy at having a proper annual budget for 2006 is tempered by the uncertainty that surrounds the multi-annual Financial Perspective."
"By this I do not mean uncertainty on our part, since we have adopted a position and are now awaiting developments."
"I can only hope that we will finally see signs this week that the European Union is overcoming the crisis in which it finds itself, by reaching an agreement on the most challenging issue of all, namely money."
"I also hope that the agreement is not one that leaves poorer countries with their backs against the wall, since we are all aware that these countries need to be able to plan ahead in order to conduct sensible regional policies."
"Mr President, our budget rapporteurs have presented us with a practical budget which addresses the Union’s political and social realities."
"To a large extent, our group’s recommended priorities for 2006 have been incorporated."
"They include: creating an effective information strategy; providing an efficient service for Members and visitors; continuing to purchase property and buildings under the right conditions; streamlining manpower policy and improving activity-based budgeting, which focuses more on core operations; critically examining all forms of expenditure; making better use of our resources, thus reducing waste, and other inherent malpractices – so adding real value to our performance."
"The successful conclusion of a very well structured budget becomes even more relevant considering the potential outcome of the 2007 to 2013 financial perspectives."
"In the budget conciliation process Parliament’s negotiating team went a long way to find a workable, balanced formula."
"Likewise, we should do our utmost to reach an agreement on the financial perspectives, but, as Mrs Jensen said, not at any cost."
"We should not agree on a set of financial perspectives that would make it very difficult, if not impossible, realistically to deliver on our promises and to meet our commitments and objectives."
"We cannot, and should not, pay lip service to high-flown ideas such as growth, employment, research, social solidarity and enlargement and, at the same time, not provide the funds to achieve them."
"If we fail our citizens in this respect, apathy and their perception of the barrier between the EU institutions and ordinary citizens will grow much bigger."
"In other words, if we really mean what we say, we should put our money where our mouth is."
"Mr President, I too should like to start by thanking the rapporteurs for all the work they have done."
"I think that what we have achieved, namely payment appropriations amounting to 1.01% of the gross national income, is especially significant in the light of the negotiations about the financial perspectives."
"It is higher than what Luxembourg offered under its Presidency and it is, if I am not mistaken, also higher than what is currently on offer by the British Presidency."
"I agree with the many who say that Parliament’s most important achievement has been the broader scope of the programmes relating to young people."
"We have received more funds in the framework of the flexibility instrument, which is also one of Parliament’s important criteria for subsequent financial perspectives."
"Let me turn to the common foreign and security policy, during the negotiations on which something strange happened."
"The Council wanted to teach us a lesson in cutting budget spending, and virtually every hour, the appropriations for this policy area increased."
"This I regard as particularly bad budget policy on the part of the Council in this area, and it has resulted in considerably higher amounts than first proposed at first reading."
"One possible explanation I could offer for this is the fact that we are now, for the third time, concluding an agreement with the Council on democratic control on the spending of common foreign and security policy funds."
"The Council ignored the agreement on the first two occasions."
"Third time lucky, we hope."
"Mr President, it is evident that good policy, of the kind that benefits the European public, results where the European Parliament possesses powers of codecision and that difficulties arise whenever the Council puts national interests first."
"It is also apparent from the current debate that this House was very far-sighted in European agricultural policy and in initiating the reduction in export subsidies."
"In Cancún, it was at the behest of the European Parliament that Mr Fischler and Mr Lamy proposed that these export subsidies be suspended outright."
"We have also used the budget and codecision to foster rural development and to qualify the agricultural policy."
"Certain governments – the British one in particular, which is now proposing cuts – should take good note of the fact that this rebate will nullify the House’s qualification, in part through budget policy, in this area, and put the brakes on a modern agricultural policy founded upon rural development, which will be particularly to the detriment of the new Member States of the European Union."
"– Generally speaking, there is no harm in comparing the 2006 ceiling, and the Community’s budget priorities, which stands at around 1.01% of Community GNI, with the 2005 figure, or with the proposals made by the Luxembourg and British Presidencies for the 2007-2013 Financial Framework."
"Let us not forget, however, that the Financial Framework for 2000-2006 provided for 1.08% of GNI for the following year, that Parliament’s proposal for the 2007-2013 Financial Framework provides for 1.0% and that the Commission is proposing around 1.14%."
"In recent years, there has been a real terms reduction in the Community budget, which some are trying to set at around 1%. That would mean that the Structural Funds would account for 0.36% to 0.37% of Community GNI, which would suit the most economically advanced countries in the EU."
"Once again, a mindset has taken hold that oddly views every concession as a victory, in reference to each increasingly damaging proposal."
"Mr President, every year, around this time, we live through a period of unprecedented extravagance in the European Union."
"I am talking about the surpluses, which give us a small foretaste of what we can – unfortunately – expect on a larger scale later on."
"Yesterday, the Committee on Budgets was discussing something the presence of which on the agenda was cause for bafflement, namely the purchase, for the sum of EUR 3 million, of a building for the European Parliament in Valletta – it is worth mentioning that the intention was that the Commission should be a tenant."
"All five Maltese MEPs are against the idea, saying that it is too remote and difficult to get to, and that they would rather carry on renting at the present favourable rate."
"They have to accept it, though, since there is a surplus and it has to be spent."
"So along comes one of your colleagues, Mr President, the Vice-President Mr Onesta, and says, ‘that is a good property investment, and I promise you that, in three years’ time, if we find something better, we will be able to sell the building at a profit and move on somewhere else’."
"We are forced to accept these benefactions, and the European Parliament is made into a property speculator by the mere fact of having too much money, and then people wonder why it is that, in Malta, the public wonder what this is all in aid of, what sort of waste this is, what sort of attitude this is to take."
"Away with such practices, and let us have proper budgeting – the sort that is not guaranteed by the draft budget we have before us, and so I, of course, will be among those voting against it."
"I shall just clarify something with regard to what you were saying about Mr Onesta, because I too am a member of the Bureau."
"The European Parliament is obviously not a property speculator, but endeavours to be a good administrator of the funds entrusted to it."
"The desire to spend in appropriate conditions should therefore, in my opinion, be approved by a man who is as fond of budgetary rigour as you are."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here we are again, with everyone in this House embracing one another and congratulating themselves and each other on this budget."
"While this congratulatory reception is going on, though, I have substantial criticisms to make, notably that the second reading in the Committee went ahead without documents, so that resolutions were put together orally, and that the cutbacks and redeployments of funds neither were nor are justifiable."
"I am quite surprised to see, in the foreign policy sphere, that non-governmental organisations and democracy programmes have gained a great deal, more indeed than they have ever had before, while cutbacks were the order of the day almost everywhere else."
"While I am on the subject of cutbacks, the Commission has, in negotiations with the Council and in the Committee on Budgets, proposed to make them, to the tune of over EUR 150 million, to the payments made from the Structural Funds, leaving EUR 70 million."
"It justified this by reference to an alleged lack of opportunity for implementation in the countries concerned."
"Looking at the programme of cutbacks, I wonder why it is that the Commission, and the Commissioner, have lost the courage to do the right and proper thing."
"The present cuts in the internal policy areas and in foreign policy hit hardest those areas in which the money could actually have been put to good use, and this is something of which I really do take a very critical view."
"We will look carefully to see whether the money remaining in the Structural Funds actually does get spent."
"What I find regrettable about this sort of thing is that it is yet more evidence of our inability to trust those who administer the funds, and so I ask, as a matter of urgency, that there be no repetition of it, or else we will see a great gulf opening up between old and new, between those countries that contribute and those that receive, and that is precisely what we cannot afford with the financial perspective and the debates on it in the offing."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate all those who have worked hard to put in place the 2006 budget, especially our rapporteur, Mr Pittella."
"I have just three points for the Commission and Council to reflect on."
"Firstly, every year we have a similar struggle to agree the EU budget."
"It is increasingly a challenging task due to ever more exceptional demands on the EU at home and abroad."
"At the same time, the traditional priorities continue to require as much spending as before."
"I do not think, therefore, that we should worry if the budget requires a heated and lengthy debate to achieve a compromise solution."
"However, we should be concerned by the fact that, after devoting time, money and effort debating, negotiating and agreeing the budget, we then fail to use the funds."
"This is totally unacceptable and I know that many others, including Mr Garriga Polledo, have made this point."
"I would ask the Commissioner to take full responsibility for improving implementation, not only in the programmes that the Commission champions, but also in respecting Parliament’s will."
"The fiercely negotiated funds must have an impact on the lives of EU citizens and it is payments that have the most direct effect."
"My second point is that collectively we need to be more aware of our public image and the importance of demonstrating the collaborative working habits that drive the EU project and inspire confidence in the European Union."
"These are currently clearly lacking."
"I would like the Commission to note that Parliament has improved resources for communication policy."
"Now it is the responsibility of Commission officials to be more imaginative."
"In this age of the competitive mass communications market, the need to sell ourselves and our EU vision and deliver a clear, simple and compelling message is absolutely imperative."
"That goes for Parliament too."
"Outdated, incomprehensible legacies such as our travelling circuses do nothing to help us win this game."
"Thirdly, a word on heading 4."
"As the chairman of the Delegation for Relations with the Countries of South Asia and SAARC, I am deeply disappointed with the reduction in amounts for Asia, even with the additional flexibility."
"The Council needs to think seriously about this dysfunctional heading."
"We have a knee-jerk reaction to major disasters."
"We have commitments to the MDG global health funds."
"We do not, however, have adequate resources."
"Let this be a priority for the Council Presidency."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Pittella and Mr Dombrovskis, rapporteurs for the budget, for their excellent budget draft, as well as Mr Lewandowski, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, for his conciliatory role as leader of the negotiations."
"The draft budget before us aims at improving employment in Europe."
"Certain multiannual programmes are to be started, on Parliament’s initiative, as a result."
"This particularly applies to the research framework programme and training programmes."
"In this way Parliament is showing the direction in which the work of the EU should be developed."
"This budget is the last under the current financial perspective."
"The new financial framework should bolster European entrepreneurship and therefore employment."
"Research and development, and training and the promotion of cohesion will have key roles to play in this."
"Unfortunately, however, the best laid plans can run into trouble."
"The proposal at Luxembourg back in June drastically reduced the appropriations intended to improve competitiveness by a hefty EUR 60 billion."
"Although Prime Minister Tony Blair promised improvements, Britain’s proposal is even worse."
"There has been no increase in appropriations for research and development whatsoever."
"Another EUR 12 billion has been cut from the Structural Funds in addition to the reduction of EUR 29 billion made at Luxembourg."
"Rural development, which is an important element in agricultural reform, is threatened with total collapse."
"At Luxembourg, EUR 14 billion was cut from the framework and now Britain is cutting a further EUR eight billion."
"The budget should aim at the future and endorse action which no single Member State can afford on its own."
"This budget shows the way."
"Mr President, some aspects of the funding of the so-called Common Foreign and Security Policy are highly dubious."
"Money from wholly disparate budget rubrics is used to fund the EU’s operations, whether of a military or police nature, and the so-called flexibility instrument makes an additional EUR 40 million available for the CFSP."
"What I would like to know is for what, precisely, these EUR 40 million are being used."
"The EUPOL operation in Kinshasa is funded by the European Development Fund, that is to say by EUR 4.3 million of development aid."
"The AMIS operation in the Sudan, which includes military training, is funded jointly by ten Member States, as well as by the fund called the African Peace Facility."
"The EUPM mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina is part-funded from the Commission’s budget, and the ALTHEA operation in Bosnia by means of what is termed the ATHENA mechanism, in other words, in an undemocratic manner and without Parliamentary scrutiny."
"Mr Brok is now proposing that there be an increase in this area, from EUR 100 million to EUR 300 million."
"As you know that the Treaty of Nice prohibits the European Union from maintaining an independent military budget, perhaps you would refrain from these sorts of tricks!"
"Mr President, since I oppose virtually everything that the European Union proposes to spend money on during the budget year of 2006, I cannot be expected to support this report or its motion for a resolution."
"The European Union is a self-perpetuating mega-bureaucracy that has carte blanche to finance its own programmes."
"I particularly oppose the allocation of funds for the brainwashing of young people, referred to in this report as being used for advancing the idea of Europe."
"I believe that even the most backward of students will be aware that the continent of Europe has been around for quite some time and is a bit more than an idea."
"Bringing secondary school pupils to this institution for all-expenses-paid visits, during which they will be given disingenuous one-sided briefings about the wonders of the European Union, is a crude brainwashing exercise, as is the flooding of educational establishments with equally one-sided literature."
"The report’s repeated references to the now almost wholly discredited Lisbon Strategy hardly add to its credibility."
"I would urge any Member of this institution who generally believes in democracy and accountability to the electorate to vote against this budget and any other documents that purport to legitimise it."
"Mr President, the Member States are in reality the EU’s paymasters without discretion."
"Whatever the arguments about the budgets, they pay and then argue about how it is all to be spent, which is not real budgeting in any sense that I understand."
"That is why the argument about the British rebate is about politics and not proper financial management."
"It is a continuing running sore, only because Mrs Thatcher was foolish enough to agree that it should be paid back by the Member States to what is now the fourth largest economy in the world and, since enlargement, it comes from some of the smallest and poorest in Europe."
"Had that been a deduction made in London and a net sum paid over, the argument would never have arisen."
"Whatever the budget, the European project is stuttering, unsure what to do about the faltering eurozone and unable to come to terms with Anglo-Saxon enterprise that the countries of Asia have made their own."
"You have big problems and many of them are of your own design."
"– Mr President, I am delighted, first of all because from now on the Council will negotiate CFSP issues with us at ambassador level, thereby upgrading Parliament's role in the shaping of the CFSP."
"Secondly, I am delighted because an agreement was reached in time on the 2006 budget."
"In this respect, the British Presidency took the right decision, given that no one would have tolerated two major impasses at the end of a Presidency and Mr Blair wanted to close the 2006 budget in good time so that he would have more room for manoeuvre when negotiating the financial perspectives."
"Thirdly, payment appropriations for 2006 are 1.01, compared to 1 in 2005, while the British proposal makes provision for 0.98 for the seven-year period from 2007 to 2013."
"We have a slight improvement compared with this year, we achieved more than the British Presidency is discounting for the next seven years, but we have no reason to celebrate."
"We shall not achieve European integration with so little money."
"I should like to reply to the minister by saying that we do not agree with what he said here today about the heading 3 financing needed and legal use of the flexibility instrument supposedly being 'exceptional events'."
"I am afraid that the minister should not have said this in his intervention, because, on the contrary, we shall not achieve integration with less money, especially less necessary money."
"To divide the Member States into net contributors and net recipients of appropriations, when we are not going to spend more than 1% on Europe, when we are not focusing our overall synergies from common European action, does not do us credit and certainly does not testify to our regard for European ideals."
"Mr President, I would like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Pittella, and his team, on the excellent work they have done and I would like to add that it is not my custom to congratulate all of the rapporteurs when their reports are finished."
"They have made great efforts and they have faced many problems."
"Having been rapporteur for the Union’s budget, I am well aware that it is not an easy thing to complete a successful budget."
"I would like to focus, Mr President, on the aspects that I consider to be of particular importance."
"Firstly, for the first time we have managed to apply a principle which this Parliament had always advocated: the sums approved during codecision are not sacred and they can be altered if the budgetary authority believes that to be necessary."
"We all agree that, in order to improve the management of multi-annual programmes, the security of financial packages is an important factor."
"But we cannot turn what is no more than a tool into an objective."
"This is what differentiates us from the Council."
"Perhaps what separates us from the Council is the definition of the objectives."
"Perhaps the Council’s objective is simply the certainty that nothing is going to change once a decision is taken."
"What I believe we could call ‘the certainty of the accountant’."
"To all of this we must add that the programmes whose funding has increased in the 2006 budget are hugely symbolic to the European Union."
"Both the Socrates Programme, which is well known to many citizens, and Youth, are examples of what a Parliament can do to create European awareness amongst the Union’s citizens."
"Furthermore, the LIFE programme, created by Parliament itself years ago, is one of those that enjoy the greatest acceptance amongst the European citizens and which demonstrate most clearly what kind of Europe we here in Parliament want to see."
"I am also pleased that the Council has not been able to impose the absurd manipulation, which they call ‘interpretation’, of the rules for mobilising the flexibility instrument."
"An unnecessary instrument within the interinstitutional agreement, which only exists because of the Council’s constant and almost legendary refusal to use the appropriate instrument for dealing with cases in which more appropriations than those provided for at the beginning of a period of programming of the financial perspective are required."
"That appropriate instrument is called ‘revision’ and its use does not lead to chaos or to eternal damnation."
"The consequence of this more rational use of the resources available to us — the phrase should be familiar to you — has meant that the cuts we have been making since 2000 in the Union’s external actions are less than usual this year."
"Since it has taken two to achieve all of this, and I do not want to be entirely negative toward the Council, I would like to congratulate the British Presidency, in which I must confess I did not have too much confidence at the beginning, but which in the end has been up to the job."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is perfectly plain from the negotiations on the 2006 budget, and even more so from the debates on the financial perspective, that the way the Council is acting is reminiscent of someone who leaves a restaurant without settling the bill."
"The Council orders more and more powers for the European Union, while being willing to pay less and less for them."
"The Council sticks up for the Member States."
"What the Member States want is for the EU to do more and more with the Common Foreign and Security Policy, to fight terrorism and crime, to subsidise agriculture, to organise policies for the protection of the environment and of consumers, for development aid and much else – the list is endless."
"It is getting longer, and, as we all know, that costs money – a lot of money."
"So let me tell the Council that it is time the simple truth dawned on it that more powers cost more money, and fewer powers cost less money."
"It is irresponsible of the Council to demand more powers while at the same time being less and less willing to spend money."
"Reforming the way the money is spent would do us all some good."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, there are just a few comments I would like to make at this point."
"I have been through quite a few budget debates, but none have been conducted in such a shameful manner as this year’s even though I did think that previous performances could not be surpassed."
"When I consider the way the 2006 budget procedure went, and how the preparations for the next financial framework are progressing, I really do wonder, Mr President-in-Office, why your Prime Minister – to whom I ask you to pass this on – delivered such an incandescent speech in Brussels at the end of June."
"The words were fine, but action has not been forthcoming."
"It is not that it has been moderate, but rather that there simply has not been any."
"I am glad that the British Presidency of the Council has learned, in the course of this budget procedure, that this House knows what it is for and what it is about."
"I hope you will take that insight away with you and take account of it in your deliberations."
"You have an image of Europe as somewhere where a few Heads of State or Government announce how things are to go and steer them in that direction, and in which the Commission and Parliament are no more than decorative accessories that have to be tolerated; well, I have to tell you that that Europe no longer exists."
"If you have taken this lesson to heart, then I will be very satisfied with the British Presidency of the Council."
"I will, however – and here I am addressing the Commissioner – make the critical comment that, as regards the role played by the Commission in the budget procedure, there has to be something of a rethink."
"It is not acceptable that the European Parliament should act as the Commission’s shield and defence, yet keep on getting the sense of being left in the lurch when the Commission withdraws positions in response to pressure from the Council."
"That is another thing to which we will, together, need to give very close consideration if we are to achieve anything together."
"Getting additional funds made available could have been achieved with less of an effort, but the fact is that presidencies sometimes need a bit longer to understand things and to come round to supporting them."
"This House, though, is patient and takes its time, for we do have a few things in the field of education policy that we want to hammer out with the Council."
"To you, Mr President-in-Office, I want to press home the point that the Inter-Institutional Agreement has proved its worth."
"We have agreed among ourselves on the ground rules, we have insisted on you keeping to them, and that was the right way to go about it."
"I do, though, also want to say something self-critical about something that has bothered me for years, and since I myself once had the honour to present Parliament’s budget, and it is this: this House will, in the long term, have no credibility in negotiations with the Council or the Commission if we do not get a firm grip on our own budget."
"When I consider the unspent funds from the 2005 budget that we had to deal with yesterday when again transferring appropriations, or the struggle we had with our good friends the Social Democrats in order to get Parliament’s budget just EUR 20 million below the magic 20% limit – and I am obliged to the rapporteur, Mr Dombrovskis, for leading us in it – then we will have to give serious thought to what all this has to do with truth and clarity."
"A European Parliament that fails to manage 10% of the amount budgeted for in the manner prescribed, has a credibility problem, and it is one that we have to consider in a self-critical light."
"I would just like to say something else about the financial perspective."
"I urge you to take home with you the lesson, which you have learned, that Europe consists of states with equal rights, not of old and new Member States."
"Europe adds up to a common interest, not to the sum of 25 national interests."
"If you bear that in mind, you will have a successful weekend; if you do not, it will be a flop."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to express my sincere thanks to our fellow Members, Mr Pittella and Mr Dombrovskis, as well as to Mrs Jensen, for the enormous task they carried out during this long procedure."
"This budget, while not perfect, is, in my opinion, relatively satisfactory, and I am delighted that the level of payment appropriations has been brought up to EUR 112 billion, that is to say 1.01% of GNI, and that our operating costs have been curbed and relatively stabilised."
"As permanent rapporteur for the Structural Funds within the Committee on Budgets, I might nevertheless have hoped that the Council would have granted more appropriations to all of these financial instruments, which remain the cornerstone of our policies aimed at reducing territorial disparities."
"What is more, I, like many of our fellow Members, am still waiting to hear the results of the European Council negotiations, and I should like to drive home the point that it is worth keeping in mind Parliament’s positions during these negotiations."
"At a time now when we need Europe most, it is crucial that the Member States provide the European Union with genuine financial resources."
"We need Europe so that we can carry out an ambitious economic policy for its 450 million people."
"We need Europe so that we can carry out a common foreign and security policy, which is distinct from those of the self-contained empires throughout the world."
"To conclude – and contrary to the opinion expressed by some of our fellow Members with regard to brainwashing - we need Europe more than ever in order to build a project for society uniting us around shared values."
"That is my dream; I hope that it is yours too."
"Mr President, I should like to take the opportunity of this debate on the 2006 budget to remind the House that the payments in this budget are set at a level that is as much as 0.07% of GNP lower than that foreseen in the 2000-2006 Financial Perspective."
"They are also 0.02% lower than the payments planned for 2005, which is now drawing to a close."
"This is certainly not good news, in particular for the new EU Member States."
"This fundamental objection notwithstanding, I should like to thank all those who have helped ensure that the 2006 budgetary procedure will soon come to an end."
"A total of two rounds of painstaking conciliation negotiations with the Council were needed to get this far, as well as the taking up of a firm position by both the negotiating group and Parliament as a whole."
"This is a particularly important message to send out at a time when the debate on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective is ongoing, and when the positions of the Council and Parliament on this matter are unfortunately very different."
"The 2006 budget sets a figure of almost EUR 112 billion to cover payments, which is the equivalent of 1.01% of the EU’s GNP."
"This is substantially higher than the level of payments proposed by the British Presidency for the individual years in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective."
"As I see it, this should be one of our key arguments in the debate on the level of payments for the 2007-2013 period, given that the European Union, far from wanting to abandon the funding of any of its present activities, is currently seeking to increase its involvement."
"I should like to conclude by thanking the rapporteurs for having drafted the reports."
"I should also like to express the hope that we will succeed in implementing this year’s budget in its entirety, so that late 2006 does not see us complaining that we have failed to adopt a rational approach to the expenditure of such a modest sum."
"– Knowledge is the European Union’s competitive advantage, and we are responsible for the development of a knowledge-based society."
"The European Union can only offer a successful response to global changes through unity and the exploitation of knowledge, innovation and creativity at a European level."
"This is the essence of the Lisbon Strategy."
"All 25 Member States of the European Union have committed themselves to fulfilling the goals of this strategy."
"Its fulfilment will of course require adequate financial resources, both in the financial perspective and in the annual budget."
"A budget geared towards development is therefore extremely important for the common European future."
"The budget for 2006 is not important simply for the coming year, but will also be of key importance in the event of our failure to agree on the future financial perspective."
"For this reason I would prefer the budget to be significantly more development-orientated."
"Most of the resources in the budget are still earmarked for agriculture and structural measures, within which we find agriculture once again."
"Despite the increase in comparison with the 2005 budget, it is the area of internal policies that receives the smallest amount of resources in the 2006 budget and thereby the developmental part of European policies."
"The ceiling set by the financial perspective has only been achieved for rural development and internal policies remain more than two percent below the threshold."
"Nevertheless I remain realistic, and I wish to congratulate the European Union negotiators for their perseverance with the priorities that were set and for the funds they managed to secure."
"The increase in funds, although lower than we would wish for programmes that are of great importance for the Lisbon Strategy, is significant, and says much about the direction we have mapped out for the future."
"In the event of failed negotiations on the financial perspective, this means more development-orientated spending of European financial resources than was set out in the Luxembourg and British proposals for 2007-2013."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that this agreement on the 2006 budget has finally been reached, and I would like essentially to stress two aspects: one directly relating to the budget and another indirectly related."
"I would like firstly to stress the fact that more than six programmes subject to codecision have been provided with EUR 100 million, which I believe to be very significant and stimulating."
"I believe that this is the direction that the Community budget should take over the coming years."
"The effort that has been made in relation to small and medium-sized businesses is particularly relevant."
"We must not forget that, at the end of the day, we have 23 million SMEs in Europe, which represent no more and no less than two-thirds of all jobs in the private sector."
"There is therefore no doubt that the success of SMEs will mean success for growth and employment in Europe."
"However — and this is an important ‘however’ — research and development are also a fundamental pillar in terms of the competitiveness of our companies, of the competitiveness of our economies."
"And there is a very worrying aspect here: the current financial perspective does not include an increase in the fund intended for research and development."
"Despite the fact that the British Presidency quite rightly – very rightly in fact – stresses the importance of research and development over and over again, there is no parallel budgetary effort in that direction."
"The British proposal — which is not an original proposal, it has already been proposed by the Commission — to increase the funds of the European Investment Bank and, by means of soft credits and guarantees, to enhance research, is not a solution to the problem, but it must be a complementary instrument."
"It is fundamental, if we want to maintain the consistency and credibility of a debate which focuses on competitiveness in innovation, development and research, that the financial perspective provides for the funds intended for research."
"Otherwise, we will be moving backwards, once again, with regard to the Lisbon objectives."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this week the European Parliament will adopt the European Union’s budget for 2006 at the second and final reading."
"This will conclude the European Union’s budget procedure for 2006 and the existing Financial Perspective."
"I am pleased that after lengthy debates with the European Council it has been possible to reach a compromise."
"This was also important because the 2006 budget serves as a point of reference in taking decisions on the next Financial Perspective, that for 2007–2013."
"I hope that this week the Member States’ governments at the European Council will also be able to agree on the Council’s position with regard to the Financial Perspective."
"I call on the European Council, when debating this issue, also to take into account the opinion and ideas expressed in the European Parliament’s resolution."
"The main priorities of the 2006 budget for the other EU institutions are enlargement and the effective and highly targeted use of EU budget resources."
"The first priority is connected with the successful completion of the 2004 round of enlargement, as well as preparations for the next round of enlargement, when Bulgaria and Romania will join."
"Unfortunately, once again it is necessary to point out that, although more than a year has passed since EU enlargement, many permanent staff posts set aside for the new Member States still remain vacant."
"One of the problems to be emphasised in this connection is the excessive red-tape and slow procedures for taking on staff."
"In accordance with the decision taken at first reading, the proposal at second reading is again to support all the permanent staff posts requested by the other institutions in connection with enlargement, and also other additional expenditure connected with enlargement, in order to ensure the success of the next round of EU enlargement."
"The second priority is effective and highly targeted use of EU budget resources."
"This priority encompasses such matters as: focusing EU institutional expenditure on fundamental tasks; giving support to new budget requests and permanent staff posts requests only after having assessed the possibility of redistributing resources and staff within the framework of the existing budget; giving support to new initiatives only after having assessed their impact on the budget and interinstitutional cooperation with a view to economical and effective use of budget resources."
"Both institutions with budgetary decision-making powers – the European Parliament and the Council – endorse the principles of budgetary discipline and the rational use of EU taxpayers’ money."
"At second reading the European Council proposed reverting to its initial position and reducing the administrative expenditure of the other institutions by 15 million euro as compared with the institutions’ original requests."
"It must be said that in many cases this reduction was implemented in an ill-considered manner, without thorough examination of the specific nature and problems of the institutions’ work."
"Nonetheless, during the conciliation meeting a compromise was reached whereby the European Council will not object to the amount of expenditure by the other institutions set by the European Parliament at first reading."
"Therefore, the proposal at the European Parliament’s second reading is to retain the amount of expenditure fixed at the European Parliament’s first reading, restoring part of the reductions in expenditure made by the European Council – in total by 7.5 million euro."
"To conclude, I should like to return to the issue of the Financial Perspective."
"During the conciliation meeting on the EU budget for 2006 it could be seen that the European Council and particularly the UK Presidency focused excessively on just a single issue – the minimum possible figure for payment appropriations."
"It only remains to hope that at this week’s European Council summit the Member States’ governments will be able to deal with EU issues within a wider perspective, and not reduce everything to just one question – the minimum possible figure for payment appropriations."
"Particularly striking proof of this tendency is provided by the unacceptable proposal by the UK Presidency to find a compromise between the older Member States at the expense of the new Member States, by reducing by 10 per cent the amount of EU funds accessible to the new Member States."
"We must remember that the Luxembourg Presidency had already proposed a significant reduction in the amount of resources to be directed towards the EU’s regional policy, in comparison with what the European Commission had announced."
"Fortunately, this proposal by the UK has already been withdrawn."
"It only remains to hope that the UK Presidency is serious about reaching a compromise this year on the Financial Perspective, and that its next proposal will be an improvement."
"The President of the Council informed me that he had to leave the debate under way. I had been informed of this;"
"I am surprised, though, that the Council should not wish to reply to such an important question before Parliament, but I take note of this information."
". Mr President, I want to thank Parliament for the debate today, and I congratulate once more the whole Parliament negotiating team."
"With the result that was negotiated in this political environment, in which we all participated, we have achieved the optimum possible outcome."
"I wish Parliament a successful vote on Thursday."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"– The next item is the continuation of the Commission statement on the Commission's legislative and work programme for 2006."
". Mr President, next year will be crucial in the face of a Europe lacking modern institutions and budgetary prospects, a Europe in crisis faced with citizens who are increasingly uncertain of it and who, unfortunately, made us aware of the fact in spring."
"We are therefore going to have to accept the challenge – the globalisation challenge, the climate change challenge, the energy challenge and the demographic challenge – if we are to meet Europeans’ expectations and if Europeans are to understand that Europe is not some amorphous mass bearing no relation to themselves."
"From this viewpoint, we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are proposing practical guidelines to you for 2006, something that was sorely lacking in your programme, Commissioner, not least in terms of transforming the Lisbon Strategy objectives into actions."
"In order to improve European competitiveness, we will see to it that all forms of bureaucracy are reduced and that all unnecessary legislation is done away with."
"In this context, it is important to involve the European Parliament more and to improve the ex-post evaluation of the measures adopted."
"The PPE-DE also lays emphasis on the completion of the internal market, the optimal running of which is crucial for all of our businesses, for all of our jobs and for our consumers."
"Our economy must be able to rely on the rapid completion of the large-scale trans-European transport network projects, which will need to be funded not only by the European budget, but also by public-private partnerships, which are also central to our ambition for research, an ambition requiring more than just lip service."
"The budget dedicated to the new framework programme for research and innovation will be enlightening."
"We will be exacting with regard to the appropriations available and the way in which these are used."
"This research is the key to our future jobs."
"Commissioner, the PPE-DE will also pay a great deal of attention to the external borders of the European Union."
"We call on you, for 2006, genuinely to begin to reflect on the Union’s absorption capacity and openly to debate this issue with Parliament."
"This is a very important issue for our citizens, who question us on this point every day, just as they question us on the fight against illegal immigration or the strengthening of border control capacities."
"To strengthen our border control capacities, we must increasingly use biometric data and ensure better cooperation between information systems – a crucial kind of cooperation that we must also see applied in the contexts of cyber security, the fight against terrorism and the fight against crime."
"We have a high-performance tool – Europol – and it is time we provided it with a Community legal basis."
"Finally, the European Union can bring its added value to other areas, such as health care."
"We look forward to practical measures being implemented in relation to the fight against obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer or psychological problems."
"The PPE-DE also wants a proposal in favour of patients’ mobility and of providing them with information."
"It is also the European Union’s duty to take charge of education."
"We regret your lack of ambition, particularly in relation to improving language teaching and to developing our university centres."
"Commissioner, you know that the fulfilment of our objectives together with Europe’s everyday added value are dependent on two fundamental requirements."
"On the one hand, the institutional rules governing the functioning of the European Union: you are aware of our attachment to the Constitutional Treaty; a strong initiative is urgently required to restart the debate."
"On the other hand, the financial perspective: a budget that meets everyone’s expectations, a strong budget for a powerful Europe and not just a few coins casually put on the table by the Council, like some shabby tip."
"."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I really cannot restrain myself from starting my speech with the comment that, although it was Mrs Grossetête’s group that insisted on us having this debate, one can hardly be overwhelmed by the number of its members who have actually turned up for it."
"Madam Vice-President, it is to our great advantage that we can support the Commission when we believe it is going down the right road and criticise it when we believe there are things to be set right."
"If I may begin with Plan D, for which you have personal responsibility, I can say that you will have this group’s wholehearted support."
"I hope that you yourself will, next year, be able to devote your full energy to getting the Constitution and the debate on the issues around it across to the public and thereby completing your achievement."
"Turning to Mr Barroso’s criticisms of the draft budget – which he described as a mini-budget for a mini-Europe – I have to say that we agree with him, and our chairman, Mr Schulz, has said so in plain terms."
"I hope that our President will stand sufficiently firm in the dialogue to ensure that the interests of Europe as a whole are defended."
"As for the ‘better regulation’ issue, we agree with you that what really matters is that the process of enacting Europe’s laws be made more efficient and more readily comprehensible, not least from the point of view of the man and woman in the street, and, with this in mind, I would ask the members of the Commission – all of them – to read through the draft of the services directive and then say whether or not they find it comprehensible or an example of ‘better regulation’."
"Quite apart from its social content, it would be very interesting to discuss that with you, but that can, of course, wait for next year."
"I would like to say something about two things to which our Socialist Group in the European Parliament will be giving particular attention next year."
"The first is the defence of fundamental rights and freedoms in Europe, in relation to which especially objectionable things have come to light and occurred in recent months, and I am not referring only to the activities of the CIA, but rather – to give a couple of examples –to the restriction of trade union rights in Slovakia, and also, in this context, certain attitudes that have become apparent in the new Member State of Poland as regards the fundamental rights and freedoms of homosexual persons and others."
"All these developments we regard with concern."
"I would like to assure Commissioner Frattini of our full support and urge him to forthrightly defend Europe’s rights and standards in this area."
"That is the only thing we demand of him."
"Let me turn to the most important issue, which is that of ‘social Europe’."
"We, in our group, know as well as anyone else that there is no long-term job security; we also know that many people have to change jobs again and again, but it is precisely for that reason that this Commission needs to take tougher action on social issues, and be seen to do so."
"Many members of the public – as you, Madam Vice-President, will know from your dialogue with them – even believe that the EU magnifies the negative effects of globalisation; they see how many people – including, alas, many companies – misuse the European Union, enlargement, and globalisation too, as a means of undermining social standards."
"This is not just a matter of concern in the so-called old Member States, but in the new ones too."
"It is for that reason that the Commission needs to become more active in the field of social policy; it must help to obviate or at least to alleviate the adverse effects, without fostering the illusion that we can erect a protective wall around Europe."
"Speaking on behalf of my group, then, I urge the Commission to produce a proposal for legislation on, for example, non-standard working arrangements, to unveil – as the Council Presidency has not done – a workable approach to the establishment of a globalisation adjustment fund and, at last, to put on the table a proposal for a framework directive on services of general interest, which are among the means whereby the public are connected to the public sector."
"What they need is support from the European Union and the Commission rather than to be undermined by them."
"I can tell the Vice-President of the Commission that the members of my group are not starry-eyed about social issues, but we do know that, if we fail to make this Europe of ours more social, if we fail to give greater prominence to the social dimension in addressing the issues of globalisation and the opening up of markets, then we will fail to win backing for our project from the citizens of this continent."
"That, though, is an absolute necessity, and for it to happen, we need the Commission’s support."
"That, speaking on my group’s behalf, is what I really would urge you to provide."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we Liberal and Democrats have taken a position on your work programme alongside the conservative Christian Democrats and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group."
"It is evident from the way we have opted to structure its content that there are tasks to occupy us next year in all policy areas."
"We congratulate you on the fundamental direction of the work programme, which is aimed at making Europe more competitive, at consistent pursuit of the Lisbon Agenda and at completing the market as a means towards strengthening Europe’s economy – those are the right lines along which to go if Europe is to be made stronger and fitter for globalisation."
"This policy will also bring Europe closer to its people by making visible what Europe really means for them as individuals."
"I would, however, also like to make some critical comments."
"This House is where many political initiatives are started, and the scene of many debates, and we would very much like to see you drawing on our debates as a source for initiatives that eventually bear fruit in legislation."
"What Europe needs is a single work programme for the various institutions, which would make visible the way in which they work together."
"The fact is that, at the end of the day, it is we who are the people’s representatives; it is we who take note of what the public in the Member States are talking about and of what they want, and so we ask you to take greater account of this."
"I also have some critical comments to make about the form of the work programme, which cannot be said to be coherent when it consists of two parts, neither of which has anything to do with the other – an introductory section describing in fine words what Europe is all about, followed by a second part lacking any consistency in either structure or language."
"A document such as this is comprehensible only to those in the institutions who have to work with it; it is not something with which one can give the public any real idea of what Europe actually intends to do."
"In exactly the same way, we demand of you that, for every initiative that you take, you also specify the legal basis for it, making it possible to trace precisely whence Europe derives the competence to do something in this particular area."
"It is also advisable to minimise the number of proposals you make, for it often makes much more sense to concentrate on a few things and then do them well."
"‘Better regulation’ is not just about making proposals, but also about implementing them later on."
"Above all, it must mean implementing them more simply, more quickly and more directly, with priority given to the effects of legislation, which means that greater attention must be given to the costs resulting from it."
"If it turns out that a piece of legislation will cost too much, and that the costs will outweigh the benefits, then it should be dispensed with."
"This applies not only to new initiatives, for those that are already going through the system, along with legislation already in force, must also be evaluated in order to determine whether it really is needed or whether it costs too much."
"Working on the principle that less is often more, we have prepared our own proposals, which I ask the Commissioner to draw on, since it is important that the EU should be clear, comprehensible and on a smaller scale if the public are to know what it is all about."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the Commission must now adopt its sustainable development strategy."
"The issue has an effect on the debate relating to the legislative programme insofar as my group criticised the Commission’s programme, considering that insufficient attention had been paid to the very issues concerning sustainable development."
"Since last month’s debate with Mr Barroso, the European Environment Agency has published a very important and very interesting report, the third five-year report on the state of the environment in the European Union and the effectiveness of the Union’s policies."
"I am not going to summarise this 750-page report in one and a half minutes, but it is clear that, in spite of the substantial progress made, the overall situation is still deteriorating in a number of sectors, not least in the transport, energy and agricultural sectors."
"This report contains – and I wanted to draw your attention to this – two more very important points."
"Firstly, the fact that the cost of inaction can be higher than the cost of a prevention policy."
"I was truly surprised to learn that 200 million working days are lost each year due to occupational illnesses connected to air pollution."
"Secondly, this report states that household expenditure will double between now and 2030."
"This goes to show the relevance and importance of guiding consumers’ choices and thus of effectively applying the principle of the internalisation of costs."
"That is why the resolution tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance calls on you, in particular, to introduce binding measures with regard to car emissions – which are linked to air pollution – to introduce implementing measures in the context of the eco design directive, on which the Commission has fallen behind in comparison with its work programme, and to introduce a tax on aviation fuel as part of a broader fiscal reform that reduces the tax on work and that, as has long been recommended, penalises those products that are harmful to the environment."
"Finally, another aspect included in our resolution is the extension of the scope of the directive on buildings in favour of a more wide-ranging policy on insulation and in favour of better building insulation."
"In other words, I would say that, if Bill Clinton declared at Montreal that he was fond of Kyoto, then we, for our part, know that the Commission is very fond of Lisbon."
"We would hope that the Commission is even fonder of Gothenburg, and I hope that you, in particular, will make your colleagues even fonder of Gothenburg."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just returned from the Montreal climate conference, where an extremely important result was achieved: the decision to implement the Kyoto commitments to the full and to prepare to go further, by maintaining the agreement well beyond 2012 with very significant targets for reductions."
"The conference revealed a determination to choose a different development path, focusing on alternative energies and energy savings, and to go down the road of multilateral cooperation, making all that the most important mission for a world caught up in an environmental crisis and the contradictions arising from increasingly marked inequalities."
"Europe played an important role in the conference regarding this choice of direction, by holding a dialogue with China on its crucial opening-up and sidelining the Bush Administration’s attempt to sabotage the talks."
"To be frank, there is no significant trace of any of this in the work programme placed before us."
"President Barroso is proposing free trade and dumping, the Bolkestein directive and the working time directive, and unbridled globalisation leading to increased pollution from transport emissions, which are exceeding all limits."
"In the current situation of crisis and failure, Mr Blair, together with Mr Barroso, is proposing a bare-bones budget and even nuclear power, in contrast to the Montreal conference and those countries, like China, that are calling for renewables, energy savings and clean alternative sources."
"I repeat: these free-trade policies have proved to be a failure."
"Europe needs a new mission, and it is our duty to find one."
"It needs social cohesion, innovation, environmental quality, a renewed link between the economy and the regions, cooperation, democracy and peace."
"A different Europe is not just possible but is becoming increasingly necessary."
"Mr President, when, in 1999, the Commission President promised us access to agendas and minutes in connection with the Commission’s meetings, officials with excessively centralising tendencies immediately set about putting together new agendas with fewer points, together with distinctly pared down minutes, while the real agendas and the most complete minutes remained secret for a number of years."
"The Prodi Commission also promised us a comprehensive annual programme, stating the legal basis for every individual piece of draft legislation."
"The countries also agreed to let the national parliaments check specifically whether the principle of subsidiarity was being observed and have the opportunity of showing the yellow card within six weeks. Moreover, a public debate on the annual programme would then take place in each individual parliament."
"The Danish Parliament went further and wanted to allow each individual specialist committee to carry out its own check on compliance with the principle of subsidiarity. This was almost too good to be true, but then, true to form, the officious centralisers in the Commission made it impossible to read the programme."
"No national parliaments can assess what is to happen next year."
"The legal basis has been removed, so it is impossible to see whether the EU is planning a harmless resolution or a binding regulation."
"The proposals are not arranged according to subject, as in budgets and statute books."
"The chapters now invented are called prosperity, solidarity and security."
"All the descriptions have been through an Orwellian office for newspeak, so all future initiatives benefit everyone and inconvenience no one."
"Every year, between 2 000 and 4 000 pieces of draft legislation are adopted, but the annual programme has only included 32 such pieces and 64 other proposals in the annual programme."
"One hundred and eighty-two other pieces of draft legislation and 295 other initiatives have also been mentioned."
"Why may we not see everything the Commission intends to propose for the coming year?"
"Again, Mr Barosso, let us have a complete and detailed work programme, arranged chapter by chapter and stating the legal basis for each individual proposal."
"Let us see it set out on the Internet and get the debate under way on what we cannot decide on effectively ourselves and are therefore trying to resolve through the EU or other international fora."
"That debate is a very practical one, but can only be serious if it is based on the full and unadorned annual programme."
"Mr President, whilst the Commission talks in its programme about, and I quote, ‘closing the communication gap’ and, and I quote again, ‘strengthening the democratic foundations of the European project’, in practice, we have to conclude that all of this remains theory and that this selfsame Commission very often pursues a policy that is fundamentally undemocratic."
"The way in which the accession negotiations with Turkey are being rammed down the European public’s throat, despite their lack of any democratic legitimacy whatever, is a case in point."
"By way of a second example, it is striking how the Commission rejects the common initiative of members of national parliaments right across the European Union in favour of the systematic testing of legislative proposals by reference to the subsidiarity principle."
"The Commission regards this system as comparable to nothing other than the familiar yellow-card system for which the European Constitution provided."
"Consequently, the Commission says that that system, together with the European Constitution, has died a quiet death and that we no longer need to concern ourselves with it."
"When it does suit the Commission, though, other documents of the former European Constitution secretly resurface and are even made legally binding."
"Accordingly, the regulation on the Fundamental Rights Agency states that this institution is competent to apply the Charter of Fundamental Rights and that Member States must respect those fundamental rights when EU law is applied."
"This strange Charter of Fundamental Rights is a kind of Bon Marché or Ikea catalogue that entitles everything and everyone to all manner of things, which makes it a particularly dangerous vehicle."
"It ought, ordinarily, to have been buried along with the European Constitution, but instead, and by a secret route, the Commission has made it binding."
"If the Commission would like to do more than pay lip service to strengthening democracy, it will need to fundamentally change its working practices."
"Mr President, first I want to thank the representatives of the political parties for their comments and reactions today."
"This is the second time the plenary sitting of the European Parliament has considered the Commission’s 2006 work programme, and I hope that both sides will become a bit wiser as a result of this procedure."
"Let me say a few words about the process."
"I think it is worth recalling that the current Commission sets its objectives over a five-year period, and a single annual work programme cannot encompass everything that we wish to achieve under our mandate."
"Some things will need to be reserved for inclusion in the work programmes in 2007 and beyond."
"I remind Members that it is always possible to make an adjustment to the work programme in the mid-term review."
"This so-called catalogue of additional items, which has been and will be communicated regularly to the European Parliament, contains information on issues of particular concern to Members, which some of you have mentioned today, that are not necessarily addressed in the priority list."
"The Commission has greatly appreciated the new process of involving committees in identifying priorities and discussing the Commission’s work programme."
"It is now taking shape in a more serious way, so that we get into the political priorities and have a real political discussion, which will be very helpful in the future."
"In response to Mr Swoboda’s remarks, the Commission will discuss the review of the sustainable development strategy in its meeting this afternoon."
"This represents an integrated approach to the objectives of economic prosperity, environmental standards and social cohesion."
"This approach is built on the idea that these policy areas are mutually supportive."
"We continue to pay full attention to social issues."
"The work programme includes a green paper on the evolution of labour law, which is expected to launch a wide debate, in which the EU institutions, Member States, social partners and experts will participate."
"The aim is to establish conclusions about the main trends in the recent evolution of labour law, both at EU and national level."
"It will also identify the most crucial and urgent issues to be addressed."
"A communication on social services of general interest is still planned for 2006."
"I also underline that the Commission, by giving such priority to the renewed Lisbon Strategy, shows a strong commitment to a Europe of solidarity, accompanied by prosperity and employment."
"We will continue to put every effort into an effective and credible action by Member States and all stakeholders."
"Without a collective effort, the strategy on growth and jobs cannot succeed."
"The credibility of our work depends on detailed preparation, including the necessary consultation of stakeholders and the carrying-out of impact assessments, which I know is also of interest to the European Parliament."
"I would also like to underline the importance of the Commission’s dialogue with the other institutions during the preparation of the 2006 work programme."
"The many contacts we have had with the European Parliament in the context of the new framework agreement have provided a valuable insight into Parliament’s expectations of the Commission for the coming year."
"When the work programme was being prepared, Parliament presented the Commission with an important list of priorities."
"We have also had very constructive contact with the Conference of Presidents in the context of implementing Plan D. I know that both our institutions are committed to realising its objectives."
"I take note of the comments you have made today on the Commission’s 2006 work programme."
"The Commission will examine your resolution with great interest and respond accordingly."
"Let me again mention my appreciation of the fruitful cooperation we have had in 2005."
"I look forward to building on it in 2006 to make sure that our work programme is implemented with determination and success."
"I also thank you for the comments on the EEA report, which I was pleased to be able to present."
"We know the content of that report very well and it has to be taken into account."
"I think that, when it comes to combating climate change, the Commission is showing leadership on the world scene."
"I do not see any other partner today playing the same role."
"Of course, we will continue to strive to ensure the Commission upholds this important role."
"We will have to lead the way on this particular issue as well."
"– I have received three motions for a resolution(1) in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, Tuesday, at 12 noon."
"The next item is the vote."
"Mr President, we had proposed an oral amendment but we will withdraw it now because we are satisfied, for the time being, with the statement of the European Commission, yesterday evening, that it is committed to fighting all forms of discrimination in all Member States and that it is prepared to urge all Member States to allocate the financial resources accordingly."
"However, we will keep a close eye on the Commission and the execution of this programme."
"We will talk to the Commission again, should it not live up to this promise."
"Under that condition, we withdraw the oral amendment."
"Mr President, I wish to ask for clarification."
"You stated that Amendments 1 and 2, which we voted on by roll call, had been rejected, but you also said that we needed a qualified majority."
"I have counted the votes against, and 328 votes do not add up to a qualified majority."
"I ask you to clarify which procedure we are now using."
"Amendments 1 and 2 were put to the vote by roll call."
"309 Members voted in favour, but we need 367 votes in favour, under qualified majority, for them to be adopted."
". Mr President, I should like to thank my colleagues from the various political groups who have worked so hard and effectively to achieve today’s first-reading compromise package with the Council and the Commission: in particular, Mrs Wallis, Mr Wieland, Mr Lehne, and Mrs Berger from my own political group."
"The UK Presidency has been very cooperative and has taken on board many of Parliament’s amendments, which allows us now to vote on this first reading package of the general enacting terms of the European payment order."
"That will now help us to speed up and simplify cross-border payments for business."
"It will also assist debt recovery."
"In short, we know that companies that do not get paid are at risk of collapsing, with knock-on effects for staff and suppliers."
"A lack of enforcement systems for payment undermines the internal market and business confidence."
"There are, however, some outstanding technical issues involved in drawing up the annexes and finalising our recitals that need to be resolved with the Austrian Presidency."
"In addition, Mrs Wallis has asked us to look at a technical legal issue related to the ‘cross-border’ definition."
"I look forward to working with the Austrian Presidency and finalising this very pragmatic law that will assist businesses and citizens in recovering debts, and to a full plenary debate with the Council and Commission and a vote in the New Year."
"I urge Members, therefore, to vote for the agreed negotiated package that is before us today at first reading."
"Mr President, I should like through you to ask Mr Pomés Ruiz why, of the eight or ten people he nominated, only one could be a woman."
"Your question speaks for itself, Mr Evans."
". Mr President, let us hope that the Member States, who have proposed the members of the Court of Auditors, will bear in mind that there should be a better balance between male and female citizens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, under Rule 168 of the Rules of Procedure, I request that the Wallis report be referred back to the committee in question immediately, since the procedure followed is not complete."
"Only the conclusions were put to the vote in committee, but not the arguments."
"I call on my fellow Members to support this request, which constitutes significant evidence of transparency and internal democracy."
"Mr Romagnoli, you do not belong to a political group; you are a non-attached Member."
"You are therefore not in a position to make that request."
"It just shows how important it is to belong to a group, especially a large one!"
"That concludes the vote."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of equality and rights, I feel that this Parliament shows a certain intolerance towards opinions that are not to its liking."
"Yesterday I heard a minister of my country’s government and even our supreme court attacked, with many respects paid to the much-extolled independence of the judiciary, because it was considered that certain expressions – which were perhaps disagreeable and perhaps impolite – were definitely offensive."
"Nonetheless, mentioning somebody’s ethnic origin or certain characteristics does not always constitute a crime of racism."
"In this Parliament, however, it seems to be taboo to talk about certain subjects."
"I believe that everyone has the same rights, including the right to freedom of opinion."
"In all 18 reports, the rapporteurs have proposed that the European Parliament be given a role in appointing the various agencies’ Executive Directors and in extending their terms of office."
"Quite apart from the fact that we very much question the justification for many of the agencies, the June List does not share the view that the European Parliament’s influence should be increased in this area, since such an increase would entail greater supranationalism."
"We have thus voted against the reports."
"Mr President, the truth about the Roure report is that it again plays us the same old tune that we have heard for years and that was continually in our ears during the recent immigrant riots in France, namely that the constant problems involving immigrants in our countries are down to us and us alone, to be blamed on the repugnant Europeans who discriminate always and everywhere."
"It is a tune that is also being echoed in this report and that is a far cry from reality."
"If we want to talk about discrimination and lack of equal opportunities in Europe, let us also mention the call from women in the Islamic communities."
"In many suburbs in my own country, in Brussels, for example, women are these days systematically abused or called whores by Islamic immigrants who want to inflict their prejudices on us."
"Let us turn our attention to this, to the time bomb of the multicultural society that puts the basic achievements of our society at risk."
"Mr President, I read in the Roure report that one of the messages to be sent out in the course of 2007, the European Year of Equal Opportunities, is that everyone is entitled to equal treatment."
"The promotion of respect and tolerance is also high on the agenda."
"Given the politically correct tenor of the report and given past experience, I will entertain few illusions about the Commission’s intention to make it clear, to Europe’s Islamic communities in particular, that violence against Jews and discrimination against women are unacceptable."
"A study in 2002 showed, for example, that anti-Semitic behaviour is particularly rife among Muslims."
"Since this is, of course, not in keeping with the politically correct image that we have, this report’s conclusions were confined to the waste paper basket."
"The most prevalent and blatant cases of discrimination are covered up with the mantle of love."
"No one has ever died of hypocrisy, of course."
". The Treaty of Amsterdam represented enormous progress in the fight against discrimination, in that it broadened the concept to areas other than equality between men and women."
"The principle of equality and non-discrimination is one of the core fundamental rights that lie at the heart of the EU."
"This proposal designates 2007 as the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, with the aim of promoting equality and eliminating all forms of discrimination."
"The idea of setting up this initiative was born out of the evaluation of the results of the Green Paper on Equality and Non-Discrimination in an Enlarged European Union."
"It will help to promote three priorities: information and awareness-raising; analysis and monitoring of the impact of anti-discrimination legislation; and networking between the people involved in the fight against discrimination."
"The promotion of equal opportunities is a crucial factor in achieving a more cohesive, competitive and dynamic society, and a means of reaping the benefits of diversity."
"We must therefore spread this kind of awareness-raising initiative in order to combat discriminatory attitudes and to ensure that the citizens are kept informed about their rights and obligations."
"It should act as a kind of campaign to exert pressure on those Member States dragging their feet in transposing the directives."
". At a time when discrimination, inequality and social injustice are on the rise, we welcome the reaffirmation that non-discrimination is a fundamental principle, which must be upheld in all policy areas, be they economic, social or cultural."
"This falls short, however, of what is required in light of the seriousness of the social situation in various EU countries."
"Although the report mentions the need for rights and equal opportunities to be upheld, for broader involvement and for increased knowledge and awareness of rights – ones, we would add, that have been acquired or lost or have yet to be won – it fails to condemn the determining factors behind failure to comply with these principles."
"Workers are currently facing a concerted onslaught against their social rights and gains – an onslaught that is promoted at EU level by means of awareness-raising and propaganda, and by means of the containment measures that are put forward – and the actual impact of the capitalist onslaught will be felt. What we are seeing, in other words, is the most blatant exploitation and the destruction of public services, which are being taken over by private capital, leading in turn to poverty and social injustice."
"The way to ensure equal opportunities is to fight against the policy that undermines them."
".‘Equal opportunities for all."
"Towards a just society.’"
"Who would dare speak out against such a report?"
"It ought even to attract steadfast unanimous support with a title like that."
"The problem is this: where equal opportunities and the fight against discrimination are concerned, we are constantly trying to outdo ourselves."
"Does this report really add anything new aside from the usual litany of concepts and slogans relating to conventional egalitarian thinking and to non-discrimination?"
"In fact, the rapporteur proposes the creation of a European Year of Equal Opportunities for All in 2007, which would be a ‘genuine tool for raising awareness among, and providing information to, the European public’."
"What a departure!"
"Once again, equality is provided for through force and through the introduction of quota systems and of positive discrimination."
"We cannot go along with that because it is a question here of the very denial of equal opportunities and equal treatment."
"We are also against the European Union being able to impose sanctions in the event of a Member State not complying with the provisions laid down in a Community directive."
"It is a question here of national powers and sovereignty in criminal matters; these cannot be restricted or delegated."
". Equal treatment is enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam and is a fundamental right belonging to every citizen."
"In order to take stock of the progress that has been made in fighting discrimination and to gather opinions on how the Union might step up its action in this area, the Commission set up a broad consultation in the form of a Green Paper entitled ‘Equality and Non-Discrimination in an Enlarged EU’ in May 2004."
"This Green Paper gave rise to the idea of setting up a ‘European Year of Equal Opportunities for All’ in 2007, an initiative with four objectives, namely to raise public awareness, to encourage debate, to celebrate diversity and to promote respect and tolerance."
"The EU now has legislation in the field of combating discrimination, yet many citizens do not know that such legislation exists or know little about it."
"As such, I welcome a media event on the scale of a ‘European Year’ being organised, in that it is an excellent tool for raising awareness among, and providing information to, the European public."
"The European Year is also a means of exerting pressure on Member States that are dragging their feet in terms of transposing directives on equality."
". While it is true that, from a legal point of view, discrimination – on whatever grounds – is being comprehensively combated, it is impossible to confirm with any certainty that all discrimination is being prevented and combated on the ground."
"The Commission believes that a European Year of Equal Opportunities would be a positive step in this regard."
"I have never been keen on big events as a way of resolving problems."
"I have always feared that promoting international years or days for one cause or another might in fact have a detrimental effect, in that they only succeed in offloading ignorance of the problem onto other days and years."
"There is an increasingly widely held view, however, that there is much to be gained from such initiatives in terms of increased visibility for the cause in question."
"I believe that the subject of the event dealt with in this report falls into that category and accordingly voted in favour."
". As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I welcome Mrs Roure’s outstanding report."
"Since, the ‘Eurodac’ and ‘Dublin II’ regulations are not part of the development of the Schengen , Denmark cannot resort to an opt-in to participate in those regulations."
"Hence the need for an international agreement between the Community and Denmark, along with a Protocol to the Agreement between the Community, Iceland and Norway."
"These proposals are aimed at extending to Denmark the provisions of the Eurodac system and the procedure for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application."
"This is a welcome step, although such agreements should be concluded under special circumstances and for a limited period of time."
"These situations raise major question marks regarding the differing guarantees which asylum seekers will enjoy depending on whether their asylum application is dealt with in Denmark or in one of the countries participating in the European asylum policy. This is because Denmark will be implementing these two regulations but staying outside of other measures in this area."
"I share the rapporteur’s view that the applicable legal basis should be the second subparagraph of Article 300(3), namely that Parliament should have been consulted under the assent procedure."
". This proposal warrants our agreement."
"The activities of the different fleets of the Member States operating under the fisheries agreements and protocols between the EU and third countries should not be interrupted for administrative reasons, such as the lengthy negotiations and the legal ratification procedures to which those agreements are subject."
"These interruptions often last several months, which means that vessels lie idle, fishermen are unemployed, and problems are created in the supply of fisheries products at national and Community level."
"This proposal makes it possible for third countries to issue fishing licences on the date laid down in the exchange of letters between the two parties, even if the Council decision has yet to be adopted."
"We hope that this proposal will enter into force at the earliest opportunity, and that its implementation will ensure that the fleets can remain in operation or at least that the current periods of inactivity will become shorter."
"In any event, it should not be the fishermen who foot the bill for the lengthy negotiations and renewal of agreements. Mechanisms for economic and social compensation should be put in place so that the fishermen can survive."
". I welcome the report before us for two reasons."
"Firstly, it is clearly much-needed in order that administrative and bureaucratic difficulties do not exacerbate the problems facing the fishing industry."
"The other reason why I have lent my backing to this report is that, as the rapporteur says, this entire process is excessively bureaucratic, inefficient and unjustified."
"I would even go so far as to say that this whole plethora of agreements and provisional licences, implemented by means of a terribly cumbersome mechanism, verges on the Kafkaesque in its absurdity."
"I therefore agree with the rapporteur that the situation is ripe for review."
"The competitiveness of a European industry such as fisheries must not be constrained by the bureaucratic inefficiency of the Community’s institutions."
"The EU has an important role to play in strengthening democracy and human rights in the countries in its immediate neighbourhood."
"Enlargement contributes to this positive development."
"We are therefore voting in favour of Mrs Malmström’s report."
"We are, however, opposed to the attempt to use the EU’s Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument for strengthening and developing the common foreign and security policy."
"Nor do we believe that the instruments should be used for extending the EU’s sphere of interest to areas that cannot be described as its neighbourhood."
". The goodwill and good intentions underpinning the programme under discussion are naturally worthy of my support."
"As for whether or not it is being implemented effectively, I must say I have my doubts."
"Nevertheless, given that we are discussing a provisional programme, I feel that our priority in shaping the future European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) should be the timely adoption of this programme, with the new framework with which it is now equipped. Our efforts should also be channelled into revising and, more importantly, evaluating past programmes."
"The EU’s external policy, which is at the root of this issue, must work efficiently, and one can only discover whether efficiency is being achieved by examining results."
"This should therefore be one of our major priorities in the coming legal steps taken on this matter."
"Mr President, one of the important objectives of European environmental policy is the prompt introduction into the EU of systems for collecting batteries."
"It is unfortunate that Amendment 26 was not accepted, and the target we are now setting ourselves is a certainly less ambitious one."
"The fact is, though, that the introduction of recycling quotas will enable us to achieve very high environmental standards, and we will be able to reuse raw materials."
"The bans on nickel, cadmium and lead are also means towards this end, enabling us to exert pressure in favour of the replacement of hazardous substances, while nonetheless allowing a small number of exceptions."
". UKIP cannot support amendments that are tabled with the purpose of increasing restrictions on Member States."
"UKIP take environmental issues very seriously, however, we cannot accept that the EU impose legislation on Member States and believe these decisions should be taken at national level."
". On Amendments 1 and 2 to the Blokland report on batteries and accumulators, I have decided to vote in favour of a single environmental legal base of Article 175 EC."
"As with the debate on the fluorinated gases regulation, although this is a less clear cut example, I have concerns about the lack of certainty we are introducing into our legislation through dual legal bases following ECJ judgments in this area."
"What industry needs more than anything is legal certainty and, given the precedent case law, this is not the direction in which we are going."
"Article 175 has inbuilt safeguards (in Article 176 EC) against unilateral trade distorting decisions that may be protectionist in nature rather than environmentally justifiable."
"It is not necessary to complicate EC legislation further by founding it on multiple legal bases."
". I support the views and objectives of the batteries directive, but two points must be borne in mind."
"First, recycling targets must be realistic and achievable and practical for both retailers and the public, which is why I did not support some amendments tabled by the rapporteur and others."
"Second, it is clear that nickel-cadmium batteries only contribute between 1% and 3% of cadmium in the environment compared to 27% from fertilizers."
"The drive to outlaw them seems driven by a refusal to confront this statistic in the interests of certain national battery manufacturers and the inability to confront public misconceptions as to the real situation of cadmium pollution."
"I have no problem burdening industry where there are real advantages to improving environmental standards, but such perverse decisions like today's only threatens support for future environmental legislation and public support."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety makes it clear that the purpose of this directive is, in the first place, to limit the use of heavy metals in batteries and accumulators."
"The position of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety contains clear priorities and clarifies the objectives of the directive."
"The June List supports EU efforts regarding cross-border environmental issues."
"Heavy metal emissions are one such issue."
"We have thus voted in favour of this report and, overall, we support the position of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on this issue."
"We are not, however, in favour of individual amendments."
"We are, for example, critical of the European Parliament’s stating that public information campaigns on the collection and recycling of batteries should be conducted and of its putting forward views on how such campaigns are to be paid for (Amendment 33)."
"We have every confidence that the Member States are capable independently of meeting the requirements laid down by the directive."
"Individual Member States must decide whether information campaigns, research or other measures are needed in order to achieve this aim."
"Mr President, I voted in the way that I did on various amendments on the Blokland report on batteries, accumulators and their waste because I believe that this directive will reduce heavy metal waste from batteries and improve recycling in my London constituency."
"I support the prohibitions in the common position and believe that any further prohibitions must be the subject of full impact assessments."
"I also believe that recycling targets should be realistic and achievable and collection systems practicable for retailers and the public and cannot therefore support some of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and other colleagues."
". I voted in favour of this report, which forms part of a balanced approach to environmental protection, consumer protection and the promotion of energy efficiency."
"Of all the aspects mentioned in the report there is one that deserves particular focus."
"I am generally in favour of a free and open economy in which there is complete access to information – or at least in which such access is promoted – given that consumers only have true freedom of choice when they are provided with information."
"This report prioritises the provision of information to consumers, and that led me to vote in favour."
".I voted in favour of the adoption of a new European directive on batteries and accumulators and on the management of their waste."
"This is a text with a twin objective in an area in which the disparities between the 25 Member States are huge: on the one hand, to make batteries and accumulators cleaner by substantially restricting any traces of heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury in them and, on the other, more effectively to organise the collection and recycling of these products."
"Belgium can, I might add, take pride in a system serving as a model in Europe: the country has a 59% collection rate, where a large number of Member States are languishing at rates below 10%."
"By drawing inspiration from the successful experiments carried out by the Member States, this directive sets ambitious targets in terms of collection: 40% after six years and 60% in ten years’ time."
"These are targets that cannot be achieved without a balanced policy taking account of the economic chain from every angle and including in the economic chain’s scope each and every actor: from the producer to the consumer, via the distributors."
"This is a basic rule so that, in future, we can produce better and collect more in Europe, for the sake of the environment and consumers."
". The soon-to-be-repealed Directive 91/157/EEC, which sets targets for the recovery and disposal of accumulators, formed part of the body of environmental legislation incorporated into the accession treaties following negotiations."
"The European Commission is currently proposing that a new system be put in place for the collection, processing and neutralisation of battery and accumulator waste."
"Poland has transposed the provisions of the previous Directive into national legislation, and is now in the process of implementing it."
"All of a sudden, however, new solutions are being proposed and collection targets being set that are much higher than before."
"There can be no question that this is the right way to guarantee safety and to make the environment in Europe cleaner, but this process should be compatible with the solutions that have been implemented to date."
"It is an unfortunate fact that most of the rapporteur’s amendments are not backed up by any studies or assessments of the impact that the new directive will have on business development in this sector."
"After all, it is business owners who will bear the costs of introducing the new legislation."
"The majority of Member States will find it impossible to achieve the collection targets proposed in Amendments 26 and 27 of the report."
"The new Member States are still at the stage of putting in place complex schemes for spent battery collection, pursuant to the Directive."
"There is no rational explanation for collection targets of 40% and 60% at the present time, and the proposal to increase the recycling target to 55% is equally intolerable and unjustified."
"Moreover, schemes for effective battery collection necessarily involve awareness raising and the fostering of a culture of battery collection at grassroots level."
"What this means is that a long-term approach is needed when proposing new solutions."
". There is no doubt that we need to reduce pollution from batteries and improve recycling of batteries."
"Nickel-cadmium batteries are particularly polluting."
"The compromise on nickel-cadmium is realistic giving a four-year breathing space before a full ban would be introduced."
"This would mean that the power tool industry would have time to introduce alternatives which are less polluting."
"I hope that there will be no headlines tomorrow saying that the EU bans power tools."
"Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I am relieved that the outcome regarding the energy services directive improved in negotiations with the Council."
"The Council thus adopted a realistic approach to the proposals by Parliament and the Commission."
"I hoped that this directive would be an opportunity to correct the distortions of competition which the failed emissions trading directive entails."
"I opposed common savings targets binding on all Member States right to the last, because I saw them as punishing countries where energy savings measures had already been practised for a long time."
"It is perhaps paradoxical, but when we treat Member States the same way, we give them unequal status."
"For some, the Commission’s proposed target was actually quite tough, while for others it was ridiculously easy."
"It would have been a competition-distorting factor in the single market."
"A criterion of savings measures now is cost-effectiveness, which gives Member States some much needed leeway."
"This is my interpretation of the outcome."
"Now there will not be any over-prioritisation of measures: instead, voluntary agreements, for example, could also be employed."
"The final outcome will also carry a risk, however, if the comitology procedure does not adhere to reason and fairness as the guiding principle."
"There is a risk of excessive bureaucracy."
"The method by which we should start to calculate savings needs to be fair and flexible, and it should above all treat fairly those countries where savings have already been made for years."
"The compromise for which the House voted was a step back from the initial proposals, although attempts to achieve greater energy end-use efficiency are to be welcomed. We therefore backed the measures that sought to implement that objective effectively."
"The final proposal acknowledges the key role that the public sector can play in this area, for example by setting up energy efficiency pilot projects, awarding public contracts, establishing energy efficiency criteria and, in its investments, offering incentives for meeting energy efficiency improvement targets. Nevertheless, it places the accent on free competition."
"Accordingly, our decision to abstain from the final vote was based on our objection to Amendment 60, which as much as anything is entirely out of place."
"We cannot accept that, when it comes to energy efficiency, the accent is placed on market liberalisation, as in the report, which emphasises ‘equal competition and a level playing field for all energy suppliers’."
"We feel that this is a key sector in which the State should remain the key player."
"We have voted against all the amendments since we do not believe that the European Parliament should have views on the actual way in which energy is to be saved in the Member States."
"This matter is best dealt with by the Member States themselves."
"."
"The EU must be more proactive when it comes to energy efficiency, both from the point of view of being true to its word and its stance on environmental issues, as in Kyoto, and in terms of economic and environmental common sense."
"In areas such as this, the emphasis should, to my mind, be placed on efficiency and common sense. These should be the very cornerstones of our environmental and energy policies."
". Draft amending budget No 8/2005, amended by the amending letter of 16 November 2005, is worrying because it cancels the original extra payment request of EUR 650 million for the Structural Funds – bearing in mind that EUR 380 million had already been obtained via transfers from other headings – and cuts the same amount from aid in respect of agricultural markets."
"The alarming part is that the appropriations used and the few applications received from the new Member States fall way short of full use of the structural appropriations available. Indeed, we are nearing the end of the current financial framework and the so-called N+2 rule will apply, whereby authorisation expenses are automatically cancelled when they are not implemented within two years."
"The return of own resources to the Member States will rise to around EUR 3.9 billion, which will naturally benefit the main net contributors."
"What we want to see is conditions put in place for complete, effective implementation of the Structural Funds. These returns will once again make it possible to tackle the constraints imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact, thereby helping to reduce deficits in some countries."
". In this vote I abstained on Amendment 11 because of London constituency concerns."
".The proposed procedure reveals some significant legal shortcomings."
"The procedure takes place in two stages:"
"1."
"Firstly, after a request has been made, the judge issues a European payment notification to be served on the debtor, who has three weeks in which to submit a statement of defence."
"2."
"Secondly, in the absence of a statement of defence, a European order for payment is delivered."
"According to the authors, this two-pronged approach is justified by the potential risk involved in issuing an irreversible claim at the outset."
"In aiming to simplify the procedure and to safeguard the debtor’s rights, it would therefore seem wiser to keep just the one stage, that is to say to provide for the delivery of the European order for payment at the outset and to make it enforceable."
"In return:"
"- the time limit for lodging a statement of opposition must be extended;"
"- and this time limit must only begin when the debtor has actually received the notification."
"That is why we reject Amendment 12, which allows a defendant to be sentenced without his or her being able to know the decision."
"Finally, the choice proposed in Amendment 20 between the notice being served by a bailiff or being delivered by post should not exist."
"The notice must be served by a bailiff, given the flaws in the postal systems in certain countries, such as France."
". There is enormous economic benefit to be gained from simplifying and speeding up procedures, as countries that benefit from legal systems that are both replete with safeguards and prompt are well aware."
"A European procedure for issuing payment orders is a step forward in this regard, because it would promote greater legal certainty in business transactions and better justice, as proven by similar national instruments."
"As various Member States have said, however, there is a need to ensure that the remit of such a procedure would not go beyond what is reasonable and feasible in terms of cooperation between sovereign Member States."
"With the above in mind, I voted in favour."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider that a grave injustice has been committed today in not upholding Mr Gollnisch’s immunity, since – and I will not go into the merits of what he said – he was speaking as a Member of the European Parliament."
"We ought to be protected – and I deliberately say ‘we ought to be’ rather than ‘we are’ – when we speak as Members of this Parliament, regardless of what we say."
"This would not be the first time that a Member had enjoyed protection when speaking, writing or intervening outside Parliament."
"That has not applied in Mr Gollnisch’s case, however, probably not because of what he said but because of his political affiliation, which is disliked by someone who has forgotten that all of us in this House have equal dignity and equal rights."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have democratically and transparently succeeded in extracting a few seconds from you in the only way possible for a Member who does not belong to one of the so-called large groups."
"That does not remove the fact that the instrument of parliamentary immunity should be subject to very different rules."
"What I said before is a very serious matter, and all Members, irrespective of the ideas and political aims that they represent, should bear it very much in mind. What is happening today to Mr Gollnisch – just because he dared to make statements with which others did not agree during a debate in which he was speaking as a Member of this House – could happen to them one day."
"It is disgraceful."
"Mr President, I voted against the suspension of Mr Gollnisch’s parliamentary immunity, regarding as I do his prosecution as an undisguised attempt at character assassination waged against one who is a non-conformist both as a Member of this House and as an academic."
"Free expression of opinion is guaranteed by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 19 of the Charter of Human Rights and Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights – something that the majority in this House has evidently forgotten."
"Mr Gollnisch addressed a political press conference in Lyons on 11 October 2004, and he did so, self-evidently, as a politician who is first and foremost a Member of the European Parliament."
"One may well find the historical statements he made on that occasion reprehensible, but they were of course made in his capacity as a Member of the European Parliament, and as such he ought, under the terms of every law on the subject, to enjoy the protection of immunity."
"Mr President, parliamentary immunity is designed to protect Members’ freedom of expression."
"According to the settled case-law of the European Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs, therefore, it is laid down as a basic principle that, when the actions for which a Member has been criticised form part of his or her political role or are directly linked to it, then immunity is not withdrawn."
"That includes – again, according to this case-law – the expression of opinions said to be closely bound up with a Member’s political activity, opinions that are voiced at demonstrations, at public meetings, in the context of political publications, in the press, in a book, on the television and even before a court of law."
"In our colleague’s, Mr Gollnisch’s, case, there is no doubt whatsoever that this well-defined case-law has been unfairly circumvented in this House."
"Mr Gollnisch is in the wrong where the law is concerned because he is in the political minority."
"You have a ‘variable-geometry’ take on the law."
"What are you doing in this place where the values and the principles of democracy and of the law are embraced?"
"Because the parliamentary immunity of our colleague, Mr Gollnisch, has not been defended today, this Assembly is unworthy of the principles it proclaims – unworthy of them, and unjust!"
"Mr President, the majority of this Parliament has just decided, for political reasons, not to defend my immunity."
"I do, however, note with satisfaction that my defence was supported by a large number of fellow Members not belonging to my political group, and I am all the more satisfied because all of the allegations featured in Mrs Wallis’ preliminary draft report have disappeared, as was insisted on by the majority of the committee, no doubt to ease its conscience."
"This decision was taken for an absurd and unusual reason: I am alleged to have voiced my opinion outside the context of my parliamentary activities, something that is untrue."
"In the current political circumstances, though, the fact that I have succeeded in eliminating all the passages that might have been hostile to me in relation to the content of my remarks is a semi-victory."
"With hypocrisy being the homage vice pays to virtue, I consider the procedural trick used by my political opponents to be the proof of the awkward position they are in – ‘awkward’ being a weak term – in relation to the content of this matter."
"The fact remains that all this comes at the very time when a large number of voices, including those of Mr de Villepin, Mr Chirac and …"
"You have had one minute, Mr Gollnisch."
"These explanations of vote are for one minute only."
"One of the remarks you made and for which your immunity has been lifted was 'it is up to historians to discuss whether the gas chambers existed'."
"That remark encourages me once again to go and visit the camp of Natzweiler-Struthof in the Vosges mountains, which I shall do in January."
"This is not the , Mr Gollnisch."
"It is the European Parliament."
"The floor now goes to Mr Vanhecke."
"Mr President, I am, quite frankly, disgusted by the idea of this House, in the present circumstances, awarding the Sakharov Prize given the level of hypocrisy, because not only does lifting Mr Gollnisch’s parliamentary immunity bring shame on this House, it is also detrimental to democracy."
"We need not even go into the detail of the matter, because anyone who calls himself a democrat must in the first place hold dear the right of free expression of opinion on the part of all those with whom they disagree."
"This House has a habit of upholding parliamentary immunity; that Mr Gollnisch’s is now being lifted is something I find frightening."
"Clearly, the world is not yet rid of the Robespierres, the Freislers, the Berias and their cowardly accomplices in this House."
"Mr President, I have voted against the Wallis report because it goes against the tradition that Parliament does not address the question of whether immunity should be lifted where opinions constituting an offence are expressed, or are alleged to have been expressed."
"If we go down this road, we might as well abolish the concept of parliamentary immunity itself."
"Mr President, this report, which concludes that the immunity of our colleague, Mr Gollnisch, should not be upheld, disregarded all of the general principles related to privileges and immunity, as well as the settled case-law of the competent committees."
"The report also engaged in an out-and-out witch hunt, thus conveying the position of the French judicial and political authorities, because there was no reason at all why Mr Gollnisch should not have made the remarks he did about the Second World War at the press conference held after the summer recess."
"They were improperly and scandalously taken out of context."
"If these same remarks had, in actual fact, been made by someone else, they would not have provoked an outcry; they would not even have been revisited."
"Proof of this was recently provided by Mr Chirac, the French Head of State."
"This entire matter has all the hallmarks of sordid political manipulation, with the sole aim of removing an irreproachable man from the political scene."
"I should like to point out that I find Mr Gollnisch’s remarks offensive."
".At a press conference held on 11 October 2004, Mr Gollnisch made remarks seemingly questioning the existence of the gas chambers."
"These crimes are nevertheless historical facts."
"To deny or to dispute this is a crime."
"It is up to French law to give its verdict in accordance with the Gayssot law, which forbids public speeches disputing the existence of crimes against humanity."
"Obviously, freedom of expression must be guaranteed for a Member of Parliament."
"Yet, the issue at stake in this vote is that of bringing a man, a university lecturer, face to face with his responsibilities."
"That is why I will vote in favour of withdrawing Mr Gollnisch’s parliamentary immunity."
"For the very large majority of MEPs, this vote conveys a message: revisionism has no place in the Europe of ‘never again’."
".Bizarrely, a crucial aspect of the affair of our colleague, Mr Gollnisch, which was nonetheless present in the first three drafts of Mrs Wallis’ report, has disappeared in the final version."
"This point refers to ."
"This is the presumption that criminal proceedings are brought about with the intention of prejudicing the Member’s political activity."
"One of the principles of the European Parliament is that immunity is not withdrawn when there is a suspicion that the motive behind the criminal proceedings is the intention to prejudice the Member’s political activity."
"Well, evidence of such nevertheless abounds in this affair."
"It is not a question here of simple guesswork."
"The intrusion of political power in this matter is evident in the intervention of the then Minister for Justice, Mr Perben, who is a direct political opponent of Mr Gollnisch, given that Mr Perben is standing in the municipal elections in Lyon."
"It is he who personally ordered the start of proceedings, even though the investigation had cleared Mr Gollnisch."
"The Attorney General of Lyon acknowledged this in a communiqué issued at the time by the entire press corps."
"It is therefore unclear why the rapporteur ultimately ruled out this ."
"It emerges, however, from the facts and the circumstances of this affair that the measures taken by the judicial authorities are aimed at hindering the political activity of this Member."
"Mr President, our concern, in the Fourtou report, was with events in Spain, and specifically in the region of Valencia, where many European citizens have felt themselves very unfairly treated in consequence of poorly-framed regional legislation and its faulty interpretation on the part of the regional, local and state authorities."
"It is to be welcomed that the Valencian regional authorities have taken a very cooperative attitude towards and are even now amending the law."
"The new law is in the process of being drafted."
"We should make it plain that the European Parliament is not competent to deal with the annulment of poorly-drafted local legislation."
"We must, of course, intervene in those cases in which European law is affected, but this House is not responsible for everything."
"Mr President, I shall make three observations and a final comment."
"Since many of the amendments drawn up by the rapporteur have been rejected, the report that we have just voted on contains certain absurdities which this Parliament cannot ignore."
"Paragraph six, as it is now worded, and not as it should have been worded according to the rapporteur’s report, obliges the national and regional legislator to introduce a series of specific actions which fall within their exclusive competence."
"I am not invoking the principle of subsidiarity here: this is a clear encroachment of competences."
"This is also true of the , which is intended to suspend the application of a legitimate law, approved by a legitimate regional parliament and not invalidated by the Constitutional Court: this is a blatant encroachment of competences by this Parliament."
"Secondly, recital J, also contrary to the amendment by the rapporteur, and on the instigation of the Spanish Socialists, refers to the existence of illegal actions."
"As the President knows, under any rule of law, any action as a result of illegal actions must be applied, determined and enforced by a court, in accordance with a very ancient principle: ."
"UKIP MEPs have voted against this report - not because they do not have sympathy and understanding for those property owners in Valencia who have been deprived of their property rights under an unfair law - but because they strongly disagree with the EU Charter for Human Rights which does not have legal force but is used as an argument in the report for EU intervention in this matter."
"Land development issues in the autonomous region of Valencia are not a matter for the European Parliament or the European Union at all. To judge from the report, all political issues come within the responsibility of the EU institutions."
"This means that the Member States’ elected assemblies, different kinds of elected regional assembly and quite a few of the local assemblies elected by popular vote could be ridden roughshod over."
"We are voting against this report."
"I do not believe that the EU should interfere in the way in which a country conducts its detailed planning."
"In this case, the Green politicians of the country concerned have, however, appealed to me to vote in favour of such intervention, since their democracy is under threat."
"Building contractors are bribing politicians and not bothering about either legislation or democracy, and my colleagues believe that attention must be drawn to the problem outside the country if there is to be any reaction from the establishment."
"I am therefore voting in favour of the opinion concerning the petition signed by 15 000 people and delivered to Parliament."
"This does not, however, mean that I want the conclusions to become legislation applicable throughout the EU."
". We as a group refute that the EU can continue in this way outside the remit of any treaty which would open jurisprudential breaches in order to ingest itself in town and urban policies, architectural issues of member states and the financial situations of property owners and renters."
"In any case it is illegal to give legal character contraining to a text of a political nature."
"(Consideration L) This is why we have voted against this report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just voted on the Bersani report, which I, as shadow rapporteur, had a part in guiding through this House."
"The report represents a good compromise between those who want the European Union to have more powers in fiscal affairs, and those who do not, be it in relation to the tax base for businesses or to the rate at which businesses are taxed."
"Even while we were voting, though, I was informed that the European Court of Justice has handed down a ruling in the case of Marks [amp] Spencer."
"The situation now is that this company, in the United Kingdom, can, by way of consolidation, consolidate gains and losses from Europe, and the United Kingdom will have to pay the firm tens of millions."
"I do not wish to discuss the case’s merits, but only to make it plain that what we want is a single system of law, with laws made, as they are now, by this Parliament and by us as its members."
"Here we have, yet again, a case of law made by judges, the fundamentals of which need to be debated."
"I do not believe that this is what the future of the European Union should be like."
"The delegation supports minimum tax rates and a common consolidated tax base for companies operating in at least two countries."
"A common consolidated tax base and minimum tax rates for companies will make the internal market more efficient and, at the same time, combat the trend towards tax competition, which threatens our social models in Europe."
"The delegation does not consider that the home state taxation principle is a good idea because it can lead to a distortion of competition between neighbouring countries with different tax rules."
". The taxation of undertakings was one of the areas covered by the so-called Monti Package of tax harmonisation measures."
"The adoption of the Lisbon Strategy gave fresh impetus to the idea of an internal market without fiscal obstacles."
"The proposal before us, under Article 94 of the Treaty on the approximation of laws, advocates the creation of a common consolidated corporate tax base."
"The objectives are clear: to remove tax barriers to companies carrying out cross-border transactions and to create conditions in which the large multinational corporations operate within a single regime covering the distribution of dividends and cross-border offsetting of profits and losses, thereby facilitating cross-border restructuring operations and merger and acquisition operations."
"Accordingly, this helps to strengthen the Statute for a European Company, by increasing the possibilities of loopholes through which these companies can escape taxation and failing to prevent tax evasion, which is quite the opposite of what it purports to do."
"In its maximalist approach, Parliament is even considering promoting stronger cooperation, if some Member States do not want to follow this path."
"We have always objected to this path, because it is an attack on the Member States’ tax sovereignty, and because it fails to solve the key problem of work bearing the brunt of the tax burden."
"We therefore voted against this report."
". I welcome the work of the Commission in this area."
"However, I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the EU Technical Working Group which has been set up to look at this issue by calling for any legislation in this field."
"I believe that the EU must look at all methods of attracting investment and is not convinced that a harmonised tax base will attract further foreign investment particularly to the City of London."
". I am resolute in my belief that tax competition is vital."
"I absolutely reject the assertion that levelling up tax in the direction of harmonisation, can offer any solution to the un-competitiveness of Europe."
"A consolidated tax base would have the effect of placing the fiscal policy of Member States into a straight jacket."
"If a government wanted to kick start an economic activity, through the granting of tax credits for Research and Development, that Member State would have to gain prior approval from the Council under unanimity."
"Is that our vision for Europe?"
"Where a consolidated approach means that the prior approval of all 25 Member States is necessary when formulating domestic fiscal policy?"
"And while Europe busies itself with such decisions, the competitiveness of the global markets will mean investors simply move on."
"That is not my vision for Europe."
"Fiscal flexibility is paramount to improving European competitiveness."
"R[amp]D is one element in the overall mix that determines competitiveness."
"Let us not forget that tax is another."
"And tax competition is healthy."
"According to this report ""the trend towards tax rate competition may lead to a drop in income tax""."
"This is a very short-sighted view, not least because the Polish and Irish examples disprove it."
". The EPLP welcomes the work of the Commission in this area however does not want to pre-empt the outcome of the EU Technical Working Group which has been set up to look at this issue by calling for any legislation in this field."
"The EPLP believes that the EU must look at all methods of attracting investment and is not convinced that a harmonised tax base will attract further foreign investment."
"The EPLP opinion is that this harmonisation of tax base could possibly lead to higher rates, with harmonisation at a later stage which is not desired."
"The EPLP supports enhanced cooperation if Member States wish to pursue this consolidated tax base approach, as long as the proper procedures are followed and precedence is not set for future tax cooperation."
"– The next item is the report (A6-0365/2005) by Mr Alvaro, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the retention of data processed in connection with the provision of public electronic communication services and amending Directive 2002/58/EC [COM(2005)0438 – C6-0293/2005 – 2005/0182(COD)]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the compromise reached on the proposal for a directive that the Commission put forward only three months ago is the outcome of serious, professional, intense work carried out together by the three institutions of the European Union. It is also the result of their joint determination to stand shoulder to shoulder in fighting terrorism and organised crime."
"If, as I sincerely hope, this Parliament comes out in favour of the compromise that has been reached, the 25 European Union Member States will have joint legislation on the retention of telecommunications traffic data. The efforts made by the courts and the police to protect the right of European citizens to security will thus be made more effective."
"That in itself is an important result, an initial but fundamental step towards the gradual harmonisation of national legislations."
"Furthermore, if agreement is reached, it will emphasise the fact that issues of major importance to Europe’s people may now be addressed within a Community framework and no longer an intergovernmental one."
"There will thus be the possibility, or rather the right, for not just the Commission and the Council but also the European Parliament to participate fully on an equal footing. I should like to state publicly here that it was due to Minister Clarke’s personal commitment and brave determination that we reached agreement in the Council on changing the legal basis to a proposal for a directive, as it is now; only a few months ago that did not look at all easy."
"In my view, this result – this compromise – strikes a balance between the need for security and the need for freedom."
"That is a key objective that the Commission and I myself have pursued."
"This compromise meets some of the most important requests made not just by the Council but, above all, by this Parliament during the intense debate of recent months."
"We have taken account of fundamental demands, such as the protection and security of personal data, imposing penalties on the illegal use of retained data, and restricting the application of the directive to serious crimes."
"I also wish to emphasise here in this House, as I have already said to the Council, that it is vital that the principles of necessity and proportionality should always be observed in applying the much talked-about Article 15 of the 2002 directive currently in force."
"These are important results aiming at the protection of the fundamental rights of European citizens, and they comply with the general principles of Europe’s legislative action."
"Mr President, as a closing consideration at this point, I should like to gratefully acknowledge the quality of the work done by this Parliament under difficult circumstances and in a very short time, compared with the average time taken by parliamentary work."
"It must also be recognised that certain aspects of this subject are highly complex in legal, technical and economic terms, and the initial positions on some topics appeared to be substantively very far apart."
"That is precisely why I should like in particular to express my personal gratitude and appreciation for the work of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, in which I took part on several occasions, and of its chairman, Mr Cavada, and rapporteur, Mr Alvaro."
"Mr President, the Commission is thus very pleased with the compromise that has been reached and recommends that the European Parliament support the compromise by accepting particularly Amendments 51 to 92 signed by Mrs Roure and Mr Kreissl-Dörfler for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and by Mr Reul for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"I believe that this consensus can and must go beyond the amendments tabled by the two main groups in the European Parliament, and I am sure that an even broader consensus in Parliament would demonstrate to the people of Europe the full ability of this great institution – and indeed of the three European institutions – to work together to provide tangible answers to our fellow citizens’ demands."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by associating myself very strongly with the sentiments expressed today by my friend, Commission Vice-President Frattini."
"I believe there has been very substantial and constructive work, both between the Council and the Commission and between the Council and Parliament."
"I particularly want to express my appreciation to Mr Cavada and everybody in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, including Mr Alvaro, and the leaders of the groups for the way we have worked to discuss these questions."
"As we come to the end of the UK Presidency, I am very happy to have the opportunity to participate in this debate."
"It has been one of the most important items on our agenda and I hope that we can agree that these proposals represent a chance for all three institutions of Europe, Parliament, the Commission and the Council, to stand united in the face of terrorism and organised crime and to send a message that we are determined to work together to achieve these things."
"I am proud of what has been achieved in this Presidency."
"We have agreed a European Union counter-terrorism strategy."
"We have taken steps to improve the exchange of information for law enforcement."
"We have adopted a strategy to address radicalisation and terrorist recruitment."
"We have established a European Union programme to protect critical infrastructure against terrible attacks."
"We have established a peer evaluation of counter-terrorism practice and development."
"We have adopted a money-laundering directive."
"We have agreed proposals to enhance the sharing of information between law enforcement agencies and we have developed a European plan of action to tackle human trafficking."
"In that context, let me draw attention to the fact that we have also placed the issues of migration much higher up the European Union agenda."
"This is a very substantial range of achievements."
"But I personally attach the greatest importance to the one we are debating today: the aim to achieve common standards for retention of telecommunications data."
"As Mr Frattini said, this has been a frank debate – with everybody ready to participate in discussion – but also a difficult debate, because the issues of principle and the technical issues have not been at all easy to resolve."
"My own commitment has been to listen as widely as possible to the views expressed within Parliament and to discuss with my colleagues in the Council how we can work together."
"To be candid, there was some scepticism in the Council at the idea of going down the course of a first-reading deal and a process of this kind."
"People were not certain that it would be possible to get an agreement."
"That is why today is so important."
"To make the statement that the European Parliament in particular, not just the Council and Commission, commits to proposals in this area seems to me very important."
"The tools we are talking about, the telecommunications data we are describing, are vital to investigate and detect terrorism and crime."
"It is essential, in my view, to provide a proportionate and balanced legal basis for the retention of data that would otherwise be erased or anonymised."
"Variations in data retention practice mean that the ability of investigators and prosecutors to detect and prosecute criminals and terrorists to stop them causing harm, or to catch them after they have caused harm, is dependent on which communications service provider a suspect, a victim or witness has used or which Member State they were in."
"That variation gives an open goal to our opponents in criminality, and it is that we are trying to close with this directive, which I hope we will adopt today."
"We have many examples, some of which I gave to the Civil Liberties Committee in September 2005, where communications data has been used to trace the members of terrorist cells, to help identify murderers and free kidnap victims and to deal with those who organise very serious crime."
"The position of the Council, supported by the Commission, aims to find a compromise between Parliament and the Council, in particular, the need to balance law enforcement needs with individuals’ right to privacy by including specific rules on data protection."
"As amended, the directive would oblige Member States to ensure the retention of data for the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime only."
"This was a call that came specifically from the European Parliament."
"Many told us that we had to ensure that this was limited to serious crime at Community level."
"We have responded to that point in what is being put forward, which the Council accepted."
"On periods of retention, the proposed period in the compromise, six to twenty-four months, represents a compromise between those in the Council, who wanted a much longer maximum period – and there are some in the Council who did not believe in principle that we should legislate on this basis at all – and those in the Parliament, who would have been happier with a shorter retention period."
"I believe the compromise will enable law enforcement authorities to obtain the data they need without disproportionately infringing privacy rights."
"The Presidency took account of concerns expressed by Member States and industry and by some in Parliament about costs, particularly those incurred by storing types of data such as unanswered calls."
"That is why the list of data in the directive has been restricted and why unconnected call data is outside the scope altogether."
"It is also one reason why I supported the commitment, given by the Commission and Council, to regularly review the effectiveness of the application of the directive together with the European Parliament, the European Data Protection Supervisor and representatives of industry."
"This is a fast-moving picture and it is important that all the institutions work together to keep us up to date on the best way to deal with it."
"As I mentioned, the Council also took very seriously the concerns expressed in Parliament about data protection and security."
"That is why the amendments include articles on data protection, data access and sanctions in the event of data abuse."
"I agree entirely with the representations made by the Parliament that data must be kept safe and secure and can only be disclosed lawfully to people lawfully entitled to see it."
"There should not be overall access."
"I know this has been a difficult negotiation and the subject matter is technical and complex."
"I welcome, therefore, the requirement that the Commission must fully evaluate the application of the directive and its impact on industry and consumers."
"Our right to privacy, our right to property, our right to free speech and our right to life are all threatened by terrorists and criminals."
"I believe that, particularly in this democracy, democratic politicians have a duty and responsibility to protect these rights through the kinds of practical measures we are agreeing here."
"I hope we can say at the end of this debate that we have achieved that."
"I believe the Commission’s proposal, as amended by the Council and with the support of Parliament, would secure an instrument which strikes a better balance between the need to retain data to protect our citizens and the need to protect and respect individuals’ privacy."
"We are embracing new technologies that offer great opportunities for learning, for doing business, for communicating."
"But those same technologies can be used and misused by those who do not respect the rights of others, and by their victims too."
"It is right, therefore, that we do all we can to deliver justice and to protect citizens."
"It is what they, our electors, demand of us and it is why we must act, proportionately and democratically, of course, but hopefully with unity."
"I am pleased that tomorrow Parliament as a whole has its chance to express its view on the proposal for a directive."
"The Commission, in Mr Frattini’s excellent contribution, has already indicated its support."
"The Council gives its support."
"If you, the Parliament, also give your support, we can celebrate an historic achievement, which will send a powerful message to all European Union citizens about both our determination and our ability to combat terrorism and serious crime and the importance of the European Parliament in that fight."
"I believe the message that would send would be important in its own right, but it will also be important for the future arrangements within the European Union as to how we develop these questions in a positive and constructive way."
"I conclude by again thanking all my colleagues in Parliament, many of whom are in the Chamber now, for the very friendly, positive, thoughtful and constructive approach they have taken in trying to debate these matters."
"I believe that your wisdom can take us to a new frontier of fighting crime, criminality and terrorism for the European Union as a whole."
". Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Clarke, I am glad of your presence here, and also of that of the distinguished colleagues with whom I have had the privilege of working for over a year."
"You cannot, however, expect me to be jumping for joy, since the line I take differs from the one you have just put forward."
"For a start, I do not believe that we ever really had a decision to take on which legal basis was actually being considered, for that is obvious; there are treaties that spell it out in black and white."
"Moreover, the Commission also brought in a proposal, under Article 95, for a directive that would have required codecision by this House."
"To celebrate getting something that is rightfully ours is something I regard as derogatory to the dignity of this House, but, fair enough, I dare say that others take a different view."
"Speaking personally, I believe that we knew perfectly well what we were letting ourselves in for, and we know from the legal services – including the Council’s own – that the Council would not have been well advised to take a decision."
"We also know that there was no unanimity at Council level, and so it made perfectly good tactical sense for unanimity to be established here in this House."
"I also wish to dispute much of the substance of what you said."
"The decisions we took in Committee were taken together, without regard to party allegiances, and sometimes unanimously, and the amendments we drafted were excellent."
"A final vote of 33 to 8 with 5 abstentions accurately reflects the position taken by the second-largest committee of this House, and the only one of its constituent bodies to take a decision on the matter."
"I take a different view where the time limits for storage are concerned, but you know that."
"I have travelled a much greater distance and have gone a long way in reaching these compromises, to which we in the Committee have agreed, in order to show some sort of backbone."
"Now, along comes this Article X, which makes provision for the Member States to extend the time limits for storage for as long as they like, provided that they inform the Commission and give it the opportunity to spend six months assessing whether their doing so could result in barriers to trade or disruption to the internal market – interestingly enough, not whether there might be any objections of a legal nature or from the point of view of fundamental rights."
"One result of this is that Poland, the Federal Republic of Germany’s much-valued neighbour, has plans to retain data for 15 years."
"What an interesting idea!"
"We have not, however, managed to come to any agreement about the costs involved."
"The fact that the companies and the public have to foot the bill for what the states order sets a precedent."
"I do indeed note the inclusion of provisions on the protection of data and of the public, as well as of sanction mechanisms, but, much as I welcome these positive steps, they require the Council to do no more than snap its fingers, since they refer to national legislation – which, as you must surely be aware, is not difficult to implement."
"As regards content, we also consulted with the Commission, which took a similar line to our own, and came to the conclusion that:"
"‘It is quite clear that the text is divergent from our original proposal in a number of important areas."
"While the adoption of our proposal would have resulted in almost complete harmonisation in this area, the compromise text represents only a partial harmonisation.’"
"As we have not resolved the issue of the retention of data once and for all, which is what the Committee and the Commission had had in mind, I do wonder to what degree we can call this an outright success."
"What we have done is to hand over to the Member States a measure that Directive 2002/58 did not empower them to implement."
"Precisely what shape it takes is now largely for them to decide, since we have provided for an enormous degree of flexibility."
"I do not believe that, in so doing, we can justifiably claim to have acted as European legislators."
"I also believe that there are continuing misunderstandings as to this House’s competence and future powers."
"A press communiqué dated 8 December from the Socialist Group ends with the following sentence:"
"In future all dossiers in this area will be treated on the basis of codecison with Parliament, including the revision of the present directive."
"In the latter case, that is certainly true, but the idea that, in future, everything serving to combat terrorism will be dealt with in accordance with a codecision procedure, is something I find highly doubtful, since this is an area in which the Council’s decisions must be unanimous."
"I also know that Ireland will take any decision we make here on appeal to the European Court of Justice, and will raise the question of whether this is possible in terms of competence; this is a very interesting turn of events."
"I would like, finally, to tell you that I am very disappointed with the way the procedure has gone and with the contributions made by the two big groups."
"I regard as in unbelievably bad taste the manner in which they behaved after we had spent eight weeks discussing these matters in great depth and considering our next steps, with everyone having given some ground, an enormous number of compromises having been made, and the Committee having come to a very clear and definite decision."
"I think it was in bad taste for a handful of members of the big groups to prejudice in this way a compromise proposal that the Council had not yet officially produced, there having been as yet no official negotiation with the Council on the grounds that the Council representative had, in principle, negated his own mandate and believed himself unable to negotiate!"
"It is true to say that I am disappointed, but I look forward with very eager anticipation to tomorrow’s vote and, all things considered, will say that the willingness to work together in a rational manner will always be there."
"Not everyone has to find the results to their liking."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Clarke, ladies and gentlemen, what people expect of us is that we should not cross swords over who is responsible for what, but instead ensure that their problems are resolved as speedily and promptly as possible, and what they expect of those who shape European policy is that they should not address the issue of how to combat organised crime and terrorism by simply adopting yet another resolution and going back to disputing among themselves, but instead by coming up with results."
"That was our problem."
"Here, on the table before us, we have something that might improve the situation – the retention and storage of data."
"It may not be the answer to everything, but it is an answer."
"Our problem was that of how to protect data and how to prevent blameless members of the public being obstructed more than circumstances warranted, and in addressing it, we were reflecting people’s justifiable concerns."
"Rather than this being allowed to become a never-ending story, what we wanted was a prompt result."
"People are entitled to have results put in front of them without delay."
"I can tell Mr Alvaro that it was for this reason that it was incumbent upon us, even in the short time available to us, to seek and find a solution."
"I will be quite frank in saying that the one we came up with is not 100% perfect, but it does help now and it does equip the police with instruments that they did not have before."
"It helps us to do whatever we can to ensure the protection of human life and of data on members of the public."
"The Council would have moved no further; the whole thing became a never-ending tale of framework decisions and disputes."
"Mr Alvaro has accurately described how Parliament kept asking questions, for months on end; it got us nowhere, because the Council was unwilling to give way, until the Commission came up with a proposal that helped us to prepare the way for a consensus."
"What we have now is a consensus that was reached only because Parliament changed position and made the attempt to bring together various forces."
"That was the right thing to do, and in doing it we also gained something, in that there is now no doubt about this project’s being subject to codecision."
"I do not think it relevant to ask whether the same result might have been achieved in some other way and at some other time."
"What interests me is that this project can be completed at the end of 2005 and can thereby enter into effect."
"To this instrument I say ‘yes’; to the arbitrary collection of data I say ‘no’, and that is why I say ‘yes’ to the restricted conditions that we have ended up with."
"Not every kind of data is included; not everything is capable of being stored, but only a very limited category, on the Internet: storage of movement data applies only to the onset of movement, unsuccessful calls are to be recorded only where this is already in place at national level."
"Nothing there has changed, and the countries that do not have this sort of data do not have to do this; they are not forced to do anything; they are free."
"We have reduced the requirements."
"We have set six months as the minimum period for retention – it is one about which I think we can certainly talk some more – and 24 months if the time limit is to be extended."
"I still have a question to put; it is the one raised by Mr Alvaro, and one to which I would very much like an answer, perhaps from Mr Clarke."
"Commissioner Frattini said, in one consultation, that the 15 years being considered by Poland could not be regarded as an exception."
"I cannot imagine that it would be either, but I would be rather happier if Mr Clarke were perhaps to say something about this, which cannot be the answer."
"I will, of course, say that we did not get the deal on costs that I would have liked us to get, but the costs issue is no longer as relevant as it was at the beginning of the process, since the types of data in the batches are no longer being considered."
"I do think that changes in the facts during the course of a procedure have to be taken into consideration, and that has an impact on other areas, for example on costs, which are no longer as considerable."
"The truth of the matter is that we have made enormous improvements to the security of people’s data as regards its monitoring and potential abuses."
"All the things that Mr Alvaro described have been achieved by our joint effort."
"It was very laborious, but now the job is done."
"It has now been set down – and will, it is to be hoped, tomorrow be adopted – that people are to be protected against the misuse of personal data and that provision is made for sanctions and penalties, that no content shall be stored, that access to the data shall be permitted only in cases of serious crime, and more besides."
"And Parliament remains a key player, with no comitology and revision after two years!"
"The police are given new scope for action, the public enjoy new and extended protection of their data, and Parliament has extended its influence."
"I think people are entitled to see us taking serious the ways in which they are protected against crime."
"Mr President, democracy and freedom are not defended through restrictions on human rights."
"In totalitarian states, people are guilty until proved innocent."
"In states governed by the rule of law, suspicion constitutes grounds for restricting freedom."
"We are now debating a law that would make it possible to spy on those whom the law says are protected."
"At least carry out an independent impact assessment, and do so before the legislation enters into force."
"Human rights are not something to be skated over and neglected."
"Legislate honestly."
"Do not pretend that what we are concerned with is terrorism if it is really a question of file sharing, national registration, taxes, trade and refugees."
"Do not create new problems of competition in Europe."
"Comply with the requirement for harmonisation in the Data Protection Directive, and act in accordance with Article 95."
"The measure proposed would not prevent terrorism."
"It would be in danger of damaging confidence in the EU if it proved to be in conflict with freedoms and rights and with the state governed by law."
"If the need for the measure cannot be substantiated, it will be a case of the EU forcing the Member States to vote against their own constitutions, in which Article 8.2 of the Council of Europe Convention is incorporated."
"A constitutional crisis could arise."
"It is necessary to establish freedoms and rights in the EU’s founding Treaty before matters go too far."
"I realise that it is easy to be seized by hatred towards terrorists."
"To tamper with freedoms and rights is, however, to give in to the attacks on the state governed by law and to depart from our values."
"Retain the right to privacy."
"Do not make large holes in our provisions for protecting data."
"Our European data protection is a European right to be proud of."
". Mr President, Mr Clarke, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, we will, tomorrow, be passing an important European instrument for the combating of terrorism and the most serious forms of criminality."
"This House having rejected the original framework decision as having been founded on the wrong legal basis, the Commission’s draft directive now provides for this House to possess the power of codecision."
"Just like the Member States in the Council, we started out with very diverse views and a different understanding, but sustainable compromises emerged from our discussions."
"From the very outset, with quick and efficient work in mind, we negotiated with the Council on an informal basis, as is the customary procedure."
"What is also customary in arriving at democratic decisions is the seeking of majorities for a position and the negotiating of compromises, and those produced by the two major groups enjoy the support of a broad majority in this House."
"The rapporteur, Mr Alvaro, may well find this way of going about things to be in bad taste, but it was not possible to reach any agreement with him, as he was not in Brussels during the final stage of the negotiations, but the UK Presidency was informed as soon as the two major groups had reached informal agreement on a position, and it was on this basis that agreement in the Council was made possible."
"This House can claim to have achieved various successes, in that we were able to substantially reduce the number of types of data over against what the Commission had proposed."
"Where the criminal offences were concerned, opinions ranged from ‘applicable to all offences’ to ‘terrorism only’, and we agreed on: ‘serious crimes as defined by national law, by reference to the European Arrest Warrant’."
"One of our great achievements has been to incorporate data protection into the directive wherever possible, striking a happy medium between the protection of the public against serious crime and terrorism on the one hand and the safeguarding of the private domain on the other."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite reports to the contrary, we will not, tomorrow, be voting on the Council’s document on data storage, but on a compromise reached, and laboriously, by a majority of the members of the Committee and the Council in the run-up to the last vote in the latter."
"Now, for the first time, the European Parliament is involved in the third pillar, that of internal security, to which codecision applies, something that was not wanted by all the Member States, and certainly not by the government of my own."
"Deciding where the European level can and may influence the national level and where it cannot and may not, without, in so doing, needlessly curtailing the rights of the national parliaments and/or voiding their powers, will be a veritable tightrope walk."
"This is what has prompted the German Federal Minister of Justice, Brigitte Zypries, to initiate a parliamentary review."
"This House has, in any case, succeeded in getting the Council to come to an agreement and in making crucial improvements to important aspects of what the Council originally produced."
"Data retention is one – but not the only – important instrument in combating serious crime, internationally organised criminal activity and terrorism, and some Member States are already using it – the United Kingdom, Spain and Sweden, for example."
"We therefore saw it as all the more important that appropriate minimum guarantees be incorporated at European level before national legislation – over which we have no influence – went much further than the present proposal."
"It was, then, with considerations of cost and data protection concerns in mind that we were successful in inserting the requirement that standard data relating to the beginning, but not the end, of the mobile telephone call be stored – the operative term is ‘profiling’ – but that traffic data relating to what are termed ‘unsuccessful calls’ would not be included, except where the companies retain this data in any case."
"It is also left to the Member States themselves to determine the period for which data is to be stored, within a range from 6 to a maximum of 24 months."
"It is only where a longer period is already applicable – as in Italy, for example – that the existing rules can be maintained, and I would very much welcome some information as to what is being done in the case of Poland."
"Data protection, though, has been tightened up in comparison with what was initially proposed, and national legislation continues to apply to access to data and the use made of it."
"My group will be voting by a large majority to adopt this compromise, even though some of us would have settled for less and others would perhaps have preferred to see rather more."
"The last thing I say I shall say to Mr Alvaro, and it is this: a miss is as good as a mile!"
". Mr President, I should like, in connection with this group work, to pay tribute to the intelligence of Mr Frattini’s initial proposal and to the courage of the President-in-Office, Mr Clarke, in this area."
"You have been able to work while showing respect for Parliament, even though, at the start, there was nothing to suggest that this would happen."
"Tomorrow’s vote is not only important, it is crucial."
"Firstly, because it is designed to create the beginnings of a Community framework and to leave it to the Member States’ discretion to establish certain limits with regard to the volume of data retained and the length of time it is retained in order to meet the requirements of the fight against crime and terrorism."
"Secondly, because when reasonable limits are set, everyone can accept them."
"The minimum six-month retention period is broadly applied by telecommunications operators in managing their contracts and their marketing."
"This six-month limit had already been suggested by the national authorities to protect data when the first directive on data protection had been approved."
"Thirdly, because Parliament wanted to demonstrate to the Council, but also mainly to its own people, that it is ready to take into account not only economic interests, but also the requirements relating to the protection of its people’s security and fundamental rights."
"I myself do not know of any cases in which economic interests would take precedence over the general interest in such a tragic situation, whatever the price to be paid, and this in spite of the current legal frameworks of the treaties, which are, I might add, somewhat schizophrenic."
"The Constitution would have spared us this multiplicity of pillars, but we must confine ourselves to the legal bases available to us."
"The Court recently half-opened a door for us; let us seize this new opportunity to draft the Community legislation that we so desperately need."
"Tomorrow’s vote will undoubtedly reveal the inconsistencies and limits of the current legal situation, but it will mainly propose something new in an area that affects public opinion, which is itself capable of recognising that we work in harmony to safeguard its interests, far removed from any power struggles and legal specificities."
"On behalf of the committee that I have the honour of chairing, I will conclude by stating that, in different circumstances, we are ready to rise to this intelligent challenge wisely overseen by the three parties, and I hope that this excellent cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament will continue."
". Mr President, I have often said in discussions here with fellow Members that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, too, does not regard the right to privacy as sacred, and that intrusions can be justified if the measures in question prove really necessary, proportionate and effective."
"It is clear to me that what we need in the fight against terrorism, the fight against organised crime, is more investments in specific investigations, more investments in analysing existing data and better cooperation between intelligence and security services."
"Money, even our euro, can be spent only once."
"Funds are currently being channelled into large-scale surveillance, the big fish, instead of those specific investigations, and I think that that really is a wrong choice."
"I could have just about endorsed the storage of telephone data, and all the underlying reasons which Mr Clarke gave only pertained to telephone data, so that was nice and easy."
"What are we to make, though, of the plans to record the time people spend on the Internet along with their logon and logoff data?"
"We live in an era in which people often have the computer switched on all day."
"Registration of that nature would therefore be rather pointless."
"We in this House are always talking about better lawmaking, and then along comes this sort of nonsense."
"They have not even worked out the financial implications for industry."
"If I were to draft a proposal on the environment or social policy without thinking it through properly, that would be unacceptable, but it appears not to be a problem in this instance."
"I would now like to turn to the large groups."
"My group was also in favour of bringing this discussion to a prompt close, namely after first reading in this House, but as, you have now done a deal with the British Presidency before Parliament has even adopted a position, we are now faced with a ."
"The small groups were not even informed and even the rapporteur for this subject, Mr Alvaro, knew nothing about this."
"It is all very well for Mrs Klamt to say that they were unable to reach him, but Mr Alvaro has a telephone, and informing the person in question would have been the decent thing to do."
"What we now have is a backroom deal on citizens’ rights, and that is just not good enough."
"My group will therefore simply vote against the proposal."
". Mr President, I regard what has gone on over recent weeks in relation to the retention of data as quite simply monstrous."
"Ever since the Commission produced its proposal, this House has been under extraordinary pressure of time."
"From the word ‘go’, we were given to understand that this proposal had to go through, come what may, by the end of the year; this alone meant that really credible and comprehensive work on it was scarcely feasible, and it is obvious that the intention was that there should not be any!"
"As I see it, further evidence for this is to be found in the fact that we will not, tomorrow, be voting on the report by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, but are, in essence, supposed to be merely nodding through what the Council resolved on at the beginning of December."
"Speaking as my group’s shadow rapporteur, let me say that I find it quite simply unacceptable that the two big groups should disregard the Committee’s vote and deliberately – let Mrs Klamt take note of this – go behind the rapporteur’s back and hatch schemes with the Council."
"The compromise that the PPE-DE and PSE groups have negotiated with the Council is rotten to the core and stinks to high heaven."
"My group rejects the compromise proposal outright, and so I, together with Mrs Buitenweg of the Group of the Greens, have already submitted a minority report to the Committee and moved that the Commission proposal be rejected tomorrow."
"I propose to tell you why I have done this."
"I have done this because the introduction of mandatory and systematic storage of data, data obtained on whatever occasion and for whatever reason, knocks a hole through the wall that protects the data of innocent citizens who are not suspected of anything."
"In essence, the Commission proposal tends to place 460 million EU citizens under general suspicion."
"The plan for the storage of collected data goes hand in hand with blatant assaults on Europeans’ fundamental rights and freedoms, along with the threat of disproportionate restrictions on the privacy of communications and the protection of the private domain, the very essence of both of which is at risk."
"The freedom of the press, and its protection of sources and informants in particular, is jeopardised, and I doubt – let my German fellow-Members take note – that this would bear scrutiny in the light of the German constitution."
"The object and purpose of this measure remain unclear to this day."
"Even now, no evidence has been produced to support the belief that serious crimes can indeed be more successfully cleared up with the help of a vast mass of stored communications data of the widest possible variety."
"Yes, of course, the law enforcement authorities have to be equipped to combat terrorism and the graver types of criminal activity, but that does not justify disregarding the rights of the individual and collecting – in a situation in which it is not absolutely necessary to do so – data and information and collating and exchanging it, to the point where, in the not-too-distant future, every detail of our citizens’ lives will be laid bare."
"Is, then, this Europe of ours to become an Orwellian surveillance state?"
"I, for one – particularly as a Member from the eastern part of Germany, will have no part in any such thing."
"Citizens under general suspicion, combined with the obsessive collection of data and information to which the police and secret services then had access at any time – there was a time when people, quite rightly, took to the streets in demonstrations to rid themselves of this sort of political thinking, and it is a good thing that they did!"
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a difference between you and the honourable gentlemen sitting on the front benches: they are selected by their governments to serve authority."
"What do the selected come and ask of us, the elected?"
"That we tie down our peoples, that we overturn the right of free speech."
"That is what they are asking of us."
"Shall we do so?"
"Just imagine if this technology had existed in 1940 and if Hitler had had this directive in his hands."
"He would have killed far more than the 6 million Jews."
"Just imagine if the Stalinist regime had had it in their hands."
"It might still be doing the same."
"That is what they are asking us to do today, at the expense of the people of Europe."
"We must not allow it."
"They tell us, 'for the sake of combating terrorism'."
"In other words, Bin Laden and his ilk will use public telephones, they will buy prepaid cards and, if they want to use the Internet, they will go to an Internet café to do so."
"What are they talking about and who is the final recipient?"
"The final recipient will be the CIA."
"Will you hand the peoples of Europe over to the CIA?"
"Think according to conscience, not according to the instructions of your groups or parties."
"Long live freedom!"
"For your information, I would point out to you that, contrary to what you might think, everything that you say today is remembered forever and retained forever as it is all filmed and recorded."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament and the Council have made an admirable effort to reach agreement at first reading so that an urgent measure to tackle terrorism and crime can be adopted swiftly."
"I have always been of the opinion that, when faced with a recurrent threat to undermine world peace and stability, people will, under exceptional circumstances, willingly accept restrictions to their privacy if the other side of the coin is greater peace of mind and security."
"I believe that it is legitimate to temporarily restrict privacy when it may be for the good of society."
"I think we can in any case be pleased with the positive compromises that have been reached, despite the customary obstructionist attitude of a certain part of the Left, which often pays lip-service to safeguarding individual freedoms merely for convenience’ sake."
"It calls for freedom and security for the people but then does not follow it up with concrete action, thus showing that it is more interested in demagogy and facile propaganda."
"I think it has been shown that targeted, restrictive measures are needed in the fight against terrorism, in keeping with the principle of proportionality."
"The outcome of these negotiations will, in my opinion, be a directive of undoubted importance if it also includes the corrective measures on which the EU ministers have already reached agreement."
"The directive would combine rigour with the protection of civil liberties, by ruling that data may be retained for long periods, while, at the same time, containing a series of provisions designed to regulate aspects relating to protection, laying down penalties for those who use such data illegally."
"The directive would allow Member States to decide whether to retain data on unanswered calls, while providing for technical restrictions to keep down the cost of doing so."
"In this regard, I should like to mention the example of Italy, one of the few Member States already to have adopted specific legislation on data retention."
"Since Italy’s legislation is proving effective, I think it is acceptable for data to be retained for two years, if particular circumstances so require."
"I therefore hope that Italy, which is always willing to share its experience, can keep its own legislation in the context of the harmonisation of the various national systems. Its legislation has been proved effective and, above all, the Commission has acknowledged the fact by saying that Italy could submit a derogation notification."
"The report by Mr Alvaro is of exceptional importance, and particularly today, when the entire population of Europe faces the daily fear of terrorist attacks."
"The attacks in London and Madrid alarmed the population because they hit civilian targets and unsuspecting citizens on their way to work, school or hospital."
"On the one hand, people are threatened by those who employ terrorism as a means of fighting against governments. On the other hand, however, governments use people, or infringe upon their right to privacy, when combating terrorism."
"We cannot allow people to be monitored in the manner of Big Brother-type TV shows."
"People elect governments in order to free them from having to decide on day-to-day public affairs."
"Governments, however, have no right to use people’s privacy as a public affair."
"That is why I think the report should be amended, placing greater emphasis on the obligations of the state with respect to the implementation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which concerns the right to privacy, so that no part of the proposed directive may be in contradiction with this Convention."
"– Mr President, the issue we are debating today is one of the most difficult and important issues, because we are being called upon to strike a balance between the right to personal freedom and the right to public security."
"I consider it a huge success, which is due to the efforts both of Parliament and of the Commission and the Council, that the initial draft has been improved considerably."
"It leaves the Member States a great deal of room for manoeuvre, firstly to define periods of data retention of between 6 and 24 months; secondly, to define the offences for which they will use this information and, thirdly, for the law enforcement authorities to have access to this information, for which prior permission must be obtained from the courts."
"These changes are most important and might have encouraged me to waive the objections I formulated from the outset, given that all the amendments which I proposed have been accepted."
"However, despite this, I cannot vote in favour, because I believe that these measures alone will prove to be totally ineffective in practice."
"It is certain that criminals will easily circumvent them or will find other means of communication and will thus achieve their criminal objectives, while the measures will remain in place."
"In addition, we need uniform and unanimous action by the global community, better coordination of measures, proper evaluation of data and, more importantly, improved cooperation between the national law enforcement authorities."
"Finally, as the European Data Protection Supervisor says in his report, the technical difficulties in the application of the measure are insurmountable, and that is why I cannot vote in favour."
"Mr President, Mr Frattini, Mr Clarke, we tried to take the heat out of the debate, but doing so was extremely difficult."
"I believe that things need to be made clear and the truth told."
"A directive is required in the area of data retention, as all the data related to trafficking is already retained and used by the law enforcement authorities in the large majority of the Member States."
"That is the truth, and that is why current practices are in urgent need of regulation to ensure that Europeans are better protected."
"The debates on this report have been very difficult."
"I am therefore pleased and proud that my group is in a position to support the compromise proposed by the Council, not because we are ready to accept just anything but, rather, because my group was able to maintain its firm stance throughout the negotiations in order to secure the better protection of Europeans."
"Limiting the scope of the directive so that it includes serious crimes, protection of data security, access to data and the recourse to criminal sanctions for misuse of data – these are real achievements!"
"We made our requirements clear and we did not give way."
"Admittedly, what we have here is a compromise, and we too would have hoped to have taken things further."
"That is why, I might add, we tabled an amendment to the legislative resolution providing for access, in the third pillar, to be regulated in the framework decision on data protection."
"I myself am draftsman for this framework decision and I will submit my draft report to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs at the start of 2006."
"We consider that this is a reasonable compromise, which allows a balance to be struck between the protection of fundamental rights and the fight against serious crime and terrorism."
"Finally, an agreement at first reading, under codecision, is a victory for the European Parliament."
"Our institution proved that it was mature enough, and we can be proud of this outcome."
"I would in fact point out that, at first, we had rejected the framework decision on data retention as it precluded all democratic debate."
"We have opened the door for the years to come."
"All matters pertaining to this same area – I repeat – will be dealt with under codecision with Parliament, not least – I would emphasise – the revision of this directive, which will most certainly be carried out, as technologies evolve rapidly."
"Mr President, Mrs Klamt said earlier that she was unable to contact the rapporteur, and I can understand her being increasingly hesitant about picking up the phone or sending him an e-mail."
"Being opposed to the compromise struck by the two big groups, I shall endorse the rapporteur’s line."
"Do the proposals that are now before us make our world a safer place?"
"No, we are, to a great extent, being lulled into a false sense of security, because the proposals are not proportionate."
"They are ineffective because they are easy to circumvent. They offer insufficient guarantees for the protection of innocent citizens and finally, they offer insufficient guarantees for good cooperation and exchange between the Member States, for that is the key to effective policy, and we still have not seen enough results."
"The Council has reluctantly agreed to codecision but I have to tell Mr Clarke that codecision is not a favour; it is a democratic right, and the Council’s democratic instincts are not terribly deeply rooted, to put it mildly."
"I would like to say to the Council that pushing this legislation through in a hurry is not a judicious way of going about things and is not, therefore, in keeping with the ‘better lawmaking’ that we are always talking about."
"I have to admit, therefore, that I am disappointed to see how the critical stance of this House has, in the past four months, melted like snow in the sun."
"Sadly, I have to say that the compromise, which will undoubtedly be accepted tomorrow, does not make me feel any safer."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was wondering why the UK Presidency wanted to fast-track this directive at all costs."
"Clearly, its keenness to achieve at least one result in this disastrous presidency has also determined the debating time for this directive."
"I should like to express my solidarity with Mr Alvaro because I believe that the compromise amendments tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have made the text put forward by the Commission worse. Basically, they demonstrate two things: first, Parliament’s subordinate position in relation to the Council and, secondly, that the major German coalition also casts its shadow over this Parliament."
"I believe that this directive is disproportionate, because it places security above freedom and democracy."
"We are faced with a slow, gradual and inexorable shift away from the rule of law towards a police state, and this Americanisation of the European Union has to be stopped by every possible means."
"We have asked a single question: ‘Can you demonstrate to us that data retention can curb terrorism?’"
"We have not been given an answer."
"Mr President, in early October, it became apparent that more than 200 officers of the Rotterdam police force tried to read the dossier of the ex-Feyenoord player Robin Van Persie."
"The computer denied them access but did – since ‘Big Brother is watching you’ – record their names."
"So the database contains the names of not only well-known citizens who are suspects in criminal cases, but also police officers."
"What worries me the most in this proposal is the misuse of databases by staff of the competent authorities."
"My fundamental objection to this proposal is that the long-term storage of data on every citizen not only encroaches upon their privacy, but also means that they are, in fact, being treated as suspects, yet without having the rights that suspects enjoy."
"Is this remedy not worse than the disease?"
"In the absence of any proof as to the effectiveness of this proposal, I should like the Commission and Council to spell out clearly how this directive will be tested and evaluated."
"Mr Alvaro has done an excellent job as rapporteur, and the deal struck between the major groups without reference to the House is unprecedented in its serious undermining of our working practices."
"I endorse the rapporteur’s line and I should like to finish by quoting George Orwell’s words to the effect that ‘Some groups are more equal than others’."
"Mr President, I would like to join with my colleagues in thanking the rapporteur for the work that has been carried out on this very difficult matter."
"Listening to the debate here today, I am somewhat reminded of 9/11 and the bombings in Madrid and London."
"This Parliament rightly objected very strongly and criticised all those who were involved in terrorist acts, called for solidarity amongst Member States and amongst all the institutions of the European Union and sought to ensure that we could cooperate to fight the evil of terrorism."
"One of the ideas to emerge is the question of data retention."
"Sometimes when we hear the differing voices in the course of the debate, we have to return to the following fundamental principle."
"Firstly, democratically elected governments have come together and agreed on a proposal; secondly, the Parliament of the European Union has come together and will hopefully agree on these proposals; and, finally, the desire to ensure that accountability – ensuring that the guardians and custodians are watched over by others – is being borne in mind."
"I think everything is contained within this overall report to ensure that we can give those guarantees to individuals."
"Let us not forget that every time we use a computer, whether it is to buy Christmas gifts or to book flights, data is already being retained by companies on those websites to target marketing and other products towards us."
"What is emerging here is not a new alien creature: information is already being stored via cookies."
"There is no control over that."
"The one concern I have – and maybe the Commissioner or the President-in-Office of the Council could respond to this – is doubt with regard to the legal basis for this directive."
"There has been some dispute, as this is an issue dealing with counter-terrorism and serious crime, over the fact that it should be done under a framework decision and not a directive."
"There is a potential clash of legal opinion in this regard."
"It is important to preserve the rights of Member State parliaments and governments to ensure that existing legislation in these areas can be maintained."
"We all know that citizens prefer to deal with their own government, rather than the European government, to protect their rights and guarantees, so it must be a balance between the two."
"Mr President, instead of protecting the citizen’s rights and his private sphere, the confidentiality of data relating to telephone and media use is being more and more undermined, and this is of course done always and only in the service of the noble cause of counter-terrorism."
"I simply wonder why it is that more and more action is being taken against inconvenient journalists, and in what way the private citizen is protected when the non-conformist elements in our society get to feel the heavy hand of state power."
"The real criminals, organised in gangs and terror groups, are not only planning their acts further ahead – which makes plans for a time-limit on retention obsolete – but are also constantly finding new ways of evading prosecution by the state."
"I do not believe that this new surveillance measure will do anything at all to prevent terrorist acts; on the contrary, it endangers those who have access to confidential information – doctors, lawyers, and journalists, for example – in the practice of their professions, and unashamedly makes incursions into the private domain of countless members of the public."
"If the retention of data is to become another step on the road towards the total surveillance state, then I regard as indispensable a minimum of protection for the citizen, in the shape of sanctions that really have teeth in the events of the data thus stored being misused."
"– Madam President, Mr Frattini, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the March European Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council of April 2004 advocated the implementation of standards relating to the retention of data, given that modern telecommunications, with all of the benefits that they bring, can be used for the purposes of international crime, and, more seriously, terrorism."
"Following these decisions, a framework decision was presented to us and was rejected by Parliament. This was followed by the proposal before us, which, as Mr Cavada said, is a welcome one in that it takes account of Parliament’s prerogatives through a proposed new legal basis."
"I must express my disappointment, however, that we were forced to work within a severely truncated timeframe."
"We did our best in the circumstances."
"The negotiations were difficult and the compromise that was reached is far from perfect, yet we did what we had to in order to reach a compromise at first reading."
"Unlike some Members of this House, I welcome the decision on a period of retention of six months minimum to 24 months maximum."
"We cannot run the risk of backsliding in our efforts to fight crime because data were eliminated too quickly or were not retained at all."
"It is crucial in my view that data be stored securely and that there be no room for abuse; the rules on data protection, security and access must be strengthened."
"Member States must establish appropriate penalties, in line with their national laws."
"If we fail to implement these rules effectively, we will be endangering people’s human rights."
"We need a clause ensuring that within three years we assess the system that we are currently adopting, and in this regard I welcome the calls for transparency and for the Commission’s eventual assessment to be made public."
"I trust that this assessment, to be provided by Mr Frattini, helps us to make a rigorous assessment of the effectiveness of the adoption of these instruments."
"Madam President, finding a balance between the protection of people’s private lives and the retention of personal data in order to respond to the terrorist threat is difficult because the temptation is so strong in our Member States to transform exceptional measures into general rules."
"The compromise reached with the European Parliament is a positive step, but it should not make us lose sight of the objective of having a directive providing a legal framework and identical guarantees in all countries, for all citizens."
"I emphasise the recommendations made by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy in relation to businesses."
"Businesses must neither become an instrument for governments to monitor their citizens, nor be hindered in their work, and their cooperation must go hand in hand with strict guarantees, not least in relation to the full reimbursement of extra costs."
"Finally, it is vital that the arrangement be as well adapted as possible to the functioning of the Web and that it hinders neither the development of the Internet nor access to ICTs in the Union."
"Neither can do without its freedom."
"Mr President, the present national variation that Mr Clarke says gives an open goal to criminals will persist and even grow under the Council Conservative-Socialist deal."
"It is a pretext for gold plating to allow, for instance, the 15 years storage that Poland wants, a wider list of data used for purposes far removed from law enforcement and access for any public or private agency, and all with a convenient Brussels stamp of approval."
"In contrast, the agreement of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is a reasonable and proportionate response to fighting terrorism."
"If MEPs tomorrow accept the Council take-it-or-leave-it deal, they will have fallen victim to a vast con trick."
"This Parliament could give up any pretence to care either about civil liberties or about European business competitiveness."
"It is not too late for individual Members to rebel against the sell-out agreement by their leaders to a charter for mass surveillance and state snooping."
"Finally, I deplore the attacks on Mr Alvaro; he delivered a resounding near-consensus in Committee."
"To use his three day absence on an official trip to Israel at the end of a phone and fax is a cheap alibi for a stab in the back by Mrs Klamt and Mrs Roure."
"– Madam President, the proposal for a directive being debated reveals in a characteristic and, I would say, cynical manner the character of the European Union itself, which has no hesitation in abolishing – I repeat abolishing – and not, in your words, restricting the personal and democratic rights achieved as a result of the fight of the peoples."
"In this particular instance, it is abolishing – I repeat abolishing – freedom of communication, personal data protection and privacy."
"It is abolishing the core of confidentiality of communications."
"It is safeguarding and introducing legislation imposing across-the-board monitoring."
"Everyone is under surveillance and provision is even made for criminal and administrative sanctions for companies which fail to comply with monitoring."
"The breadth of monitoring includes every detail of communication and the impudence of the directive is so great that it calls on those being monitored to pay the cost of monitoring."
"Apart from anything else, the directive also infringes constitutional provisions, for example of the Hellenic Constitution, and provisions of international conventions and obviously paves the way for abolishing personal rights and freedoms."
"We reject the draft directive, which will not brook improvement."
"Madam President, this debate centres on an issue that is of supreme importance for all of mankind."
"For many years now, Members of the House have reiterated the point that freedom is mankind’s most valuable asset, and that human civilisation cannot develop properly without it."
"It is true that terrorism must be fought by all available means and methods, but such a fight must not be waged at the cost of human freedom."
"This directive does not in any way accomplish the goal it sets itself."
"Technologies are already in existence that will make it possible for genuine terrorists and genuine criminals to be highly successful in avoiding checks."
"What the directive will do instead is help bring about the total surveillance of millions of free citizens."
"I should like to remind the Commissioner that such data will inevitably leak out."
"I also have to say that the Commissioner is a hypocrite."
"The comments he made yesterday before the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, when defending himself against accusations that the CIA had transported a number of terrorists to Europe and interrogated them there, were of a very different tenor."
"Today, however, he has come out in support of a solution that quite clearly curtails civil liberties."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by expressing my satisfaction with the agreement finally reached on an issue that is so complex from technical and political points of view."
"Much has been said about the implications of this issue in terms of restricting freedoms, but disguising powerful, unacceptable and worrying economic interests; a proposal that has been the subject of successive and complex debates, with voices against, but also with powerful and justified voices in favour."
"I know that it has been difficult and also that the agreement contains significant concessions and abdications."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to disagree with those people who do not feel that the measure is timely, effective or proportionate."
"Whether we like it or not, our society of values is under threat and, whether we like it or not, the instruments available to us so far have not been entirely effective in dealing with this threat."
"I therefore applaud the initiative that we are debating today, ladies and gentlemen, as I have always done, and I hope it will receive the majority support of the House."
"Security over freedom, no."
"I would say: infinite freedom, but with security; and that is simply because without security we cannot fully enjoy our freedoms."
"Terror and crime exploit our doubts and hesitations and seek out our weakest points so that they can attack our societies."
"We must fight them with all the power of our democratic system, a system that always advocates the full observance of legal guarantees."
"To doubt that this is the case is to call into question, ladies and gentlemen, the work done by our judges and police and is to doubt the vitality of the democratic system."
"The victims deserve all of our efforts."
"And unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, I have not heard anybody talk about them this afternoon."
"– Madam President, today's compromise abolishes all the protections imposed by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and is a monument to non-harmonisation."
"With what is now the standard pretext of combating terrorism, the Council is harmonising just one thing: the obligation for data to be retained which are currently retained voluntarily, in the expectation that a few criminals will be caught in this way."
"At the same time, it refuses to make provision for anything tangible in order to protect millions of innocent citizens and their rights."
"Thus, while Mr Clarke is talking about harmonisation, his proposal leaves the exemptions in Article 15(1) of the previous directive untouched."
"As a result, the Council is giving the Member States the go-ahead to retain any information they want, for any purpose they choose and for any period of time they consider expedient, without the slightest material European presence, restriction or control."
"My party, PASOK, will be voting against."
"President-in-Office, on a personal note, it has been a great pleasure to work with you, both professionally and personally."
"This is not personal, this is political."
"What we have in the end is a proposal with a roar for police access and with a whimper for the protection of fundamental rights."
"It is shame that we missed this opportunity."
"Madam President, the reasons given for this directive are the usual ones about the fight against terrorism and organised crime, but this is a red herring."
"Governments already use the most sophisticated means to monitor national and international communications."
"The United States of America has the Echelon system that enables it to intercept every form of international communication."
"The British Government has GCHQ in Cheltenham."
"Terrorists and organised criminals are well aware of this and do everything they can to avoid being tracked and caught by these means."
"This directive is really about formalising the creation of a surveillance society and the control of individuals."
"More and more powers are being concentrated in the hands of the state, at the expense of the individual."
"The UK Presidency is trying to use this Parliament to implement a policy that has already been rejected by the UK Parliament."
"This directive represents another step on the road to a police state."
"I hope this Parliament will reject it."
"Madam President, there can be no doubt that regulations on data retention can help us a great deal in our fight against terrorism and dangerous crime."
"The efforts of all those involved in achieving a consensus on this issue should therefore be acknowledged."
"At the same time, however, I have serious doubts about the interpretation of Article X of the Directive."
"The period of data retention may be extended to more than two years pursuant to this Article, provided that the appropriate procedure is followed."
"Mr Clarke responded to a Polish journalist who had asked whether a data retention period of 15 years would be permissible by saying that a period of this duration would still be compatible with the directive, even in such extreme cases."
"The draft amendments that have been tabled to the Polish Telecommunications Act by the governing party in the Polish Parliament do in fact provide for a retention period of 15 years."
"As I see it, this is a test of sorts of the scope of the directive’s application."
"I do not believe that a 15-year retention period is compatible with the concept behind the directive, the aim of which is to protect individuals’ right to privacy."
"A retention period of this duration also blatantly violates the principle of proportionality, and means that the directive’s impact will not be commensurate with its goals."
"Furthermore, there is a risk that procedures resembling those of a police state could be used, which would further the government’s short-term political goals while subjecting citizens to long-term and far-reaching surveillance."
"There is every chance that data stored in such large quantities for such long periods could leak out."
"This would provide criminal groups with even more opportunities to use it, which runs counter to the directive’s fundamental goal."
"I should therefore like to receive a clear answer from the Commissioner, and also from the Council representative, to the question of whether the Commission regards a 15-year data retention period as acceptable in line with the procedure outlined in Article X."
"I hope that Mr Clarke’s response to the Polish journalist was founded on a misinterpretation of the directive, although it may well be the case that he has made some sort of concession to the Polish Government on this matter in order to achieve a compromise at any cost."
"Since we are adopting joint regulations, however, we have a right to call for them to be interpreted similarly by all of the EU institutions."
"Madam President, this is a very difficult debate because, interestingly, groups that are normally homogeneous are split; political allies who normally work with one another are split."
"I have absolute respect for those who have their reservations about that which is being proposed."
"I ask that they have respect for those of us who believe that this is a way of protecting fundamental freedoms."
"It is important to restate that this is not about the data within the calls or on the internet; it is about traffic data, and it is arguably to allow us to protect fundamental freedoms."
"Of course, there are costs; there are costs to businesses, there are costs to each and every one of us, but the cost if we do nothing is cataclysmic."
"We have to deal with the real and imagined threats."
"There are people who use the Internet to entrap young women and children into prostitution rings."
"If we can break one prostitution ring with this directive, that alone would have been worth it."
"I and my group are proud that we have achieved a compromise that delivers and protects fundamental freedoms."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Council and the Commission have recently come to an agreement on the retention of stored data, and I am glad that it has proved possible, following long and intensive negotiations, for a compromise also to be reached between this House, the Council and the Commission."
"This compromise is one that I can support."
"I would like to take this opportunity to extend especial thanks to those who conducted the negotiations on Parliament’s behalf, for they really did do their utmost."
"We must also, though, be aware that we find ourselves caught between the desire to protect fundamental rights and the need to fight against international terrorism and organised crime."
"I am also, in principle, glad to see the obligation imposed on telecommunications enterprises to store certain traffic data for the purpose of combating organised crime."
"While I do believe that a three-month limit on their storage would have been perfectly sufficient, we do now have this compromise, and I find the flexibility acceptable."
"Our democracies cannot, and must not, aim to make everything in a person’s life visible; whatever needs to be done in the fight against terrorism, the principles of the rule of law must be upheld, and so I very much hope that we, in Europe, will at last line up together to fight terrorism and organised crime."
"In the same way that the international organisations opposed to law and order are interconnected, we too must combine and fight them together."
"I very much hope that we need never again experience such tragic events as those that occurred in Madrid and London."
"Madam President, I would like to address those Members who have spoken against this compromise."
"We are worried about abuses, but we are also worried about a lack of protection for citizens."
"Since democratic society is made up of personal restrictions and personal abdications, I would like us to consider one question: how much individual freedom must we surrender in order to guarantee fundamental rights, freedoms and collective security?"
"I believe that the immense majority of citizens are prepared to surrender some of their freedom for a certain amount of time, provided that equality is not affected and provided that democratic control and prosecution and punishment of any abuses is guaranteed."
"We must not choose between security and freedom."
"There can be no freedom without security."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I know what I am talking about: I have been living with bodyguards for fourteen years."
"It is not possible to be free if one cannot take one’s children to school, if one cannot walk the streets, if one has to look under the car in order to safeguard one’s daily life."
"Freedom and security are part of democracy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am not neutral."
"I am passionately in favour of human rights."
"I would therefore ask you to support this directive and this compromise."
"Madam President, from a Finnish perspective, I must say that I am slightly worried about the British debate here because, on the one hand, we have Mrs Ludford from the Liberal Democrats who agrees with Mr Batten from the UKIP Party and then you have Mr Cashman who is widely applauded by the British minister."
"It is not very often that you get applause from a British minister in the European Parliament, so Mr Cashman should be congratulated for that."
"Nevertheless, I wish to make three brief points."
"The first concerns the balance between freedom and security."
"We have taken the issue too lightly and we are not finding the right balance."
"Perhaps we are rushing things."
"I have heard people say that those who come from countries where terrorism is a threat must take this issue in a different way to those from a country where there is no threat."
"I disagree: this is a common problem and we should all look at it from a broader perspective."
"My second point concerns cost-efficiency or efficiency in general."
"To me it seems that we have to calculate every piece of legislation carefully, we must make an estimation and base our legislation on that."
"I do not think we have done that yet."
"We have not gone far enough in trying to estimate how much this legislation costs."
"I think we are also chasing the wrong crooks, because if you are a crook who does not have the brains to use hotmail or prepaid mobile phone networks, then you are a stupid crook and we are really chasing the stupid crooks."
"My third and final point concerns procedure."
"It might seem that I am against this whole initiative, but I am not."
"What came out of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs was quite good."
"It was a good compromise."
"Therefore I would urge this European Parliament not to be bullied by the Council or the UK Presidency but to find a compromise and push it through."
"Madam President, I should like to focus on the internet part of this directive."
"Mr Clarke, you think that the lack of massive quantities of traffic data is a threat to our security."
"I disagree."
"Practice shows that it is the lack of online security that offers unlimited opportunities to criminals and terrorists."
"I will give you a practical example."
"Last month, a group of three criminals who control a network of over 100 000 hacked PCs was rolled up by the Dutch police."
"Control over those unsecured PCs gave the criminals the power to perpetrate all kinds of crimes, from massive identity theft, attacks on vital infrastructure and the unlimited opportunity to grant anonymous access to and use of all services of the internet, for whoever was willing to pay."
"Imagine what could happen if these men offered their services to terrorist networks."
"Imagine also how useless traffic data is, because it points at innocent people."
"The methods used to track these criminals down are specified in the Cybercrime Treaty, which has been signed by all Member States but implemented by only a few."
"It is those methods that we need to fight terrorism."
"It is indisputable that this directive is intrusive."
"It is questionable whether it will help."
"On the internet side, it is even technically unfeasible."
"I completely agree with my colleagues Mrs in't Veld and Mr Lambrinidis."
"I fear a false sense of security."
"I fear that part of this directive could even pose a threat to our security."
"When we debate the draft legislation tabled before us, we must take into account four issues."
"Firstly, human rights must be upheld."
"Personal data protection must be guaranteed in all circumstances."
"Secondly, when crimes are committed with the use of new technologies, we cannot leave European criminal investigation agencies without the necessary resources."
"Thirdly, bearing in mind the importance of competitiveness, we cannot place unacceptably high and unjustified burdens on the service industry sector."
"And fourthly, we should only resort to the use of European-level regulations in areas where Member State regulations are less efficient."
"To summarise it briefly: human rights, efficient criminal investigation agencies, competitiveness and subsidiarity."
"These are targets we can probably all agree with."
"Our orders of preference may be different, and they are indeed different even within our factions, as clearly proven by our debate today."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to share a personal reflection."
"As a young Hungarian MEP, my memories of the Socialist autocracy had been accumulated when I was very young, but I remember the recurring warning my parents gave me whenever I tried to talk politics on the phone: ‘This should not be discussed on the phone!’"
"Everybody knew that the dictatorial authorities were monitoring telephone conversations."
"This may sound familiar to my fellow Eastern and Central European Members."
"I cannot deny that, partly due to this memory, my order of preference has the protection of personal data in the first place."
"Therefore the only compromise I find acceptable is one that upholds to an equal extent all four aspects mentioned above."
"A compromise that – while leaving room for manoeuvre for Member States to make their criminal investigation agencies more effective – does not affect human rights."
"One last thought: due to the sensitivity of this issue, the newly created legislation cannot be set in stone."
"I believe that a periodical review of the directive would be justified, particularly in respect of the range of data required by the authorities."
"Madam President, when, tomorrow, plenary votes on a minimum directive on data retention, we shall do so by means of an agreement with the Council and the Commission in which Parliament has the right of codecision."
"Citizens put the fight against crime and terrorism high on the list of what the EU should tackle successfully."
"People also want us to solve problems jointly, and that is something in which we have succeeded."
"We have protected personal privacy and human rights."
"Moreover, European police forces are being given modern aids to combat crime, including organised crime such as child pornography, the drugs trade, terrorism and trafficking in women and children for the purposes of prostitution."
"That is something I am very pleased with, so I wish to thank everyone very much for their constructive cooperation."
"We must succeed in these areas together."
"We must also monitor what everyone in this Chamber is concerned about, and we must do it together."
"Madam President, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Alvaro for his excellent work as Parliament’s rapporteur on this issue; Mrs Cederschiöld too has done excellent work as co-rapporteur."
"I sincerely hope your efforts will not be in vain, as the hard work accomplished was circumvented at the last minute by a deal between the Council and the Commission and, shame to say, by the two biggest groups in this House."
"The idea to rush this proposal through is not a good one."
"Yes, we all agree that terrorism should be fought efficiently."
"Yes, we all agree that electronic communications data can be very useful in tracking terrorists, drug smugglers and human traffickers."
"Yes, that kind of information should be retained and used against those who are threats to our society."
"But no, all citizens should not be treated as criminals."
"No, I am not convinced that the compromise package proposed is a balanced one."
"And, no, I do not think we have enough information available about how this proposal would affect the privacy of individuals and what kind of threats might be posed to civil liberties."
"I am against this proposal."
"Firstly, because the so-called compromise allows the use of retained data when investigating serious crimes, without defining these serious crimes."
"Are infringements of intellectual property rights in peer-to-peer networks serious enough crimes for the data retained to be accessed?"
"One could suppose so when reading the statements from the content industry."
"If we are passing terrorist laws and, at the same time, fulfilling other objectives, we should then at least have a chance to debate and examine them properly and have the right to proper procedures."
"Secondly, we are leaving too much decision-making to the Member States."
"However, in electronic communications the frontiers are artificial."
"According to which jurisdiction would the seriousness of a crime be assessed when a packet of IP data circulates in different Member states, for example?"
"Thirdly, I am opposed to this proposal because it leaves completely in the air what kind of costs it brings and who should bear them."
"Various estimates have been presented, and it is without question that the costs to operators and internet service providers are high."
"These costs should at least be reimbursed if we were to impose any new data retention requirements."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, some speakers have attempted to create the impression that this directive might have been drawn up in a police state."
"That is not a perspective that I share."
"My opinion is that this directive, which was drawn up jointly by the Council, Parliament and the Commission, will in fact help to safeguard human rights and the rights of citizens, in particular their right to life and their right to a life in safety."
"I shall therefore be supporting the report in tomorrow’s vote."
"I feel that there is no contradiction between upholding such values as the citizens’ right to privacy and the protection of personal data, on the one hand, and the fight against terrorism, on the other."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it can be said that a debate and a political process have taken place in this Chamber in recent weeks that have not only given Parliament a greater role in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, but have also enhanced the overall image of the three European institutions."
"In one of the many speeches, I heard someone say that this directive is an undemocratic instrument; some people even mentioned Stalin and Hitler."
"This directive is a victory for democracy: it is an important, balanced instrument that serves both the people and, above all, those engaged in the fight against crime who pay the price even on a personal level."
"I am referring to the investigating authorities, the police forces."
"Besides, as Mr Cashman very clearly put it, what is the cost of not deciding, what is the cost of not doing anything?"
"Do we want to carry on with 20 different legal systems, in which each Member State does substantially what it wants, or is it not better instead to come together for the first time with a European approach, a directive, the first step towards harmonisation?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a directive firmly based on the principles of necessity and proportionality."
"I have heard certain demands, for instance those made by Mr Reul and Mrs Kudrycka, who mentioned an idea that the Polish Parliament is examining."
"I can certainly say that retaining data for 15 years does not seem to be in keeping with the criteria of proportionality and necessity."
"Even though each Member State has a duty to demonstrate why its request is proportional and necessary, 15 years frankly seems to me a really extreme case."
"I should still like to make two final considerations."
"I am grateful to all those, particularly Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra and Mrs Díez González, who have chosen to remember the victims of crime and have sought to emphasise that the fundamental freedoms of the person must definitely be assured – something with which I fully agree."
"Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, if someone uses a mobile phone to set off a bomb, as unfortunately has happened, or to give instructions to a gang of paedophiles, is it not right that the police and the courts, that is to say the legitimate institutions, should have the tools to prevent and to tackle such crimes?"
"I think it is right that that should happen, and at the same time I think it is right that any abuse of the system should be punished, as we have stated in the directive."
"The police forces need more tools, as do the courts in our countries, which are democracies, as well as more checks to see whether anyone has abused the system."
"To conclude, the European institutions have unfortunately been divided, and still are, on major issues, but it is highly reassuring – and I hope tomorrow’s vote will confirm this – to see that the European institutions will not be divided on the subject of people’s security and the fight against terrorism and organised crime. Instead, all three of them together will have the ability to respond extremely quickly to our fellow citizens’ needs."
". Madam President, firstly, in our capacity as Presidency, we have tried to work with all groups within the European Parliament."
"I pay respect to Mr Alvaro as rapporteur of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs; I have been to that committee on a number of occasions to have discussions on these points."
"They are difficult matters, which is why there are differences of opinion, but they are differences of opinion based, I hope, on mutual respect."
"Secondly, these proposals are about networks."
"Networks are the modern criminality, whether they are terrorist, paedophile, drug- or people-trafficking networks."
"It is not a question of the content of the communication, but what the network is, who is in it."
"It is very important to understand that."
"As far as the point about Poland is concerned, Mr Frattini is completely correct in what he says."
"There is a clear procedure if Member States want to go beyond the period of time."
"They can consult the Commission and the Commission will then make a judgement on the proportionality issue, which Mr Frattini has mentioned, also as regards the criteria of the single market and competitiveness within the single market."
"Those are the procedures and that also is clear."
"On the question raised by Mr Crowley from Ireland, it is certainly true that Mr McDowell, the Irish Minister, raised questions about the legal basis."
"We took opinion from the Council’s legal services, which were very clear, on the basis of the legal advice, that this is the right course to follow."
"My final point: people have talked about a police state."
"This is the opposite of a police state."
"We are all democracies, both the European Parliament and each country."
"It is the rule of law that determines how this technique is used, and what we are doing here is proposing the rule of law."
"Those who talk about Hitler or Stalin or police states are utterly wrong."
"This proposal goes in exactly the opposite direction."
"I hope, when the vote takes place tomorrow, we will agree that the democratic European Parliament will stand by the democratic Council of the European Union, will stand by the democratic Commission in that process, to defend our democracy against the criminality which is working to weaken us and our societies at all times."
"Madam President, I would like to make it plain, for Mrs in 't Veld’s benefit, and in order to nip in the bud any potential legends on the subject, that the rapporteur was in Israel until the evening of the Wednesday prior to the crucial meeting of the Council."
"It was on Wednesday that I had recourse to the telecommunications facilities and informed Mr Alvaro of our proposals by email."
"As far as I know, Mrs Roure did likewise."
"Mrs Kaufmann and Mrs Buitenweg were of the opinion that a deal had been done behind the backs of the smaller groups, but I would like to remind them that the European United Left and the Greens had already rejected the Committee’s compromise, and it is hardly productive to initiate negotiations with groups that are categorically opposed to a proposal; after all, they, as a matter of principle, will negotiate on all other matters with any group other than the Group of the European People’s Party."
"So let them stop talking about ‘deals’ and accept the democratic majority opinion in this House."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be held on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the Council’s annual report on human rights."
". Madam President, the Presidency warmly welcomes this debate."
"It emphasises the high priority which all EU institutions attach to the promotion and protection of human rights."
"It also recognises the immense importance of communicating the EU’s policies and actions in support of human rights clearly and confidently to the outside world."
"The then General Affairs Council decided in December 1998, on the 50th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that the European Union should enhance its actions on human rights, and that it should draw up an annual report on human rights."
"This year’s report – covering the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 – is the seventh such annual report."
"Its purpose is to provide an overview of the work of the European Union, through its institutions, in promoting human rights."
"It is, obviously, only able to highlight those areas where EU action has been particularly significant during the reporting period."
"It does not seek to be fully comprehensive and it does not try to duplicate information which is already available from, for example, EU websites, or to provide an account of action taken by individual Member States."
"But it does provide European Union citizens, civil society partners and governments and human rights defenders in third countries with a regular, accessible overview of EU concerns, priorities and actions."
"Much of the report focuses on the European Union’s promotion of human rights and democratisation as part of its common foreign and security policy."
"But, domestically, the European Union must also be consistent and coherent with the policies that it promotes abroad."
"We all recognise that, while much has been done to promote human rights within the European Union, there is still scope to improve."
"The report therefore sets out significant internal developments, including the continuing work to establish an EU Fundamental Rights Agency."
"And the chapters on thematic priorities, such as the human rights of women or human rights and business, include developments within the European Union, as well as those abroad and in multilateral organisations."
"The report also provides information on EU instruments and initiatives in third countries, for example, the EU’s human rights dialogues with China and Iran, and the new human rights consultations established during 2005 with Russia."
"It includes information on the wide range of activities implemented by the European Commission through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights."
"The report highlights that the EIDHR was created at Parliament’s initiative, and that Parliament has used its budgetary powers to increase substantially the resources earmarked for the protection of human rights and democracy."
"There is also information about policy development and specific action in relation to 17 thematic issues."
"These include areas where the EU has adopted human rights guidelines such as on the death penalty, torture, human rights defenders and the rights of children, including their involvement in armed conflict, as well as on other issues, ranging from human rights and terrorism to democracy and elections and the International Criminal Court."
"The report provides an overview of EU action in the key international organisations: the United Nations Commission for Human Rights and the UN General Assembly Third Committee, the OSCE and the Council of Europe."
"It also provides a country-focused perspective, with an account of EU action in its immediate neighbourhood, in Africa, in the Americas, in Asia and in the Middle East."
"The Council will continue to look for ways to improve its report."
"There were a number of innovations in 2005."
"The first – which, I am sure you will agree, was welcome, and perhaps overdue – was the inclusion of a substantive chapter outlining the extensive work that the European Parliament has done in support of human rights and democratisation."
"Everyone recognises that Parliament adopts its own annual report and resolution on human rights in the world and on the European Union’s policy."
"However, I think it is both right and helpful that readers of this report get a sense of how the Council, Commission and Parliament all contribute together to the common EU goal of promoting and protecting human rights around the world."
"I would like to repeat, at this point, the Council’s warm welcome for the re-establishment of Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights last year."
"I know how much the Council, and in particular its Working Group on Human Rights, values the contact and cooperation which is being established with that subcommittee."
"This year’s report also sets out, for the first time, to provide readers with practical examples of the EU in action."
"For example, the chapter on racism, xenophobia and non-discrimination includes information on an EIDHR project to combat discrimination against Dalits in Nepal."
"The chapter on the rights of the child includes a project to promote the rights of children in the New Independent States."
"We believe that these specific examples will help readers make the connection between EU policy and our ability to deliver real changes to the lives of real people right around the world."
"A further innovation this year was the introduction of some analysis of where EU action has worked well and, indeed, where there were gaps in our performance."
"A short analysis is provided at the end of each main chapter."
"It will always be the case that some internal reflection must remain internal, if the EU is to act effectively in, for example, UN negotiations or in its relations with certain third countries."
"But it is also important for NGOs and other key partners to have a sense of where we are content with our performance and where we ourselves want to do more."
"This analysis is a modest but useful step in that direction."
"Like any annual report, this one has its limits."
"Agreed by the Council in early October, it provides information on EU action up to June 2005."
"Events have obviously moved on since then."
"Our Presidency has sought to use the six months since June to build on the broad range of existing EU commitments."
"We have taken forward efforts to mainstream human rights throughout the European Union’s work."
"We have, for example, sought to implement the EU’s human rights guidelines, with a particular focus on freedom of expression, by action in support of those who defend human rights where they have suffered for exercising their freedom of expression."
"Within the United Nations, the EU is actively involved in negotiations in New York to establish a new UN Human Rights Council."
"There have also been many specific human rights issues and concerns which have been taken up over the past six months."
"We will look today, for example, at the situation in Tunisia."
"Many of these issues could be the subject for next year’s annual report."
"In conclusion, I look forward to hearing the views of the European Parliament and those of the Commission on the report itself, and on the various issues that it covers."
"We want to work to ensure that this report is right."
"But, more importantly we need to continue to work together to get EU policies and actions right, to ensure that we have real gains in human rights protection around the world to report in years to come."
". Madam President, I very much welcome the latest edition of the EU Annual Report on Human Rights covering the Union’s human rights activities for the period of June 2004 to June 2005."
"The special thing about this report is that, for the first time, it has been drawn up jointly by the Council, Parliament and the Commission."
"The Council and the Commission have been doing so in recent years, but, for the first time, Parliament is also associated with it."
"That gives valuable credit to the report."
"The EU Annual Report on Human Rights is a very important expression of the crucial importance of human rights policy in the overall policy setting of the European Union."
"It covers both the EU internal policy developments in the human rights dimension, in particular in the external and international dimensions."
"Its broad coverage of all major thematic and geographic human rights issues underscores the European Union’s strong attachment to the protection and promotion of human rights as defining principles of the Union across the board: as a community of shared values, founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law."
"Let me briefly touch upon some of these items."
"I have six points to make."
"This year is a crucial year for the future of the UN human rights system, with the ongoing negotiations on the creation of a new institution, the Human Rights Council, as a successor to the existing, widely contested Human Rights Commission."
"In pursuit of the UN Summit conclusions in September, it is without exaggeration the rarest of opportunities for the international community to club together to improve on the ability of the UN to monitor, improve and act decisively on critical human rights situations throughout the world."
"Had it not been for the European Union, it would not have worked."
"I was there at the start of the Millennium Summit."
"I know how difficult it was to come to an agreement, but there, the EU made the difference."
"Our expectations remain high as to the expected result, and our capacity to influence the world community positively should have a favourable bearing upon the negotiating process."
"However, we should be under no illusions as to the resistance many countries are putting up to improving effectively the current UN human rights system."
"We will need to mobilise all our energies and outreach efforts if we are to bring the current, rather difficult negotiations to a successful conclusion."
"The human rights dimension impacts increasingly on the European Union’s external relations with a range of countries around the world: the human rights dialogue with China; the dialogue with Iran – though, regrettably, we have not had a dialogue round for more than a year, but we hope to have one again; the human rights consultations with Russia; the local human rights dialogues at the level of the heads of missions of the European Union in numerous other countries; and, specifically, our developments under the European Neighbourhood Policy and its human rights related agenda under the various action plans, where a great deal is always concentrated and reserved for human rights."
"All this amply demonstrates that the European Union is not alone in actively pursuing its agenda of human rights promotion in its external policy: we are also seeing an increasing willingness by our partners to acknowledge that human rights protection is an essential feature of their own countries’ development."
"Still, much has to be done."
"In this context, I am often asked what these dialogues or consultations really achieve."
"My answer to that is as follows: as each round is completed, so another opportunity has been taken not only to exchange ideas – so important to our dialogue partners who do not wish to be preached to – but above all, for us, also to explain from our own hard-won experience how we, in the European Union, have adapted legislation and administrative practices in order to respect fundamental rights and how we expect our partners to take a similar path."
"I am convinced that, little by little, the message gets through."
"The dialogues and consultations allow the EU to raise and discuss individual cases of political prisoners or other persons suffering human rights abuses."
"On the basis of the European Community’s association agreements or partnership and cooperation agreements with third countries, the Commission regularly reviews the partner countries’ respect for international human rights standards."
"Indeed, the policy dialogues with many of our partners under these agreements include substantial discussions on relevant human rights and democracy related issues in partner countries."
"Our colleague has already mentioned some very concrete issues."
"The Commission has taken the initiative to establish – with some of those policy dialogues – working groups on human rights and good governance, within the framework of the regular Joint Committee consultations, for example, with Vietnam, Jordan or Morocco."
"I would like to draw your attention, in particular, to the five-year work programme on Barcelona, where important goals on human rights are indeed included."
"Moreover, as you are aware, all Community agreements now contain a specific human rights clause as an essential element."
"In this respect, the Commission is keen to ensure that the clauses are used as a positive tool to improve the human rights situation in partner countries."
"It is my belief that these structured exchanges on human rights offer a very promising way of realising the goals for which the human rights clauses have been included."
"Indeed, there will be times, in cases of widespread, egregious human rights violations, when sanctions need to be imposed or even an agreement suspended, such as in the case of Zimbabwe or Togo."
"However, generally speaking, we should avoid putting too much emphasis on a ‘mechanical’ approach to sanctions or suspension."
"Rather, it seems to me, the crucial point is to scrutinise systematically the human rights records of our partners and to induce them through political and assistance means to live up to their obligations under the human rights clause of the agreement."
"In that context, I am very grateful for the draft report on the human rights clauses prepared so assiduously by the honourable Member, Mr Agnoletto."
"His report will oblige all human rights actors within the European Union, and particularly within its institutions, to reflect further on their value and on the most appropriate way of using them."
"The EU Annual Human Rights Report also reflects the re-casting of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights for the 2005-06 period."
"The modifications to the programming under that initiative have been based on the result of a careful assessment and designed to respond in the first place to the demands of the potential beneficiaries of the initiative."
"As a consequence, four campaigns have been designed with a more flexible geographic coverage and integrating actions at global, regional and country level."
"Two elements are particularly dear to me: the stronger commitment to mainstreaming the rights of women and children, as well as the enhanced incentive for the effective participation of civil society organisations from partner countries in the developing world."
"At the moment, while the last contracts under the 2004 budget of this initiative are being awarded, the publication of the important calls for proposals for the 2005-06 budgets is imminent; indeed, they should be published any day now."
"At the same time, country-specific calls for proposals are going ahead, and the next annual report will give details of this exercise."
"The key point here is that the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, in its present and future forms, is an essential and integral part of the European Union’s overall human rights policy."
"The European Union derives great strength in its relations with third countries from unified positions on many human rights issues of strategic importance."
"I need think only of the guidelines we have agreed on the death penalty, torture, children in armed conflict and human rights defenders."
"These, used well, are excellent tools of great influence."
"I would therefore like to salute the efforts undertaken under the Luxembourg and UK Presidencies this year in orchestrating very effective campaigns under these guidelines."
"I would also like to salute the work of the many Commission delegations which contributed so effectively to the respective Troika demarches in the target countries."
"The same teamwork is true for the outreach campaign on the subject of the envisaged Human Rights Council – which I mentioned at the beginning – which was conducted in 77 countries."
"The more that the Union, its Member States and its institutions speak with one voice on human rights matters, the greater the political impact is."
"Therefore, we should not cease in our efforts, in the Council, in Parliament and in the Commission, to work together as closely and efficiently as possible."
"In that sense, we present this annual report and hopefully this is a stark reminder of the enormous challenges still lying ahead and the good work that has been done in the past."
". Madam President, I am glad to make a brief contribution to this debate."
"The Council’s 2005 report on human rights is a good summary of human rights activity and aspirations within the EU and the impact that such activity is having outside the Union."
"As the author of Parliament’s most recent human rights report, I was pleased to see almost all of the thematic issues raised in Parliament’s report dealt with in this document too, reflecting consistency of thought and priority."
"The death penalty, children’s rights – and, in particular, children in armed conflict – women’s rights and gender equality, the role of international business in human rights, human rights in the fight against terrorism and the role of the ICC in the fight against impunity are all issues that need to be given continued priority by consecutive Council presidencies and the Commission."
"I believe, if possible, we should be moving towards the creation of one substantial human rights annual report for the EU in future, representing the views of the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"It makes no sense for Parliament to duplicate the work of the Council."
"Our separate role should be to analyse critically the performance of the Council and the Commission in relation to meeting targets set out in key areas outlined in an EU annual human rights report."
"Parliament needs to be actively involved in drafting this report in future years and not merely presented with the finished article before it is published."
"Finally, while we are debating human rights in the EU for 2005, I cannot let the occasion pass without registering my concern regarding the need for clarity on the so-called CIA rendition flights issue."
"I am one of many Members in this House from EU countries that have facilitated the landing and refuelling of US aircraft – military and CIA – in recent years."
"As a spokesman on human rights, I would be a hypocrite not to demand clarity as to whether or not detainees have been transferred through EU countries to third countries where they may be at risk of torture."
". Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the UK Presidency for agreeing to present the annual human rights report to Parliament today, the first time this has been done since the Finnish Presidency in 1999."
"As this year’s parliamentary rapporteur on the annual human rights report, the President-in-Office is aware that it is my intention, rather than duplicating the Council’s work in this area – as Mr Coveney has already indicated – to strengthen collaboration between the Council and Parliament so that the European Union can send a stronger and more coherent message in favour of human rights to the wider world."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his support for Parliament’s subcommittee in his speech this afternoon."
"However, I invite him to indicate the Council’s willingness to enter into a debate with Parliament on our closer collaboration in relation to the annual report itself when he replies to this debate."
"The annual human rights report this year should be welcomed for its scope and honesty."
"In a year when the Council has evaluated the human rights dialogues with specific countries, the finding that the dialogue with China has had little, if any, impact is indeed a very important one."
"The report overall is stronger at stating actions rather than evaluating their effectiveness and I hope we will see greater use of human rights impact assessments in future years."
"At a time when the European Union has to stand firm in New York in seeking to strengthen support for a strong Human Rights Council in the United Nations, all of us could reflect on whether the European Union itself gives sufficient priority to human rights vis-à-vis the importance we give to trade and development in our own external relations."
"I remind the Commissioner that, despite her comments this afternoon, Parliament is still looking for her support to retain a separate legal base on the European initiative for democracy and human rights."
"I hope we will hear from her too."
"Finally, let us take one of the bloodiest events of 2005: the massacre of hundreds of people in Andijan on 13 May and the subsequent arrest and torture by the Uzbek authorities of seemingly anyone who might be a witness."
"The EU suspension of parts of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, the arms embargo and visa restrictions represent and categorically show to the world that this European Union can and will uphold human rights."
"Madam President, the EU’s foreign policy is based on the defence of peace, democracy, human rights and the state governed by law, and that is why we attach such importance to the political dimension of the Copenhagen criteria when we negotiate with the new Member States."
"In this area, the EU too has, of course, been extremely successful in disseminating these values."
"It is naturally more difficult when it comes to other countries."
"Even though human rights are always included in theory, it is difficult to achieve our objectives through dialogue."
"We have clauses but, as you know, Parliament has recommended that they be compulsory and be activated."
"We cannot be content merely to protest vaguely at events such as those in Tunisia in which fundamental human rights are grossly violated."
"Tunisia is a country closely associated with the EU."
"As we know, the human rights dialogues with China and Iran are going badly."
"Nor is such dialogue making any progress in Russia."
"Today, we have seen how our Sakharov Prize winners – the ladies from Cuba – are not being given permission to come here."
"I hope that the Council and the Commission can step up their protests against the dictator in Havana, who continues to mock the whole world."
"There is a lot more to do when it comes to Zimbabwe, Belarus, Burma, Saudi Arabia etc."
"We know, of course, that the EU, as a soft power, is fantastically powerful."
"We are the only international actor that really can bring about great things if we are agreed on the defence of human rights and values."
"Those around us expect us to have a common foreign policy through which we can play a role on the international stage and speak with one voice."
"This foreign policy, which takes the form of trade, aid and political and economic cooperation, must always be guided by respect for human rights."
"As democrats, we have a responsibility for making sure we combat lack of freedom and spread democracy and human rights as far afield as the villages of Colombia, Zimbabwe and North Korea."
"That is why this report is an important and constructive tool."
"I only hope that, in the future, it may become somewhat more strategic so that we obtain a still more cohesive human rights policy."
". Madam President, I, like my fellow Members, am delighted that we should be holding this debate today on the annual report on human rights."
"I am especially delighted by a new chapter focused on analysing the effectiveness of the European Union’s instruments and initiatives."
"This is precisely the angle chosen by the European Parliament to draft, in full cooperation with the political groups, its report for this year. This outcome demonstrates that, in over the next few years, we – the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament – will, in the long run, finally be in a position to draft a genuine joint report together."
"To reach this stage, it is important that a continual flow of information circulate between our institutions."
"I should like to emphasise, for example, the Council conclusions of 12 December, which informed us that the Council – we had no doubts about this – had, on behalf of human rights defenders, launched active lobbying campaigns under the leadership of the Heads of Mission in third countries."
"Well, it is very useful for MEPs to know to whom, when and how the Council and the ambassadors in third countries provide their support under the guidelines for the protection of human rights defenders."
"Another example: the Council compiles fact sheets evaluating the human rights situations in the various countries."
"Here too, the Council should pass on these fact sheets to Parliament so that the various delegations and committees might refer to them in the context of their everyday work."
"Another example: I read in this report that, for the first time ever, Chinese representatives had participated in the structured dialogue on human rights between the Union and China."
"In these conditions, I do not understand why Members themselves were not involved in this dialogue, and Members are, moreover, requesting that all representatives be involved in all of the dialogues, irrespective of the structure of these dialogues."
"As regards the Commission, finally, we are aware of the shortcomings of the European initiative for democracy and human rights, but I must say to you, Commissioner, that I have the gravest reservations and concerns in the face of the document currently being examined by the European Commission on the implementation of the horizontal programme for human rights."
"This document in no way meets the European Parliament’s expectations, any more than it meets those of the NGOs, as you will see …"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is very much to be welcomed that the EU has published an annual report on human rights for the past seven years."
"It is also right and proper to have adopted the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"At the same time, however, we should be wary of an attitude that was all too common in Communist times, namely that an office or agency should be set up every time a problem arises."
"This leads me on to something the Council representative mentioned a few moments ago."
"I refer to the question of whether there is in fact any need for a Fundamental Rights Agency."
"We have yet to see convincing proof that such a need exists."
"It is good news that the EU is cooperating with various bodies in the field of human rights, such as the OSCE and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights."
"It is bad news, however, that the EU’s actions sometimes amount to a acceptance of double standards."
"We consistently stand up for human rights in small and weak countries, but we fail to do the same in the case of large and strong countries."
"The reason for this is that we like to do business with the latter."
"We defend human rights in enemy and neutral countries, but we are not bold enough to speak out when human rights are violated in countries that are our allies."
"In addition, there are times when Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner fails to speak out, especially when it comes to regions and countries that are seen as strategic partners for the EU."
"I would call for some consistency in this regard, and for human rights, which belong to the EU’s fundamental values, no longer to be observed selectively."
"Madam President, the reason why the EU is accepted throughout the world as the voice of human rights is that, more than other institutions, it backs its words up with deeds."
"The Commissioner was quite right to describe as a key point the clause that is making human rights an essential component in trade and cooperation agreements with third countries."
"To date, 120 agreements of this kind have been concluded."
"The Report on Human Rights lists the major successes that were achieved in 2005, including such things as tighter export controls on material capable of being misused for the purposes of torture, or the campaign against child abusers who use the Internet for their own purposes, and the campaign for the recognition of the International Criminal Court."
"The report also, though, records such setbacks as the events in African countries – Sudan, Zimbabwe, Congo or Rwanda, for example – or in such Asian countries as Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Iran, and Burma."
"As before, China comes in for particular criticism; its attitude towards the freedom of opinion, religion, and assembly is not acceptable; critical journalists and lawyers are harassed, human rights activists persecuted, the accused denied fair trials and subjected to torture."
"Every year, it executes thousands of people."
"The situation in Tibet remains a horror of tragic proportions."
"The day after tomorrow, we will be having a debate in which we will be responding to the Chinese military interventions in a Tibetan monastery as a matter of topical and urgent importance."
"The EU’s Member States must at last stir themselves into action, rather than always abstaining as they have done hitherto in Geneva."
"China’s violations of human rights need to be on the agenda for the Human Rights Convention when it meets there."
"Terrorism, alongside civil rights, was the priority for 2005, and wholly justifiably, yet the maintenance of the rule of law is an absolute necessity, and not least as regards the CIA’s transporting of prisoners across Europe, about which we will be having a debate tomorrow afternoon."
"The absolute intolerability of any breach of the Human Rights Convention is but one of the messages from the report on human rights."
"Madam President, we are grateful that, for the first time, the Council’s report mentions Parliament’s actions in the field of human rights, because this Parliament does a lot."
"We are also grateful that you have come here to present it to this House."
"The Socialist Group had asked for this on many occasions."
"Thus, our report can be better geared towards the monitoring and evaluation of its commitments."
"We have had enough fine words and great speeches, because there are specific situations that require action and compliance with the commitments we have made, such as the European Initiative for Human Rights and Democracy, which has already been mentioned."
"What does the Council do with the resolutions that are adopted in this Parliament?"
"We have adopted three, with the one that we will adopt this week on Ethiopia."
"We have not received any response."
"What has happened about Guantánamo?"
"What action has it taken?"
"The lack of action is leading to many problems, despite the serious violations of human rights that are taking place."
"I could mention other cases."
"It is better to say less and to do more, because if we say too much people will stop believing us."
"This Parliament works extremely hard to ensure that its voice is heard, but in order for its voice to be heeded, we need you, and we need you to renew your commitment to European human rights policy, which is supposed to be a fundamental pillar of our external action."
"We are still awaiting many replies."
"Madam President, today we again debate human rights across the world and point out the deficiencies of others."
"However, I want to focus this debate on a flagrant breach of human rights perpetuated within this European Union specifically within the United Kingdom."
"Council Directive 2000/78/EC rightly prohibits religious discrimination in employment."
"Yet pursuant to a derogation under Article 15 of that directive, the United Kingdom Government is permitted to practise discrimination against Protestants in Northern Ireland who apply to join the Police Service of Northern Ireland, solely because they are Protestants."
"In consequence, hundreds of exceptionally qualified young Protestant applicants have been refused admission to the police, not on merit, but because there is not a matching quantity of applicants from the Catholic community."
"So before this House and the EU parade their human rights credentials, I say: let it set about righting that wrong, implementing the directive on employment in its entirety and ending the outrageous discrimination against the majority community in my country."
"Madam President, I am responsible in the Committee on International Trade for the proposed revision of the human rights clauses in partnership and trade agreements."
"Words are not enough; we need action."
"Far too often, the Council and Commission are not prepared to trigger the use of these clauses to pressurise third countries to address legitimate concerns."
"Can the Council and Commission look at the step-by-step ratcheting-up of pressure that can be built into a new, revised human rights clause?"
"The second point is that sometimes process failures interfere with product outcomes."
"We welcome the human rights dialogue with China and Iran."
"For two years the EU was the only place in the world that had a human rights dialogue with a deeply unloved regime in North Korea."
"Then the Council sponsored a resolution condemning North Korean human rights in Geneva without informing either the North Koreans or the Commission."
"As a result the dialogue was suspended."
"This year, we sponsored a new resolution on the ground that we have to have a resolution: we have no dialogue; we fail to recognise that we have no dialogue because we had a resolution."
"– Madam President, 10 December was International Human Rights Day, and recent events, in particular, have made it clear that much remains to be done."
"For example, the USA, too, should feel bound by minimum human rights standards and not circumvent them by means of secret prisons abroad."
"Within the EU, too, however, human rights violations continue to occur, particularly in the form of domestic violence, honour killings, polygamy and widespread discrimination against women, which we indirectly tolerate if we accept these as part of Islam in Europe."
"In Turkey itself, almost 80% of all women in rural areas are living in forced marriages."
"Discrimination against minorities and members of other religions continues."
"Given that, in 2004, more applications for asylum were received throughout the EU from people of Turkish than of Iraqi nationality and that, even in 2005, Turkey remains the second most common country of origin of asylum seekers in Germany, for example, it can in no way be assumed that human rights have actually been implemented in Turkish society; and this in a country that is negotiating accession to the EU."
"– Madam President, the future of the European Union, as a democratic community of principles and values, is linked to the consistent stand of the institutions and of the Member States in defending human rights, minority rights and democratic freedoms."
"The European Union needs, firstly, to take initiatives to shape a new, effective, institutional framework to defend human rights within the framework of the UN."
"Secondly, it needs to make the issue of the ratification and implementation of all the international conventions on the protection of human rights and abolition of torture chambers a high priority in its relations with third countries."
"Thirdly, it needs to help to shape an open and democratic global system of governance of the information society and to combat the digital divide which is creating new relations of dependence and hegemony between the developed and developing countries."
"Fourthly, it needs, without selective discrimination and expediencies in the Member States, to apply all the cooperation and association agreements and to implement the mechanisms provided for."
". Madam President, I would also like to thank the Commission and all the honourable Members who contributed to an impressive debate."
"I am always impressed by the range of human rights issues on which Members of the European Parliament are active."
"I am certainly encouraged by the commitment, not only that shown today but throughout, on these issues."
"I would like to deal with one or two of the specific points that have been raised."
"First of all, I welcome Richard Howitt’s suggestion, and Simon Coveney’s as well, that we should act on today’s useful exchange and hold further discussions on our two reports."
"A number of honourable Members have expressed a wish for a more active role for the European Parliament in the EU’s annual report on human rights."
"As reflected in the conclusions reached at its meeting yesterday, the General Affairs and External Relations Council welcomes the cooperation with the Parliament in developing and delivering its human rights policy during 2005 and looks forward to building on that relationship further."
"I will ensure that we give very serious reflection to the specific ideas that have been put forward and I am sure that we can find ways to deepen our dialogue."
"I want to emphasise that one of the EU’s great strengths lies in its variety of different institutions: they have different and complementary roles."
"The Troika often works to promote human rights in an intergovernmental framework."
"Parliament can bring its weight and views to bear in different ways and often with much greater flexibility."
"We greatly welcome such opportunities to share views and ideas."
"We particularly value our regular and open exchanges with the Subcommittee on Human Rights."
"We need to make sure our work is well coordinated and coherent, but we must also capitalise on our respective strengths."
"It is important to keep some distinction between the roles the different institutions can play in promoting human rights and democratisation."
"Glyn Ford raised an important issue about the way in which we use human rights clauses."
"The Council will look seriously at any issues put forward by the European Parliament."
"It is worth noting that their primary purpose is to provide a constructive platform for engagement with third countries on human rights."
"Suspension of any agreement is a last resort and is therefore very rarely used."
"Human rights clauses have been invoked in at least 12 cases since 1995 as a basis for consultation, suspension of aid or other measures involving 10 ACP countries."
"So obviously that is a weapon we are prepared to use."
"It has to be used discreetly and effectively if it is to bring results."
"I conclude by welcoming once again the strong commitment the EU institutions have shown to promoting human rights and to providing an effective report on EU policy and actions in this area."
"It is extremely valuable to have these opportunities to review collectively how we are doing and how we can do better."
"We look forward to continued close cooperation with the European Parliament as we take our human rights work forward in the months ahead."
"I am very grateful to all those who have contributed to what has been an extremely good debate."
". Madam President, let me try to round up this important debate, to which I personally attach great importance."
"Of course, there are still many challenges, otherwise we need not have this debate."
"However, the Commission uses specific instruments and I would like to give you a few concrete examples, because it sometimes seems that we are only using words."
"This is not true, we have many possibilities and we try to use them, but still much has to be done and we have not reached the end."
"For instance, we have an instrument through which EUR 180 million is used for promotion of justice and the rule of law, fostering a culture of human rights, promoting the democratic process, advancing equality, tolerance and peace."
"Secondly, we have country-specific cooperation programmes, to which a total of EUR 35 million has been allocated."
"Thirdly, grants of EUR 14 million have been awarded to international organisations, and we use these for campaigns."
"We also have a very important instrument for the EU election observation missions."
"Many Members know of it and its importance because they have been chief observers in different countries, although the chief observer does have a certain amount of independence."
"This instrument is allocated EUR 13 million."
"The Commission has been involved in presidential and parliamentary election missions."
"It has completed EU election observation missions to Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Burundi, the West Bank and Gaza, also to Lebanon, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Liberia."
"Other missions are currently under way, such as those in Venezuela, Haiti, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and again for the parliamentary elections in the West Bank and Gaza."
"The Neighbourhood Policy is my specific responsibility."
"There is now an instrument that provides a positive incentive."
"I can give 10% to 15% more if a country in the region, for instance Morocco or Jordan, is introducing more reforms in the human rights sector."
"I think this is important."
"With regard to the CIA, in general we are clearly of the conviction that terrorism can be fought only with full respect for human rights and the rule of law."
"Human rights are valid in every situation."
"We know that this is a difficult challenge."
"It is a challenge to maintain the right balance between improving the right to privacy and combating terrorism."
"We have to protect our people but we also have to protect the principles on which our society is based."
"Finally, with regard to the democracy and human rights instrument, I have often stated that for us the EIDHR is a flagship policy."
"Although it will no longer have a separate legal base, we have proposed a thematic programme for democracy and human rights, with global coverage and with visibility and unified programming, including a separate budget line."
"The proposed thematic programme would be identified within each of the proposed external action instruments."
"There will be a specific communication on this thematic programme, setting out the scope, objectives and political priorities, which will be presented at the end of January."
"I hope there is a chance of agreeing a complete overall package, which will enable the Council, Commission and Parliament to look forward."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on human rights and freedom of the press in Tunisia and evaluation of the World Summit on the Information Society held in Tunis."
". Madam President, I shall begin by thanking the European Parliament for proposing this timely debate on Tunisia."
"I would like to record our appreciation of Tunisia’s recent hosting of the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society from 16 to 18 November."
"We welcome the summit’s agreement to the Tunis Commitment and the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society, an important contribution to the global effort needed to bridge what is known as the digital divide."
"At the same time, it is right for us to consider more generally the issues of human rights and freedom of the press in Tunisia."
"The Council shares the concerns of Members of this House about the human rights situation in Tunisia and is well aware of the shortcomings in Tunisia’s performance, particularly with respect to acts of intimidation and harassment by the authorities against civil society and human rights activists."
"The meeting convened on Thursday, 1 December, involving MEPs, certain committees and other EU institutions involved in the summit, specifically to discuss human rights concerns in Tunisia, further highlighted the importance of these issues."
"Human rights is an essential element in the EU’s relationship with Tunisia, as set out in the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement, which came into force on 1 March 1998, and the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan which came into force on 4 July this year."
"Under its action plan, Tunisia has signed up to commitments in the area of democracy, good governance and human rights."
"Implementing these commitments will be an essential element in developing EU-Tunisia relations."
"They include, for example, the establishment of an EU-Tunisia subcommittee on human rights."
"To this end we continue to urge the Tunisians to establish and hold a first session of a human rights subcommittee as soon as possible."
"In addition to this, the EuroMed tenth anniversary summit on 27 and 28 November in Barcelona represented an important opportunity to help the EU’s Mediterranean partners, including Tunisia, to address the challenges of the 21st century, including in relation to good governance."
"At the EuroMed Summit, leaders endorsed an outcome-oriented five-year work plan."
"That plan included the creation of a governance facility to help those countries that make progress on good governance, allowing them access to additional funds to spend on their priorities."
"Tunisia is a state party to the six core United Nations human rights treaties."
"Tunisia scores well on most socio-economic indexes of multilateral institutions, and social and economic rights are recognised and protected."
"Tunisia plays an active role within international human rights institutions and was elected to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in April 2004."
"Tunisia has not yet, however, signed the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court."
"The EU welcomes Tunisia’s record of promoting reform in the Arab world, notably on the position of women and the right to education."
"However, the EU remains concerned about the human rights situation in Tunisia, particularly in relation to freedom of expression and assembly and the independence of the judiciary."
"This debate has raised in particular the issue of the freedom of the press in Tunisia."
"All books and publications, with the exception of newspapers, are still subject to censorship."
"Until May 2005, all newspapers had to clear articles with the Ministry of the Interior in advance of publication."
"Whilst this is no longer the case, we remain concerned that the fear of reprisals appears to have resulted in some self-censorship, as no newspaper offers any political criticism or opinion on domestic issues contrary to the government’s view."
"Access to foreign television, however, is common, as most Tunisian households have access to satellite television."
"As I already made clear, the EU welcomes the agreement on the Tunis Commitment and the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society reached at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis."
"The EU looks forward to working with all stakeholders to ensure the full and effective implementation of both stages of the summit process, both on substance and on follow-up."
"A number of incidents involving freedom of expression and freedom of assembly were reported in the run-up to and during the summit itself."
"The Tunisian Human Rights League, the oldest human rights body in Tunisia, claimed police harassment of its activists and says that it has been prevented from functioning properly."
"A court decision in September 2005 postponed its Congress."
"The EU consequently made representations to the Tunisian authorities and issued a statement reminding the Tunisians of the EU’s expectations of its human rights responsibilities."
"During the summit itself, the EU Troika made representations to the Tunisian authorities following an incident at the Goethe Institute, where NGOs were prevented from meeting to discuss plans for an alternative ‘Citizens’ Summit’."
"The EU is also concerned about a number of other incidents involving freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, also reported during the summit."
"These include the disruption of the activities of a Belgian TV crew, as well as the disruption of the European Commission workshop for MEPs to meet members of civil society in the summit’s conference centre."
"Tunisia’s Constitution provides for freedom of association, but within certain defined limits."
"The law provides for freedom of assembly, as long as a permit is obtained from the Minister of Interior."
"However, some NGOs experience difficulties in renting space and the control of funding."
"A number of associations have applied for legal status and have been refused, for example the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia."
"NGOs also report that Internet access is routinely blocked and e-mails addressed to certain e-mail accounts never reach the intended recipient."
"During the presidential campaign of October 2004, the electoral code prohibited Tunisians from discussing politics in the international press, and opposition parties were given little opportunity to campaign."
"Whilst recognising that the election law safeguards female representation in parliament as well as the representation of minority views, we noted that the overall process leading to the elections did not provide a level playing field for contenders."
"We therefore encourage the Tunisian authorities to continue to improve the framework for elections and to take the necessary steps to ensure that the next elections fully meet international standards."
"The EU is also concerned by reports from NGOs, including Amnesty International, about prison conditions in Tunisia."
"These reports state that overcrowding in prisons and discriminatory treatment of political prisoners continue as well as a lack of basic medical care, poor hygiene, torture and ill-treatment."
"We therefore welcome the fact that since June 2005 Tunisia’s authorities have allowed the International Committee of the Red Cross access to prisons."
"Earlier this year, the Tunisian authorities announced their intention to allow Human Rights Watch representatives access to prisons in a similar way to that of the International Committee of the Red Cross, although no timeframe was specified."
"The Minister for Justice and Human Rights also announced that the practice of detaining prisoners in solitary confinement beyond 10 days, the maximum allowed under the Constitution, would cease."
"The EU welcomes these announcements and hopes that both undertakings will be put into practice."
"I should also like to say a few words about the judiciary in Tunisia."
"Under its Constitution, it is independent."
"However, Amnesty International and others report that the authorities interfere in the judicial process."
"The trial in April 2005 of a lawyer and member of the National Council for Civil Liberties in Tunisia, Mohamed Abou, who wrote an article criticising Tunisia’s President Ben Ali, seems to support this contention."
"The Tunisian Magistrates’ Association has complained of increased intimidation by the Government after its board issued a communiqué criticising the attack on Abou."
"The Public Prosecutor closed the Tunisian Magistrates’ Association’s office in August."
"A law passed on 12 August 2005 making provision for the statute of magistrates does not take into consideration earlier calls by the Tunisian Magistrates’ Association concerning terms and conditions of service and would appear to weaken its position."
"We also note that despite several requests to visit, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers has yet to receive an invitation from the Tunisian Government."
"The EU wishes to work with Tunisia to support the modernisation of its judiciary."
"The EU has provided money through MEDA to fund a project that will support this work and hopes to see progress on this."
"I am sure that the Commission will want to say something about this."
"In conclusion, the EU welcomes the agreements reached at the World Summit on the Information Society as an important contribution to the global effort to bridge the digital divide."
"In terms of the EU’s relationship with Tunisia itself, we wish to see Tunisia maintain and develop its security and prosperity."
"We regret the serious restrictions on freedom of expression and association and the incidents which occurred prior to and during the World Summit on the Information Society."
"The Council should like to assure honourable Members that the EU will continue to express its concern over specific human rights violations and to impress on the Tunisian authorities the need for full respect for human rights and democratic principles."
"It is now time for us to look forward to the implementation by the Tunisian authorities of the commitments made by President Ben Ali on democracy, good governance and human rights set out in the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan."
"Implementation of these commitments will be an essential element in developing EU-Tunisia relations."
". Mr President, the Commission is very concerned about the situation of human rights and freedom of expression in Tunisia."
"What brings me to Parliament today is a series of incidents that occurred at the recent World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis, an event in which both Members of Parliament and the Commission were present."
"I must admit that I refer to those incidents with great regret, since we have to recognise that the host country made an enormous effort in organising the summit, which itself brought about a very positive outcome for the EU in the important field of the future of internet governance."
"The summit outcome is a success for the EU and it bears the ‘made in Europe’ stamp."
"The active participation of the Commission and the continuous coordination of the position of the 25 Member States, together with the UK Presidency, since the June Telecom Council, had a positive impact on the final agreement."
"We managed to push through our ideas, showing that the Europe which speaks with one voice is a Europe that wins."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has spoken with one and the same voice throughout the negotiations and has exerted a real influence on the debates."
"As regards Internet governance, the results of the Summit bestow on the world an agreement that covers such crucial aspects as freedom of expression and of access to information, security, and the fight against spamming."
"As regards the key functions of the Internet, it has been decided, consistent with the proposals made by Europe, to create two fora and two processes."
"On the one hand, the Internet Governance Forum, already known by the acronym IGF and, on the other, the process organising enhanced cooperation between governments on the political principles related to Internet governance."
"Governments have political responsibilities to fulfil."
"It is clear that they must not intervene either in the technical management of the Internet or in that of ICANN."
"The Commission is in favour of the Internet being managed by the private sector, as was demonstrated, for that matter, by the implementation of the ‘.eu’ domain."
"As regards the funding for combating the digital divide, an agreement has been finalised on the funding mechanisms, and priorities have been set in terms of promoting the importance of information and communication technologies in the context of the existing funding mechanisms."
"In other words, information and communication technologies will be an important tool in the future for our development policy."
"In the first quarter of 2006, the Commission will adopt a communication, the aim of which is to evaluate the results of the Summit and to show how the European policies will take account of them."
"In March 2006, the United Nations intends to start a wide-ranging consultation with a view to the preparation of the Internet Governance Forum."
"We, for our part, will actively consult with industry, as we have done in the past, and I believe that the European Parliament will be in a position to take responsibility for a substantial part of the consultation of civil society."
"As regards enhanced cooperation between governments – the second process – Mr Annan wanted first of all to know what the intentions of the United States and the European Union were."
"I confirmed that it was our intention to prepare an initial position statement at European level by mid-February."
"Together with the Member States, we must now define the process that will enable political principles in relation to Internet governance and the transparent and responsible implementation of these principles to be attained."
"Mr President, unfortunately, the summit was overshadowed by events that prompted the Commission to mark its strong disagreement as to the way the Tunisian authorities interfered with civil society events, creating difficulties even for the European Parliament-Commission Joint Workshop on Human Rights, not to mention the restrictions on expression experienced both before and during the summit."
"On behalf of the Commission, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has already expressed our concerns to the Tunisian Government, and we have pointed out that it was difficult for us to believe that the incidents were just the result of an ‘unfortunate’ misunderstanding."
"We also explained that in the absence of positive reactions it will be more and more difficult for the Commission to continue its constructive approach."
"Secondly, an EU demarche on human rights is being considered by Member States, and the Commission will participate fully."
"The intention is to express our regrets vis-à-vis the recent events and reiterate our demands of last October: first, to unblock EU-funded civil society projects; second, to make progress on the implementation of the judicial reform programme; and, third, to create a subcommittee on human rights."
"The reaction to the Tunis summit was brought up by President Barroso in his speech at the Barcelona summit."
"He expressed his deep regret at the attempts to stifle freedom of expression during the event."
"He stressed that ‘a society which cannot trust its own people is a weak and fragile one with little prospect of meaningful development’."
"These demarches represent our first steps."
"We have asked for specific gestures from the Tunisian side."
"At the beginning of next year, we will re-evaluate the situation with Member States and decide, in the absence of progress, whether further measures should be taken."
"I should like firmly to reassure you that the European Commission will continue its efforts to ensure that the provisions of the association agreement and of the EU-Tunisia Action Plan with regard to respect for human rights are duly implemented."
"We now have a new and more effective framework to tackle human rights questions: the neighbourhood policy."
"It is our firm intention, shared with the Council, to put the neighbourhood instruments at the service of improving the situation in the field of human rights."
"Finally, I welcome the good dialogue that we have had with Parliament on this issue."
"Our efforts in promoting democracy and respect for human rights in Tunisia will be all the more effective if we are able to send consistent and coherent messages."
"Mr President, Tunisia is a country that has an important relationship with the European Union."
"It is the first country in its region to sign an association agreement with the EU."
"However, the conditions and events which surrounded the recent World Summit on the Information Society have significantly increased existing concerns relating to human rights and freedom of expression in Tunisia."
"In the build-up to the summit, advocates for freedom of expression and association in Tunisia experienced increased harassment."
"There are also reports of summit delegates being harassed, assaults on Tunisian and international journalists, denial of entry into the country, the monitoring and blocking of certain websites, the censorship of certain documents and speeches and the prevention and disruption of meetings."
"Even MEPs and representatives of the European Commission reportedly experienced intimidation and verbal aggression."
"While we recognise that Tunisia faces a certain threat from extremist elements and is trying to deal with that threat, it must do so in a way that respects human rights standards and democratic standards."
"The European Union has a special responsibility to insist on that through dialogue."
". Mr President, as the head of our parliamentary delegation at the World Summit on the Information Society held in Tunis, I should like to testify to the leading role played by the Union in terms of the progress made in the international negotiations."
"The enhanced cooperation of the Member States has enabled progress to be made with regard not only to the introduction of an Internet Governance Forum, which will meet for the first time in Athens, but also to the democratic balance between the Member States, to pluralism and to the involvement of civil society."
"Human rights and fundamental freedoms constitute the essential foundations of Internet governance and of the action plan."
"It is on the basis of the proposals made by the Union and, more specifically, by the Commission, that an agreement was reached in Tunis, not least with the United States."
"I should like to pay tribute to the Commission’s negotiators and to sincerely thank the Commissioner for having involved the European Parliament in this process."
"Nevertheless, I regret the fact that the only shadow cast over this Summit should have come from Tunisia itself."
"The serious incidents that surrounded the Summit and that undermined not only the freedom of the press and freedom of expression and of assembly, but also the people are, in my opinion, unacceptable, as are the events targeted at our delegation including, in particular, the sabotage of the Workshop on Human Rights in relation to Internet governance."
"They run counter to the commitments made by Tunisia in the Summit conclusions and in the Association Agreement, thus violating the reciprocal character of these commitments."
"These events call for a swift and firm response from the Union, and I call on my fellow Members to vote in favour of the compromise resolution, which demands that practical measures be taken immediately."
"I thank the Commissioner for the very precise remarks she made just now along these lines."
"Mr President, as Commissioner Reding reminded us, the fact that Tunisia undertook to organise what must have been one of the biggest ever global summits cannot go unheeded."
"You acknowledged yourself, Commissioner, that the World Summit on the Information Society produced valuable results; it also had a spin-off, a focusing effect."
"It is not possible to accredit 30 000 people and hundreds of journalists without attracting the attention of public opinion."
"As Tunisia came under this spotlight, we became acutely aware of the imbalance that exists there between the treatment of human rights and fundamental freedoms and the undeniable progress that Tunisia has been making in the fields of economic and social development, education and training and equality between men and women."
"The Union has long been monitoring these things, because Tunisia is a partner of ours and was one of the first countries to conclude an association agreement with us."
"In our opinion, its development has been exemplary, and we reiterate the wish expressed in our last resolution, adopted in September, that the development of respect for human rights should keep pace with the observable progress in other areas."
"All we are asking, in other words, is that Tunisia honour the contractual commitments it has made."
"It is not in our interests to hurl invective, nor would we wish to do so."
"We simply seek to guarantee instruments of dialogue, as Mrs Reding emphasised."
"We are prepared to help in the realm of justice through the MEDA programme; in the spirit of the resolution that will be adopted by our Parliament and on the basis of the values we seek to share, we want to have access to instruments of dialogue such as the Association Council and the Subcommittee on Human Rights, so as to ensure that our Tunisian partners are aware of the message – still a restrained message – that this House is about to convey to them."
". Mr President, I am pleased that we are holding this debate today."
"It comes in the wake of the numerous violations of human rights that accompanied the World Summit on the Information Society which, as we know, took place in Tunis."
"Let me recall them briefly: human-rights activists and journalists were harassed, action was taken to prevent the convening of a citizens’ summit, telephone connections were cut off, e-mails and Internet access were blocked, the speech delivered by the President of Switzerland was censored, other international figures were deported, among them our Sakharov Prize winner Robert Ménard, and so on."
"Let us remember that these violations are not isolated, one-off occurrences but routine everyday practice in Tunisia."
"The human-rights situation in Tunisia is deteriorating – as we noted, by the way, in our resolution of 29 September."
"These latest incidents, I believe, are a direct challenge to the policy of the European Union on democracy and human rights in that country, which was the first signatory of an association agreement containing the famous Article 2, and we must rise to that challenge."
"The Council has certainly made representations on several occasions, but it is truly regrettable that no public move has been made to denounce the violations of human rights that have taken place and to lend essential support to the incredible mobilisation of civil society, parts of which, incidentally, are represented today in the European Parliament."
"We consider it important that the Commission and the Council undertake, firstly, to convene a meeting of the Association Council as soon as possible in order to discuss the human-rights situation and the practical consequences of the observed violations and, secondly, to initiate discussions, in the true spirit of the action plan, on a timetable of reforms in the areas already referred to, a precise timetable with deadlines for measurable results: result number one is the reform of the judicial system; in this context, we must demand the release of the lawyer Mohammed Abou and of all political prisoners in Tunisia as well as an end to the harassment of the Tunisian Magistrates’ Association; result number two is the removal of restrictions on the activities of civil society; number three is cooperation with UN mechanisms."
"These are the minimum requirements if we are to meet the challenge confronting us."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, democracy is effectively a complex process and one which not even our own governments have ever achieved fully."
"However, as far as the Tunisian Government is concerned, I believe that the level of non-achievement is particularly significant and that very specific action has to be taken."
"We are in fact seeing the symptoms of a virtual police state, where democratic rights and principles are denied."
"For months, European funds intended for the Tunisian League for Human Rights and other associations have been frozen."
"The defenders of human rights, whom I applaud today because they are here with us in Parliament, have described to us the political intimidation and physical threats to which they are subjected."
"Freedom of the press, as we have seen at this latest conference, is non-existent and torture is practised in Tunisian jails."
"The opposition has no way of making its voice heard and all demands for democracy and reform are suppressed."
"We therefore ask the Commission, which has shown courage in its informal contacts, to do much more and take steps to have the EU-Tunisia Association Council convened without delay."
"Mr President, we shall be voting against this so-called compromise resolution, which I am rather inclined to call the ‘Flautre resolution’ since it seems to be so closely aligned with the text presented by the honourable Member."
"The manifest aim of the resolution is to make an issue of minor incidents, and I do mean minor incidents, that occurred during the World Summit on the Information Society, a summit which took place in what we – and we are not alone in this – considered to be entirely satisfactory conditions."
"Why should Tunisia be hounded like this when so many states around the world with which the European Union has better relations and which, in some cases, it is preparing to welcome into the fold, display far less respect for fundamental freedoms than the Tunisian Government?"
"Why Tunisia?"
"The answer is simple. It is because Tunisia is succeeding only too well and, in the eyes of certain powers – and, alas, of some simple souls they manipulate – Tunisia poses a risk on three counts."
"First of all, Tunisia is a model of development, and one wonders whether certain superpowers are not out to destroy any Arab country that is on the way to development."
"Secondly, Tunisia is a model of Mediterranean cooperation."
"It is no coincidence that it was the first country in that part of the world to sign an association agreement with the Union, and there are some who, in the name of the well-known theory of the clash of civilisations, might have an interest in setting one side of the Mediterranean against the other, given that unity in the Mediterranean region would allow the wider Euro-African area to prosper."
"Lastly, Tunisia is a model of cooperation in the French-speaking world."
"French is the language of its development, but, as we saw at a meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly in Rabat only a few days ago, some would prefer French to give way to English as the one and only international language."
"By rallying round the systematic detractors of Tunisia, such as Mrs Flautre, and by attacking a country which, I repeat, has been exemplary, this House will convey the impression that it seeks, under cover of cooperation and respect for human rights, to harden positions on both sides, which will ultimately foster Islamic fundamentalism."
"This is what is currently happening in Iraq through the agency of the West – or, to be more precise, Washington and its accomplices – and it is a process which first Egypt then the Maghreb countries might experience too."
"Our involvement in that would not serve the interests of the European powers; on the contrary, it would expose our peoples to the effects of terrible divisions in our common maritime region."
"Mr President, I was privileged to be part of the European Parliament’s delegation in Tunis."
"Indeed I was also at the Geneva Summit and was able to follow the project through."
"I share the regret expressed by Mrs Reding and my colleague Mrs Trautmann about what I regarded as the entirely unnecessary disruption of our meetings in a country that clearly has embraced many aspects of the digital revolution, as the previous speaker said."
"I could not understand why it was felt necessary to do that."
"I want to concentrate on some of the achievements of the summit and, in particular, the policy that I called for after the Geneva Summit, which relates to how we can spread the capacity for computer science and research to the developing world so that they can develop their own products."
"We in the European Union have been hugely successful in the way that we have offered the benefits of our own networking technology through spreading the Géant Network to the developing world and also encouraging the development of open competitive markets to deliver high-quality services at competitive cost."
"That is a major achievement."
"It was sad that, even so, this was a workshop full of professors and university researchers where the Tunisians chose to restrict attendance."
"It was unnecessary and took the shine off it."
"I admire Mrs Trautmann for the robust way in which she stood up to the interventions at our meeting."
"It was a pleasure to watch her."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, if there is one cause for rejoicing in the aftermath of the recent Tunis summit, it is the beneficial effect the summit has had in convincing the world of something too many people refused to accept – and still refuse to accept, in fact, judging by what I have just heard – namely that democracy is flouted in Tunisia on a daily basis."
"When I questioned the Commission and the Council on my return from a mission to Tunisia, I was indeed astonished at the timidity of their responses to what can only be described as a violation of the partnership agreement between the European Union and Tunisia, at least of the clauses relating to human rights."
"I trust that this timidity is not directly linked to other objectives, such as the organisation by the Maghreb countries, as some would wish, of a kind of policing system for our borders to curb illegal immigration."
"I am nevertheless pleased with the statements I have heard today, especially those from the Commission."
"Beyond these statements and the resolution we must surely adopt on this subject, I hope that we shall have the opportunity to see the establishment and rapid adoption of specific mechanisms in the form of an Association Council and a Subcommittee on Human Rights."
"I shall close, Mr President, by simply asking that civil society in Tunisia, which is treated with utter contempt today, be associated with this human-rights committee."
"It would be useful to give it the opportunity to express its views to this recently created body."
"( Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can draw two lessons from the Tunis Summit."
"First and foremost, an assessment of what happened: this was a summit focusing on the issue of a knowledge-based society, debating how new technology and services can be used to develop a high-technology society that seeks to spread greater freedom, give opportunities to all and ensure access to information and knowledge – just look at the computer designed for the so-called developing world – and to expand areas of freedom."
"With a summit of this sort and goals of this nature, the events in Tunis appear even more discordant, more unpleasant and more serious."
"In the middle of a discussion on ways of increasing freedom and respect for rights, we actually found ourselves facing behaviour that clearly curtailed freedom, showed intolerance and prevented debate."
"That was a serious matter."
"We ask the Commission and Council – which have already done so – to take a firm stand against what occurred, and point out that our association agreement with Tunisia also includes a section on human rights."
"Finally, I should like to give my assessment of the negotiations and the next phase."
"Commissioner, we believe that significant progress was made, thanks to the role played by Europe, but we ask – and believe – that more should be done in relation to the commitments given and the forum to be held in Athens."
"We must be increasingly aware that Internet governance also requires Europe to find greater strength and cohesion in order to resist – if I may use the term – or in any event to respond in a positive manner to those who are today in dominant positions and try to trample on our European notion of balanced development and pluralist governance, with its respect for diversity, which, even in societies based on knowledge and technology, allows democratic principles to prevail."
"Mr President, allow me to use the debate to reveal certain unhealthy trends in EU policy towards the Middle East."
"We all know that Tunisia has a secure constitution."
"Women have rights to possess, inherit, vote and divorce."
"Islam belongs to everyone and cannot be used as a political monopoly for one political party."
"We all know that on the occasion of the World Summit on the Information Society, journalists, defenders of human rights and lawyers were intimidated and heavily beaten by security forces."
"We all know about President Ben Ali’s long and complicated struggle with An-Nahda – an extremist, radical, pro-terrorist movement which combines its influence with the far left and quite clearly threatens the regime and democracy in Tunisia."
"Nevertheless, we should use this opportunity to send a clear message not only to President Ali, but to many other rulers in the Middle East."
"We must firmly support every possible means to struggle and fight against Islamic radicalism, extremism and abuse of power to explain and present the general truth to everyone."
"But we must not allow friendly countries, friendly presidents and friendly regimes to misuse our support to wipe out, kill and destroy a diverse, democratic and secular opposition."
"The drive for democracy must be based on local ownership and respect for local sensitivities."
"No respect should be paid to undemocratic practices in which human rights are abused, particularly the right of freedom of expression and criticism, the freedom to gather and to obtain information."
"We cannot deal with the threat of terrorism, with abuse of the right to explain the truth to everyone and with frustration until we say very clearly that every man and woman should be free to express himself or herself clearly, openly and democratically, be they Tunisian, European journalists or Tunisian human rights activists or lawyers."
"State monopolies on newspapers, state monopolies on financing all newspapers, radio and TV channels clearly contradict what we call the ‘information society’."
"This should be our friendly message to our friend President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali."
"Mr President, I should like to pre-empt certain criticisms and reassure Mr Coûteaux that the media will not engage in a systematic lynching of Tunisia."
"On the contrary, we socialists believe that, with regard to a country that has undoubtedly made impressive advances in the socio-economic sphere, it is important to welcome a veritable democratic outcry on the part of the trade unions, the human-rights organisations, the judicial authorities and lawyers."
"The momentum they have generated can surely lead to the realisation of freedom of expression, association and assembly."
"This renewal is epitomised by the 18 October Movement and its intention to set up a permanent forum, with which the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wish to be associated."
"It has often been said that the Barcelona process was a partial failure, and it is true that we were timorous."
"Europe is struggling to propagate its ideal of democratic pluralism."
"In this respect, Tunisia is a gift to us, almost a model."
"The Tunisians are not calling for our help, but they do want more democracy."
"Can we support these people who have been striving, and sometimes waging fierce struggles – as social struggles always are – to open up and relax a regime that tends to close in on itself, a regime which, in the name of the fight against terrorism, stigmatises all defenders of human rights and prevents judges, prosecutors and lawyers from holding meetings and forming associations?"
"Can we fight to ensure that no socialist regime is able to invoke its membership of the Socialist International in order to trample on human rights?"
"I have only one request: that the issue of human rights and the rule of law in Tunisia play a key role in the deliberations of the Association Council which is due to meet in January 2006 and that no one beat about the bush."
"Mr President, I would like to begin with a reference to Commissioner Reding’s final comment, calling for coherence."
"I believe that this is the key: the key question and the key issue."
"The case of Tunisia is not just any case."
"A few days ago we expressed our regret — as has already been said — that, in the assessment of the Barcelona Conference on the Euro-Mediterranean process, insufficient progress has been made in terms of moving forward on the construction of a European area of respect for human rights and promotion of peace."
"In the case of Tunisia, we are not dealing with an absence of civil society."
"The problem is that civil society is not being allowed to express itself with complete freedom."
"And to me this is the fundamental aspect."
"If the European Union wants its message, its debate and its Euro-Mediterranean policy to be coherent, it should not send out the message that the situations we have witnessed over recent days are being ignored, in particular during the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunisia and the arrests of several leaders of human rights organisations."
"To me, therefore, coherence is a fundamental issue which we must not leave out of this debate."
". Mr President, I can sum up this debate fairly briefly and, I hope, at a reasonable pace."
"The European Union wishes to see Tunisia maintain and develop its security and its prosperity."
"We welcome Tunisia’s record of promoting economic and social reform, notably on the position of women and the right to education, but we need to continue to work with Tunisia on a number of human rights issues and see progress made, particularly in the areas of the right to expression and association."
"We will continue to work with the Tunisian authorities to implement the commitments on democracy, good governance and human rights that it signed up to in its European neighbourhood policy action plan."
"As I made clear earlier, implementing those commitments will be an important element in developing EU-Tunisia relations."
"I thank the Commission for its contribution and, indeed, each of the Members of the European Parliament who have spoken in this debate."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the honourable Members of this House for their staunch support in respect of two issues on the agenda – their positive backing of the quest for Internet governance and their critical stance on the human-rights situation in Tunisia."
"It must be recognised, as some Members have said, that economic and social reforms have been a Tunisian success story, but there is also a need for Tunisians to rise to the challenge of a trailblazing role in the field of human rights, and there is still a long way to go on that score."
"The Association Committee will meet at the start of next year."
"A meeting of the Association Council will follow, and we fully intend to put human-rights problems on the agenda."
"As for the Subcommittee on Human Rights, Tunisia has accepted its creation."
"Informal agreement has been reached on all points other than the individual cases, and I believe this is important in the light of the discussion we have had."
"Following the debates that are currently taking place within the Council, we shall make a formal proposal to Tunisia."
"May I thank all the European Members of Parliament who have demonstrated their solidarity with all those in the Council, the Commission and Parliament who are committed to ensuring that human rights and freedom of expression become a reality and not a political football for the governments of this world."
"In spite of the very deplorable events that occurred in Tunis with regard to human rights, the summit had a gratifying outcome."
"In future, the two processes – the stakeholders’ forum and enhanced intergovernmental cooperation – will enable us at any time to put on the agenda issues relating to the freedom that can emanate from information and communication technology and to make that freedom a reality in every country of the world."
"Six motions for a resolution(1) have been submitted by the following groups: the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"( Tunisia is a critically important partner for the dialogue between Europe and the Arab world."
"A fundamental premise of this cooperation is respect for human rights, as enshrined in the EU-Tunisia Agreement, which entered into force in 1998, and the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan inaugurated this year."
"The Tunisian Government has always shown itself to be particularly open and willing to accept its commitments towards the international community in the field of human rights, democracy and governance, as shown by the recent establishment of the EU-Tunisia Human Rights Subcommittee and the country’s willingness to agree to organise the World Summit on the Information Society."
"Tunisia is actively party to the six main United Nations treaties and, compared with other Arab countries, it makes a point of maintaining a secular state and of protecting its citizens’ social and economic rights."
"Greater efforts are, of course, still needed to achieve a level of freedom worthy of a fully democratic country – episodes like those that have just occurred are proof of that – but we must in any event acknowledge the efforts and the progress made so far and assure Tunisia that it has our full support."
"I did hear you."
"Commissioner, the floor is yours."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0343/2005)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission:"
". Mr President, I understand the message from honourable Members, but I strongly disagree that we have not answered the question; indeed, we have."
"If the answer is not convenient for the honourable Member, that is something else, but I have answered and I will answer again."
"The Premier League sells rights to its matches to media operators throughout the world, including a large number of EU countries. Premier League football is very popular, for example, in Ireland, and the Premier League has changed its rights policies as regards Ireland as a result of the Commission’s intervention."
"To put it plainly, there is a clear cross-border element, which the Commission was well placed to address when the case began in 2002."
"Whether there are a couple of lawyers or far more than a couple, that is up to them; we are willing and able to deal with this case and have had some success, for we have solved a problem in which competition was harmed."
"A meeting was held in the Palacio de la Moncloa on the night of 6 November 2005 between the Commission President and the Spanish Prime Minister, on the latter's initiative. This meeting was not made public and came to light only several days later thanks to the persistence of the media."
"As has been acknowledged by both sides, the topics discussed at the meeting included the question of the authority competent to settle the case involving Gas Natural's takeover of Endesa."
"A matter of hours afterwards this item was withdrawn from the agenda for the meeting of the College of Commissioners on 9 November 2005 and postponed to the meeting on 15 November, when the final decision was taken to leave the takeover bid in the hands of the Spanish authorities."
"It subsequently became known that the Competition Directorate-General had prepared two contradictory drafts on the case."
"How does the Commission believe that this series of events might affect its image as guarantor of neutrality and objectivity in defending the Community interest?"
"Total payments against the 2005 commitment for decommissioning of Ignalina nuclear power plant will amount to only 50% of the total."
"This represents a substantial under-consumption of the payment appropriations planned in the 2005 budget."
"This is largely due to the fact that the Fund Manager (EBRD) for IDSFs failed to establish accurate payment forecasts."
"What does the Commission intend to do to avoid this type of problem and improve the services of the Fund Manager in the future?"
"I would prefer not to give you too precise a figure, Mr Hegyi, because up to now some EUR 100 million have been invested through the framework programme for research and development, and the programme will continue with the seventh framework programme for research."
"I can also tell you that the Civitas programme has received a great deal of financial support from the Commission to encourage the exchange of good practice."
"We will see what policy for greater support we are able to adopt when the White Paper is revised."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply and ask him if he would give particular attention to integrated ticketing on urban transport."
"In Dublin, for example, we have a commuter train, a rail network, a Luas tram and public buses. So far, there is no integrated ticketing system to be used on all four."
"Would he consider making Dublin a study and promoting the whole question of integrated ticketing, so that people would use public transport more often and it would become more efficient?"
"This is a very pertinent question, Mr Mitchell; there really should be integrated ticketing. However, urban and interurban transport is really a question of subsidiarity."
"What we need to do is to encourage the exchange of good practice between our European cities in order to find the best solutions."
"Thank you for raising this issue, which is very important for our citizens."
"Questions Nos. 61 to 72 will be answered in writing(1)."
"As the author is not present, Question No 73 lapses."
"At the meeting of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organisation held on 28 October 2005 in Chisinau in Moldova, Turkey, as a full member, once more vetoed an application by the Republic of Cyprus to attend with observer status. It is also continuing to obstruct Cypriot accession to the International Export Control Regime."
"In view of the specific undertakings given by Turkey within the negotiating framework, in particular paragraph 7, adopted by the Council of Ministers on 3 November in Luxembourg, what view does the Commission take of Turkey's continued refusal to meet EU conditions even after commencement of the negotiation accessions? What measures will it take to ensure that Turkey complies fully with the Community acquis and European law in its dealings with an EU Member State?"
"In connection with the increasing signs from several Member States of the emergence of a black market in antiviral drugs against influenza, can the Commission indicate what steps it is taking against this irresponsible action by individuals and/or organised groups?"
"Mr President, in view of my lack of experience in this Parliament, I would like to know, purely by way of information, on what the written reply you have mentioned is based, because one of the questions is by myself."
"Is this a decision by the Commission, or is it something laid down in the Rules of Procedure?"
"I am happy to satisfy your legitimate curiosity, Mr Yáñez. We are applying the Rules of Procedure strictly."
"When the questions to a Commissioner exceed the time allotted, we move on to the next bloc and all the others have to be replied to in writing."
"Questions Nos 84 to 126 will be replied to in writing(3)."
"– Mr President, I understand that you are applying the Rules of Procedure, and quite rightly so, but Commissioner Rehn has only been given 12 of the 20 minutes allocated to him for his replies. I have the 76th question and you have prevented the Commissioner from replying to my question, which was the next question, even though you only allowed 12 of the 20 minutes to which he was entitled."
"I am afraid that that is not possible, Mr Matsis."
"It is gone 8.00 p.m. and the Commissioner is going to be late for an unavoidable commitment. That, therefore, concludes Question Time."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I am here above all to state my support for the compromise achieved and to recommend colleagues to vote in favour of it."
"Obviously we could – or perhaps should – have gone further. Charging for infrastructure will yield all its benefits only when two principles can be fully combined: the principle of ‘the polluter pays’ – and on the roads negative effects arise in terms of the environment, safety and congestion – and the broader principle of 'the user pays'."
"Only by combining these two principles can the two aims be made to converge, namely allocation, which in our case means influencing the modal shift, and recovery of the inherent cost of charging."
"Today’s compromise only provides for application of the ‘user pays’ principle."
"In terms of ‘the polluter pays’ we shall just have to be satisfied with the fact that the shift from financing infrastructure out of general taxes to financing it at least partially out of tariffs is a precondition for any internalisation of external costs, which we have been promised after yet another in a long series of evaluations by the Commission, which, as we have been repeatedly told, will be completed within the next two years."
"However, there are also other types of reference in the measure to the principle of ‘the polluter pays’."
"The reference is clear where variations in the amount of the toll are permitted in relation to the emission category to which the vehicles belong and to the day or time of use of the infrastructure, or rather less obvious where the possibility of a toll mark-up is allowed where a route crosses sensitive areas such as mountainous regions. Incidentally, this latter rule can certainly help overcome difficult situations such as that currently affecting the section between Turin and Lyon in the Susa Valley."
"Paradoxically, however, this directive addresses environmental problems, congestion and safety most effectively through a surrender of competence: it has been decided not to treat urban areas in the same way as sensitive mountain regions, yet on the other hand the full compatibility of the Eurovignette has been recognised, with urban tolls Ken Livingstone being used directly to regulate congestion and combat pollution."
"It is a first step; let us just be grateful for that."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately I cannot support Mrs Wortmann-Kool’s report."
"Despite all her valiant efforts, her work is a series of assumptions which clearly do not support the introduction of the Eurovignette."
"This is a worrying new tax which the Union is seeking to impose – this time on commercial road transport – in the absurd belief that it will help to re-level the competitive playing field with rail transport, producing those environmental benefits to which we all aspire."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to condemn what is happening in the Susa Valley in Italy, where those who should be giving energetic support to rail transport, as they did with the decisions on corridors, are now trying to place obstacles in its path, moreover using somewhat questionable methods."
"Basically, I view the Eurovignette as the first obvious direct tax which the European Union wishes to impose and which could open the door to other unacceptable taxes."
"I shall therefore vote against the proposal."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, for the work she has done and, above all, for the result that is on the table today. A result that, if all goes well, will be the end, for the time being, of a long and laborious negotiation process."
"It is provisional because a great deal of homework is yet to be done in terms of external costs, one of the key bottlenecks. The Commission will need to develop a calculation method for the external costs within two years, upon which a fresh initiative will need to be taken."
"Some will claim that compromise Amendment 37 does not go far enough."
"Needless to say, I have a great deal of sympathy for this viewpoint, having myself tabled, in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, an oral amendment that goes much further with a view to keeping the pressure on in order to make quicker progress in terms of external costs, the well-known 60% rule."
"We scrapped this in the compromise, which means that things will all take a little longer."
"This may be a concession, but this is offset by the fact that the Council, in its common position, had not made any reference to external costs, and had to make a U-turn without there being any turning back now."
"The principle of external costs in toll charges will be accepted and applied."
"This is surely considerable progress on the road to fairer competition between the modes of transport, with the underlying principle being that the polluter pays."
"Combined with the fact that the revenue from toll charges will be used for investments in the whole of the transport system, and thus not only roads, means that possibilities are being created for alternative modes of transport, such as rail transport and inland shipping, which is a giant leap forward."
"Madam President, I warmly congratulate Mrs Wortmann-Kool on her tenacity and flexibility, which are the greatest virtues in terms of achieving fair and balanced agreements such as the one that is being presented to us."
"I would also like to congratulate the Council and the British Presidency on their dynamism and on the efforts they have made to achieve a good agreement. We would like the same kind of results to be achieved in other fields as well."
"It is also proper that I should congratulate the Commission and, if Commissioner Barrot will allow me, I would like in particular to congratulate the Director-General, Mr Lamoureux, who will be greatly missed and whose great contribution we wish to acknowledge."
"The truth is that the impressive European achievements and progress in the field of transport now carry his mark. We thank him in particular."
"With regard to the Eurovignette, we welcome the political signal represented by breaking the taboo of external costs. It is a small step, certainly, but it is essential to the future."
"We are impatiently awaiting the Commission’s study and we hope that it will be credible and acceptable to everybody, and also to the outlying countries, whose special circumstances and distances we hope will be taken into account."
"Madam President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Parliament as a whole for this rewarding debate, which has confirmed the broad support that the compromise negotiated between our three institutions enjoys today. I would like to congratulate everyone, more especially your rapporteur, on this outcome, which represents undeniable progress, although I know that some of you would have liked to obtain even more."
"This agreement is an important step forward and, thanks to Parliament, the next stages for the formal internalisation of external costs have been defined."
"The Commission will have to model the best approach to this question, and then it will make an evaluation to analyse its impact."
"It will do this over the next two years."
"The Commission will use that analysis to make whatever proposals seem appropriate so that external costs can be borne internally."
"This agreement is in keeping with our strategy for sustainable development while encouraging our economies to be competitive and guaranteeing the principle of equity: if the user pays, he must not pay twice."
"Moreover, the sums raised will, so far as possible, have to be used for sustainable transport. One of you spoke of a compromise, but it is a compromise that may be considered a commitment."
"That is the word I will use. For me as Commissioner, this compromise is a commitment for the future, a commitment to work for a mobility compatible with the demands of sustainable development."
". – The proposal tabled by the European Commission on the rights of persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air was timely, and I, as a shadow speaker for the Liberal and Democratic Alliance for the Europe Group of the European Parliament, agree in principal that the rights of persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air should be regulated on the European Union level."
"It is no secret that disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility are discriminated against in respect of other passengers, not only whilst booking flight tickets but also when boarding planes."
"Therefore, I believe that implementation of the new directive will prevent such discrimination."
"I also believe that by approving this report we will ensure equal travel possibilities for disabled persons and those with reduced mobility and will regulate the provision of such services at the European Union level."
"Persons with reduced mobility will no longer be groundlessly refused to book a flight or board a plane."
"Furthermore, specially trained personnel will provide such persons with assistance tailored to their personal needs, and, most importantly, such services will be provided free of charge; the responsibility will lie with a single institution which will ensure that such services are provided continuously and to a high standard."
"I congratulate Mr Evans and I thank him for the possibility of constructive cooperation."
"I believe that the compromises achieved will contribute to passing the legal acts at first reading."
"We knew of and were familiar with these difficulties. In fact, it is a sad reflection of a society that it has to pass its own directive to clear the obstacles to the journeys of people who are disadvantaged enough in their lives as it is."
"I should like to thank my colleague Mr Evans."
"He has done a tremendous job, and we enjoyed a marvellous working relationship."
"I should also like to thank the organisations representing disabled persons, which stood by our side and gave us good tips."
"In addition, I wish to ask the Member States to drive the implementation and entry into force of this directive forward as quickly as possible at airports, in particular, and make it a real Christmas present."
"."
"Madam President, the changes to the sugar regime will achieve the double whammy of destroying the livelihood of sugar producers in Member States and in the developing world."
"According to in the UK, next season, British sugar beet growers will start facing deep price cuts and the possibility of factory closures."
"One of the ACP countries, St Kitts and Nevis, has already stopped sugar production and it will not be an isolated case."
"The chairman of the ACP Sugar Group, Mr Arvin Boollel, has said that, following the EU decision, it is very likely that we are all going to suffer from the St Kitts and Nevis situation."
"He said: ‘We have been shot in the legs and asked to run the marathon’."
"He is the Agriculture Minister of Mauritius, one of the many developing nations subject to the EU’s scandalous fishing agreements."
"Only EUR 40 million is on the table. The ACP countries call it peanuts."
"The Jamaican Foreign Minister, Mr Knight, described it as a miserly approach, a very evocative and relevant thing to say at this time of year."
"It will not be a sweet Christmas for sugar producers, be they in East Anglia or East Africa."
"They all know that if the EU and its Scrooges are the answer, it must have been a stupid question."
"Madam President, perhaps Mr Wise might support an amendment to shift EUR 40 million from the compensation package for UK farmers to the ACP countries to provide us with the EUR 80 million we are asking for in this report."
"The reform of the sugar regime has caused considerable turmoil in a number of Member States, including my own country, Ireland, but they have been bought off with billions of euros."
"Whatever dislocation the reform of the sugar industry is causing in the European Union, the impact on ACP countries, and people there who are already poor and barely subsisting, could be catastrophic."
"Like many others in this House, I am deeply concerned that the financial reference amount of EUR 40 million, earmarked by the Commission for 2006, is grossly inadequate."
"Commissioner, a promise of more in 2007 is simply that: a promise."
"It carries no weight whatsoever in this House or anywhere else, given the turmoil the financial perspectives are in at the moment. We must avoid robbing Peter to pay Paul."
"The money we find for the ACP countries has to be new money. It should be made available immediately and it should be complementary."
"Our declarations of wanting to make poverty history have to be backed up with actions and with hard cash."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"Madam President, it is very tempting to offer all of Europe’s poorer regions vast subsidies, but perhaps we should remember that West Germany has already spent some EUR 900 billion trying to create a level playing field for their relatively small neighbour, East Germany. That should ring serious alarm bells, but we are turning a deaf ear."
"The eight eastern European countries that have already joined the EU, plus Bulgaria and Romania, have been promised EUR 139 billion out of the total structural funds budget of EUR 336 billion for the period 2007 to 2013."
"An exhibition that the Dutch Presidency put on in Brussels last December predicted that another ten impoverished countries will join the EU by 2022."
"Based on Germany’s experience, the costs will be absolutely astronomical and attainable only if the big three Member States – Germany, Britain and France – are prepared to impoverish themselves in the process."
"It is about time we scrapped this whole crazy idea and helped out those poorer countries by creating opportunities for increased trade, tourism, etc."
"I can well believe that Tony Blair will agree to impoverish Britain in his quest for European popularity, but I cannot imagine Mr Chirac doing the same thing to France."
"– State aid is normally seen as something detrimental to competition."
"The Treaty of the European Union acknowledges, however, that such aid is acceptable when it is intended to contribute towards the economic development of those regions in which the standard of living is well below the European average. The principle whereby active public policy is justified when it is intended to boost social cohesion is thus enshrined."
"While the free functioning of the market brings benefits in terms of economic development, it alone cannot ensure development."
"In terms of regional policy, therefore, this kind of state aid could serve to support the least favoured regions."
"Accordingly, given that state aid and regional policy are complementary, they need to be brought closer together. In this regard, I agree with the rapporteur that regions affected by the statistical effect should be subject to the same arrangements as the convergence objective regions."
"I turn now to globalisation, which has brought a fresh problem to the EU’s table, to which I have repeatedly drawn the House’s attention. The problem centres on the fact that regions and sectors built, economically speaking, on manufacturing, run the risk of being wiped off the map."
"In order to redress this trend, the EU has put forward the idea of the globalisation adjustment fund, an initiative that I support, albeit on the proviso that it be implemented only in regions that, according to likely trends, are at acute social risk."
"This fund must therefore be highly selective and applied only in exceptional circumstances."
"The focus must be on those regions that fulfil three key characteristics at any given time: high rate of population concentration, high unemployment and specialisation across a range of sectors."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparation for the European Council in Brussels on 15 and 16 December, including the Development Strategy."
"To this end, we welcome the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso."
"No member of the Council is here yet, unfortunately: they must be finishing off their preparation of the new British proposal."
"– Mr President, I wish to rise on a point of order, to offer the Presidency the opportunity to request that this debate be rescheduled for this afternoon."
"It is my understanding that the President-in-Office, the European Affairs Minister, intended to be with us this morning to discuss the preparations for the Presidency and yet the Presidency-in-Office did not intend to unveil its budget proposals until this afternoon."
"We have had the great pleasure of debating with one of the more assiduous and intelligent European Affairs Ministers who has come before this House."
"To engage in some kind of shadow boxing when we do not know what the proposals are seems to me to be really quite ridiculous and a waste of our time."
"The Presidency-in-Office is not here to be able to make this request."
"I hope it will be here later."
"Mr President, I hope you will seek an assurance from the Presidency-in-Office that it will have proper debate with us and outline what it intends to put to the Council as a budget proposal."
"Thank you, Mr Watson."
"For the moment, we would not be so much boxing shadows as boxing a void, because the representative of the Council is not yet here."
"Nevertheless, I have been told that he is on his way and that there are traffic problems."
"I therefore assume that he will be here in a few minutes."
"With regard to your request for the Council to refer in its speech to the new proposal which is apparently going to be made public today, I must inform you that yesterday, at the lunch to mark the end of their Presidency, I asked the British Presidency to do that, since it would appear strange to Parliament that a new proposal that is going to be made public today should not be included in the debate, since it would surely be a merely formal debate."
"I did not receive a guarantee but I did note a degree of understanding that I imagine will in practice lead, at least, to a foretaste of what the Presidency is going to say later."
"If that is not the case, I certainly believe that Parliament would have good reason to feel under-valued."
"Furthermore, I do not believe that we should suspend the sitting now, Mr Watson, since I know that the Minister will be with us very soon."
"I hope that the common sense and sense of humour of which the British are so proud will help them in their speech and that they can tell us what is going to happen later."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to convince you that tomorrow’s European Council is a crucial stage for Europe."
"We identified the immediate challenges at Hampton Court; we must now provide ourselves with the resources to meet these challenges, and that is what is at stake in the financial perspective."
"I will return to the financial perspective shortly, but allow me first of all to say a few words about other important issues to be addressed at the European Council."
"At Hampton Court, we discussed the way in which Europe can prepare itself for globalisation."
"We agreed to restart our work in several areas, in particular research, universities, demographics, energy, immigration, security and external relations."
"I will report to the European Council on the work under way following the informal summit."
"In this context, I would draw your attention to a few key issues."
"Yesterday, the Commission put the finishing touches to the revision of its sustainable development strategy."
"The aim is to increase the level of ambition of this strategy by making sure that the latter is implemented more effectively."
"The most important factors are as follows: to see to it that all Community policies are underpinned by the principles of sustainable development; to make a firm commitment to accomplish the aims by scheduling regular meetings between our institutions with a view to taking stock of the situation and of reviewing the Member States’ practices; and more systematically to involve the main actors in the area of sustainable development, and not only the institutions, but also the world of business – which must make significant efforts – as well, of course, as the regional and local authorities."
"The Commission will work closely with Parliament and the Council to prepare as well as possible for this important stage."
"You can count on my personal commitment and on that of the College."
"In this context, the success of the Montreal Conference comes as very welcome news."
"It shows that the European Commission’s and the European Union’s leadership in the context of climate change has borne fruit."
"I shall now turn to the issue of growth and employment in the context of the new Lisbon Strategy."
"The Commission is pleased to observe that the renewed strategy for growth and employment is now well under way."
"The national programmes that have been established show that the Lisbon Strategy’s new system of governance is beginning to be integrated by the Member States."
"I should now like, for my part, to note the following points: there is clearly a very close link between the economic challenges we identified at the informal summit and those that the Member States are identifying in their national programmes."
"The Commission will assume all of its responsibilities in its report in January by explaining in a clear and constructive way the strengths and weaknesses of these national programmes."
"It will also make sure that it singles out good ideas and practices that everybody could use."
"Another important, and extremely topical, issue is that of immigration."
"The Commission is determined to make progress in the development of a horizontal approach to migration issues."
"This approach would consist of looking at immigration from the angle of prosperity, solidarity and security within the European Union and of doing so in close cooperation with the third countries concerned."
"This is the spirit of the communication on an action programme relating to legal immigration, which the College is to debate next week."
"The Commission also welcomes the comprehensive strategy to combat terrorism, which should result from the forthcoming European Council."
"The instruments recently proposed by the Commission with regard to information exchange, the interoperability of databases or the protection of critical infrastructure should be adopted and implemented as soon as possible."
"We desperately need these instruments in order to strengthen the effectiveness of our action."
"This is, once again, one of the areas in which there is distinct European added value when viewed in the light of the contribution Europe can make to the action carried out at national level."
"Finally, I am very pleased that the three institutions should be in agreement on the initiative taken by the Commission with regard to the European consensus for development."
"As you know, this consensus will also – we hope – be the subject of the European Council conclusions."
"For the first time in 50 years of cooperation, this European consensus for development defines a common set of values, principles, aims and resources designed to eradicate poverty."
"With the adoption of the European Parliament’s resolution on the European Union’s development policy statement, this consensus becomes a genuine European tripartite statement on development."
"Today, the seal is set on an agreement promoting development."
"We must now take the promises of extra money and apply them in specific ways in the real world."
"The Commission will actively call on the Member States to honour their commitments. We not only made these commitments between ourselves, but also at the United Nations."
"Once again, we are proud, as Europeans, to champion this dossier at international level, but we must now turn this ambition and these commitments into practical measures."
"I am now going to speak to you about the of this European Council: the financial perspective."
"As you know, whenever I speak about financial matters I switch to English!"
"I have been doing that for the last month, so I shall now continue in English."
"We all know what is at stake this week."
"This is the opportunity for Europe to show its citizens that it is capable of deciding on tough issues, that it can meet their expectations and that it will hold true to its values."
"The Commission has set out its ideas."
"Parliament has done the same."
"Now we are waiting for the Council."
"Any further delay and implementation of our policies will be delayed."
"Policies delayed are policies denied."
"I know that there are other technical options for keeping spending programmes going, but let us be frank: these are temporary measures only."
"The Europe of today needs greater security and ambition for its new priorities."
"The Commission is playing its role."
"To unblock negotiations in October, I set out five proposals which have helped to kick-start discussions."
"On Monday I set out to Prime Minister Blair and other national leaders and to the President of this Parliament principles and 12 specific proposals to reach what I believe can be an ambitious and fair agreement this week on the financial perspectives."
"I welcome the support I have received within this House and amongst the Member States for the Commission’s position."
"I want to set out today where the European Council should focus its attention in the coming days."
"We need an ambitious Europe."
"The Hampton Court Summit showed the scale of the challenges before us and the role which the European Union must play in meeting them."
"But we must be coherent."
"Having defined the objectives, the Member States must now provide the means to achieve them. To support enlargement, we need investment; to support reform and modernisation, we need investment; to increase trade liberalisation, we need investment."
"Ambition is not realised through communiqués and great and grand statements."
"It needs action."
"And action needs means and instruments."
"Europe’s credibility is severely damaged when some do not put their money where their mouth is."
"A modern budget needs to recognise the realities of an enlarged Europe, so it must support growth, with cohesion policy focused on competitiveness."
"It must support Europeans adjusting to globalisation, immigration and the threats to security."
"It must avoid reversing recent reforms, such as the shift to rural development in agriculture, and it cannot downgrade the essential task of reconnecting with our citizens."
"Heading 3b of the financial perspectives is not an optional extra; it is of central importance to the Union’s work."
"There is another direct consequence of a tight budget."
"It makes it all the more essential that every euro be used to best effect, and seven years is a long time."
"We must not close the door to sensible adjustments in the future."
"With our original proposals, the emphasis Parliament’s resolution put on flexibility was prudent: at much lower levels it is indispensable."
"The European Council must leave room for these issues to be debated within Parliament and the Council, as the two arms of the budgetary authority."
"The principle of flexibility should be carried through to the review clause."
"I said in June that this will be essential in reaching a deal."
"I remain convinced of that."
"We need a comprehensive, ambitious and open review clause."
"Of course, any change must be agreed unanimously, but it is essential that this Commission and this Parliament have the opportunity to launch a genuine debate, without taboos, about the future of the European Union’s spending and resources."
"The budget also needs to be fair: fair in spending, but fair in contributions too."
"I think that we have come a long way in this respect, with a true recognition that the impact of enlargement on the budget has changed the situation."
"Now we need one further step to ensure that the burden of that impact is genuinely shared."
"That means further movement from the British side on their abatement."
"That will be crucial to reaching an agreement."
"That change should be linked to enlargement and, since this enlargement is permanent, so should the change be permanent, just as it was when the United Kingdom agreed changes to its abatement in 1988 and 1999."
"One aspect of last week’s proposals which concerns the Commission is the creation of parallel rules: one set for the Europe of 15, one set for the rest."
"This creates a very unfortunate effect."
"A two-speed cohesion policy, with one set of rules focused on competitiveness and another on financial transfers, is not the way to build a competitive Europe or a cohesive Europe."
"We need to ensure the coherence of our instruments."
"If there is some differentiation – and in some cases we need differentiation – it should be based on objective criteria in terms of the relative development of the Member States or the different regions, and not on those who were already members and new members."
"The European Union we want to build is not the European Union of old members and new members, it is a Union of all members with exactly the same dignity, and that is a very important point."
"Making exceptions and special arrangements not only undermines coherence, it creates new risks for financial management."
"As you know, we take our accountability to this House and to the public at large very seriously."
"We take seriously the fiscal pressure on the Member States."
"The Commission made great efforts to develop a package of measures which were simple and comprehensible and will permit high standards of control."
"Alongside the revised financial regulation, they aim to make programmes more user-friendly and more efficient, so I regret that the principles of value for money and sound financial management seem to be sacrificed in order to achieve an agreement."
"The proposals on managing cohesion policy and voluntary modulation must be revised."
"Sound management can also be undermined if cost-cutting takes the easy way out and targets administration."
"It is simply not credible to suddenly bring to an end the process of bringing our institutions up to speed with the last enlargement, and still less credible to make zero provision for Bulgaria and Romania."
"I have to tell you, very frankly, that I know it is very easy and popular – I would say demagogic – whenever there is a need to make some cuts, to make those cuts in the administration."
"But in the next financial perspectives, we have to accommodate Bulgaria and Romania in all the institutions: in the Commission, in Parliament, in all the rest."
"I have to say that we do not have the resources now for that."
"So, if you want to have Bulgaria and Romania, we should have this in our budget."
"I know that you share many of the concerns I have set out today."
"I know this because many of them echo your own resolution and your own comments."
"I welcome Parliament’s position."
"It contains sound principles and imaginative solutions which can only make agreement more likely and results more effective."
"I am determined to do everything I can to help the European Council reach agreement this week."
"I urge the Presidency, with its special responsibility, and the Member States to show the courage and determination to reach a deal which matches our ambitions."
"I fervently hope that when I address the Conference of Presidents next week our task will be to chart the path towards an interinstitutional agreement that will take Europe into the next decade with real confidence."
"But we must do that with confidence and ambition."
"I myself, you in this House, and, I hope, all here today will always reject the narrow, nationalistic vision of a mini Europe."
". Mr President, let me begin by apologising to honourable Members for the momentary delay in my arrival here from the airport this morning."
"Let me also assure this House that I have listened with great care to the statement that we have just heard from the President of the Commission and I look forward to the contributions of honourable Members to this important and timely debate that we are having here today ahead of the European Council."
"This week’s European Council in Brussels takes place at the end of a tumultuous year for the European Union."
"It has been a year in which the voters of France and the Netherlands rejected the draft Constitutional Treaty; a year in which the need for Europe to face the realities of a globalised economy has become ever clearer; and most tragically, a year in which terrorism has once again struck in the streets and trains of a European capital."
"But Europe has responded."
"We have developed a clearer sense of our common response to globalisation."
"We have shown a sheer determination, which Mr Schulz has been generous enough to acknowledge in previous debates in this Chamber, in the face of terrorism which has reaffirmed the strength of our solidarity, our democratic values and our common resolve to see those values triumph."
"We have asserted Europe’s truly global role and responsibility, whether it is in New York, in Montreal last week, the Gaza Strip, or in Aceh, Indonesia."
"The United Kingdom has been truly proud to hold the Presidency of the Council during these last six months."
"Let me put on record, on this occasion, our gratitude to the Members of this Parliament for the cooperation they have shown in facing this challenging but shared agenda."
"The primary task facing the European Council this week is both necessarily and appropriately to agree the financial perspectives of the European Union for 2007-2013, to which the President of the Commission directed the majority of his remarks this morning."
"It has always been one of the key challenges of our Presidency."
"Following the failure to reach political agreement last June, we listened to the calls of those, not least in the new Member States, who underlined the importance of agreement being reached by the European Council this year, and we have worked long and hard towards that end."
"The proposals we put on the table a week last Monday, which were discussed by foreign ministers first in the informal conclave last week and then again briefly at the General Affairs Council this week, are challenging for Member States – I acknowledge that – and so, too, will be the revised proposals which we will table later today."
"Those revised proposals will be realistic, too, given the budgetary context in which most Member States are now operating nationally."
"Let me be candid: the room for negotiation is narrow."
"We remain convinced, on the basis of our extensive consultations with other Member States, including at the level of Heads of Government over the last week when a number of Heads of Government came to London and there was a range of bilateral contact beyond London, that these proposals remain the best and only basis for agreement within the Council and subsequent discussion with Parliament."
"They are an important and necessary step in the direction of a modern, reformed budget, fit for the purposes of the 21st century, about which our Prime Minister spoke so eloquently on the eve of the British Presidency at the European Parliament."
"The review we propose to hold of all Community expenditure in 2008 and 2009 offers us a chance to assess the global and domestic challenges which the Union faces, where and how Community action and spending can best add value to national and regional efforts, and how the resources to sustain that spending can be most fairly found."
"It is an important opportunity for us all, for this Parliament, for the Council and the Commission and our European citizens, to consider the best way forward."
"Amidst all the debate in the press and the media, let us keep our eyes on the very considerable prize before us: a budget that enshrines a fundamental shift of spending towards the new Member States, EUR 260 billion in receipts for the new Member States over the next seven years, EUR 2 500 for every man, woman and child."
"The economic dynamism of those new Member States is already truly an inspiration for us all."
"The new flexibilities we have proposed for the structural and cohesion funds should ensure that more of the allocations to new Member States can be spent and that each euro absorbed by Member States, their regions and their cities can have more impact."
"This will deliver greater improvements in the infrastructure and skills which this Union collectively will need if it is to rise to the global economic challenge and if it is to deliver the social justice which all of our people rightly demand."
"Future financing lies at the heart of this week’s European Council, but it is not the only issue, so let me briefly touch on other points to be discussed by our Heads of Government this week."
"First, there is the follow-up to the October informal Heads of Government meeting at Hampton Court."
"At the summit we agreed to make more concrete progress in a series of key areas: boosting research and development with the creation of a European research council; improving our universities and their links with business; creating a more competitive energy market; examining how migration can boost our economy; how we can use more extensive and better quality child care to give people a fairer balance between work and family life; how we can re-skill workers to meet the global challenge, and how we can strengthen Europe’s place in the world and our collective security."
"President Barroso and High Representative Solana will report back to Heads of Government on the progress made and on the next steps."
"Let me pay tribute to the work that they have already done and the close cooperation they have offered on those and so many other issues in the course of our Presidency."
"Secondly, there is the issue of economic reform."
"Here we continue to work closely with the Commission in pursuing the jobs and growth agenda for Europe."
"This has borne fruit these last few months with the launch of the Lisbon national reform programmes, setting a forward-looking agenda of reforms for every Member State."
"The summit will welcome this progress, as well as the significant steps taken already on the issue of better regulation."
"That includes simplifying European Union legislation, both for citizens and for European businesses, and underlining our common responsibility as Council, Commission and Parliament to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens."
"Thirdly, we will adopt a Europe-wide counter-terrorism strategy, creating a clear and coherent framework for the European Union’s work on counter-terrorism and setting out concrete objectives for action."
"The strategy enhances the European Union’s work to prevent people turning to terrorism."
"We will adopt an action plan to tackle radicalisation and recruitment by terrorist organisations."
"It will work to protect further the European Union citizens and infrastructure."
"We will put in place a programme for protecting critical infrastructure right across Europe from terrorist attack."
"It improves the European Union’s efforts to disrupt terrorists and their terrorist networks, in particular combating terrorist financing."
"The strategy will help the European Union build its ability to respond to a terrorist attack by improving our crisis management capability and coordination."
"The Council hopes that we will have reached agreement on the measure on data retention, on which we have worked very closely and effectively with this Parliament in recent days and months."
"Next, the summit will set out a global approach to migration."
"This is an approach that learns the lessons of the events of the last few months and is informed by the discussions we had here in the plenary debate in October."
"It focuses on the problems of Africa and the Mediterranean but does not exclude the important and necessary cooperation which we need to foster with other regions."
"It identifies priority actions for the Union to take so as better to help countries of origin and transit to manage migration better and to combat illegal immigration."
"Fifthly, let me highlight the regular report on European security and defence policy to the Council."
"The report will register the difference our European missions are already making on the ground, including the two latest missions: in Aceh – our first in Asia – and on the Rafah border crossing in Gaza, a practical manifestation of the Union’s longstanding commitment to the lives and freedoms of the Palestinian people."
"The European Council is also expected to adopt an overarching declaration on that area of the world – the Middle East."
"This will renew our commitment to a secure, prosperous and peaceful Middle East, as well as our efforts to support political, social and economic reform within that region."
"The declaration will reflect what the European Union has achieved over the course of our Presidency: the first ever EuroMed Summit in November, which has set the agenda for our future relations with our southern Mediterranean neighbours, support for disengagement from Gaza, building Palestinian institutional and security capacity, launching the European Union border assistance mission to Rafah and increased European Union engagement with Iraq."
"But it will also set out the continued challenges that we face in that region: the search for peace between Israel and its neighbours, the political processes within Iraq and Lebanon, Iran’s nuclear programme – a subject that we have debated here in this Chamber – and ending support for groups that use violence."
"Let me just pause here to note that the Presidency has been unequivocal in its condemnation of the comments attributed to President Ahmadinejad of Iran which relate to Israel, firstly saying that Israel should ‘be wiped off the map’ and then denying the Holocaust and calling for Israel to be removed to Europe."
"The comments are wholly unacceptable and we condemn them unreservedly."
"They have no place in civilised political debate."
"Finally, Heads of State or Government will also adopt a comprehensive global strategy for Africa, tackling peace and security, governance, regional integration, trade and development assistance."
"It will refocus the Union’s relationship with Africa to cover the whole continent."
"It will be a fitting end to a year in which the continent has taken centre stage in the European Union and internationally, and in which we have seen extraordinary popular calls for change throughout Europe to make poverty history."
"The European consensus on development is the second theme of today’s debate."
"It is right that we should return to the subject of development as we approach the end of this year and the end of this Presidency."
"Over the course of the year the European Union – already the largest provider of global aid – has again demonstrated the leading role which it plays in this area of work."
"The European Union set the tone for the Millennium Review Summit with its commitment from the International Development Ministers to increase aid back in June, a decision that was then ratified by Ecofin."
"As the consensus on development shows, however, this is not the time for us to rest on our laurels: we must not only spend the money but also spend that money well."
"This tripartite declaration sets out the aims and principles guiding European Union development cooperation efforts."
"The first part is a political declaration that sets out common objectives, principles and methods for delivering development cooperation at both Member State and Community level."
"The second part guides the implementation of development aid at Community level."
"The Council and the Commission agreed the consensus on 22 November, following extensive discussions between all relevant European Union institutions and after consultation with other key stakeholders, including European civil society."
"We hope Parliament will agree to this today so that it can be a truly joint tripartite declaration."
"The Presidency would like to extend particular thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Wijkman, for his commendable efforts to ensure Parliament’s substantive and constructive input to this important text."
"This agreement would be the first time we would have a common European Union approach to development, which will guide the actions of the Community and all 25 Member States."
"The consensus focuses squarely on poverty eradication to help meet the Millennium Development Goals, on partner country ownership, on ensuring we provide more effective aid and on joined-up policies to promote development."
"This agreement is particularly important, given that the European Union already provides over half of all global aid and is set to provide two thirds of aid by 2015 on the basis of the commitments that have now been made."
"The consensus also sets out a revised EC development policy which clarifies the Commission’s role and establishes where it adds value."
"It ensures that we give priority to the poorest countries and that we take into account development objectives in all other policy-making that affects developing countries."
"The consensus is an important political statement, against which all parties can be held to account."
"I hope that it will receive your support."
"This will, frankly, be an important but difficult European Council, but, approached with flexibility and vision, we can make significant progress on some of the most important issues facing the Union and set the scene for further work by our Austrian and Finnish colleagues in the coming year."
"I will listen with great interest to the points that you make and ensure that they are narrated back ahead of what will be important discussions in Brussels towards the end of this week."
"Minister, as I imagine you know, this plenary sitting is intended to prepare for the European Council that will take place this weekend."
"The Presidency regrets that you have missed an opportunity to inform Parliament of the proposal that you are going to make shortly."
"I asked this yesterday of your Minister responsible for relations with Parliament, and I believe that it is a shame that this request has not been granted, undoubtedly reducing the significance of this debate."
"I regret that I did not take any notice of the proposal that you made at the beginning of the sitting, Mr Watson."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, that this Chamber is so splendidly decorated today is not in celebration of the achievements of the British Presidency, but because we shall shortly be welcoming the winners of the Sakharov Prize, who do so much, and so outstandingly, for the cause of human rights in the world."
"That the President-in-Office has arrived rather late is not something I want to use as an occasion for criticism; it simply shows that he too is subject to human limitations, but it does also show, symbolically, how the Council generally is a latecomer where the practical politics of moving Europe forward are concerned, and, if we are to have the results we want for Europe, we would like the Council to get up earlier in the morning."
"The President of the European Parliament said, to great applause, that it would be nice if we were to be informed about what is going on now."
"I presume, Mr President-in-Office, that the fact that you waited until midday to present your proposals for the Financial Perspective indicates that you have chosen a time after this debate in order to allow what emerges from it to influence your proposals."
"I hope that it will."
"The Group of the European People’s Party would like to see a result for the Financial Perspective, but the crucial thing for us is that that result must be an acceptable one, and the reason why this is so is that Europe, after the difficulties we have had in various areas, needs renewed success."
"We would point out, Mr President, that we have as yet nothing to show for it."
"As you said, the President of the European Council, Tony Blair, gave an eloquent speech; indeed he did, and was applauded for it by many in my group, perhaps by more than in the group to which he politically belongs."
"Style is, of course, important, and I would certainly concede that the British Presidency – whether in the person of the Home Secretary or any other minister, not to mention the Prime Minister and President of the European Council – has been good at getting its message across."
"We have been getting along well with each other in this House, but style on its own is not enough."
"If style is not backed up by political substance, then it is the substance that loses out and must come in for criticism from us, and that is why we hope that results will be forthcoming from what you do in Brussels tomorrow and the day after."
"We were told by the British Prime Minister, the President of the European Council, that more must be done for research."
"Indeed so, but it appears to me from the British Presidency’s proposals that what is now provided for research is less than what Mr Juncker offered us."
"Where, then, is the logic in what the British are doing?"
"We see it as crucial, and as cause for rejoicing by all of us, that there are among us representatives of the eight Central European countries that joined the European Union on 1 May 2004."
"We believe that it will be crucial to see whether what you on the Council propose – on the assumption that such a proposal is made – actually expresses European unity and solidarity, for if there is no such solidarity, we will be obliged to reject your proposal."
"For us, solidarity and the community of Europeans come first and there can be no first- and second-class Europeans."
"I am addressing the President of the Commission when I say that we very much appreciate his writing to the British Presidency on 12 December, and that we endorse what he had to say in that letter."
"I have to tell the President-in-Office that the British rebate has had its day, and must therefore be reduced, the ultimate objective being that it should disappear altogether."
"We are, of course, aware, that this is tied in with the agricultural policy, and that is why we are in favour of a review clause with the effect that the whole EU Budget for 2008–2009 would be re-examined, but what we must not allow to happen is for the Central Europeans, who need our solidarity most, to end up footing the bill for the British rebate."
"That is not in your interests; it is not in our interests, and we will not agree to it."
"We also demand that the European Parliament’s legislative rights be taken seriously."
"To take one example of which we have heard, we would remind you that promising money to the Hungarians for house-building touches upon this House’s rights, for it is we who have to pass the legislation that would make it possible for this to be done."
"We therefore urge you to take this House, and its reforming goals seriously; we want to be able to make use of our right in both internal and external policy areas, and we will not allow the Council to disregard them."
"Where Iran is concerned, we are right there by your side."
"We must unequivocally express our opposition to Ahmadinejad and our support for Israel and its right to exist."
"Those who call that into question are, in essence, also questioning the right of the Palestinians to live as they are entitled to, for, if you deny Israel the right to exist, you are opposing any sort of Palestinian state; the fact is that, without Israel, there will not be one."
"So, in dealing with Iran, speak out against Ahmadinejad and in favour of peace in the Middle East; in this respect, we are one your side."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the time has come for us to have things out with the British Presidency of the Council."
"It is time for us to get to grips with the politics of the European Council."
"As Mr Barroso wrote in his letter to the Council, to which Mr Poettering referred, ‘We need a strong and effective European Union, and I am prepared to fight for one’."
"I recently had an interesting telephone conversation with Mr Barroso."
"After reading an interview with him in the , and liking what I read, I phoned him up and said, ‘That was a good interview; it was a pleasure to read it’."
"I have to admit that his response down the phone line was a sharp one."
"He said, ‘Whenever you have criticisms of me, you write them in a newspaper; when you have something good to say about me, you phone me up."
"Why not give me credit for something in public?’"
"Well, Mr President of the Commission, I am doing it now."
"That is the right way to go about things – so fight!"
"An overwhelming majority in this House support your position and oppose the line we have just heard taken by the Council, which will not move Europe forward or foster cohesion, but will make for less solidarity in it."
"That is something that this House will not take lying down!"
"I would like to come back to what Mr Alexander said to this House; he referred back to what the President of the Council said six months ago."
"He was perfectly right in what he said, and we all heard him say it."
"He said something important that Mr Alexander has not quoted, and so I will."
"He said that, if there is a crisis in the European institutions, it is there because there is a lack of strong leadership in Europe."
"Five and a half months later, Mr President-in-Office, I get the impression that that is still the case, and let me tell you what impression my group gets: whatever country holds the Presidency – not just the British – we always get told the same thing by the Presidents of the Council."
"We are always told not to talk too loudly about Europe, not to plead its case too strongly, as it puts people off."
"It is clear that if the Heads of State or Government constantly talk Europe down, they cannot be surprised when Europe’s peoples get the idea that their Heads of State or Government are right."
"The state of affairs in the Council that you lament is one that you yourselves have brought about."
"To put it bluntly, we have now had it up to here; things cannot go on like this."
"In the European institutions generally, there is no crisis: Parliament acts and takes decisions; they may perhaps not always be the right ones, but, to take one example, a few days ago, we achieved a very good compromise on chemicals policy."
"That was this European Parliament in action."
"The Commission acts, perhaps not always in the right way, but it does take action; it is active."
"The only people in Europe who are in a permanent state of disagreement are the members of the Council of Heads of State or Government, and things have now got to such a pass that they cannot even agree on their own order of business without fearing a veto."
"If there is a crisis in the European Union, then it is above all a crisis in the European Council, and I hope there will be no repetition of it this weekend."
"Fifty or sixty years ago, the European project did not call forth enthusiasm from all the peoples of Europe."
"I was born where the borders of Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium meet, and when, 60 years ago, Paul-Henri Spaak or the Dutch Prime Minister or the Head of the Luxembourg Government turned up there and said that the Germans were getting more funding from the Marshall Plan, that we had to rebuild the country and establish the European Coal and Steel Community, I do not suppose that all the Luxembourgers, Belgians, Dutch and French people burst into applause."
"They, too, said, ‘What?"
"That lot on the other side were over here only recently, wrecking our country and killing millions of people, and now they are supposed to be getting more money?’"
"And the people in positions of government said, ‘If you want peace in Europe, you have to have integration."
"This is the only way to go, and it is the way we are going, because we are convinced that it is the right one.’"
"That is why we call them statesmen and name buildings after them."
"There have indeed been times when Europe has been led by statesmen, but I get the impression that it is now led by businessmen whose only interest is in working out how much they can make out of the project."
"That is what makes the European Summit this weekend such an important one."
"It is not just about selling the new maths to Europe, for I have now learned that there is such a thing as new maths, according to which a reduced increase is the same thing as a reduction."
"That, though, is wrong; slightly increasing the British rebate is not the same thing as reducing it."
"That is certainly no way to bring about agreement; what really is needed instead is an attempt at putting Europe’s real needs in a financial framework."
"While I am on the subject of financial frameworks, let me say that my colleague Mr Walter always does a brilliant job of analysing the things that are put before us."
"In this Parliament’s proposals, set out in the Böge report, agricultural policy is given a share of 40% of the Financial Perspective over the next seven years."
"The British proposal gives it 44%."
"Our proposals are more up to date than what the Council has now put on the table."
"If we are talking about modern policy, that much is clear."
"Now, out of personal affection for the British Presidency of the Council, because the Labour Members are my friends and because I am very fond of you, Douglas, I will do something I do not usually do and speak English:"
"To avoid any misunderstanding, I will now speak in English Six months ago, Mr Alexander, we all applauded when the President-in-Office of the Council set out his vision for reform, including great investment in research, education and the hi-tech future for our Union, and you repeated it today."
"In preparing these remarks today, I recalled what I learned at school about the United Kingdom: 10 April 1912 was the date of another launch of a hi-tech future for Europe."
"The crowds applauded enthusiastically, as they did when Tony Blair spoke here five months ago."
"They applauded enthusiastically as the symbol of that hi-tech future sailed from Southampton."
"The symbol was, of course, the ."
"Today, we are on the ."
"The captain is not Edward John Smith, but Anthony Charles Lynton Blair."
"Our captain has a huge advantage over poor Mr Smith."
"The iceberg is staring him in the face, but he still has time to avoid it."
"To avoid this iceberg, Mr Alexander, you have to sail in the direction of the Böge report."
"To be absolutely clear, let me give you our iceberg coordinates: Böge."
"Certainly not 1.03%."
"That is the centre of the iceberg."
"Do not sail in this direction or the and its crew will be lost."
"Choose another route and do it urgently."
"I strongly hope that, by the end of the week, Captain Blair will have avoided the iceberg and steered the British Presidency to a safe harbour and a secure financial future for the European Union."
"Mr Alexander, that is what I wish."
"Then you will have a successful British Presidency."
"Otherwise we will fail altogether in Europe."
"Thank you, Mr Schulz, the services of the House will verify the precise coordinates of the iceberg which sank the so that we can be sure that they were one zero three."
". Mr President, two years ago today a letter was written to President Prodi."
"It bore the signatures of one head of state – President Chirac – and five prime ministers: Balkenende, Blair, Persson, Schröder and Schüssel, four of whom, alas, are still in office today."
"Signed with poison pens, it is the root of our problems today."
"That letter called for a limit to EU spending of 1% of gross national income."
"Those same heads of state and government simultaneously demanded of the Union policies that they are not prepared to finance."
"They are Member State leaders who urge on the Union abroad but duck the debate at home; leaders who will the ends, but not the means."
"Words like ‘unacceptable’ rarely flow from the very moderate lips of the Commission President, who is reportedly one of Mr Blair’s best friends, but the Commission and Parliament must be at one in rejecting a budget that puts the concerns of the accountants above the broader view of the boardroom."
"I welcome Mr Barroso’s letter to the Presidency-in-Office about this week’s Council."
"For Liberals and Democrats in this House, no deal is better than a bad deal."
"Liberals and Democrats will not compromise Europe’s long-term interests."
"We will not be implicated in creating a two-tier Europe."
"What have the new Member States found in their brave new world?"
"A French President who tells them to shut up, a German Prime Minister who denies them their own tax policies and a British Presidency that moves the goalposts of solidarity."
"What we expect from the Presidency is a budget that puts long-term strengths and common concerns above individual satisfaction and personal gain."
"What it seems we will get is a proposal that will paralyse the Union’s priorities and satisfy no one."
"President-in-Office, 1.03% of gross national income will not pay for our new policies or for enlargement."
"This House understood that when we estimated the future financial needs at 1.08% of GNI, and that was a conservative estimate."
"What about money for challenges, such as security?"
"What about the ambitions of the Lisbon Agenda?"
"Five years ago, we said we would raise research spending to 3% of GDP by 2010."
"It has slipped down even further: to below 2% last year, compared to 2.5% in the USA and over 3% in Japan."
"This is not just a budget for tomorrow."
"It is a framework that will bind us until 2013."
"It is a budget that must provide for competitiveness and jobs for our young people."
"It is a budget that must pay for the social solidarity Europe wants."
"Parliament should reject any Council agreement that does our Union down."
"The Presidency has ambitions for a wider Council agenda."
"I wish you success."
"My group hopes that you will review the so-called war on terror."
"Complicity of EU Member States in warfare using depleted uranium and white phosphorous, detention without trial, torture and turning a blind eye to a clampdown on the freedom of millions in countries with whom we cultivate strategic partnerships debases our Union."
"Two days ago, the General Affairs Council called for a comprehensive approach to combating terrorism while respecting human rights."
"Liberals and Democrats want the Council to restate the European Union’s respect for the rule of law and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to mean it."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just learnt something this morning: even on a cold December morning, a May-time atmosphere can develop in a room, and I can suddenly see a spirit of revolt arise against the Council and against the governments."
"I find that very, very interesting."
"Mr President, Mr Alexander, you spoke of Mr Blair’s eloquence."
"I, on the other hand, would say that it is the inadequacy of the UK Presidency that is eloquent."
"It is extraordinary, and if the policy you are proposing to us is truly on a par with the manner in which you exploit this Parliament and the European institutions when you need them – I am talking about data retention, which you cannot arrange for your own Parliament to approve, because you have the obligation and the duty to go via ours – if this is how you conceive of Europe, then I have one thing to say to you: not only will you fail – I do not care whether the UK Presidency fails – but Europe will also fail, and that is dangerous."
"On the subject of the financial perspective: when you speak of reform proposals and of your desire to reform agriculture, you are, in reality, cutting funding for the development of rural areas."
"These are the most modern aspects of our budget that you want to sacrifice!"
"Hold your applause; I fear that you will find less to applaud in what I am about to say."
"You said something extraordinary: we need to be modern – there will be less applause heading my way right now – and yet what are you proposing to us?"
"Nuclear energy!"
"This is an energy source from the past, from the 1960s!"
"Do not stay in the 1960s."
"Modernity means something else, namely hydrogen."
"You have not understood a thing, and that is what is dangerous."
"When a presidency has not understood a thing, it does just about anything."
"– I would now like to say that in German, so that Mr Poettering and Mr Schulz can get my drift."
"One thing is true: say to your governments what you have said to the Presidency today!"
"The fact of the matter is that these miserly governments, to which Mr Watson has already referred, and who do exactly what the Council wants of them, are part of the problem."
"Tell Mr Steinbrück that things cannot go on the way they are!"
"In the days when the Greens were in government, I told them to make things public!"
"This finance minister’s aspirations are a scandal!"
"Likewise, I have this to say to Mrs Grossetête:"
"Tell Mr Chirac too: the defence of French agricultural policy, such as it is, is a scandal that does not help us make progress."
"– It is not only the Presidency that bears responsibility for what happens, although it does share in it through being every bit as feeble and poor as the other governments in the Council."
"It is not one whit better than any of them, but the governments that they represent are part of the problem, too."
"Not when they are in here, but when they are out there, they form part of a total artwork called the Council – and what a total work of art that is!"
"I would now like to say something about two things that strike me as important in this connection."
"Earlier on in this debate, reference was made to Iran."
"Mr Poettering is right to say that what is said by that country’s President touches and affects us all."
"If, though, we are going to think about what to do about him, then I have an idea."
"The fact of the matter, whether we like it or not, is that he is an elected President!"
"At present, the only effective way to get this discussed at last, would seem to be to consider the possibility or otherwise of excluding Iran from the World Cup."
"That would spark off debate in Iran, and the debate would be a serious one."
"Bread and circuses on the one hand, and everyone on the other being able to do and say what they like is something I regard as inconsistent."
"It is that sort of debate that would bring home to people in Iran the reality of what their leadership is currently doing – cutting them off from the world!"
"If people are being cut off, that needs to be said and there must be no illusions about it."
"This is also something that one might suggest that the Council Presidency might discuss, along with, ultimately, the war on terrorism."
"Fighting against terrorism cannot mean fighting against democracy."
"Do you understand?"
"It cannot mean fighting against democracy."
"Having heard about the events involving the CIA here in Europe, I can tell you that this is not about fighting terrorists; this is about creating the conditions for bigotry."
"We must stop the wrong fight against terrorism."
"If you want to fight terrorists, please, come back to the rule of law and then you will have us, the Greens, on your side."
". Mr President, last June, the majority of Parliament warmly welcomed Mr Blair."
"Six months later, the chairmen of the political groups took a very unusual step and unanimously rejected his budgetary proposals on the grounds, I quote, ‘of a lack of solidarity’."
"The President of the Commission has just made a speech along the same lines, and our entire debate could not be clearer."
"This turnaround in the situation ought to make the outgoing Presidency reflect."
"The UK Presidency’s offhand manner towards its partners in general and to the new Member States in particular has, this time round, crossed the threshold between what is acceptable and what is not."
"How can one dare envisage resolving Britain’s internal political and budgetary quarrels on the back of the new Member States, which have the most need of Community funds, while at the same time professing to be the champion of enlargement?"
"On the one hand, the new Member States would be granted EUR 14 billion less in appropriations than what was proposed in the June compromise, the amount of which was itself meagre."
"On the other hand, Great Britain, on account of its notorious rebate, would benefit from an extra EUR 12 billion in savings in comparison with what had been envisaged six months earlier."
"This is a Thatcher-style touch that could cost us dear."
"As for the desire expressed by the Presidency-in-Office to reform the CAP with a view to making it fairer, let us leave it to the 7 December issue of the to assess the sincerity of that desire."
"I quote: ‘When the Commission proposed to set a ceiling on the size of the farms eligible for subsidies during the last reform of the CAP, the initiative was blocked by the United Kingdom because the latter has fewer small farms than the other Member States’."
"The great European principles of the current Presidency obviously stop at the point where major domestic interests come into play."
"Thus, it took a fair amount of composure to look down on the new Member States, as Mr Straw did, by comparing the funds allocated to these countries in the forthcoming financial perspective to two Marshall Plans, even though, according to your Foreign Secretary’s own figures, the cheque would, to all intents and purposes, amount to nothing less than a 2000-2013 Marshall Plan exclusively for Great Britain, the fifth global economic power."
"This is no longer about Europe; it is about winning the lottery."
"Let us not allow the bad old days of ‘I want my money back’ to return with a vengeance."
"The letter from the six biggest net contributors announcing, two years ago, that they intended to limit future budgets to 1% of gross national product sadly re-opened this dead end."
"Mr Blair leapt unrestrainedly into the breach."
"We must arrest this wayward trend while there is still time."
"It appears that we are in the middle of a period of reflection on the direction to be taken by the European adventure."
"It seems to me that the time has come to choose between integration via the market and political integration, between fierce rivalry and solidarity and between capitulation and ambition."
"We will soon see who really wants Europe."
". – Mr President, if you sat down and deliberately tried to plan the family Christmas from hell, you could not do a better job than the British Presidency has managed to achieve in the last six months."
"I am certain, Mr Alexander, that you have been very ably backed up by the utterly useless and treacherous Foreign Office sitting behind you, but perhaps this morning you as a great Europhile will begin to understand the reality about the UK’s position inside the European Union."
"We have never been more isolated, more alienated, more disliked by our European neighbours in our entire history than we are today, sitting here in this Chamber this morning – and I guess that is why Mr Blair has sent you here today to do his dirty work."
"Because he promised us back in June – did he not? – that he would report back to the European Parliament as often as he could."
"Well he has not got the guts to turn up today."
"Perhaps it is the abuse, I do not know."
"Perhaps he is upset that Mr Barroso has likened him to the Sheriff of Nottingham."
"I know that many of the new Member States think that Mr Blair is behaving like Ebenezer Scrooge."
"Well, that is actually rather unfair because the British are still paying GBP 30 million a day into an organisation whose accounts have not been signed off for the last 11 years in a row, and we are paying our fair share of the new underground system in Warsaw, and the sewers in Budapest, and goodness knows how many hectares of French farmland."
"But the ghost of Christmas past for Mr Blair will be the spectre of failure."
"He will not want history to see him coming out of a six-month Presidency without a deal and that is why there will be a deal."
"There will be a further surrender of the British rebate."
"And the only real victor in all of this is Mr Barroso!"
"And my goodness me, Mr Barroso, you could do with a few successes, could you not?"
"You wrote to Mr Blair on 20 October with five proposals to relaunch negotiations, and the British Presidency has followed those to the letter, including accepting that in 2008 there will be a complete review of the EU budget, when the whole of the UK rebate will be on the table."
"So there will be a deal over the next couple of days, but it will not settle the matter."
"I have a positive proposal for all of you."
"Yes, honestly!"
"Why do we not extend the British Presidency for a further six months?"
"Six more months of the Foreign Office, Mr Blair and Mr Alexander, six more months of this, and it will be obvious to all that the United Kingdom is a square peg in a round European hole."
"A global trading nation that is very proud of its recent history does not belong, does not fit in with this club and, from your perspective, we are like the dog in the manger, are we not?"
"We are always holding you up."
"We are always stopping you."
"Get rid of us!"
"Kick us out!"
"Expel us!"
"You can then carry on with your projects and we can get back to running our own country."
"It is not just a question of ‘we want our money back’ – we want our country back!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can only regret the fact that we have learnt about the United Kingdom’s proposal for the Union’s financial framework only at the end of its six-month presidency, as well as the fact that this new proposal has not even been put before this House today."
"That really shows a lack of consideration towards Parliament, which has been flattered in words but scorned in deeds."
"Europe is in difficulties today because of an international situation that has led the globalisation process to be managed rather than experienced naturally, and in which there occur serious breaches of the rules that constitute the only guarantee for honest trade and fair competition. We all know that what is needed to reinvigorate Europe in this situation are political and economic measures based on appropriate budget lines."
"That is why we might have hoped for a calmer and more thorough debate in the Council and in all the European institutions over the past few months."
"Instead, this last-minute proposal, which is worse than the Luxembourg one, makes it even less likely that we can press ahead with the development policies and social policies that are needed to address the problem of over 40 million people living in poverty and over 20 million unemployed."
"The UK proposal does not even take account of the geographical diversity of the Member States and cuts those Structural Funds that are vital to southern and eastern Europe."
"This proposal lacks ambition and diminishes Europe’s role in the world."
"Minister, you mentioned terrorism."
"Well, to combat terrorism it is necessary not only to strengthen the structures for monitoring and fighting it, but also to improve living standards within the European Union and beyond, and to do that requires political will and funding, not just statements of good intentions."
"The fact that President Barroso himself and the various Heads of State or Government have clearly stated their disagreement with the UK proposal, even though they are still negotiating, suggests that the proposal was probably put forward at the end of the mandate precisely because the United Kingdom is unwilling to realistically face up to the old problem of the UK rebate."
"A decent agreement means that some countries must learn to give up certain privileges, even substantial ones, which they were guaranteed at a particular time in the Community’s history under specific circumstances, and which at that time were justifiable."
"In the absence of a new Treaty, the Union is in great need of a financial equilibrium that penalises no one and can usher in a new economic policy."
"Mr President, I almost feel sorry for Mr Alexander, but I am going to resist the temptation."
"Last weekend the London published Mr Blair’s next speech in Brussels, which included the words: ‘here you breathe the sweet smell of Belgium’s unique brand of corruption, which it has generously bestowed on the rest of Europe’."
"Then it went on to anticipate what he might say to Mr Chirac the next time they meet: ‘ Jacques, the proud upholder of the most immoral state-subsidised policy in human history – the GBP 27 billion-a-year common agricultural policy’, which transfers British taxpayers’ money to ‘bloated French landowners, pumping up food prices in Europe and creating poverty in Africa’."
"Mr Blair’s real problem is that he cannot say any of that."
"He has to be supportive of the European Union, or at least seem to be so."
"However, he knows back home that the majority loathes this House and all it stands for and wants us to leave."
"He knows the British Presidency has been a disaster."
"We do not subscribe to your project."
"Mr Heath’s pigeons of the 1970s have come home to roost big time in the UK."
"Mr Heath lied through his teeth to persuade us to join."
"His deceit has left successive British governments to cope with the consequences and we have gradually come to see the EU for what it really is."
"Today we know this emperor has no clothes."
"This is not a parliamentary democracy."
"That was never intended."
"This is ruled by secret committees, faceless bullying bureaucrats, and accountability by smoke and mirrors."
"This is the new soviet and it is no wonder that Italy now wants Russia to join it."
"Mr Putin would feel perfectly at home."
"Since I arrived here last year, it has been remarkable how many people have admitted privately to me that we should never have joined and we should leave at the earliest opportunity."
"So we should!"
"Mr President, I too almost feel that I should be doing something to help Mr Alexander out, but, as a lawyer, it does not appear to me that there will be enough money in the EU budget to pay my fees."
"I am rather sorry for him, but he is here to try to convince the House that the Presidency is on top of events."
"Sadly, the past six months have shown that this presidency has unfortunately been unable even to comprehend events, let alone establish its position in relation to them."
"He is the messenger for a presidency that has run out of ideas, run out of steam and is rapidly running out of time."
"It is sadly acknowledged across the political spectrum, as we are hearing today, that the British Presidency has not achieved what it said it would."
"It began with high hopes and prime ministerial panache."
"In this Chamber, it asked to be judged on its record over the six months it was in office."
"In June, I warned the House that there was often a yawning gap between the Prime Minister’s rhetoric and reality."
"Anyone who has watched the Prime Minister preside over this presidency will surely understand my caution."
"Unlike the Minister, I now want to concentrate on Mr Blair’s increasingly frantic attempts to get an agreement on the financial perspectives and the future EU budget."
"In the past few weeks, he has left us breathless with his efforts at diplomacy."
"Flexibility and vision is all very well, Mr Alexander, but the Prime Minister’s actions have been successful only in securing the hostility of the countries of central and eastern Europe – which thought he was their friend – while gaining not a hint of compromise on CAP reform in discussions with governments."
"In addition, and crucially, he has reneged on a promise to the British people not to undermine their budget rebate, a promise that perhaps he should not have made."
"In June, he said the rebate would remain."
"He is now negotiating it away without any promises on fundamental reform, which he said previously were vital."
"He should not be surprised if public reaction in the United Kingdom is hostile."
"He has misled the British people and they see it live on their television screens. They will be paying more because the Prime Minister has let them and the country down."
"I read at the weekend – and I hope the President-in-Office will react to it – that the British Treasury has not budgeted one cent for a reduction in the budget rebate, meaning that British taxpayers could end up paying higher taxes."
"We will look closely at the latest budget proposals expected from the Presidency today."
"I am sorry that we did not have the benefit of hearing these in Parliament this morning, but we will judge them in part on how much British taxpayers will have to pay for their government’s mishandling of the issues and on whether there is any evidence that the Prime Minister has received any solid and bankable commitments on fundamental reform in Europe."
"As far as we are concerned, whatever our political positions, we need to have sensible and progressive reform."
"Under this Presidency, the omens have not been good."
"Mr President, I too regret the fact that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has come here to say nothing, but I would like to make the following comments and ask the following questions, to see if the Council can clarify things."
"Firstly, the preamble to the Council’s proposal of 5 December states that the financial perspective must provide for the financial resources necessary to confront the European Union’s internal and external challenges."
"Do you really believe that the Union’s challenges can be tackled with fewer and fewer resources?"
"Secondly, you ― though you are not the only ones ― have ranted and raved, sometimes for good reasons, but also for reasons of demagoguery, against the CAP, but at the end of the day, you will carry on cutting the most sensitive part of the CAP dedicated to rural development: the most modern, the most rational and the most justifiable part of agricultural spending."
"Thirdly, we all applauded the British Prime Minister when he said in this Parliament that he wanted a modern budget for Europe, and we hoped that that would include an increase in the appropriations intended for creating this Europe of excellence."
"Will that be a vain hope?"
"Will you change your initial proposal, which meant a 40% cut with regard to the Commission?"
"Fourthly, the ‘ugly duckling’ of the Community budget: external actions."
"All of the Foreign Affairs Ministers are constantly delivering promises relating to the needs of developing third countries, or to provide relief following natural disasters, or not so natural disasters, such as famine."
"But then the cuts will come, as always."
"This means that we will be giving to some people what we take from others."
"Fifthly, you have accepted that an agreement was not reached last June, because the financial perspective was too generous."
"Are you going to carry on listening to those colleagues of yours who believe that when it comes to the European budget, the smaller it is the better?"
"Unfortunately, many countries are happy that the European budget gets smaller every year; for some, in fact, it was the only positive thing about your first proposal."
"Is the idea of trying to slow down European integration with the philosophy ‘with less budget, less Europe’ going to win out in the Council?"
"In Parliament, however, I would like to make it very clear that we want to move forward with European integration."
"We do not believe that we have gone too far and that from now on it is better for each country to sort things out for itself."
"This is the great gulf between the Council and Parliament."
"It is not going to be a question of a few million euros more or a few million euros less."
"We shall judge where the financial perspective that the European Council can propose to us is going to take us."
"Sixthly, we saw that all you were prepared to propose on the controversial issue of the Union’s income, or own resources, were a series of botched jobs to keep your associates who want to pull the Community budget apart happy."
"Do you want us to return to national contributions?"
"Finally, in the face of an attack on the Union’s system of own resources, Parliament only has the right to protest, according to the Treaties; nevertheless, please be in no doubt that the existence of the financial perspective does depend on Parliament."
"Do not forget that, and do not be so sure that we are going to do whatever the Council asks of us."
"Mr President, the reason why the current debate on the Financial Perspective is so fraught with drama is because it is not just money that is at stake."
"What is at stake is firstly a climate of trust, and secondly the future of Europe."
"I refer to a climate of trust because the outcome of this debate should reveal whether the promises that were made, and the British Prime Minister’s acknowledgement of the need to help weaker countries, have any kind of meaning."
"Alternatively, it may reveal that the real aim is to ensure that the EU’s only priority is something else entirely, which would violate the principle of European politics, and that brings us to the second problem. The question is whether we want a Europe that is not only enlarged, but also united, which requires a certain amount of political solidarity."
"We currently have the Commission’s proposals, Parliament’s proposals and the Böge report on the table."
"These are all manifestations of the European spirit, and demonstrate an understanding of Europe’s future needs."
"Yet we also have the recent British proposal before us, which exemplifies the national egotism of the great and the rich."
"We are all aware that Europe paid a high price for such egotism over many long centuries."
"There can be no compromise between egotism and the sense of national spirit."
"It is for that reason that we must wait and hope that an entirely new British proposal will be put forward."
"Such a proposal is the only way of resolving this crisis."
"Mr President, for the first time in 11 years, we see a President-in-Office of the Council declining to avail himself of his right to speak in response to the first round of debate."
"So short is a presidency’s road from splendid to wretched, from its dissembling performances on the European stage to its public failure, from great affirmations to the ostracism that is the present lot of the British Presidency of the Council."
"It began with fanfares and ends with the passing-bell at a pauper’s grave."
"Six months ago, wanting to regain people’s trust, you promised them leadership."
"I really do pity you;"
"Tony Blair took responsibility for the great performance, while you must take responsibility for the ostracism."
"I am not surprised that you do not want to talk about it."
"Leadership was what you promised, but what you showed was national egoism, with Europe as a bazaar of national interests, a Europe run by governments."
"You wanted to regain people’s trust, but, at the end of these six months, all surveys indicate that, because of your policies, people in every country have markedly less of it in you."
"Turning to the Financial Perspective, you affirmed your belief in a Europe of solidarity, yet are dividing the EU financially and creating a first- and second-class Europe."
"Solidarity among Member States is becoming a thing of the past."
"Having announced great reforms, you are making your agreement to the Financial Perspective conditional upon agricultural reform, and are now, by cutting funding for regional development, wrecking the only successful reform that we have seen."
"You wanted to prepare the way for the social Europe, yet what came out of Hampton Court was that the social model in Europe does not actually exist."
"That is what has emerged from your Presidency, and it is lamentable."
"Internal security was meant to be one of your Presidency’s priorities; instead, it has become a fiasco."
"It was your own Home Secretary who managed to be the first representative of a democratic government to describe the European Convention on Human Rights as outdated."
"The whole issue of the ban on torture, in particular, shows the British Presidency in a curious light."
"Perhaps that is the explanation for why this Presidency of the Council has let the public down on the most fundamental of fundamental rights issues in the face of the presumed crime of abduction and transportation, and the utter inability of the government of the United Kingdom to do anything about it."
"I have but one question to put to the British Presidency, and it is this: when will you stop travelling to Europe, and instead start living in it?"
"Mr President, there are many difficulties with the British Presidency’s proposals for the financial perspectives, which the chairman of my group, Mr Wurtz, and others have outlined here this morning."
"Those include lower than previously proposed amounts for rural development, cohesion funds for the newest Member States, culture, youth and health and consumer protection."
"I would plead in favour of one aspect, however: the funding for the EU programme to support peace in the north of Ireland."
"That is necessary if we are to continue the valuable work of peace-building, tackling discrimination and promoting national reconciliation."
"It is imperative that the opportunity for peace in Ireland is not squandered, which means that there is also an onus on the British Government to ensure political progress in Ireland in 2006."
"Mr President, the United Kingdom’s assumption of the EU Presidency meant that there was a chance that this bureaucratised and inefficient organisation would take the first step on the path towards major reforms, and that the voices of the smaller or less-developed Member States would be no less audible that those of the large Member States."
"Six months ago in this very Chamber, the British Prime Minister said that we should forget about national egotism if we want to transform Europe into a politically credible and economically competitive continent on the basis of solidarity."
"Now that the British Presidency is coming to an end, it is apparent that this was merely brilliant rhetoric."
"It is highly unlikely that the EU will gain a modern and development-focused multi-annual budget in the near future."
"It is equally unlikely that there will be any change to the way in which decisions are taken on matters that involve the 25 Member States."
"The EU will continue to be governed by means of opaque negotiations conducted by the powerful Member States, during which the weak Member States are expected to keep quiet or nod in agreement."
"The new Member States, which were accepted into the EU ‘as a favour’ even though they pay their way in full, are otherwise accused of being ungrateful, or they are told that, in the words of the British ambassador to Warsaw, and I quote, ‘life is brutal and full of traps’."
"We cannot consent to an EU of this kind."
"Six months ago many people in this Chamber and also in the new Member States looked with hope and sympathy to the new, dynamic British Presidency and its leader."
"We heard about a vision of Europe’s competitiveness in the world and about an equalisation of socio-economic conditions in Europe."
"In Luxembourg various new Member States also proposed reducing their requirements for funds, if the bigger states could not reach a compromise."
"Unfortunately, this was the basis for the British proposal for the Financial Perspective, simultaneously reducing the amount of the budget and slightly reducing the ‘British rebate’."
"Here the debate is not about the roads that have not been built or the jobs that have not been created in the new Europe."
"Here the debate is about the fact that you have demonstrated to our people that the principle of solidarity is nothing but fine words."
"We wanted to see that by 2013 our people would be living a little more like ‘first class’ Europe."
"Our people in Latvia, my people, do not want to be merely a cheap workforce for your labour market and a cheap tourist destination for the tourists on your cut-price airlines."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, the Brussels European Council, devoted to budgetary and fiscal issues, is of the utmost importance."
"Albion, embodied by the socialist Mr Blair, put forward its proposal on the 2007-2013 financial perspective just ten days before the European Council so that its partners could not present it with counter-proposals."
"Moreover, the British - shrewd tacticians as they are – went so far in their cunning as to annoy their friends – the countries of the East – and to give the kid-glove treatment to their opponents – France and Germany – practically without touching their budgetary rebate."
"All they need do is pretend to make concessions in order to obtain an agreement from the Council, which is scarcely inclined to return to this issue under the Austrian Presidency."
"The big loser will, in all likelihood, be France, which will probably continue to finance the British cheque and to see its contribution to the Community budget soar on account of enlargement, while receiving less as a result of the decrease in the CAP budget."
"The other topic of debate is the reduced VAT rate for labour-intensive services."
"It is marvellous that taxation on activities such as catering or building renovation, which have no negative bearing whatsoever on the operation of the internal market, should be debated at European level and require unanimity."
"Mr Chirac should have remembered that fiscal sovereignty no longer existed when he made promises to catering workers that he was unable to keep."
"Be that as it may, the decisions made in Brussels will bind France for many years to come and contribute, a little more, to our country’s tragic debt."
"Mr President, Minister, almost twenty years ago, with the Single European Act, when we opened up our borders in order to create a European Economic Area, we also decided to establish a series of financial mechanisms to help the least-developed countries to adapt their economic structures to free competition."
"From that moment, cohesion became a fundamental pillar of Europe, consolidating in the financial perspectives negotiated in 1992 and 1999."
"The results of that policy have been extraordinary."
"As Minister Straw acknowledged a few days ago, on presenting the British Presidency’s proposal, there has been a similar increase in the commercial flows benefiting the most developed Member States and it is therefore perfectly clear that the net contributors’ budgetary deficit with the European Union is in line with the trade surplus of those countries compared to the cohesion countries."
"It is therefore clear that the cohesion policy ― certainly the most effective of all Community policies ― benefits all the countries of the European Union, allowing for the true convergence of the least advantaged regions within a relatively short space of time."
"Minister, the British Presidency is therefore violating that cohesion policy, which means that the financial costs of enlargement will have to be met by the least-developed territories of the European Union, despite the fact that it is the richest that benefit most from enlargement."
"In line with the views approved by the European Parliament, therefore, the Council must be very aware that it cannot assume that it will have parliamentary support for a proposal such as the one that the British Presidency is putting forward at the moment."
"And if the Council approves it, I will of course do everything possible to ensure that Parliament vetoes it."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, many aspects of our cooperation with the British Presidency have gone well; the problem is that you risk giving this sort of cooperation a bad name if you fail to put together a proper and realistic Budget."
"It was you who spoke of a realistic Budget."
"There are just two points I would like to touch on, and briefly."
"You yourself come from a region that has managed – not least with the help of European support grants – to move away from agriculture to being a leader in research and development."
"Why do you now want to deny that to other regions by making massive cuts in this modern funding for research and development, or by not creating the conditions for them in an enlarged Union?"
"That leads me on to the issue of enlargement."
"I share your view that we should negotiate with Turkey, and that the creation of a greater Europe, one that included Turkey, would be a good thing."
"Do you think it realistic to pursue an enlargement strategy, as the British Presidency is doing, with a Budget like this one and this sort of financial perspective?"
"Do you think it realistic that this enlargement should include the countries of the Balkans?"
"Such a thing is not credible, and the public will not accept it."
"That is why I find your proposal incomprehensible."
"After all, you cannot achieve your own objectives, which both you and Mr Blair have defended, and so the only thing I can do is urge you to change your mind, and come back with a Budget proposal that is realistic in the truest sense of the word, while also taking some sort of account of Europeans’ hopes and aspirations."
"What you have put before us so far is unacceptable either to this House or to the people of Europe!"
"Mr President, at the European Council on Thursday and Friday, you, Mr Alexander, and Mr Blair will have the fate of Europe in your hands."
"We expect you to deliver a balanced outcome."
"Here in Parliament, we have in actual fact delivered when it comes both to REACH and data retention, on which we are voting today, showing that it is not only when there are summits that the EU actively makes things happen."
"Six months ago, your Presidency made a point of presenting a very visionary programme that attached importance to future investment in research and development."
"It was a fantastic performance that gave rise to great enthusiasm among us MEPs."
"What, however, has become of those promises now?"
"I hope that, at noon today, Mr Blair will emerge from Sherwood Forest like a proper – and not a false - Robin Hood, who gives to the poor and takes from the rich."
"The new proposal should also tackle the outdated British rebate."
"We must show the necessary solidarity with the new Member States."
"That is something they deserve, and it will also be in Mr Blair’s interests clearly to distance himself from the voice of the past, embodied by Mrs Thatcher."
"If Mr Blair does not stand by the promises he made this summer, his Presidency will have been of no substance."
"Mr Blair must and should show leadership so that the EU’s by now tarnished image can be polished up."
"Mr Blair must show that he dares invest in the future."
"Research and development are to be welcomed, but not rebates and support for the industries of the past."
"I therefore call on the British Presidency to find a reasonable and balanced solution so that we might restore confidence in Europe."
"The ball lies in your court."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am somewhat embarrassed because both I and the members of the Committee on Development from other political groups would have liked to see a more important subject for discussion in this debate and not merely the announcement of a document, which we have drawn up and which is certainly a positive one."
"We were hoping for some kind of assessment as well, because there are in fact a great many positive points contained in the European Consensus on Development, although the budget cuts seriously undermine our ability to put this vision of development policy into practice."
"The European Parliament was jointly involved, first with the Commission and then with the Council, in the analysis and debates that took place. We also took part in a number of seminars."
"Throughout the process, Parliament contributed a great deal and also gained a great deal."
"This document, however, does not take account of the need to democratise the international financial institutions, for instance, and there is no assessment of the reasons for the lack of growth in economic equality. Instead, economic disparities are growing, as is our responsibility for the consequences of the arms that we produce, for example."
"There is no doubt that the process of redefining the European Union’s development policies, financial instruments and economic agreements framework will be a challenge for the future."
"In that sense, and also in our document, the question of trade still takes centre stage."
"I feel I must also add that, although this document contains a great many positive points, many are still missing, but that would require another debate."
"I should really like the Presidency and the Commission to respond appropriately to what we are doing with our development policies."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the end Tony Blair has decided to don the robes of the Sheriff of Nottingham, with his drastic cuts to the budget and hard-line defence of the privilege of the UK rebate."
"Unless there are last-minute changes, London’s proposal is liable to set the seal on a resounding failure."
"In actual fact, we are facing a much deeper crisis: Mr Blair has simply chosen to exacerbate the clash, to show up Europe’s weakness and to bring its contradictions to the boil; he has simply highlighted the problems of a Europe torn apart by self interest, unwilling to make any effort to support enlargement, and unable to genuinely face up to the challenges of the third millennium or to assert itself as a unitary political entity on the world stage."
"Italy, as a founding member of the European Union, has always played its part and has always been willing to make sacrifices for the sake of the future."
"As a net contributor, it has paid 25% of the UK rebate for 20 years."
"Now, however, we have reached a crossroads: we cannot pay for the costs of enlargement all by ourselves."
"This time we cannot be the only ones to step back."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, punctuality is a virtue of kings."
"Great Britain is a kingdom, but its ministers are not punctual."
"As a matter of fact, this metaphor works on many levels."
"The EU is waiting for sensible proposals from London, but London is behind schedule, in the same way that Mr Alexander was late getting here today."
"Earlier Mr Cohn-Bendit said that there was an atmosphere of springtime revolution in the House today."
"As I see it, however, the atmosphere is more reminiscent of winter, such as that experienced by the soldiers fighting at Stalingrad during the Second World War."
"Relations between the Commission and the Council, and also between the individual Member States, are positively icy."
"It is a shame that at the beginning of the 21st century, at a time when films are being released in 3D, Parliament has regressed 50 years to the era of black-and-white films."
"The film we are currently watching features Mr Barroso, the advocate of European solidarity, as a good sheriff, and Prime Minister Blair as a baddie."
"Unfortunately, it is only American westerns that have happy endings."
"The film of the British Presidency, however, is a horror film that will end in disaster."
"Zorba the Greek will not appear and say ‘what a wonderful catastrophe’, for this is a terrible catastrophe, ladies and gentlemen."
"Christmas is coming."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over 100 years ago, Mr Blair’s fellow countryman, Charles Dickens, gave us a portrait of the current British Prime Minister in ‘A Christmas Carol’."
"Yet the hero of this tale, who was a real miser, underwent a transformation."
"I hope that the same happens to that other miser, namely Prime Minister Blair."
"– Mr President, Minister, President Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council is a vital stage in the difficult process of building the Union."
"Agreement on the financial perspective would restore certainty in our political action and confidence in the integration process, whereas failure would trigger a serious political crisis."
"The need for agreement must not, however, be mistaken for a willingness to accept just any compromise."
"In his inaugural speech to this House, Tony Blair promised the revitalisation of Europe and major budgetary innovations."
"Today, unfortunately, we have to accept the fact that the proposal is modest and low-key."
"The Juncker proposal to reduce spending to EUR 871 billion was a difficult compromise to accept, but the proposed further reduction to EUR 846 billion, with substantial cuts in cohesion policies for the new Member States and in rural development, is unacceptable."
"I should also like to point out that the contribution demanded from Italy would be greater than that of France or the UK."
"Thus it would be the poor regions of the old Member States that would be penalised, while the privileges of the countries that want a pared-down budget would remain virtually untouched."
"This kind of solution contradicts everything the UK Prime Minister put forward and cannot be accepted by this Parliament."
"The only way to escape the squeeze affecting our countries and to give fresh impetus to our Europe is to reach an ambitious agreement that combines competitiveness and cohesion, solidarity and innovation."
"To conclude, I should like to quote a man of the future: Alcide De Gasperi, whom we remembered yesterday."
"To reunite Europe we have to throw out a world of privileges, a world of pusillanimity and resentments."
"We must speak out, write and insist; we must not take a moment’s rest in order to keep Europe on the agenda."
"Mr President, in June the United Kingdom blocked the Financial Perspective proposed by the Luxembourg Presidency."
"Prime Minister Blair told us that the EU needed a different kind of budget, in which less money was earmarked for traditional goals in the field of agricultural policy."
"Instead, more money should go towards furthering modern goals, such as the development of poor regions and of the new Member States."
"His words gave us hope that the EU would move beyond the era of national egotism, and that it might make some real progress in terms of modernisation."
"Five months then passed in which nothing happened, and I regret to say that the proposal that was put before us after this five-month period was disappointing in the extreme."
"The United Kingdom has proved itself incapable of persuading its partners to reform the common agricultural policy, and it has also been unable to forego further increases in its rebate."
"The final result is that all the proposed cuts to the budget are unfair, since it will be the new Member States that are affected by most of them."
"It turns out that one quarter of the cuts proposed by the British Presidency will affect one country alone, namely Poland."
"This amounts to a figure of EUR 6 billion."
"I should like to ask Mr Alexander whether he thinks that there is any chance that the Polish Prime Minister will return to his country and tell the Polish people that he intends to agree to a proposal along these lines. It would be entirely unrealistic to expect such a thing."
"The British Presidency’s proposal shows a lack of imagination, and it is based on a vision of Europe that this House finds unacceptable."
"The European Parliament cannot consent to such a vision."
"Mr Alexander, never before in the history of Europe have the principles of solidarity and cohesion been at such risk, and never before have European countries been so caught up in defending their own selfish and short-term interests."
"I would ask you to tell the British Presidency that we expect it to rise to the occasion and to be able to achieve a compromise that upholds the principles underpinning the European Union."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is important because it voices the discontent felt in Europe about a European summit which, given the way it has been structured, can only lead to predictable failure."
"If that is the case, it will be impossible to use the resources effectively in the early years of the programming period, that is to say from 2007 onwards, and that will result in serious harm."
"It is preferable, however, to run that risk rather than permanently jeopardise the design for a strong, united Europe by agreeing to accept the 1% mini Europe."
"The 1% idea is indeed a dreadful solution that the European Parliament cannot accept."
"Worse still, it is a dreadful solution that comes without a substantial reduction in the UK rebate."
"In order to grow, Europe has to be competitive, and to be competitive it needs cohesion."
"With a budget that cuts spending and sets a ceiling of around 1%, with a budget that only guarantees existing privileges, there will be no investment in either growth or competitiveness or cohesion, Mr President, and Europe will be betraying itself."
"We do not want that kind of Europe; we do not recognise ourselves in such a Europe. We shall do everything we can for Parliament to reject any agreement on that mini Europe, which is not the Europe that Parliament wants."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Alexander, Europeans deserve more than the game of cat and mouse being played by the Presidency of the Union with its 24 partners on the eve of a European Council that is crucial for the future of Europe."
"The proposals put forward over the last few days by the UK Presidency on the 2007-2013 financial perspective are unacceptable for two reasons."
"They sacrifice the new Member States, they erect a new wall between old and new Member States and they seem designed to preserve the British rebate, which now has no reason to exist."
"With regard to agricultural spending, there is, furthermore, a hidden meaning to the proposals, which verges on a threat and which we cannot tolerate within our Union."
"If the common agricultural policy is not reformed in 2008, then the United Kingdom will hold on to its rebate as it stands."
"There should be no taboo subjects whatsoever in our democracy, and this is the case whether it is a question of Europe’s overall budget, the apportionment of European expenditure, regional aid, the CAP, aid for research and innovation or any other Community policy."
"Any subject can be debated, be looked into and form the subject of a compromise in our interests, and this is something that we all understand."
"What we cannot accept, however, is one country retaining benefits that no longer correspond at all to today’s economic and political context."
"This is all the more unacceptable when it is to the detriment of countries requiring aid to overcome the handicaps created by 50 years of Communist regime."
"Nor can we accept the extensive efforts already made by the European Union in the area of agriculture being repudiated, particularly in the context of the WTO negotiations."
"Europe has already done its duty on this matter and is looking forward to other agricultural powers, such as the United States, making similar efforts before Europe pursues, if necessary, its reforms."
"The British Prime Minister, Mr Blair, formally declared to us in this very Chamber his desire to work for the common good of Europe, to go beyond national self-interests and to take European integration forward during his Presidency."
"We are waiting for him finally to turn his words into deeds if he is to deserve the applause that a number of my fellow Members might have been slightly too quick to offer him back in June."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by apologising to the Presidency."
"When it agreed to open negotiations with Croatia, I confess I suspected that a rather grubby deal had been done to overcome Austria’s objections to Turkey."
"I was wrong."
"We now know that Croatia was cooperating very closely with The Hague and providing information which led to the very significant and important arrest of General Gotovina and I congratulate the Presidency on that progress."
"If it is not too much of a shock for Mr Alexander, I would also like to congratulate the Presidency on its cooperation with the Parliament, which has led to huge progress on some very difficult dossiers, noticeably REACH, the long-running Eurovignette saga, and hopefully data retention."
"I also understand the Presidency is making great strides, or trying to make great strides, in introducing transparency to the Council and I would hope Mr Alexander could tell us what progress he has made on that."
"Nonetheless there is still a lack of transparency in the Council, so I wonder whether he could just lift the veil momentarily by answering some questions."
"Which net payers, apart from the UK, are prepared to pay more money to solve the budget problem?"
"Which net recipients are prepared to receive less in order to solve the budget problem?"
"Which net recipients from old Europe are prepared to receive less in order to show solidarity to new Europe?"
"How many countries in the Council advocate spending programmes so long as they do not have to pay for them?"
"Which of the main beneficiaries of the CAP are arguing for further reform?"
"Which CAP beneficiaries are prepared, like the UK Government, to make public the information about where the money goes?"
"By that I mean information that shows that the benefit is felt not by farmers but by multinational processors of food and big landowners."
"Which finance ministers are prepared to sign an annual statement of assurance of their accounts, which will put an end to the annual saga of us failing to sign off the accounts because of the failure of Member States to control their accounts?"
"Which Member States come to the Council meeting and ask not what Europe can do for them, but what they can do for Europe?"
"Mr President, the EU needs a budget, but not at any cost."
"The Commission’s proposal was optimal and in agreement with the commitments of the Edinburgh Council of 1992."
"Do you still remember the 1.27% of GNI from Edinburgh?"
"The European Parliament’s bigger budget is realistic in protecting crucial areas of EU priorities."
"Our Parliament wants to free the dynamism of new Member States and use it to the advantage of the economy of the whole Union."
"We should not, as under the humiliating British proposal, penalise them and push them into second class membership status."
"The Luxembourg proposal was already scarce and at the limits of acceptability."
"The British proposal has crossed the red line in terms of the overall level of commitments and unacceptable reduction of funds for the poorest Member States."
"Non-agreement is better than an agreement that contradicts the very principle of European integration."
"The budget is not only about figures; it is about principles and policy choices."
"Reducing the budget when our Union is larger and has new tasks is contrary to logic and common sense."
"It means amputating EU policies, slice by slice: real salami tactics."
"The budget is about the solidarity, cohesion and competitiveness of an enlarged Union, not about charity."
"We do not want charity."
"We are not beggars."
"We want our money back."
"But, even applying an accountant’s approach, the proposal is contrary to honest business practice."
"New Members opened their markets and committed themselves to apply high and costly EU standards."
"Matching transfers of 4% of GNI was a legitimate expectation based on political promise."
"Limiting that support today means breaking the contract."
"Our Parliament, showing self-respect, should prevent the erosion of the EU in the name of the impossible and destructive doctrine of ‘more Europe for less money’."
"The primary source of that doctrine is the 1% budget proposal, the famous ‘Letter of Six’: the proposal to have, to use the words of President Barroso, ‘a mini Europe’."
"The 1% philosophy means of the Union and leading the Union into a trap of doing ."
"When there is a crisis of leadership – and there is – the European Parliament should take the lead and the responsibility, together with the European Commission, and veto the Council proposal if there is any bottom line set by the Luxembourg proposal."
"Best wishes and Merry Christmas to the outgoing British Presidency."
"Mr President, the structure of this debate creates great confusion, mixing up the Council on Thursday with the European consensus on development."
"It is surely because of this misunderstanding that Mr Durão Barroso has not said a word about the latter, although Mr Alexander has referred to it."
"I wish to talk about it on behalf of the Socialist Group."
"With regard to the European consensus on development, we feel very satisfied, though we also have certain concerns."
"Satisfaction at the process employed in drawing up the declaration; satisfaction at the initiative of the Commission and of Commissioner Louis Michel that a document should be produced to replace that of 2000; and also satisfaction at the decisive involvement of the British Presidency and of Minister Hilary Benn in this operation."
"The flexibility demonstrated by the Commission and the Council with a view to achieving the final agreed text is also worthy of note."
"The Presidency’s determination to convince the other twenty-four governments, some of which were very unwilling at the beginning, to accept the compromise that was taking shape, has also been notable."
"One significant change was the Commission and the Council’s will to involve Parliament in the signature and, before that, in the process that has led to the wording of the statement defining the Union’s development policy for the coming years."
"Our participation, through Anders Wijkman and followed by all of the groups in the Committee on Development, has been effective; it was essential that we acted firmly and in a united fashion."
"Thanks to this, the statement includes most of our suggestions."
"By providing them with a political framework, this statement should enhance the commitments that were made a few months ago on the proposal of the Council of Development Ministers and which drastically increase the efforts of the Union and its Member States to overcome under-development and its consequences for the people suffering from it."
"At least we are acting in accordance with the provisions of the European Constitution, which indicates that the Union’s responsibilities in the field of solidarity with the South are one of our priorities."
"We could talk about coherence if it were not for other greater incoherences, which are the source of the concern mentioned earlier: the financial perspectives announced by the British Presidency, showing a worrying degree of schizophrenia, are incompatible with the budgetary commitments made at the Leeds Council and the actions laid down in the statement being debated today."
"That is why we are so worried that all our hopes are destined to be dashed."
"And that is why my group would like to make it clear that we will not accept such a prospect and we will act to ensure that the hopes raised today are not dashed when the resources available for the coming years are approved."
"Congratulations to everybody today, but I would point out that there will be great resistance if there is any intention to take with one hand tomorrow what is given today with the other."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I have to tell the President-in-Office that the United Kingdom is the main cause underlying the failure of the summit in Luxembourg."
"The abandonment by the Heads of State or Government of their responsibility for Europe as a whole, along with their almost daily attempts at renationalisation and at the splitting of the European Union’s policies into internal and European policy are, of course, not your problem alone, but you are constantly provocative, and you also play the blackmail card."
"You are here today, and Tony Blair is again absent."
"I had good reason for posting him as missing on 12 October."
"You are here, and the proposal for the summit follows the debate; a few days ago, you told us that, if we did not agree to what you propose, you would reject everything next year."
"That is blackmail."
"What have you done over the past six months to combat this concept of the Council’s political role, which is so lacking in solidarity and any sense of responsibility?"
"It takes more to make a successful presidency of the Council than two performances or rhetorical pyrotechnics by Tony Blair."
"On the contrary, they confirm the fact that a gulf lies between speeches and reality, between aims and deeds, between tasks and competences, between what is announced and what is actually achieved, between the dueller’s glove thrown down in writing and the obligations to be found in the Treaties, as well as those of a moral and political nature."
"Your mentality is one that I cannot fathom."
"How do you tell the public that the want to reduce competitiveness, that you want less money spent on internal and external security, that you will, in 2007, be putting less money on the table than we agreed for the 2006 Budget, that you want to play down Europe’s role on the global stage?"
"The more arrogant your attitude to the citizens of Europe and to their Parliament becomes, the greater our confidence and determination, and all the greater the rage of the public."
"Negotiation is possible only where there is mutual respect; it requires compliance with shared rules and must be between equals."
"Far from us being the agents of the governments’ national and individualistic interests, our cause is that of Europe as a community, of an effective and decisive European Union united in solidarity."
"We will not allow the future of the European Union to be determined by the success or failure of a Council Presidency or of the Council itself."
"It is Parliaments such as our own that must assume leadership and responsibility in view of the vacuum that you are leaving behind you."
"– Mr President, I believe that anyone wanting to put a title to the opinions being expressed by certain Member States in the Council would choose the title: 'How to have more Europe with less money'."
"This, in my view, simply cannot be done."
"I believe that there are numerous contradictions in the discussions being held in the Council and in the proposals by the British Presidency."
"In this debate there is a huge contradiction between words and ambitions, on the one hand, and the fact that we only give the Community budget 2.5% of public spending in the 25 Member States, on the other."
"Similarly, numerous Member States are putting the emphasis in this debate on how much money they personally give the Community budget."
"However, these same Member States are forgetting what they receive, the net contributions, via the single market and via the Structural Funds, given that a significant portion of the budget of the Structural Funds finds its way back to these Member States in various ways, which everyone knows and I need not analyse."
"In addition, farmers are being discussed."
"If the common agricultural policy is ever revised, I propose to the British Presidency that we start with the large-scale farmers, who receive the lion's share of subsidies, rather than the poor farmers in the south, if we want the common agricultural policy to have a social content."
"In all events, as coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on cohesion policy, I should like to say that Parliament has expressed its views."
"They are views that support a credible budget for cohesion, a cohesion policy without two tracks and with efficient management."
"Parliament will not keep quiet; it is not prepared to accept every Council agreement, every decision taken next week; we are here to fight to the end for the cohesion policy and we shall exercise all our rights."
"Six months ago I called attention to the fact that the changes needed in the European Union should start with the elimination of the long-standing unfair discrimination still evident against new Member States."
"We had to be disappointed."
"Now, at the end of the year, not only did we fail to make any progress on the road taking Europe out of the crisis, but we actually started off in the wrong direction, in the opposite direction."
"Mr Schulz, the iceberg is not ahead of us, but behind us."
"We have already managed to successfully avoid it once."
"The problem is that we are moving in reverse."
"It is obvious that the outcome will still be certain shipwreck."
"It has to be said that the budget proposal is not suited to serve as the foundation of the huge historical undertaking of European reunification."
"It does not reduce the crisis of Europe, but increases it; it does not unite European Union Member States, but divides them."
"It does not help new Member States, but humiliates them."
"It does not make Europe more competitive, but pulls it back."
"This budget proposal is a budget that slows us down and divides us."
"A few years ago the new Member States of the European Union accepted the transitional disadvantages and differentiations in Copenhagen in the hope that they would be able to participate in the seven-year financial plan with full rights, without differentiation."
"However, what we can now see is that the old Member States intend to solve their long-standing unsolved problems to the detriment of the new Member States."
"This is unacceptable, humiliating and inadmissible."
"This is not worthy of Europe."
"The governments need to change their approach."
"They should follow the European Parliament!"
"In spite of our differing interests, we already agreed on the budget in spring, and this House has more than 700 Members, while there are only 25 governments."
"Mr President, I have little time in which to speak, and I shall therefore focus on the agreement reached on EU aid policy on the theme, ‘European consensus’."
"I feel entirely positive about this agreement and the process that has led up to it, as I did not about the debate on the budget and the lack of leadership in that sphere."
"The dialogue conducted during the autumn between the Commission, the Council and Parliament has been both positive and constructive."
"I would thank Mr Barroso and Mr Alexander for their positive comments in this Chamber today, and I should like to convey my thanks both to Commissioner Michel and to Secretary of State Hilary Benn for what I consider to be their very constructive cooperation."
"As has already been stated in this Chamber today, the EU is, overall, the world’s largest aid donor."
"To date, the effectiveness and quality of the aid has not, however, been commensurate with its size."
"The EU Member States are poorly coordinated both among themselves and in relation to the Commission."
"This means high transaction costs, duplication of effort and major difficulties for many of the countries with which we cooperate."
"The new development policy, with one part now dealing with the EU’s work and another specifically with the Commission’s, will mean major progress in this area."
"Better donor coordination, greater coherence and increased efficiency are, then, the cornerstones of this policy."
"We have also obtained an agreement to define the Commission’s specific role in development cooperation, something I believe will become very important."
"Regarding the issues of substance, the fight against poverty continues to be given high priority."
"We also give increased attention to issues such as democracy and human rights, the importance of utilising natural resources in a sustainable way and the role of women in development work etc. In conclusion, I wish to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Development for their very constructive cooperation."
". Mr President, I always enjoy these debates."
"On the basis of this morning’s debate, I shall miss them!"
"Whether you will miss the British Presidency is perhaps a different judgement altogether, given the comments I have listened to during the last hour-and-a-half!"
"I will not be able to address every single point or charge that has been put to me in the course of the last couple of hours, but I will endeavour to answer some of the specific points that have been put to me by honourable Members."
"Mr Poettering began the debate with what I judged a rather unworthy charge that I, and the Presidency, had got out of our beds too late."
"If 4.30 a.m. is judged to be too late, then I apologise unreservedly to this House!"
"In the last 24 hours, more seriously, not only – as you would expect – have I met with our Prime Minister, our Chancellor of the Exchequer and our Foreign Minister as we prepare our revised proposals, but I have also met with the heads of mission in London of every one of the other 24 Member States of the European Union."
"So I will happily discuss how late we are working and how early we get up, as we endeavour to secure the deal that we believe is necessary for Europe’s future this weekend."
"As to the issue that you raised, Mr President, I can assure you that there was no discourtesy intended, nor is any intended now, in relation to the timing of the revised proposals being tabled by the European Presidency later today – not least given the timing of this important debate."
"First, these will not be wholly new proposals but will simply be revised proposals, the principles of which I set out in my introductory remarks."
"Secondly, the charge has been levelled that our Prime Minister is somehow not available for scrutiny on this, the second negotiating box."
"Our Prime Minister will be coming to Strasbourg tomorrow to hold further discussions with the Conference of Presidents."
"Thirdly, notwithstanding the criticism that has been directed toward the British Presidency in the course of this debate, I would respectfully reply that, as Mr Titley generously acknowledged, criticism of the Presidency’s engagement with this Parliament is surely not something that deserves to be articulated by honourable Members."
"My visit today is one of more than 80 visits by British ministers in the course of the British Presidency."
"Mr Schulz was brave enough to acknowledge our friendship before this House, so let me further imperil his reputation by saying that I also like and admire him."
"Let me return the candour with which he spoke to me directly."
"Mr Schulz, you discussed whether a cut on a rise was still a rise, and spoke of what you described as ‘the new arithmetic’."
"I should like to be clear that in relation to both the Commission’s proposals and the Luxembourg Presidency proposals, an unfunded offer is no offer at all."
"We need a deal that commands the support, not simply of those who spend the money, but also of those who contribute the money."
"As to the , I accept that trying to secure agreement amongst 25 Member States of this Union does involve a ‘titanic’ challenge, but I believe that it can end in agreement rather than tragedy."
"In only a few days’ time we will all find out."
"To Mr Watson, who said that no deal is better than a bad deal, I certainly find myself on common ground on that particular issue."
"Although I admire his erudition, his critique of how budgeting should work did rather call to my mind that it perhaps accounts for why the Liberals have now been out of power in the United Kingdom since 1929."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit spoke of a vacuum of achievements during the British Presidency."
"Perhaps he chose to ignore the development agenda, of which a number of honourable Members have spoken in this debate today."
"Also, given his concern for the environment, I am surprised that he did not pay due tribute to the work of Margaret Beckett, on behalf of the European Union, in persevering to secure agreement during what I judge to have been a hugely significant conference on climate change in Montreal, just last week."
"Mr Farage began his speech by accusing my Foreign Office officials behind me as being both able and ‘treacherous’."
"I was on the point of jumping to their defence and refuting this allegation, before one of them asked me to say that yes, that was entirely true!"
"We had the ghosts of Christmas past and Robin Hood bumping into the Sheriff of Nottingham in Mr Farage’s contribution."
"Suffice to say, the kindest thing I can find to say about that particular speech is rather than being a convincing case, it turned into more of a fairy tale."
"Mr Kirkhope, who, perhaps in a sign of disrespect to the Presidency, has now left the Chamber – I wonder whether he has returned to his bed rather than got up from it – made perhaps one of his final appearances as part of the EPP before this Chamber."
"Something of a swansong before being banished to new irrelevance by the incoming leader of the Conservative Party!"
"He suggested that the Presidency would not be able to afford his fees, if he was representing us."
"I do not know the level of the charge-out rates being sought by the present leader of the Conservative Party in the European Parliament, but I sincerely hope it is not very much, on the basis of the speech we heard this morning!"
"Mr Voggenhuber did not hold back and accused us of being surrounded by ruins at this stage in our Presidency."
"He then went on to follow the charge by suggesting that our Presidency proposals were framed by national egotism."
"This is a serious point, and I think it deserves a serious reply."
"There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that had the British Presidency sought to succumb to national egotism, it would have been far easier domestically for the United Kingdom and for the British Government to assume an approach which continued to advocate immediate and fundamental change, for example to the common agricultural policy and the wider European Union budget."
"It has been a far more challenging route to walk to suggest that, notwithstanding our continuing desire to see more fundamental change in the Union, that there should be a clear recognition of the urgent need to find the resources to fund the costs of enlargement, and that explains the basis of the proposals that we tabled initially last week and the revised proposals that we will table later today."
"Mrs de Brún spoke of the need for further work to secure the peace process in Northern Ireland, and on that specific point I listened very carefully to her in relation to the proposals that, in turn, we shall make."
"Let me deal, finally and briefly, with the issue of transparency which was taken up by Mr Titley."
"I was invited to inform honourable Members as to the further progress during the Presidency."
"I can assure this House, not least on the basis of the strength of opinions articulated within this Chamber on the matter, that we are making continuing efforts to increase the transparency of the Council."
"We tabled an options paper last month."
"There are proposals that have now been discussed both in Coreper I and Coreper II, and we continue to hope that the Council will adopt conclusions this month on the important matter of transparency."
"However, most honourable Members directed their interventions towards the important issue of future financing."
"Let those who criticise our proposals today pause, if only momentarily, to reflect on what we may all lose, but particularly the new Member States, about whom a number of honourable Members have spoken."
"Speaking for just a second as a United Kingdom Minister rather than solely on behalf of the Presidency, let me underline that we are willing to pay our fair share of the budget but not than our fair share."
"Back in June, we were asked to make a net contribution of an extra EUR 20 billion or more above and beyond the EUR 50 billion we were already going to pay, or, to put it another way, to make a net contribution about a third more than France as a share of gross national income."
"So let me be crystal clear on this point: that was not fair then and it is not fair now."
"We did not accept it then and we will not accept it this week or, indeed, next year."
"Instead, for the first time in 30 years of our membership of this European Union – 30 years, in which we have always been a net contributor to the Union – and after years of paying far more than countries of similar levels of prosperity, we intend to make a contribution roughly in parity with similar-sized countries, like France and Italy."
"We believe that is transparently and eminently fair."
"Others have alluded, at least briefly, in this important debate to this week’s other major event: the WTO ministerial meeting taking place presently in Hong Kong."
"A globally oriented Europe is also one that takes seriously its responsibilities to tackle global poverty, and I once again pay due tribute to a number of honourable Members who have brought this to our attention this morning."
"Following its decisions earlier this year effectively to double the level of development assistance by 2010, this Union needs to take the lead in securing a truly ambitious conclusion to the current WTO trade round."
"We have in our hands the potential to create a fairer trading global system that will allow hundreds of millions to lift themselves out of poverty."
"This is no zero-sum game."
"A fairer global trade system can also act as a spur to the reforms that Europe needs if it is to enhance its competitiveness and deliver on its promises of social justice."
"We need an outcome to the round, whether in Hong Kong or indeed in the months and years to follow, that is, therefore, pro-poor in the world and pro-jobs in Europe."
"Let me finish my contribution to today’s debate, however, by casting our minds back to July when we took over the Presidency."
"A number of honourable Members have referred to the speech that our Prime Minister made at that time."
"But let us remember also the context of that speech coming, as it did, soon after the twin rejection of the European Constitution in France and in the Netherlands."
"There has been a lot of debate as to the exact significance of those two votes."
"What, if anything, was wrong with the constitutional draft itself?"
"What were the citizens of Europe telling us about the way in which they wanted the European Union to be run?"
"I would agree with the commentator who said that what we saw in June was the rejection not just of the text but of the context."
"People in France and in the Netherlands did not have deep-seated objections to a particular subparagraph or clause of the draft Constitution."
"Rather the basic question, which should still be in our minds today and in our minds during this European Council, which these European citizens were asking, is what did the European Union deliver for them?"
"They were not sure enough about the value added to their lives."
"They did not know enough about the decisions it made and they had not got the trust in Europe’s politicians to steer the right course."
"People were uncertain about the broader forces of global change, about the economic challenges facing Europe and what they might mean for them and for their families."
"Who can blame them at a time when one in ten European citizens today are out of work, in which one in twenty are long-term unemployed?"
"It is the duty of those who believe fundamentally in social justice to ask how the European Union can be part of a solution to that challenge."
"The answer to people’s justifiable concerns about change is not, I would argue, to turn inwards, retreating into a politics of anxiety and, indeed, an economics of protectionism."
"That way offers no solution and, I would argue, no hope."
"If we are to meet the challenges of today’s world, we must turn outwards with optimism and determination and become a globally oriented Europe."
"That is what will inspire us in the days ahead."
"I can assure you that I will, in turn, pass back the comments that I have received in the course of this morning’s debate to our Prime Minister and to other members of our government ahead of his visit here to Strasbourg tomorrow."
"I can assure you of our best endeavours in the critical days and hours that lie ahead."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to address three issues in this, my final speech."
"I shall first deal with the very important matter of development, and in particular with the agreement that has come to light in the Council on the EU’s policy on development and development aid."
"I shall go on to look into what can be concluded from this debate, and then address the UK Presidency directly."
"With regard to development, I should like to correct something that Mr Martinez Martinez said."
"I said in my first speech, in the clearest terms, that I was very proud of the Commission’s contribution towards achieving the consensus on development aid policy that clearly exists between the Commission, Parliament and the Council."
"Indeed, I went further, and said that the Commission will fulfil its role of checking whether the Member States are honouring their commitments on development aid, and of keeping the public informed on this matter."
"I therefore wish to state categorically that we are committed to an ambitious development aid policy, that the Commission is responsible for pursuing this policy, and that we wish to continue to work with Parliament and the Council in such a way that the EU continues to lead the way, on the international stage, in providing aid for countries most in need of our solidarity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, beyond the occasionally sharp words uttered by the speakers during this sitting, it is in fact a deep sense of concern that has been expressed on the eve of an extremely important date for the Union."
"This concern comes in the face of a lack of ambition which is, to all intents and purposes, hindering the necessary modernisation of our economies."
"Colleagues, please be quiet."
"Our debate is not yet over."
". Mr President, with all due respect, this happens almost every time I sum up a debate!"
"It is better that Members of Parliament are coming in, rather than going out when I start to speak, but, if I may make a suggestion, maybe it would be a good idea in future to come up with another system to avoid disruptions to debates directly preceding the vote."
"I shall continue, but I believe that it is important to look into this issue; it is also a question of respect among our institutions."
"I already said, with all due respect, that when the president of another institution makes a speech before this Assembly, he has the right to be listened to in silence."
"Yes, Mr Schulz, you are right, not just listened to in silence, but listened to carefully, just as carefully as I have listened to all of you, ladies and gentlemen."
"I should like to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that, throughout this morning’s debate, I have sensed grave concern in this House, and I am sure that Mr Alexander will inform his government and the Presidency of this concern, felt by virtually all the political forces in Parliament."
"This concern comes in the face of a lack of ambition, which could create obstacles to the modernisation of our economies, and in the face of the danger posed by a ‘two speed’, divided Europe."
"It is a concern regarding the Union’s capacity to provide itself with the necessary resources to enable it to win the battle in relation to globalisation and, therefore, in relation to employment and to the well-being of Europeans."
"As you know, these concerns are also shared by myself and by the Commission, and I will outline them very clearly at tomorrow’s European Council."
"The die has not yet been cast, however, and the time will come to take stock of the situation."
"We must have only one aim tomorrow: to reach an agreement."
"Not just any agreement, of course, but an agreement that opens up real perspectives - and not just financial perspectives, but political perspectives with a view to European integration."
"An agreement that opens the door to constructive negotiation with your Parliament and to the conclusion of a sound interinstitutional agreement, as – and this scarcely needs repeating – we need the agreement of the three institutions."
"In short, an agreement that will testify to our sense of responsibility where our citizens and Europe are concerned and that will give men and women reasons to believe in this Europe, for which the majority of people continue to hope and pray."
"I would now like to address the British Presidency with all due respect, friendship and frankness."
"First of all, I would like to congratulate you, because of what you have achieved during this debate: getting Mr Schulz to speak such good English was a real achievement by the British Presidency."
"I hope, however, that this will not be the highlight of the British Presidency ..."
"and that we will have a major success in the Council tomorrow and afterwards."
"We sincerely hope for more."
"How can this be achieved?"
"That is the problem."
"Does it not concern the British Presidency that the overwhelming majority of this House and the most relevant political groups unanimously reject your proposal?"
"Does the opinion of this House and the Members of Parliament who were directly elected by our citizens mean nothing, or mean so little, to the Presidency of the Council?"
"I hope the conclusions of this debate are important for your final negotiating position in the Council."
"And, does it not concern the British Presidency that the strongest supporters of your proposal in this Chamber are those who hold a narrow-minded, nationalistic, backward-looking vision of Europe?"
"Is it not strange that there is such a contradiction between the forward-looking, modern, open, competitive view of Europe expressed by Mr Blair, and the lack of ambition of the British Presidency proposal in terms of financial assurance?"
"So, with all due respect, frankness and friendship, I say to the Presidency of the Council that we have to avoid this disconnection between the policy objectives on energy, security, immigration, research and universities that are supported by the Presidency – and were so well expressed at Hampton Court – and the resistance to providing the means to achieve them."
"We must have the courage to explain this to the whole public in Europe – including, of course, the British public."
"If we want an enlarged Europe, we need investment."
"If we want a modern, reformist, competitive Europe, we need investment."
"If we want an open Europe in terms of global trade, we need investment."
"Let me tell you very frankly that I am concerned about this."
"President-in-Office, you mentioned the world trade talks."
"I really think that, if we do not have a good deal in the European Council, this could undermine the goals for the global talks."
"Why?"
"Let us be frank: in the European Union there are several opinions about the world trade talks."
"There are those who are more in favour, who take a more affirmative position on trade, and those who are more ‘prudent’ or resistant to it."
"Some of the less-developed regions of Europe and the countries that have some structural problems will not support open, ambitious world trade talks if there is not good investment in these countries’ social and economic development."
"I want the British Presidency, the Member States and the Council to think strategically, not only from the point of view of an accountant but also from a political point of view, and consider whether no deal or a bad deal on the budget will not put some fundamental strategic objectives – such as the world trade talks, an open Europe and an enlarged Europe – at risk."
"Already we can hear people saying that, with this kind of ambition with regard to the Financial Perspective, there is no provision for further enlargements of the European Union."
"Therefore, the issue we shall be discussing tomorrow is very important."
"It is not just about the financial perspective."
"It is about the budget, but it is more than that."
"It is the kind of vision we have for Europe: whether you envisage an ambitious open and reformist Europe – an enlarged Europe, or a mini-Europe: a Europe that does not fulfil the goals that the citizens of Europe want."
"On the subject of the British rebate, let us be clear: we understand the British position."
"Mr Blair said: ‘the rebate is an anomaly’."
"However, at the same time he said that he is ready to discuss the general question of the rebate when there is a discussion on the reform of the budget."
"That is why I believe it is important to have a real discussion about the future of our budget, without taboos, looking at everything, the expenditure and the resources."
"Our discussions and the proposals made by various Member States are not about the existence of the rebate; it is the size of the increase of the rebate that is the problem."
"Should the British rebate grow by 60% at the expense of the poorest Members of the Union?"
"I think not – that is not fair."
"It is my duty and the duty of the Commission to represent the general interest of Europe, particularly those Member States who have just joined our Union."
"They want to see the solidarity of the European Union."
"If the European institutions do not send signals of solidarity to the new Members, they might be tempted to think that the European Union that they have joined is not the European Union of solidarity that we daily endeavour to build."
"I believe a deal is possible."
"It is difficult but it is possible."
"I would just like to mention again what I believe are the minimum conditions for a deal that will also be accepted by the Commission and Parliament, because Parliament will also have a say on this."
"The first point is a higher level of spending."
"The second point is a fairer deal for the new Member States in terms of solidarity, giving them an opportunity to show whether or not they are able to spend the money, not starting from the position that they are not able to invest in their own development."
"The third point is the adaptation of the British rebate to meet the conditions of enlargement."
"That is all the Commission is asking, and we believe it is fair and reasonable."
"From all the contacts that we have had with all Member States, we believe this can be accepted."
"A fourth condition is a real review clause that will enable the Commission, Parliament and the Council to look at the budget in good time."
"It is true we have a problem with the budget."
"However, we should not be paralysed by it; we should approve the budget for the next seven years but at the same time give ourselves time to look at it in terms of expenditure and resources."
"We should have a real debate about what we want from the European institutions, what we want in terms of competitiveness, what we want in terms of solidarity."
"This should be a real review clause, not just a cosmetic review clause, so we have a true debate in Europe about the instruments to fulfil our objectives."
"Finally, I believe it is important for the Council to take on board at least some, if not all, of Parliament’s very good suggestions concerning flexibility, for instance the globalisation adjustment fund – a typical flexibility instrument – and other good suggestions by Parliament for the new interinstitutional agreement."
"When we discuss the budget it will only be fair to take on board the suggestions that were put in a very responsible way in the debate in Parliament."
"If these conditions are met, if there is a significant move on the points I have just mentioned, I believe a deal is possible and necessary."
"I know it is difficult and will require a lot of statesmanship by all the Members of the Council and all the Heads of State and Government present."
"I believe a deal is important."
"It is my duty and the duty of the Commission to protect the general interest of the European Union."
"I can promise you that tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow, we will put forward in the European Council this vision of a Europe that has ambition and a European that is committed to the goals of solidarity. Because without solidarity there is no Union."
"Thank you very much, Mr Barroso."
"I was receiving the winners of the Sakharov Prize, but the noise of the applause for Mr Barroso was so rapturous that I felt obliged to rush to the Chamber to see what was happening, because it is not normal for Mr Barroso to receive such loud and sustained applause."
"You are aware that, if there are no changes to the programme, Mr Blair, President-in-Office of the Council, will come to Strasbourg tomorrow to meet with the Conference of Presidents and to explain his proposal to the Council which the Minister representing the British Presidency has not been able, or has not wished, to explain."
"The political groups and you as well, Mr Barroso, have spoken very clearly."
"I would just like to offer you a warning: we must not underestimate words."
"The unacceptable must not be accepted, because otherwise something that is declared unacceptable today and accepted tomorrow may turn the applause into boos."
"The line between the acceptable and the unacceptable cannot be so thin."
"That concludes this debate, and I would like to thank everybody who has taken part in it."
"The Presidency has a thankless task in trying to reach an agreement in Council on the financial perspectives."
"It has to reconcile the six countries who wanted to limit EU spending to 1% of GDP with those who want a much larger budget."
"It has to deal with Mr Chirac who wants to ring-fence all agricultural spending, from which his country benefits far more than most."
"It has to deal also with the expectations of the new Member States and with longstanding members who wish to preserve their privileges – such as Spain which wants to remain a net beneficiary to a greater extent than the much poorer central European countries, and Luxembourg which, in per capita terms, is both the richest Member States in and the biggest net beneficiary."
"It has to deal with all those who think that a cost-free –for them! – way to increase resources is to cut the British rebate – although even with the rebate Britain’s net contribution is far higher than that of France and Italy."
"I wish the Presidency well in finding an agreement which will serve as Council’s negotiating position for the definitive negotiation with Parliament."
"– The run-up to this Council shows just how serious our problems are in the EU, and is indicative of the crisis arising from the increasingly neoliberal policies, which pander to the interests of the large economic and financial groups in the most powerful countries."
"The wealthiest countries are showing less and less solidarity; the principles of economic and social cohesion in the Treaty are being totally trampled underfoot; the most recent rounds of enlargement have taken place without any fresh financial resources; and the situation is set to get worse, with the British Presidency proposing more cuts for the new Member States and for cohesion countries such as Portugal."
"The great malaise in the European Union is embodied by the budget crisis, and the monetarist policies of the European Central Bank and the Stability and Growth Pact serve to exacerbate that malaise. Furthermore, the problem will only deepen with the cuts imposed on the Community budget."
"Despite all of this, attempts are being made to reinstate priorities contained in the – already rejected – so-called European Constitution, such as the militarisation of the EU, so-called internal security, immigration control and competition policy."
"The upshot of this will be financial resources being channelled into meeting the needs of the economically most developed countries and the economic and financial groups in those countries, at the expense of social needs, the environment, cohesion and development aid."
"– The financial framework for 2007-2013 is the centrepiece of the European Council."
"It is not the only ‘item on the agenda’, however: the liberalisation of services and the so-called ‘fight against terrorism’ also feature."
"After the British Presidency had given precedence to the interests of the economically most developed EU countries, by putting forward a proposal to lower the bar still further and to overlook the contradictions inherent therein, pressure increased to reach agreement as quickly as possible."
"UNICE (the European employers’ association) has been saying that an agreement has indeed been reached."
"Whilst warning of the danger that the EU will lose ‘credibility’, it has presented its wish list: an agreement on the financial perspective, reaffirming that this should ‘act in the interests of pursuing the Lisbon agenda’; the prompt establishment of the internal services market (it is revealing that, by way of justifying the liberalisation of services, UNICE argues that this is an ‘essential element of the Lisbon Strategy’ and a ‘requirement of the Treaties’, backed by rulings made by the European Court of Justice – and then tries to ‘sell’ us the idea that the so-called European Constitution has nothing to do with this ...); and the liberalisation of world trade within the framework of the World Trade Organisation."
"Behold the unmasked EU!"
"It saddens me as a proud Scottish European that the UK has represented Scotland so badly during the Presidency, and everything I have heard in this debate confirms my view that the UK has lost friends and influence on our behalf by this wrongheaded stance on the budget."
"The proposals announced today fail Scotland and they fail Europe also."
"I have no doubt that they will be comprehensively rejected by other member states and with 11 of those states smaller than Scotland I am more convinced than ever that there is no substitute for independence in Europe."
"I would now like to welcome a delegation from the Central American Parliament who are in the official gallery."
"I would also like to congratulate its President, Mr Julio Palacios, on his election as President of that institution, which emerged from the Esquipulas agreements that put an end to years of civil wars in several Central American countries."
"Congratulations, Mr President."
"We shall proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, this is probably the wrong time to discuss the content of this proposal in detail, but I would like to say that I have received hundreds of e-mails – not sent in bulk, but individually written messages – and 58 000 verified signatures from members of the public right across Europe, giving vent to their grave concerns."
"So much for the alleged great public longing for data retention!"
"The Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has taken these objections seriously and, by means of its amendments, balanced freedom and security against one another."
"The accumulated pressure of time does not, however, justify the ways in which some elements are attempting to proceed."
"If this project matters to the European public and is not meant to be just a favour done for the British Presidency of the Council, then we should proceed with caution, for if we do not, we will be fostering the prejudicial belief that the Council only has to call on Parliament to jump for this House to ask in reply ‘how high?’"
"Under high-pressure conditions, that is the sort of thing that can happen."
"It is high pressure that enables nature, over the course of millions of years, to produce the most marvellous diamonds."
"Put a lemon under high pressure, though, and in no time at all, all that will be left is juice and pulp."
"Whether this House is to be a diamond or a lemon depends on us, so, in order that it may remain a diamond, I ask you to join with me in endorsing the amendments tabled by your committee."
". – It is scarcely to be expected that I should be happy with the outcome of the vote."
"As I can no longer put my name to this report, I withdraw it."
"That concludes the vote."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to welcome, on behalf of all of you, on behalf of all of us, the two winners of the European Parliament’s Sakharov Prize 2005 and the representative of the third winner."
"Unfortunately, despite all of the efforts made right up to the last minute, the ‘Women in White’ have not been given permission to leave Cuba to be with us today."
"I believe that I can say on behalf of the entire European Parliament that we regret and reject this attitude on the part of the Cuban authorities."
"On this formal occasion I would like to talk about the ‘Women in White’ and our reasons for awarding them this prize."
"This is unfortunately not the first time that this has happened."
"Neither Nelson Mandela, Aung San Suu Kyi, Leyla Zana, nor Wei Jingshen were able to come here to receive their prize."
"Their representatives came instead of them."
"When they we able to – some have not yet been able because they are still being detained – they came to the House and we met especially to hear them."
"This happened in the case of Nelson Mandela and more recently Leyla Zana."
"We shall therefore continue to apply every possible pressure on the Cuban authorities to allow them to come, and when they do we shall organise a formal sitting so that they can address our House, as we have on previous occasions, and we will do everything we can to ensure that this happens as soon as possible."
"What all of this year’s winners have in common is their fight for human dignity and freedom."
"They are worthy successors of the Soviet academic whose name is on the prize that the European Parliament awards."
"In their different ways, all three symbolise the fight to consolidate human rights in the world."
"The fight against regimes that imprison critics who dare criticise them."
"The fight against inhuman laws."
"The fight against those who deny the right to information and against the terrorists who want to banish the right to information."
"The European Parliament has supported this year’s winners by means of its resolutions and its initiatives."
"They are well known to us."
"We have followed their work, we have followed their fight."
"Their presence here is just the end of a process that we have shared by means of our resolutions."
"It is a fight for a more democratic and more just world."
"Please allow me to point out, here in this esteemed Chamber, that many Europeans believe that the right to have one’s human rights respected is something natural, something inevitable, which is practically free, and that it has always been the case."
"No, it has not always been the case, and nor is it yet the case in many parts of the world, unfortunately."
"For the great majority of humanity it is still a distant dream."
"And for this reason, we Europeans have a special duty to defend and promote human rights in the world."
"I would like to speak briefly about each of our prize-winners: the ‘Women in White’ are represented by Mrs Blanca Reyes, who has been a ‘Woman in White’ until she fortunately ceased to be one when her husband was set free, whom I had the pleasure to receive on your behalf in this Parliament immediately after he was released from prison."
"These women demonstrate peacefully every week in Havana to express their solidarity with relatives and friends in prison since March 2003."
"To a certain extent they are also continuing the phenomenon that was known at the time as the ‘Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo’, to whom we also awarded a prize."
"The only crime of many of these prisoners is to express publicly their opposition to the government as ordinary citizens, as independent journalists or as peaceful dissidents."
"Many of them have become seriously ill during their imprisonment in conditions which Mrs Reyes will no doubt describe to us."
"We called for the release of these prisoners in April 2004 and unfortunately this is still far from being achieved, despite certain individual cases that have arisen."
"The experience of many European countries shows us that it is not possible to establish the conditions for a transition to democracy, a peaceful transition to democracy, by imprisoning dissidents, quite the opposite."
"Let us hope that the transition to democracy in Cuba takes good note of the experience of certain European countries."
"Mrs Hauwa Ibrahim:"
"You have used your talents as a lawyer to promote the rule of law."
"Your strength, as you said to me when I received you this morning, lies in respect for the law."
"We admire your determination."
"In this enormous country of Nigeria, you defend people who live with the threat of cruel and inhuman punishments."
"Punishments which are applied in accordance with Sharia law in twelve States of your country."
"You fight for these people’s right to a fair trial, in accordance with the law."
"Please believe me that we felt moved and indignant while watching the proceedings against Amina Lawal and Safya Hussaini, accused of adultery."
"You made sure that the law prevailed, demanding respect for the Constitution and for the international Treaties signed by Nigeria."
"It is inconceivable that a woman accused of adultery can still be stoned."
"It is inconceivable that a woman accused of adultery can be stoned as in biblical times; we cannot condone the amputation of young criminals."
"This Parliament has spoken out vigorously against these inhuman punishments and against the death penalty on many occasions."
"Mrs Ibrahim, we stand shoulder to shoulder with you in rejecting this cruelty and our rejection will be total."
"We admire your personal commitment."
"The personal commitment that you express with great conviction: that of the right to education for the poor, in particular women, because poverty harms women especially."
"You are an example for all Nigerians who want to leave behind poverty and ignorance."
"We are also receiving Robert Ménard today, who is well known to this House, Secretary-General of Reporters Without Borders, and, through him, all journalists."
"These professional people breathe life into freedom of information and open our eyes to a cruel world."
"There can be no democracy without pluralist information."
"Information is the raw material, the principal fuel, of the system of democracy."
"Without it there can be no democracy."
"We pay homage to those who fight every day, in every part of the world, to make this principle a reality."
"To those who all too frequently fall victim as a result of their passionate pursuit of their duties."
"Unfortunately, they all too often fall victim as a result of their passionate pursuit of their duties."
"A few weeks ago, Robert Ménard was denied permission to attend the Information Summit taking place in Tunisia."
"The Tunisian authorities were undoubtedly afraid of what he would say."
"It is a great paradox that this should happen precisely when we are talking about the right to access to free information for everybody."
"I would like to remind you that in 2005, which is drawing to a close, 58 journalists have lost their lives, one every week of the year, every seven days a journalist dies while carrying out their duty."
"In 2004 that figure was 53. Unfortunately, it is increasing."
"I would like to pay tribute to all of them, and to all of their imprisoned or disappeared colleagues."
"This Parliament has acted and will always act in support of them."
"Because dictatorships do not last forever."
"Some last a long time, too long, but they do not last forever."
"Through their brutal actions, the terrorists will not deny us freedom of information either, the essential basis of our democratic life."
"Finally, and before giving the floor to our winners and their representatives I would like to combine the thoughts of Voltaire and Brecht."
"Two intellectuals separated by many years."
"One of them opened up the light and the other suffered in the shadows."
"Both Voltaire and Brecht used a similar expression, and I am not very sure to which of them it should be most attributed."
"They said it during different eras, in different places and in different circumstances."
"I would insist, one of them was opening up the light and the other was enduring the shadows."
"Both said that freedom of expression is the only right that separates freedom from tyranny."
"And not to accept this is to condemn the human being to ignominy."
"Congratulations to our prize winners on the courage they have shown."
"Voltaire and Brecht are watching us."
"Thank you very much."
"Mrs Blanca Reyes, you have the floor."
"‘. Mr José Borrell, President of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, esteemed participants, Mr Robert Ménard, Doctor Ibrahim, European friends and Cuban brothers and sisters resident in all parts of the world, the honour of being awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize, shared with Doctor Ibrahim and the hard-working and selfless Reporters Without Borders, has touched the hearts of the Women in White and of the seventy-five prisoners of conscience imprisoned in Cuba during the black spring of 2003 very deeply."
"I would like firstly to welcome a supportive delegation of friends of the Women in White in exile ― and I mean exile ― who are here with us in the visitors’ gallery."
"I myself am a woman of exile, because, as you are well aware, the real Women in White are not with us today, unfortunately."
"We never imagined that our spontaneous group, motivated by pain and injustice, which has no political allegiance or party or group organisation, would receive such a prestigious tribute."
"For us, this prize means an even greater commitment to our cause and to you; an inspiration to carry on defending the innocence of our loved ones with greater courage and to demand their immediate and unconditional release."
"Once again, the Cuban Government has demonstrated its systematic violation of the human rights of the population of our country on a daily basis, by denying five peaceful and defenceless women permission to travel and to be with you at this prizing-giving ceremony, despite having completed all of the bureaucratic procedures that it had demanded of them, the majority of which are unnecessary and incomprehensible, including the efforts of this Parliament and of certain European personalities and governments."
"This does not prevent the Women in White from being here in Strasbourg today, nor the seventy-five prisoners sentenced since March 2003 and hundreds of Cuban prisoners of conscience and politicians."
"On the contrary, the entire world will hear your voices today and the response of all of us."
"We will not collect that prize today, but, like Andrei Sakharov, the eminent scientist and selfless fighter for freedom of thought, the exemplary Aung San Suu Kyi, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo and all the other winners from previous years, we shall continue our tireless efforts to ensure that social justice, democracy and reconciliation prevail."
"In particular, we could bring you together with our compatriot Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas, the Cuban awarded in the prize in 2002."
"We would like you to visit us in our homeland, Cuba, for an award ceremony for the Prize for Freedom of Thought in the near future."
"We shall receive you in our modest homes and not just we five women, but many many more, will be able to show you personally the harsh conditions, the arbitrary treatment, the intimidation and repression suffered by our prisoners and our families."
"Before I finish, in view of their particular significance amongst the very many acknowledgements and congratulations that we have received, I would like to quote the words of former Czech President Vaclav Havel: ‘Dear Women in White, I would like to congratulate you most warmly on the prize that you have been awarded by the European Parliament."
"Your strength makes you worthy of this recognition."
"I am convinced that it will serve as an inspiration to your courageous husbands, just as the interest of the free world was an inspiration for me during the darkest times of my imprisonment."
"Vaclav Havel’."
"Finally, and I hope you will not take this as impertinent, rude or discourteous, I would like to inform you that the Women in White have asked me not to take part in the official lunch that you have arranged following this ceremony."
"This ‘empty chair’ policy is only intended to be a symbolic gesture, of protest against the Cuban dictatorship and of condemnation in the eyes of the world, at the absence of the true recipients of this prize."
"I hope that you can understand and forgive such a blatant absence."
"We would like once again to thank you for acknowledging us — wives, mothers, daughters, sisters and aunts, representatives of the Cuban people — and we would like to reiterate our conviction that no cause is impossible if it is inspired by justice, reconciliation and love."
"Every voice, united in diversity, for the right to freedom of thought."

"Havana, 14 December 2005."
"Mr President, political group chairmen, honourable Members of this beautiful Parliament, my friends from Lawyers Without Borders in France, staff of the Parliament – especially the Protocol Service, who have provided me with guidance since I arrived; I would like to mention Ursula Bausch and my guide; members of the press, ladies and gentlemen: ever since our arrival on Monday we have been warmly welcomed by all of you."
"We started with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which afforded us the opportunity of being heard by all the political groups. We are very grateful for this opportunity."
"We were able to explain our work and answer questions about what the European Union and European Parliament can do for us."
"We want to assure you that, following this ceremony, we will be willing to discuss any specific issues you wish to bring up with us, at any time, regarding the projects or programmes in our regions or constituencies with the appropriate committees and think-tanks."
"In some of the committees and groups, I mentioned the strategies we used in the defence of the woman sentenced to death under the Islamic religious law of Sharia in Nigeria, and I will continue on that subject now."
"I shall then try to read my three-minute speech, as I have been advised."
"Let me turn now to our strategy."
"Our strategy was to understand the dynamics of the Islamic law of Sharia."
"We tried to understand the dynamics of the mullahs, the religious leaders."
"We tried to understand the dynamics of the culture and the values of our people and, above all, we tried to understand the dynamics of the society in which we operate."
"We were focused and we stayed focused."
"The press asked us questions such as, ‘Is it Islam versus the West, or perhaps a clash of civilisations?’."
"We do not know."
"We knew, however, that a woman had been sentenced to death by stoning and that we were using the instrument of the law to ensure her freedom."
"That is what we knew."
"We paid attention to the detail around us, but were flexible with regard to society’s perception of what we were doing."
"We acted locally, but we thought globally."
"Lawyers Without Borders from Canada and France gave us support, and every time we went to court we had a plan."
"We also had a back-up plan, just in case."
"We did not tell the media, which had given us huge coverage, what they wanted to hear."
"We told them what we wanted them to know."
"We were aware of the views around us and the accusations, verbal attacks and threats, but we stayed focused."
"I will share with you today our safety strategy."
"Of course we had many threats and we had to take care of ourselves so that we did not get killed."
"We did not travel to court in the same car."
"At times, we would take our public car then switch to our personal car and we sometimes took public transport."
"We never travelled in the same car twice, because we knew we were being monitored."
"We never dress the same way twice."
"We never take the same route twice, if we can avoid it."
"More importantly, however, it was necessary to engage with the fundamentalists."
"We engaged with the extremists, and I will try to illustrate that with a brief story."
"I was interviewed by a BBC reporter, who came from London but interviewed me in the local language, Hausa."
"He asked me whether stoning to death was in the Koran."
"My response was simply that I did not think so."
"It was played repeatedly over the radio, and the mullahs decided to answer me via the radio."
"They said I was anti-Sharia and anti-Islam."
"That meant that I had committed blasphemy and could be stoned to death."
"I was afraid, of course."
"I then called the reporter and told him I wanted to meet the mullahs."
"He said, ‘That is a very dangerous thing to do."
"You heard what they said on the radio’."
"The radio programme was not only broadcast to the more than 70 million people in Nigeria who understand Hausa, but also across the western coast of Africa, where Hausa is spoken in several countries."
"Hausa is the second largest language in Africa, after Swahili."
"He said that it was really dangerous to do that, but I told him I wanted to go."
"He said that he would not be responsible for me, but would introduce me."
"He was kind enough to do so and the mullahs decided to see me in the mosque."
"It was a huge mosque, bigger than this hall, though not as beautiful."
"There were eight mullahs."
"They were sitting at the end of the hall and in the middle of the hall was a chair."
"When I went in, they beckoned me to sit on the chair."
"I did not sit on the chair."
"I walked towards them."
"On approaching them, I decided to kneel down and to sit on the floor and they said to me as I went to sit, ‘You cannot sit on the floor."
"Sit on that chair’."
"And I said to them, ‘How can I, your daughter, sit on a chair when you, my fathers, are sitting on a chair?’"
"They asked me, ‘Are you Hauwa Ibrahim?’"
"And I said, ‘I am’, never looking at their faces because that culture forbids me to do that."
"And they said to me: ‘Are you the lawyer?’"
"And I said: ‘I am."
"I am a stupid lawyer."
"I did not know what I was doing."
"I came to you, because I want your wisdom."
"I came to you because I want some knowledge."
"I want to do what is right for society, but I do not know how to do it and I want you to guide me’."
"It is important to understand that this was my strategy."
"I caught their attention."
"They listened to what I was saying, but they did more than that."
"They said, ‘We will not publicly support you, but neither will we publicly oppose you’."
"And that was all I needed."
"Nothing more."
"We needed safety."
"We needed them to listen to us."
"We needed to carry them along with us."
"We needed to engage them."
"This is part of the strategy."
"In all the 90 cases in which I have been involved, the strategies have not been the same."
"As you know, I do not take money for the cases."
"This is because I have enjoyed a huge privilege – that of education."
"And that is my passion."
"Whatever my share of this prize, all of it is going towards education."
"As a result of this Sakharov Prize, I have started a trust fund to invest in education, because I think that is the way forward."
"Now I shall read my three-minute speech!"
"I am humbled to receive this prestigious 2005 Sakharov Prize alongside this distinguished group of people."
"I am saddened that the Ladies in White are not here."
"I share Parliament’s sentiment, and agree with what the President said."
"I am proud to be associated with the Reporters Without Borders."
"This is a gift and an empowering message to the voiceless, to the powerless, to the illiterate and to women."
"It acknowledges not just the women and children of northern Nigeria, for whom I have worked, but everyone who remains unrepresented in society."
"This award tells those millions that the European Parliament does not just hear them but that it supports, encourages and celebrates them."
"It is humbling to realise that most of us strive for the common good, for universal respect for human dignity, for basic human rights and civil rights."
"Unfortunately, some of the provisions of the new Sharia legal system in my country, Nigeria, violate some basic human rights, especially equal treatment under the law."
"In spite of scientific progress, a woman in 2005 can be stoned to death for having a child out of wedlock."
"It raises the issue of respect for the certainty and supremacy of law, respect for fundamental rights, the separation of state and religion and strict standards for evidence."
"This law has resulted in the loss of hundreds of lives."
"The 90 victims of the Sharia legal system, in whose defence I have been involved, are powerless and voiceless."
"They are illiterate and poor."
"The new Sharia legal system in Nigeria needs to be reformed."
"We need you to help us with your voice."
"It has to be reformed."
"Our goal for the reform is a bottom-top approach."
"We have a long-term plan, a medium-term plan and a short-term plan."
"Our methodology will be flexible."
"It will be responsive to a cultural system of values."
"It demands organisational and analytical skills, as well as creative intelligence."
"We must think strategically, coordinating and cooperating with donors, working with political leaders, building coalitions and encouraging alternative ways of resolving disputes."
"We will give people the tools to ask questions and encourage greater measures of political freedom and activism."
"We will let people realise the essence of the rule of law, not the essence of being ruled by the law or by man."
"To encourage this idea and vision we will build, without letting up, on the struggle and labours of our women heroes, such as the one this building is named after: Louise Weiss."
"We cannot afford to be infatuated by the progress we have made."
"We must continue to build on this modern approach, through advocacy and beyond."
"I will walk out of this beautiful and magnificent building feeling a greater sense of self esteem, having a greater voice."
"The European Parliament, one of the world’s most important bodies, is behind me."
"Most importantly, the plight of the poor and the voiceless, with whom I have walked free today, is gaining attention and their cause is known and supported."
"Today, you have made the voice for humanity louder."
"I will return to Nigeria with a deep sense of mission and will help redefine the future of the vulnerable and powerless."
"I will return to share skills within my country, and across the globe, with humility and passion for freedom and justice, irrespective of race, colour, sex, political beliefs and privileges."
"My ultimate hope is that, through the effective application of the rule of law, those who argue for truth and justice and those who work effectively to achieve a better community will change people’s hearts and the attitude that governs society and bring about the type of world envisaged by all of us."
"I have chosen a path, a path of equal protection under the law, a path to pursue justice, encourage and engage, a path to do good."
"I have found in all of you in the European Parliament, and all lovers of humanity, the passion to go on."
"What a great day, what a great honour and what great people!"
"Thank you so much."
". Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin, of course, by thanking you for having awarded us, the entire team – some of whom are present - this Sakharov Prize, and by letting you know just how important this is to us."
"Allow me just to mention one name, that of Mr Jean-Marie Cavada, who is a friend of mine;"
"I know how much he campaigned for Reporters without Borders to be awarded this prize."
"Thank you, Jean-Marie."
"I should just like randomly to share some positive and more negative observations with you."
"I shall begin with the positive ones and leave the negative ones until the end."
"I should like to begin by congratulating you, the men and women of Parliament, on having recognised the qualities of - and, above all, on having awarded a prize such as this to - journalists who are, all the same, a constant thorn in your side and towards whom you often do not hold back your criticism – for good reason."
"You are, in fact, right: journalists do not do their jobs very well - far from it – but to award this Sakharov Prize to Reporters without Borders also goes to show that, in spite of everything, there is an awareness of just how vital journalists are for democracy, in the same way as elected representatives are."
"It also goes to show – allow me to make this point here, even if you are already aware of it – that, notwithstanding the gossip columns, there also exists the kind of journalism that involves taking risks on a daily basis."
"Such daily risk-taking is represented by our 74 colleagues killed in Iraq - a figure twice that recorded in 20 years of war in Vietnam - and the five Iraqi journalists being held today among the 120 journalists detained in Iraq by the US army, with no information at all available on why they are being held, what they are accused of or how exactly they can be defended."
"It is to them, through us, that you are paying tribute."
"I believe, once again, that they deserve such tribute, even though there is good reason to be irritated by the behaviour of the press."
"Allow me to mention another name in this House, one that I believe is in the news: that of the most recent journalist to have been killed."
"You will know to whom I am referring: Gebran Tueni."
"I am not the only one in this House who knew of Gebran Tueni; he was a leading political figure in Lebanon."
"He was the fourteenth victim of targeted attacks that have been taking place in the country for some months."
"We must support the Lebanese people and we must support the Lebanese democrats."
"You are aware that, through Gebran Tueni, it was, again, democracy and genuine Lebanese independence that were being targeted."
"I wanted to pay tribute with you to the memory of Gebran Tueni."
"I shall now present at random some perhaps rather more critical points, and the prize awarded to the Ladies in White enables me to address them."
"There still continues to exist a ‘variable geometry’ capacity for indignation that shocks me to the core."
"How can one fail to understand that, on the one hand, the detention of 24 journalists in Cuba and, on the other hand, the situation I described to you a moment ago, whereby the US army is holding journalists in Iraq without ever having justified its actions, might be deemed equally scandalous?"
"A choice should not have to be made between the one and the other."
"An equally hard line should be taken in both cases."
"In the case of Cuba, I am completely astounded by the attitude displayed by a number of people."
"As I was saying to some friends yesterday, if a journalist from Reporters without Borders denounces the dictatorships in Burma, North Korea or Laos, there is no one to come and tell us that we are overstepping the mark, that what we are saying is bad or that the situation is more complicated than that."
"We only need, however, to say that there is a dictatorship in Cuba too, and we receive tons of insulting letters from people finding excuses for that dictatorship."
"I am not going to give my opinion in this House on whether or not it is necessary to keep the US embargo."
"That is not my problem."
"My problem is the fact that there are 300 prisoners of conscience in Cuba, whose only crime is to have called for democracy and to have challenged Mr Castro’s authority."
"That is all!"
"It is unacceptable that they should be treated in that way, regardless of the political positions one upholds."
"I am astounded to see people here who are ready to take to the streets if their freedoms are interfered with in the slightest way, but who are also ready to applaud scoundrels from far off places just because they are ‘exotic’!"
"Another person I should like to mention, Mr President, is Mrs Florence Aubenas, because you have been exemplary in the way you have rallied people."
"You, in Parliament, have been extraordinary – and I am not one to mince my words, as you will see – you have been extraordinary where Florence Aubenas is concerned."
"I have come to this House several times to defend her."
"The French, Belgians, Italians and Germans – everybody joined forces."
"How unfair for the others, though."
"There are others like Florence Aubenas, but they do not belong to great Western media organisations and they do not come from the West."
"In their cases, it is a job and a half mobilising you, the press and even, at times, ourselves, as though double standards were being applied, as though some lives were worth more than others and as though there were some freedoms that affect us and others that do not."
"It is imperative that we put a stop to this way of thinking."
"One cannot be credible and one cannot say to people ‘we, in this House, are democrats who fight for democracy’ if we fight a thousand times harder for such democracy when our own people are involved than when others are involved."
"Doing so strips us of any credibility, including where our position on human rights is concerned."
"I wanted to say this to you because I see this happening every day."
"I also wanted to tell you to stop feeling guilty about the developing world, to stop thinking that you are defending Western values in this House and to stop chastising yourselves all the time and trying to find excuses for people who have none at all."
"The democratic values that you defend in this House are universal values; they carry the same weight whether in this House, in Cuba or in Nigeria."
"Let us stop thinking that we have this kind of inexorable duty to remember, with these anniversaries and never-ending commemorations."
"We have had just about enough of all that; let us focus on the present."
"I do not have a guilty conscience with regard to what took place in the past."
"I have a guilty conscience with regard to what is happening today and to what I am not doing."
"I should like, if I may, to address another point in relation to our own intolerance."
"It is so easy to defend the ideas of people who think like us."
"It is so easy to fight for people who are like us."
"That is not democracy, however."
"Democracy means fighting for the freedom of expression of others, including those who will pose a threat to our democracies in the future."
"This is the paradox and the problem faced by you and me."
"As I often tell friends – I can see Dany opposite me – at Reporters without Borders we sometimes go to countries in which we defend people, and I say to myself that these people are scoundrels."
"I say to myself that on the day when that character comes to power, my God, I will return in a hurry."
"At the same time, I say to myself that my place is here."
"The difference between those who merely talk about democracy and those who live it – and you live it in this House – is being able to say what I have just said and to defend people on the grounds that they do not benefit from a certain number of legal rules, even though those people will pose a threat to us in the future."
"This paradox is our weakness at the same time as our strength."
"I should like to make two or three further small points."
"No, not all the attacks on the freedom of the press are the same."
"Let us stop making remarks such as: ‘Hang on, I do not know how things were done in the past, but the arrest of a conscientious objector in Switzerland (when conscientious objection existed) and the 30 years of gulags in the USSR are the same thing’."
"No, they are not the same thing."
"We have to fight in these two different cases."
"Let us stop making others think, or ending up making them think, that we do not live in democracies."
"We do in fact live in democracies."
"Democracies exist."
"Half the countries in the world are not democratic in their dealings."
"To equate the problem of media concentration in our own countries with that of the arrest of journalists in China or Burma is terrible for the people who are imprisoned in China."
"It is a despicable thing to do to them."
"I can say what I like in this House, and that includes expressing my opinions about you."
"Such freedom of expression is impossible in half the countries in the world, so let us stop blurring the distinctions."
"Yes, there are things that do not work in our countries."
"Yes, there are things that do not work in the field of information."
"Yes, we need to reflect."
"Yes, like you, I am scandalised from time to time by the attitudes of my colleagues and by what I do as a journalist."
"We must be careful, though, not to say that it all boils down to the same thing and not to confuse countries in which, generally speaking, attacks on the freedom of the press are the exception with countries in which they are the rule."
"It is not the same thing, for heaven’s sake!"
"We are not asking you to agree with everything we say."
"I do not believe that you are in a position to do so."
"We, for our part, are irresponsible to a certain extent because the only thing we defend is freedom of expression."
"As for you, you are required to take into account other things, such as the economic interests of your countries and of Europe and diplomatic and military interests."
"I hope – indeed, I am sure – that you are aware of this."
"That is why I am not calling on you to say that the policy of Europe and of this Parliament is guided only by human rights."
"That is happily not the case."
"I call on you, when you say something to us and when you make a commitment, to abide by it and to abide by your own words, which is something that you do not always do."
"A short while ago, Mr President, you were speaking to us about Tunisia."
"Yet, for heaven’s sake, an association agreement exists with Tunisia!"
"You will tell me that what we are concerned with here is not Parliament but the European institutions as a whole."
"What is delaying this association agreement from being implemented?"
"Clauses exist; you make sure they are voted in favour of."
"You are the ones losing face in cases like these."
"In this case, it is not human rights that are being talked about."
"When they are, however, being talked about, it is a question of abiding by one’s word and one’s commitments."
"We need you, you know."
"You are magnificent – I said the same thing to you yesterday, Mr President – when you vote in favour of reports and resolutions."
"Do not think for a moment that it is pointless to do so."
"We rely on your doing so."
"It is useful for people, so continue to do it, but follow it through to the end."
"Speak the truth."
"That is the only thing we ask of you."
"We have had enough of people waxing lyrical."
"We have heard enough quivering voices."
"We want to hear people telling us: ‘There you are, I can do that."
"I cannot do any more than that, but that at least is something you can count on us to do."
"I wanted to make yet another final point."
"I, along with others, believed that it was possible radically to change the world."
"I am now less certain about that, as are others."
"Knowing that the world cannot be radically changed can be reassuring, you are right, but in other respects it can also cause anguish."
"At the same time, we cannot be content with the world as it is, Mr President."
"Each time I open the newspaper, the world makes me sick."
"I have a small daughter aged four who is going to grow up and who will have a thousand times more opportunities than a young girl of the same age in 90 countries that I can list for you in this House."
"This injustice is unacceptable."
"Do you know what is good about human rights?"
"The fact that it works."
"I am not saving my soul."
"I believe in neither the dear Lord nor the devil."
"In simple terms, I believe that we can get up and do something and improve, day after day, the lives of each and every individual."
"To do that, we need you."
"Mr President, it is an irony of fate that, immediately after having voted through the ‘directive on monitoring’, Parliament awards the Sakharov Prize for transparency and human rights."
"On the same day that we are building walls to restrict our fellow citizens’ freedom, we give prizes to those who break down these walls in the surrounding world."
"According to the spin doctors, this directive should give us freedom from murder, terrorism and organised crime but, in reality, it frees us from the democratic ideal more than from anything else."
"The good thing about democracy is being able to communicate with whomever one wishes whenever one wishes, without feeling anxious about such communications."
"The advocates of the directive maintain that the relevant monitoring is necessary for combating the most serious crimes, but they are wrong."
"The directive would apply in practice to all the crimes listed in the European arrest warrant, that is to say it could be used to pursue those who share files illicitly too."
"That is why the big media companies are now rejoicing at this new directive."
"It will allow them to retain their old technology, and they will not need to change over to more modern technology that would enable consumers to save money."
"According to the directive, data is to be retained for between 6 and 24 months. In fact, 80% of all e-mails are what are called spam."
"This is a junk directive that leads to the retention of junk mail, a practice that is scarcely the most effective way of combating organised crime."
"It costs money and diverts resources away from more effective measures."
"It is also easy for professional criminals to avoid getting caught in the net."
"In the United States, the police quick-freeze data."
"It is much simpler and more efficient and only affects those specifically suspected of committing a crime."
"Where were you on 17 March?"
"Whom did you meet?"
"Whom did you sit beside?"
"Did you sit beside a known criminal?"
"How can you prove that you had no contact?"
"How do you know that those whom you regularly e-mail are not hunted by the police as sharers of illicit files on a large scale?"
"How do you prove that it was not material protected by copyright that you sent?"
"Are you aware of the dark sides of those with whom you communicate?"
"States governed by law will continue to exist and, more often than not, people will only be convicted when guilty, but perhaps the burden of suspicion will only be lifted from them following abusive interrogations and house searches."
"The Greens voted against this directive."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am voting against the data retention directive, primarily because it is intrusive and technically unworkable."
"The only threat to security is the threat to people’s right to privacy."
"This directive does not actually target suspects, those under investigation or known offenders, but pokes its nose into everyone’s affairs indiscriminately."
"The aim of this directive is to institutionalise horrendous discrimination against the vast majority of citizens, honest and peace-loving people, whom we should instead be protecting from this kind of abuse."
"We cannot consent to having a controlled system of constant, unjustified spying in Europe, and one which is, moreover, pointless and expensive. We cannot institutionalise the failure to uphold the right to privacy."
"For these reasons I have voted ‘No’."
"I could not vote in favour of this report because I believe that the European Union simply cannot condone the collection of personal data on every citizen."
"Besides monitoring general samples of people, databases can be used to search for persons holding views that are politically or otherwise undesirable."
"Every totalitarian regime in history has begun by amassing personal data on all of its citizens."
"I myself grew up under a forty-year-long totalitarian regime where the Communists in power collected my personal data and information about my phone calls."
"Existing data transfer technology is still not secure enough and, therefore, potentially beneficial uses, such as the fight against terrorism, crime and money laundering, can easily be subverted."
"I could never explain to the public why I might vote for such a proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am well aware of the importance of the directive on data retention that has just been adopted."
"From the point of view of security, I believe that adopting it is an essential step in the fight against terrorism and other serious crimes."
"As one of the signatories to Amendment 41, however, I cannot consent to individual Member States offering different reimbursement to operators for any costs they have incurred as a result of retaining data, since this would violate the rules of the free market."
"I voted today in favour of the amendment by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to reject the proposed directive on data retention. I believe that the proposal is too far-reaching when it comes to personal privacy."
"It is also ineffective. It will not help combat terrorism, and it has also been driven through with frightening speed and in a way that does not bode well for the future."
"I therefore also voted against the proposal in the final vote."
". I welcome the proposed agreement between Parliament and Council."
"It achieves the right balance between allowing police and judicial authorities access to the data on electronic communications, and the protection of privacy."
"Its approval by both a majority in the elected Parliament and by a qualified majority of governments in the Council is proof of its acceptability to a wide range of opinions."
"It reasonably allows police and judicial authorities to access, under certain conditions when investigating serious crimes, data on past electronic communications: that is, who has called who, not the content of the conversations."
"I am nonetheless shocked at the tactic of some of those who oppose it."
"I have received letters, emails and representations from people who fear that governments will be able to listen to their telephone conversations and read their emails!"
"Why do they think that?"
"Because they have been told this by people who should know better, including some in this chamber who are willing to deliberately mislead the public in pursuit of their political goals."
"In principle, the June List believes that a decision with such far-reaching implications for people should not be taken on the basis of a qualified majority."
"Instead, the procedure should be directly subject to the national parliaments, and decisions should be taken at intergovernmental level with the unanimous agreement of the Council and following cooperation with the police and the criminal justice system."
"We also believe that the proposal goes much too far in view of its expected benefits."
"The Member States should make it easier to exchange information among themselves in order more efficiently to combat terrorism and organised crime."
"Such cooperation does not, however, require harmonisation at EU level for the purpose of retaining the huge quantity of information involved."
"The proposal also gives rise to considerable misgivings concerning the way in which citizens’ freedoms and rights are observed in a situation in which people in general are under suspicion."
"The June List does not wish to help create a society in Europe in which people are under surveillance."
"If a Member State wishes to introduce the compulsory retention of data, it should only do so following a proper national debate with a decision taken in its national parliament."
"To sneak in such sweeping legislation through the back door is extremely incongruous from a democratic point of view."
". We regret the fact that the majority in Parliament rejected the proposal to reject this directive on the retention of electronic communications data, a proposal that had our backing."
"It should be noted that a similar proposal was previously rejected by Parliament and did not receive the unanimous decision in the Council that it would have needed in order to be adopted."
"The proposal for a directive before us, presented by the Commission on the initiative of the United Kingdom, took just three months to be adopted by the majority of MEPs and by a qualified majority in the Council."
"The British Presidency has stated that it wants to see this directive enter into force at the earliest opportunity."
"We find this yet another unacceptable proposal, as it forms part of the current onslaught of securitarianism, whereby the citizens’ rights, freedoms and guarantees have come under attack, on the pretext of the so-called ‘fight against terrorism’."
"The intention is to ‘legalise’ something that is illegal."
"The directive seeks to broaden its current scope of gathering and storing data (telephone communication, email, Internet, and so forth) for up to two years, subject to extension, to include other aspects such as ‘preventing’ infringement."
"A flexibility clause has been brought in, which will give the green light to the almost indiscriminate gathering of electronic information."
"Hence our vote against."
". I voted against the proposal on Data Retention."
"The European Parliament has been used to by-pass national parliaments which have rejected similar proposals."
"Our Parliament has forfeited certain rights by the process we have adopted on this Directive."
"I hope this behaviour will act as a warning and not a precedent when we handle future dossiers in this field under co-decision: the reward we were offered by Council for being a ""politically mature"" institution, capable of agreeing with Council."
"We have today, set up the framework for a surveillance state."
"It is not clear to me that this will make us more secure and safe from crime."
"This Directive no longer has crime prevention as a goal."
"We are therefore using an intelligence-led approach which relies on public confidence and support to be effective."
"Mass surveillance threatens that confidence."
"We have alternatives to such surveillance and should have adopted them."
". This directive does nothing to guarantee either proportionality or the accommodation of considerations both of security and the citizen’s fundamental freedoms, both of which are of great importance to me."
"The storage of data, in particular, is regarded as a vital tool for the authorities in investigating and combating terrorism, although the law already provides for access – subject to a court order – to those data stored by telephone service providers for billing purposes."
"Moreover, it has proved impossible to come to any agreement about, or determine what should be done about, the costs incurred in consequence of retention, so that it is far from certain what effects will result in future for industry and the consumer."
"While I, too, take the view that telecommunications data are of immense importance in solving crimes and in combating international terrorism, the fact is that we already, in this area, possess considerable scope for action, without – in contrast to the proposed directive – interfering with the fundamental rights of every individual."
"Good laws are not enacted under pressure of time and with a faulty basis for decision-making."
"I am very critical of the way in which the process relating to the proposal for a decision on the retention of electronic communication services data has been handled."
"This is a difficult issue on which to adopt a position. Reflection is required, together with a solid factual basis in relation to the privacy aspect, the technical consequences and the actual costs for telecommunications operators and thus consumers."
"This is an approach we owe Europeans."
"It is undoubtedly the case that electronic communication data can be of value in various criminal investigations."
"That does not, however, mean that we should give the green light to extensive data retention."
"It must be possible to use electronic communication data, but only in connection with very serious and well-defined crimes and following court decisions."
"A harmonisation of EU provisions is desirable, but it should be much more restrictive than is indicated by the current decision."
"The proposal for amending the directive, adopted in Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, was a step in the right direction."
"In the vote, this proposal was, however, rejected in favour of proposals that are too far-reaching."
"I therefore chose to vote against the proposal for a directive."
"I should have liked to have seen a decision involving shorter retention periods and better protection of privacy. E-mails would have been exempted, and the use of electronic communication data would only have been permitted in the case of certain serious and well-defined crimes."
". The data storage directive that was pushed through under the British Presidency was not exactly eagerly anticipated in Europe."
"In a bid to fight terrorism and crime, citizens’ and companies’ telephone and Internet data will soon be stored for years."
"This is a downright breach of privacy and creates considerable legal uncertainty."
"The questions as to who has access to this data and who uses it have not been properly dealt with."
"Telecom companies may well use the data for commercial purposes."
"Moreover, there are no guarantees that the compulsory data storage will help trace terrorists and criminals."
"While the directive applies throughout Europe, it is left to the Member States to define what is meant by ‘serious crime’, and it is unclear who will shoulder the cost of the gigantic databases required."
"Not only is the directive superfluous, but it has also been piloted through the Council and Parliament far too quickly, with the rapporteur simply sidelined in the process, and the Council of Ministers throwing overboard all the guarantees that were built in by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"This is another example of how badly our democratic institutions are equipped to cope with this sort of demagogy, which governments use to play on the fears that are current among the public."
"Under the pretext of responding to terrorism, Fortress Europe is becoming more and more of a police state."
". I do not know why this proposal was rushed, the 'extremely accelerated legislation procedure has meant that there was little time for discussion and translations were sometimes unavailable."
"There was also no time for a technology assessment or for a study on the impact on the internal market."
"Bearing in mind the measures and plans aimed at better regulation at European level, it is to be hoped that the procedure used for debating data retention will not become the rule', to quote directly from the report to Parliament."
"-There is a framework decision on this issue still with the Council of Ministers."
"-There is doubt that the correct legal basis was used for this proposal."
". No longer must fear of terrorism be misused for the purpose of the progressive nullification of fundamental rights and freedoms in the interests of a totalitarian surveillance state."
"Ever since the attacks on 11 September, there has been evidence of a growing tendency to take action not only against those in the exposure business – in other words, journalists – but also against those elements that do not conform, or who incur the authorities’ displeasure."
"The latest example of how the freedoms of journalists are restricted and abrogated is what is known as the ‘Cicero affair’, as criminal acts are again and again used as pretexts for the introduction of new police powers, and, in Germany, even the access to toll payment data is under discussion."
"Even in the best-case scenario, though, it is only the little fish that are caught, for criminal organisations and terrorist networks are usually well able to evade prosecution."
"Since terrorists’ attacks are often planned many years in advance, these simply cannot be prevented by the storage of data."
"Instead, the consequence of it is the permanent subsidising of network hardware, unjustified interference in people’s private lives and the hampering of people in possession of confidential data – doctors, journalists, lawyers and so on – in the practice of their professions."
"Even if there are as yet no credible estimates of the effects and costs that will result from the planned directive, it is not acceptable under any circumstances that the public should be left defenceless in the face of such a massive curtailment of their fundamental rights."
"If we are not soon to end up with something like a Chinese-style Internet, they must at least be protected against any possible abuses by stringent and deterrent sanctions."
". Following the vote on the Alvaro Report, I believe that Labour MEPs were successful in getting stronger safeguards concerning the security of communication data and in specifying penal and administrative sanctions for abusive use of retained data."
"In representing London, the city with one of the highest numbers of Internet service providers in the EU, safeguards are important."
". I voted for the LIBE committee's position, but against the overall resolution."
"Hurried law is usually bad law."
"This has been rushed through by the UK presidency of the Council."
"It is tragic that two large MEP groups have passed this in a single reading rather than have a thorough scrutiny."
"It has many defects."
"The definition of ""serious crimes"" is uncertain, being left to 25 separate governments to each decide in their own way."
"The question of costs is unclear."
"The demanders, the governments, should pay, not the individual citizen."
"The inclusion of emails was badly thought through."
"The industry was never formally consulted."
"Hotmail and Yahoo emails are excluded."
"In the 2004 Madrid bombings, no emails were sent by terrorists ; instead one wrote a draft on Yahoo, and his accomplices logged on and read it."
"So much ""Spam"" email is sent."
"Why do the governments want to preserve spam ?"
"The text gives too much latitude to the 25 governments to do what they wish."
"It allows them to decide the details themselves, and cannot be amended by national parliaments."
"This is an unsatisfactory law."
"I am proud to have opposed it in its present form."
". Before we enter into any discussion on the report, I wish to say that we should welcome the fact that this issue has given rise to such a wide-ranging discussion."
"To my mind, it is a sign that Europe is prepared and alive to the potential risks to individual freedoms of an excessively securitarian approach."
"In the report that we adopted, I did not detect any drift towards securitarianism, or any abandonment of the fundamental principles of ensuring and protecting the citizens’ rights, freedoms and guarantees."
"The report shows that we recognise the need to increase the resources available for combating crime, especially given the serious nature of certain types of crime, with terrorism of course at the top of that list, and given the use of new technology in these criminal activities."
"There is a concern, which came to light in the debate and in the adopted document, which I feel should be highlighted."
"The increased powers provided for in this report will only work if their use is monitored more closely, and Parliament must not take its eye off the ball with regard to this directive."
"What we adopted today was for the purpose of protecting the citizens from criminals and must not be used for any other motive."
". Nobody would deny that any measures which would help in the fight against terrorism should be investigated, but data retention as proposed will just not achieve the desired aim."
"Worse than that, I fear it will infringe liberty, and add unnecessary costs to business and consumers without actually making any of our citizens safer."
"This is a flawed proposal and the Parliament has done us a disservice today by adopting it."
". After carefully examining my conscience, I have voted in favour of the report,"
"- in the hope that the authorities will use the data only in accordance with our stipulations,"
"- in the knowledge that the concept of a ‘court order’ is not to be found in all Member States,"
"- in the knowledge that this House has largely removed the teeth from what was put before it by the Council and the Commission, and"
"- out of the conviction that civil rights will be adequately protected by Parliament."
"After two years, I shall be demanding to see statistics on the authorities’ access to data."
". – I voted against the proposal for a directive on the retention of data because, despite the improvements to the initial proposal by the British Presidency following the efforts made by Members of Parliament, I still believe that these measures alone will prove to be ineffective in practice and will, furthermore, crack individual freedoms wide open, with painful consequences."
"I am guided always by the memorable phrase by the US President Benjamin Franklin, who said in 1759: 'They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither'"
"Good laws are not enacted under pressure of time and with a faulty basis for decision-making."
"I am very critical of the way in which the process relating to the proposal for a decision on the retention of electronic communication services data has been handled."
"This is a difficult issue on which to adopt a position. Reflection is required, together with a solid factual basis."
"This is an approach we politicians owe Europeans."
"It is undoubtedly the case that information about telephone conversations can be of value in various criminal investigations."
"That does not, however, mean that we should give the green light to the extensive and systematic retention of both telephone conversations and e-mails."
"It must be possible to use electronic telecommunication data, but only in connection with very serious and well-defined crimes and following court decisions."
"A harmonisation of EU provisions is desirable, but it should be much more restrictive than is indicated by the current decision."
"Moreover, telecommunications operators will in all likelihood have to be compensated for their additional costs."
"The proposal for amending the directive, adopted in Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, was a step in the right direction."
"In the vote, this proposal was, however, rejected in favour of a proposal identical to that negotiated by the governments. I therefore chose to vote against the proposal for a directive."
"I should have liked to have seen a decision involving shorter retention periods."
"E-mails would have been exempted, and the use of electronic communication data would only have been permitted in the case of certain serious and well-defined crimes."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the presumed use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners."
". Mr President, over the last few weeks we have heard and read a lot about the alleged use of European airspace, airports and countries by the United States in its global war on terror, so I welcome this afternoon’s debate."
"It allows this Parliament to discuss one of the fundamental issues facing European governments and institutions in the 21st century: the balance to be struck between security and liberty in a world characterised in part by mass-casualty terrorism."
"I hope the debate will help illuminate the key issues involved, including how to tackle the unprecedented threat we all face from international terrorism, how to ensure respect for the international rule of law at the same time, and how every day Member States have to take hard decisions to maintain the balance between security and liberty and take responsibility for those decisions."
"I hope too that the debate can demonstrate respect for the word of other governments, the benefits of informed discussion and a sense of proportion."
"In so doing, Parliament will be able to make a valuable and credible contribution to the larger debate about how to safeguard our security and liberty simultaneously."
"As honourable Members of this Parliament will know, allegations have been made in the European and international media and elsewhere concerning US detention facilities in Europe and the use of aircraft to transfer terrorist suspects between countries in order to interrogate them using torture and ill-treatment."
"These reports prompted discussion amongst European Union Foreign Ministers at the General Affairs Council meeting on 21 November."
"As a result, the Presidency wrote on 29 November to the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, on behalf of European Union partners, seeking the views of the United States Government on these allegations."
"On 5 December the United States Secretary of State made a detailed public statement on the matter in advance of her visit to Europe."
"The Presidency has forwarded that reply to European Union colleagues and I have today provided a copy of the reply to President Borrell Fontelles."
"Some European Union colleagues were able to discuss this matter with Secretary of State Rice last week in Brussels."
"The United Kingdom has expressed its satisfaction with the US statement."
"I understand some other European Union colleagues have also made public comments upon the statement by Secretary of State Rice."
"The Council welcomes the detailed statement by the US Secretary of State, for all European countries share the determination of the United States to protect innocent citizens from the threat of terrorism, while operating within international law."
"Let us be clear about the threat our people face from the modern terrorist."
"Europe has faced terrorism for many years."
"I do not need to relate the names of the organisations and individuals concerned, but none of us have had to face the kind of threat we face – now and in the long term – from al-Qa’ida and its supporters."
"Modern terrorism means mass-casualty attacks."
"We have seen them in New York, Washington, Istanbul, Madrid, and recently in London and in numerous other cities around the world."
"Honourable Members will recall that, just a few years ago, Strasbourg was also the target of a thwarted attack."
"Today we are exposed to fanatical suicide attacks on innocent civilians using modern techniques and technology previously confined to states but now available to individuals on the internet."
"That is a picture we face for the foreseeable future."
"Our people need protecting against it; our governments have a clear responsibility to provide that protection."
"It is a responsibility that requires governments to make difficult decisions, take concrete action and explain and defend those decisions and that action."
"The European security strategy adopted in 2003 emphasised that transnational terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction pose a threat we cannot ignore."
"However, at the same time, in seeking responses to these new challenges, it is essential that the rule of law and the human rights of individuals are respected."
"The question of torture is a key element of this debate."
"Torture is abhorrent."
"The prohibition against it is absolute."
"The British Government – like all European governments – unreservedly condemns it."
"We never use it; we never instigate or condone it; we condemn it utterly, and we work hard with others to eradicate it."
"Secretary of State Rice’s statement of 5 December makes clear that the policy of the United States Government is to comply with the UN Convention against Torture, that the United States Government complies with its Constitution, its laws and its Treaty obligations."
"She goes on to say that acts of physical or mental torture are expressly prohibited, that the United States Government does not authorise or condone torture of detainees and that torture and conspiracy to commit torture are crimes under US law wherever they may occur in the world."
"The Council welcomes this statement."
"It is right that the word of another sovereign government – expressed so clearly on such an important issue – is respected within a larger discussion on the balance between security and liberty."
"As Secretary of State Rice herself said on 5 September, that debate in and among democracies is natural and healthy."
"That must be right and this Parliament can and has made a contribution to that debate."
"I understand that, in the light of the allegations, the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe has requested from the Member States of that international organisation an explanation of how they ensure the effective implementation of the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"I am sure that Member States will want to cooperate with the Council of Europe."
"Informed exchanges on issues like this are important, including for the benefit of our people who look to their governments and institutions for a lead."
"I look forward to hearing your views and those of Commissioner Frattini on this important subject."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the European Commission considers it our moral, institutional and political duty to ensure that the fundamental rights of every person are always respected and upheld without exceptions or derogations of any kind."
"Torture and inhumane treatment are a negation of the values on which the European Union has been based ever since its inception, and on which it is still based."
"Secondly, I should like to reassert the crucial, strategic importance of the joint action and close cooperation between the European Union and the United States in the fight against terrorism."
"All European democratic nations, the United States and our other international partners must together defend their common values against this century’s greatest threat: international terrorism."
"As Minister Alexander has just said, I welcome the formal statement by the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, that the United States does not tolerate torture, whether on US territory or anywhere else in the world, but considers it a crime."
"As you will realise, that is a binding statement, committing the United States to a certain kind of conduct."
"It is also proof of the great US democracy that a public debate has been started there in Congress, in the Senate and in the country’s free press."
"That is also something for us to reflect upon and to watch, since Europe too is taking part in the international debate on this major issue."
"Thirdly, it is important to ascertain the truth behind accusations deriving from press sources, because if the accusations were shown to be true they could have grave political consequences, since they would constitute a serious breach of the Treaty."
"‘Ascertain’, ladies and gentlemen, means finding evidence: according to the rule of law, no accusation can be considered proven if there is no evidence, and until evidence is found I personally have a duty to respect the word, and thus also the denial, that I have been given by all the governments I have consulted so far – and I repeat so far."
"That does not rule out our common desire for the truth but, as I said to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs the evening before last, I clearly cannot cast doubt on the credibility of the legitimate and democratic governments of European Union countries and candidate countries without good evidence to the contrary."
"In addition, I cannot consider that there are any individual European countries ‘on trial’, and I say that in inverted commas, particularly to our friends in Poland and Romania."
"We have a duty to ascertain whether abuse and torture have been committed throughout Europe."
"One country or another cannot be singled out as the object of investigation, as the accused, or as being on trial."
"If torture or inhumane treatment has been carried out, we have a duty to ascertain that fact throughout the territory of the European Union."
"Some European countries, as you know, have started investigations at a national level."
"That has been done by the government in some cases, as in Portugal and Poland for instance, or by the judicial authorities in Member States such as mine, Italy, as well as in Spain, Germany and other countries."
"These judicial authorities are conducting investigations using the powers of the courts."
"We are, of course, awaiting the conclusions of these judicial inquiries with all due respect and without being able to influence them in any way."
"Yesterday I met the Secretary General of the Council of Europe."
"I met him yesterday evening and reaffirmed the Commission’s support – and my personal backing – for the investigation he has begun, under Article 52 of the European Convention on Human Rights, into all 46 Council of Europe member states."
"I also assured Mr Davis of the Commission’s staunch support for the second inquiry set up in parallel by the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly."
"Dick Marty, its rapporteur, deserves public acknowledgement for the work he is carrying out."
"As you will probably already know, the Secretary General will conclude his investigation on 21 February 2006 and Dr Marty will present an initial report on his inquiry to the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly by the end of January 2006."
"Through our Commissioners Mr Barrot and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, I have asked for the Eurocontrol data on flight plans over European territory and all possible relevant data collected by the European Union Satellite Centre to be made available to the Council of Europe for its investigation."
"At the moment there is no evidence to confirm the accusations, but we must continue to work in close collaboration with the Council of Europe and with this Parliament to seek out the truth, and that is what I shall do."
"It is not for me to decide what kind of working instrument Parliament will choose for this joint operation;"
"I shall confine myself to saying that an investigation needs powers to enquire, question, investigate and inspect, and it is of course up to you to decide whether there is provision for such powers or not, as Parliament’s legal service would seem to indicate."
"In any case, seeking the truth, in my view, means not just ascertaining if there has been any abuse and then drawing the right conclusions, but also clearing the air of negative preconceptions and suspicions that might otherwise undermine our necessary international action in the fight against terrorism."
"In conclusion, then, if there is any suspicion or evidence that abuse and torture have been committed in Europe, we shall certainly be in a weaker position in the face of terrorists and antidemocratic terrorist propaganda."
"That is why we have to find out the truth; that is why we have to do so as loyal friends and allies of the United States, while jealously safeguarding our shared values at all times."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with two prefatory remarks."
"The first is that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats regards itself as a partner and friend of the United States of America."
"Far from this debate, or any other on this subject, being a fit and proper occasion for anti-American sentiments, what we have to do is consider the facts in the light of our principles."
"Secondly, the fight against terrorism is one of the greatest challenges of present times."
"To the terrorists, who want to spread fear and fright, to intimidate, we respond by refusing to be intimidated, and by waging war on terrorism with all the forcefulness and determination we can muster."
"There can be no compromises with terrorists, any more than there can be compromises when human dignity, human rights and the upholding of the law are at stake."
"Our system of values, the values in which we share, must not take second place to legal and political opportunism."
"The principles that underpin our democratic system of values must never be abandoned, for it is they that distinguish us from terrorists."
"If we were to adopt the terrorists’ methods by trampling the law underfoot, they would be the winners."
"The fight against terrorism must be fought by legal means and in accordance with the principles of human dignity and human rights."
"What that means is that, if a person is suspected of terrorism, the proof that he or she is one can be obtained only by him or her being subject to the due process of law."
"Kidnapping, abduction, unlawful detention and torture are things we must never permit."
"No state on earth – neither the European Parliament nor the European Union, neither the Member States of the European Union nor those of the Council of Europe – can permit such things."
"Let me quote what was said in a major German newspaper yesterday by the rapporteur for the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Swiss parliamentarian Dick Marty; he said that the information available to him thus far reinforces the impression that members of the public are unlawfully transported to European countries and held there for periods of time."
"Mr Marty’s very words are that ‘It has to be noted that the charges have never formally been contested by the United States.’"
"Much as we welcome the US Secretary of State’s statement that the USA would not tolerate torture, that is not proof that people have not been abducted, and that is why we demand information and transparency."
"We see it as crucial that the truth be put before us."
"I might add that this is the line we have always taken."
"We have always taken a critical view of Guantanamo, and did so even before the US Supreme Court handed down its ruling."
"I can speak for this House when I say that we can take pride in our defence of human rights, in Guantanamo as elsewhere, and in the fact that the Supreme Court can be said to have come to the same conclusion."
"What is now needed is for what really happened to be brought to light and it has to be said that, whatever our criticisms of secret services, we do need them, and that includes the American one, the CIA, for we know that they, and the CIA, are of assistance to us."
"In a situation like the present one, in which a German woman has been abducted in Iraq, we need the secret services’ back-up, but let me say, most definitely and most firmly, that secret services, too, must be founded upon the law."
"Human dignity and human rights are worth more to us than anything else; we must speak out wherever they are violated, and where it is unclear whether they have been, we must set investigations in motion."
"That is why our group advocates close cooperation with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and also, if need be, the setting-up of a Temporary Committee to help defend human rights and human dignity."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Mr Poettering that we need to inform without prejudging the issues."
"The essential issue is whether institutions of the European Union or of its Member States were involved – whether actively or passively – in setting up prisons outside the law and in the use in them of methods of interrogation that have to be described as torture."
"Both prisons operating outside the law and the use of torture for the purposes of interrogation would constitute breaches of the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, of the Council of Europe’s Human Rights Convention and of the Convention against Torture ratified by all Member States of the European Union and by all candidates for accession to it."
"I do wholeheartedly agree with Commissioner Frattini, though, that it is not the task of the European Parliament to investigate any one Member State or candidate country; what matters instead is that we get a picture of how things stand in Europe as a whole."
"The best place in which to do that is this House."
"If, though, we set this inquiry in motion, we cannot do so in isolation from the experience of the past."
"Mr Poettering is right to say that we need secret services, but, more than ever, they need to use modern methods of investigation."
"The infiltration of organisations whose actions are intended to undermine and destroy our system of values, who do not shy away from the destruction of things of value or of life itself, is indispensable – that much is common knowledge; that it takes more than road traffic police to combat such organisations is also common knowledge."
"That the secret services’ is not transparent is also common knowledge – God knows that it is not."
"That, after all, is why they are called secret services, and their need occasionally to work in secrecy is also common knowledge."
"It is also common knowledge, though, that the United States of America and its current administration are not always that fussy about international law!"
"My view is that the decision to wage war in Iraq was taken without reference to international law."
"The decision to wage this war was a disaster, and the war itself is one."
"It follows, of course, that one cannot have a great deal of confidence in the secret services of a country whose government’s actions are not quite open and legal, or which at any rate gives that impression."
"It is, of course, possible to do things that foster trust; one of them is to get the actual facts out on view for all to see, to say who flew where, when and for what reasons, to state in what manner he was taken prisoner, on what legal basis, what circumstances led to his being arrested, where he was taken, and how he was questioned."
"If these answers show that everything was legal and above board, then fine, but if – and we hope that this will not prove to be the case – it appears from them that we have no option but to conclude that institutions of the European Union or of its Member States played a part, whether actively or passively, in the unlawful arrest of persons or the operation of prisons outside the law, and in torture, then sanctions must be the inevitable consequence."
"Let us, then, have no pre-emptive judgments; let us, instead, simply list the questions to which we expect clear answers."
"I can tell Mr Poettering that it is not a matter of ‘if need be’, but this very day, in the Conference of Presidents, we will be asking for a temporary committee to examine this matter."
"I take it as read that the Group of the European People’s Party and all the other groups will support that."
". Mr President, the investigator for the Council of Europe, Dick Marty, has called allegations of illegal extraordinary renditions credible."
"If he concludes that they are true, the question for us is what is the degree of complicity of EU governments?"
"They are all rattling off the denials, but this has not satisfied those who have expressed concern or deterred calls for parliamentary or judicial inquiries in a string of European countries."
"No wonder the US is irritated by European governments’ attempts to evade responsibility and I am glad that the President-in-Office talked about taking that responsibility."
"Secretary of State Rice pointedly said last week that the US has respected the sovereignty of other countries."
"That means: ‘don’t rock the boat, guys – we are all in this together’."
"A feasible scenario is that, in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, understandably keen to offer help to the US in tracking down the perpetrators of that abominable crime, European governments offered intelligence help and facilities to their US ally."
"However, as the years have gone by, they have got deeper into the mire of illegality."
"Only by cleaning house and starting afresh on the basis of real respect for the rule of law can we convince our citizens that we are not sacrificing our principles."
"The problem is that we are living in an Alice in Wonderland world."
"The President-in-Office said that Secretary of State Rice’s statements last week should be taken at face value."
"However, if the US does not tolerate torture inside or outside the United States, why is it resisting the McCain amendment?"
"Why have we had so many twists and turns by the Bush administration, redefining torture so that it does not cover waterboarding, prolonged shackling or induced hypothermia?"
"Secretary of State Rice’s statement begged more questions than it answered."
"I welcome Mr Frattini’s statement that we have a duty to investigate."
"I also welcome his offer of assistance to the Council of Europe."
"This Parliament must avoid duplicating Dick Marty’s investigation."
"However, we need a mechanism to draw all the threads together and that means a temporary committee."
"Then we can assess, in the light of Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, what evidence is produced."
"I also welcome Mr Frattini’s statement that finding out the truth will strengthen our fight against terrorism by upholding our values."
"I agree with Mr Poettering – that does not happen often – that this is not an anti-American project."
"Helping save America and Europe from the disastrous policies of the Bush administration is a pro-American exercise."
"You wicked girl!"
". Mr President, Mr Alexander says he believes in the benefits of an informed discussion, but the problem is that we do not have much information to draw on."
"You are wholly satisfied with the answers given by Mrs Condoleezza Rice and perhaps you may want to share with us why she managed to win you over so convincingly."
"I can understand that you do not want a diplomatic dustup, but what is now your strategy in order to find out the truth?"
"That is something I should like to know."
"The United States claims that it does not tolerate torture, but, as somebody has just asked, can bringing people almost to the point of drowning really not be termed torture?"
"Mrs Ludford has mentioned the McCain amendment in this connection."
"Surely we should not be palmed off with any sort of American word play?"
"No, indeed not."
"Terror suspects are sometimes not released for months, and often claim that they have been very badly treated."
"It may, of course, be the case that they were misinformed, but, be that as it may, that is not even the point."
"The point is that whether they have been tortured or not, it is illegal to detain people without a judicial trial."
"That is, of course, what is happening in Guantanamo Bay, but it would be too crazy for words if people were to be detained without trial in Europe as well."
"If that is the case, if people are locked up, or transported illegally, on European soil without any judicial trial, then the EU’s very core values are at stake and the question arises of what we intend to do about it."
"It is our duty to mount an inquiry into those cases."
"Although Commissioner Frattini explained to us the detail of the legal procedures, we will find this out in due course."
"If Europe’s core values are on the line, we must respond."
"We can at any rate set up a temporary committee, along the lines of the one that worked so well in the case of Echelon."
"We can always consider at a later stage whether we want to change this into a parliamentary inquiry committee."
"Some Members are already collecting signatures for this, but we have seen in the Echelon committee that even a temporary committee of this kind triggers a dynamic quest for the truth, with a public debate that gives people the boldness to speak out, so that public opinion gets noticed and politicians are forced to go further than simply affirm that they have every confidence, just to please some US Minister."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to inform Minister Alexander that today we are not talking about the fight against terrorism, but about hundreds of flights throughout Europe, about kidnappings and torture carried out by the CIA against European citizens or refugees, and about torture practised in prisons on European soil."
"All of this has already emerged from certain elements of the Council of Europe investigation. Commissioner Frattini quite rightly calls on us to look into these events more thoroughly because we have to be able to prove them."
"There is an emblematic case which itself contains all these elements and which demonstrates that evidence does exist for all these events."
"It is the case of Abu Omar, who was kidnapped by CIA agents right in the centre of Milan, transferred to an American base in Italy and tortured for 12 hours; he was then transferred to Egypt, where he was detained and tortured for more than a year."
"He was finally released and warned not to talk about the abuse and violence he had suffered."
"He disobeyed the order and 22 days later he disappeared and has not been heard of since."
"All that is proven by the clues left behind by the CIA agents who kidnapped him: intercepted mobile telephone calls, calls home, calls to CIA headquarters, hotel credit card payments and even details left on the computer with the route taken by the car."
"In my view, all these points need to be looked into; there are 22 arrest warrants out for CIA agents, and we are still waiting for the Italian Government to issue the extradition requests."
"Clearly, therefore, the Italian authorities knew about the Abu Omar case, and it is also clear that a great many European governments know about these events."
"Indeed, the agreement signed between the United States and the European Union in Athens in January 2003 states that the use of transit sites for the transfer of foreign criminals needs to be stepped up."
"I believe that we have to find out the truth; we have to find out about the torture and detentions; we have to find out about the flights and transfers."
"A committee of inquiry needs to be set up to shed light on all these points."
"We have a duty to find out, and that will be for the good of Europe, because it cannot preach human rights and yet tolerate violations and abuse."
". Mr President, if it is true that the Americans detain and torture terror suspects on European soil, then this is a grave blow to mutual trust."
"I do not, however, like the keenness of some people here for serious measures."
"The United States of America is still the EU Member States’ biggest ally, and nothing has been proven as yet."
"The Bush administration does leave something to be desired, though, when it comes to the transparency of the detention system; prisoners can be detained for years without the court intervening, and it is also unclear in what ways they are interrogated."
"I would therefore call on the United States to respect the rule of law."
"Senator McCain was right to table an amendment in order to define the rules of interrogation more precisely."
"It would become President Bush if he did not oppose this by using his veto against it."
"The fight against terror is tough, but the law, as we in the European Union and the United States know it, must be upheld."
"Together with the US, the EU must find a way in which mutual trust can be strengthened."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the extremely serious matter raised by certain newspapers, and if what for now remains mere supposition or fantasy is actually confirmed, then I too consider that Parliament has a duty to play its part in shedding light on the matter and ensuring that there is complete transparency in the relations between the European Union and all non-EU countries."
"I believe, however, that it would have been more useful right now to spend our time debating more concrete facts."
"I do not want to go too far back in time, but I should like somebody to stand up and tell me whether in those days the United States trampled on the sovereignty of European Member States when it sacrificed thousands and thousands of its men to save Europe."
"It is always you on the left who remind me of such things."
"Well, then, are the people of the United States our friends or not?"
"They cannot be our friends when it suits us and not our friends when it does not suit us."
"I still do not understand how even people who have important roles in the institutions and who ought to hold objective views and avoid making destabilising allegations can possibly utter such damning statements when there is actually no evidence for the events and, , when the very countries involved deny any illegality."
"Nobody, of course, wants to deny Parliament’s crucial role in guaranteeing and monitoring respect for human rights and protection of the freedoms of individuals and peoples."
"Even so, nobody is authorised to hold court and to pass judgment based on suppositions and suspicions, just on the basis of some newspaper articles."
"Nonetheless, I declare myself in favour of setting up a working party to look into the matter more thoroughly, making use of the information supplied by the Council of Europe. According to the European Convention on Human Rights, the Council of Europe is the only institution charged with investigating possible human rights violations in the Member States."
"I would not want this whole attitude – this aversion to a country that is Europe’s friend – to be just the product of a perverse feeling, which is noticeable in the speeches of certain Members of this Parliament, although certainly not in my political group."
"To conclude, I sense that a veiled but widespread feeling of ideological anti-Americanism reigns in this Parliament, and especially in certain of its constituent committees."
"Certain groups seem to be permeated by a visceral, deep-seated anti-American, anti-Western feeling, which clearly reveals old Soviet friendships that have never dimmed."
"I see we have some Americans in the Chamber!"
"Mr President, Commissioner Frattini’s reaction to the reports that the CIA is secretly transporting and interrogating terror suspects in Europe was prompt, dynamic and forceful."
"If the European Union were to respond with the same measure of energy, force and speed against terrorism itself as it does to the alleged CIA flights, we would certainly be on the right track."
"It is, of course, true that the fight against terrorism must be waged within the bounds set by the law, but the European Union has a credibility problem."
"We are always prepared to observe a minute’s silence for the victims of terrorist attacks such as those in Madrid and London, and even those of 11 September in New York and Washington, but, when it comes to taking measures and taking action which must help prevent such terrorist attacks in future, we fail to deliver, being primarily interested in safeguarding the rights of the terror suspects."
"It follows that this European Parliament’s selective indignation is misplaced."
"If the European Union were able to point to just one specific success in the fight against terrorism, the series of imputations against the United States might yet be acceptable, but it cannot."
"Maybe we ought to stop teaching other people lessons in morality, now that it is, for example, apparent that the Council, further to the Palestinian parliamentary elections, will be establishing official contacts with organisations such as Hamas, and Hezbollah, the former of which – let it be noted – is on the EU list of terrorist organisations!"
"This hypocrisy should stop as a matter of urgency and the legal framework in which the fight against terrorism must be carried out must be tailored to today’s needs."
"Mr President, the protection of fundamental freedoms and human rights and compliance with international commitments and conventions are among the primary concerns of the members of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"They are supremely important values, which allow all the citizens of the EU’s democratic Member States to live and work in safety and harmony."
"I therefore agree that while we must fight terrorism effectively, in so doing protecting the lives of citizens, this fight must be conducted in accordance with the international conventions that are binding upon us."
"We must also ensure that the right to dignity of all human beings is respected, even in the case of terrorists."
"On 11 September 2001, terrorists declared war on our civilisation and its underpinning Judaeo-Christian values."
"America took up the challenge by limiting the reach of terrorist organisations’ deadly schemes."
"We should not forget that the fight against terrorist fanatics is not merely a brief episode, but something that will continue for decades."
"Following the attacks in Madrid and London, Europe joined in the fight by actively proposing courses of action that would be effective in the fight against terrorism, but that would also ensure respect for fundamental rights and human freedoms."
"By this I also mean the rights and freedoms of terrorists."
"In view of the above, torture should not have been used and must not be used in any EU Member State."
"We will therefore vote in favour of the appointment of a temporary committee to investigate issues surrounding the alleged transport, detention and even torture of prisoners in EU Member States."
"At the same time, however, it is crucial that the work of this committee should not heighten anti-American sentiments in Europe, and that its conclusions and findings should not be taken as read."
"I hope that the work carried out by the committee will allow us to strike a much-needed balance between two values that are of enormous significance for every European citizen."
"I refer to the protection of the right to life and of life itself, by means of effective measures that ensure our safety, and the protection of fundamental human rights."
"These latter include both the right to legal representation for those suspected of crimes such as terrorism and the right to a fair trial."
"Mr President, today, in this House, we have adopted a piece of legislation that is of vital importance to the war on terrorism."
"Thanks to good cooperation with the British presidency of the Council and with our colleagues on the Committee, particularly with our coordinator Mrs Roure, the overwhelming majority of Social Democrats have endorsed this act as an important weapon in the fight against terrorism, while being no less determined in our opposition to torture of any kind."
"I am amazed that Mr Alexander, Commissioner Frattini and the future President of the Council, Chancellor Schüssel, are prepared, on the basis of no more than a few statements by Mrs Rice, to believe that the Americans are not practising torture, for that is something of which I would like to see concrete evidence."
"All of you, after all, have heard of Guantanamo, and of Senator McCain, who is no kind of lunatic, but is behind a specific and well-founded campaign against torture, particularly that engaged in by the United States of America."
"That is why it is important that we in this House should get to the bottom of what has been going on and, without prejudice or prior judgment, but also without averting or shutting our eyes to the facts, should examine whether such things – ranging from abduction to torture – have been engaged in on European soil."
"What we want is the truth and nothing but the truth; that is what we need this committee for."
"The last thing I have to say has to do with our relationship with the USA, and this is where I agree with Mrs Kudrycka, who spoke before me."
"In campaigning against torture, we are campaigning for that America that is as opposed to torture as we are, which I believe to be the majority, represented in any case by those like Senator McCain."
"This is our common cause – Europe and the USA against not only terrorism, but also torture!"
"Mr President, it is up to the political groups to decide to get to the bottom of these allegations at a time when everyone is feeling very uneasy."
"The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs will take the information provided by the political groups into consideration as far as possible."
"I personally am convinced that we need to re-examine four main points."
"Firstly, we need to look into the issue of extraordinary rendition."
"Have the United States engaged in this practice in respect of people suspected of terrorism?"
"Can it be regarded as legal, if by any chance it has taken place on the territory of the European Union?"
"In these circumstances, we need to bear in mind Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, Articles 2, 3, 6 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, particularly with regard to legal guarantees, and also the provisions of the agreements between the United States and the European Union on legal cooperation in criminal matters and on extradition, and the bilateral agreements in that respect."
"We must, when examining this issue, take account of the problems raised by illegal abductions and the treatment of prisoners."
"Secondly, has this practice occurred on EU territory since 1 January 2002?"
"Have flights been organised to transport people suspected of terrorist acts?"
"Where were they detained?"
"What was their status?"
"To help it find answers to all these questions, the Committee on Civil Liberties has, under Annex 6 of the Rules of Procedure setting out its powers and responsibilities, a legal basis for triggering the warning system if there is a risk of violation of fundamental rights; it can therefore set to work if the political groups give it the opportunity and work in agreement with the Council of Europe or, in any event, cooperate with the temporary committee that will be set up."
"Nevertheless, I would ask you not to wait."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was in response to the terrible images from Abu Ghraib, if not before, that a debate was unleashed in the USA too as to what was or was not permissible in legitimate war on terrorism."
"I would like, on behalf of my group, to reiterate what has been said by the others."
"We welcome the efforts made by Senator McCain and others like him in the US Congress towards the outlawing of torture."
"Torture is an un-American activity; at the same time, though, it has no place in Europe either, and so it is legitimate to ask why a country such as Switzerland, on seven occasions, refused to allow military aircraft to overfly its territory, evidently suspecting that they were carrying prisoners illegally."
"What is it about these other countries?"
"What information have they had from their secret service?"
"Why is it that, so far, only the Danish Foreign Ministry has acted consistently in stating that actions contrary to international conventions will not be permitted in Danish airspace?"
"What are all the other European countries doing?"
"We serve as a role model for other countries around the world in which there is no democracy and in which human rights are under threat."
"We have to be an example to them, and at all times!"
"Mr President, yesterday, the Council of Europe’s investigator Dick Marty stated that the suspicion had been confirmed that the CIA had, on many occasions, used European states’ airspace and territory to transport prisoners to interrogation at secret locations."
"This reinforces my conviction that our Parliament must, without delay, appoint a committee to investigate all such accusations."
"The very gravest of charges, relating to the abduction and torture of human beings, have been laid against the United States and Member States of the European Union; that much is in the public domain. As the Commissioner has called for evidence, I will ask him whether the case of Khaled El Masri, a German citizen, does not itself speak volumes."
"Neither the US administration nor the European governments concerned have, to date, come up with an appropriate response."
"For the sake of the public at large, for the sake of the EU’s credibility as an international advocate for respect for human rights, it is vital that these things be cleared up once and for all."
"There must be no no-go areas in the European Union!"
"As representatives of the citizens of the European Union, we are under an obligation to shed light where there is darkness."
"The fact is that what is at stake here is nothing more or less than the defence of the most fundamental values upon which the European Union rests."
"The prohibition of torture is among those minimum human rights standards that every state must observe most stringently; it is part of binding international law, and it is one of the core values of the European Union."
"If the government of a Member State gave active assistance to, or even merely abetted, the USA’s abduction of people, as part of the so-called war on terror, in order that they might be tortured in secret locations, then that government has abandoned the fundamental consensus on which the European Union rests and on which membership of it depends, and that is what must be examined in minute detail."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago in Ceuta and Melilla, some members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs were personally able to verify the gentle methods used by the , to which the current Spanish Government has entrusted the sensitive task of turning back illegal immigrants."
"The MEPs were also able to admire the brilliant invention of the double fence system in which the illegal immigrants are then dealt with, as we have heard."
"The truth is that this did not generate all the scandal that everyone has been talking about these days, which was due to some news items that appeared in the press. I believe that these allegations should first be verified by a committee."
"Condoleezza Rice maintains that European governments should also accept responsibility and that the United States acted with the more or less explicit consent of the governments in question."
"European policy should, in turn, abandon the hypocrisy of the idea held by everyone that terrorism must be fought above all by using intelligence."
"Before anything else, let us also ask ourselves why we have tolerated the violation or abuse of the right to asylum by many people who have then abused that right to set up terrorist training and support centres here in Europe, in our cities."
"Mr President, I support the cooperation which the European Union and the United States have undertaken for the fight against terrorism."
"Terrorism is a huge threat to all of us and to all of our citizens and it is something that has to be fought in the years ahead."
"I am pro-American, but that does not mean that I am not going to question the US Government for the presumed use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation, illegal detention and/or torture of prisoners."
"We should all recall that this story emanated in the United States, where there is deep unease about what may be happening."
"We should also recall that America, like all EU countries, has signed up to international conventions protecting human rights and against torture."
"The provisions of these conventions must be honoured and we cannot arbitrarily throw them out of the window when it does not suit us."
"The European Union is at the forefront in protecting and upholding the human rights of all its citizens."
"It would be wrong for us in Europe to ignore what is happening."
"I would go as far as to say that it is a derogation of our public duty to not ask questions about this serious issue."
"Serious clarifications must be given by the US Government to the issues that have been raised."
"We have a right to ask questions and demand answers from the US authorities."
"I am tired of people saying that when you question America, somehow you are not one of its friends."
"This is not the truth."
"As friends, we should be allowed to ask questions."
"I quote one of the most famous Americans, Thomas Jefferson, when he said, ‘I have never considered a difference of opinion in politics, in religion, in philosophy, as a cause for withdrawing from a friendship’."
"Because we are debating this issue today, certainly, as far as I am concerned, I have no intention of withdrawing my friendship from the United States and I hope nobody else has."
"Serious human rights issues are at stake."
"That is the reality of the situation and it is an issue which, rightly, will not go away."
"We have a right to answers and the US Government should cooperate with all of us to ensure that clarification on the issues raised is secured and that human rights and human dignity are not swept under the carpet in this fight."
"It is absolutely essential that Europe sticks to what it believes in and we believe in human rights."
"At the same time, of course, we believe that terrorism should be fought in all ways."
"We cannot sweep under the carpet things that we believe and hold true to us, because in this fight, it is absolutely essential that Parliament stands up to this."
"Mr President, we say yes to a committee, but no to anti-American hysteria."
"That, in a nutshell, is our position on the appointment of a parliamentary body to investigate media reports of CIA prisons in Europe."
"This matter should be cleared up, but I would warn against using it as a convenient weapon in the fight against the nasty Americans."
"It is only right that we should stand up for human rights, but we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater."
"We should keep things in proportion, and make a distinction between regimes that base their very existence on brutal violations of human rights and countries in which human rights are only occasionally infringed."
"Commissioner Frattini is a very nice man, if perhaps a little overzealous, and I would very much like to believe him when he tells us that there have not been any prisons of this kind in Europe."
"I am afraid, however, that we should be listening to someone else’s words on the matter."
"I refer to the head of the CIA, who has not denied the reports of secret prisons on our continent."
"We are in favour of a committee being appointed, but we would not want such a committee to become a platform for anti-American rhetoric."
"One of the many reasons for this is that America has several faces."
"As I said yesterday, we must defend human rights and reject double standards."
"At the same time, however, universal values such as human rights must not be used as weapons in our political battles."
"We should bear this in mind when we appoint a committee."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, when it comes to protecting human rights, we have to be clear – either those rights have been violated or they have not."
"Torture is still torture whether it takes place in Iraq, Afghanistan, China or Pinochet’s Chile."
"If there have been cases of torture in a democratic country, with the tacit acceptance of an elected government, it does not stop being torture; it is an embarrassment to that country and its government."
"We must first condemn outright any act that may constitute a violation of human rights, whether that be humiliation, illegal imprisonment or the detention of prisoners without legal protection."
"I therefore commend Mr Frattini on taking such a clear stand."
"The EU, which created, and is in the process of strengthening, the area of freedom, security and justice, cannot allow such violations to be practised or facilitated on its territory."
"There has been mention in this debate of statements made by Condoleezza Rice, which left no room for doubt."
"The problem is that we are left with the uncomfortable impression that there are two strands of rhetoric on this issue; it is as though within the Bush Administration there were the Rice strand and the Cheney strand."
"The New York Times reported last week that there was substantial evidence of torture by US interrogators, and NGOs, such as Human Rights Watch, the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights First, which have reported serious and alarming incidents."
"The United States is not helped by the continuing Guantanamo situation, by Donald Rumsfeld’s refusal to authorise a UN humanitarian mission, by the doubts expressed in a recent interview by Head of CIA, Peter Goss, as to whether degrading treatment can be considered torture, or by President Bush’s threat to block the McCain amendment, which would ban the cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of detainees."
"I must congratulate the United Kingdom on the law lords’ recent decision that information obtained under torture cannot be used as evidence in court."
"In the Europe of values and freedoms, we want to know the facts, and, if something inappropriate has taken place, we want to make sure that it does not happen again."
"In democratic Europe we do not convict people on the basis of assumptions, without any evidence."
"The EU must therefore make every effort to cooperate with the Council of Europe and with the ongoing investigation."
"This is the best way of ensuring that the truth will emerge and that our values will prevail."
"Mr President, the Council of Europe’s investigation into the existence of secret American detention centres in Europe has made no progress in five weeks."
"According to the Swiss Parliamentary rapporteur Dick Marty, all the information they have gathered tends to reinforce the credibility of the allegations, but he has been unable to get precise answers to his questions."
"It is therefore our duty, as the representatives of the European citizens, to demand that an investigation be conducted to find out the precise details, on a case-by-case basis, of circumstances that may give rise to offences and to violations of human rights."
"If the information we are hearing is true, that means that serious crimes have been committed on EU territory."
"With regard to torture, let us not beat about the bush."
"The CIA admits that it uses sleep deprivation, exposure to cold and suffocation; if that is not torture, what is it?"
"If these centres are admitted to exist, we will call for severe penalties for those responsible."
"If, on the other hand, the rumours turn out to be unfounded, we must remove the doubts for the sake of our credibility."
"All of our Member States are concerned and we must bear that in mind."
"The EU, by way of its Charter of Fundamental Rights, can – as we all say so often – be a model."
"Therefore, we cannot tolerate any attacks on human rights on EU territory."
"Mr President, I would like to start by saying that it is very important for a temporary committee to be set up, not only to confirm that the European Union is greatly concerned by respect for human rights, but also to find out the whole truth of this matter."
"I am pleased to have heard Mr Alexander and Mr Frattini give the European Union’s point of view, but I must also say that I was surprised to hear Commissioner Frattini, and the representatives of the European Commission, faithfully repeat the rumours that two Eastern European countries, Poland and Romania, housed detention centres run by the US secret services."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that, to my knowledge, Poland has had no detention camps, American or otherwise, where prisoners are illegally detained since 1989."
"If they were to exist, I would want that fact to come out."
"On the other hand, if they do not exist, I would like the opprobrium piled on my country without any evidence, by rumours, to be lifted at some point in the future."
"I want the temporary committee to set to work in order to find out the whole truth in this matter, and I confidently await the day when it will tell that truth for my fellow Members to hear."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this issue is a very important and fundamental one."
"It must, of course, be said at the outset that, whatever criticisms we may have to make, the fight against terrorism is of immense importance and that Europe and America must cooperate closely in waging it."
"I do not believe, however, that it can be won unless it is fought on the basis of the rule of law and of human rights."
"It is now for us to determine whether these conditions have been complied with or disregarded, and the relevant evidence needs to be forthcoming as a matter of urgency."
"If the West as a whole is not to risk losing its credibility, it is vital that any misdemeanours that have occurred are brought to light without delay and that salami tactics are dispensed with, or else we will be lumbered for months on end with the same sort of credibility problem that we had after Secretary of State Powell’s presentation to the United Nations on the Iraq war, and in other instances too."
"It has to be clear to us that what is at stake is the credibility of the West as a whole, and it is in the interests of that that we must act promptly, together, and in a responsible manner, or else we will lose our capacities for action."
"I think it is a good thing that – as Commissioner Frattini has made perfectly clear to the two committees that have dealt with this – the Council and the Commission are working with the Council of Europe, and at its specific request, to arrive at clarifications on which the temporary committee will be able to draw when, as I expect it will be, it is brought into being."
"Whatever problems we may have, we have to see that these are not lines dividing Europe from America, but that debates are going on in both of them and that we have an ally in the shape of the US Senate, which voted, by 98 votes, to endorse Senator McCain’s motion that torture cannot be an instrument in the fight against terrorism."
"That shows what the other great democracy on the other side of the Atlantic is capable of, and this gives us our starting point: what the democrats and the supporters of the rule of law, both in Europe and America, have in common, is not only the capacity to combat terrorism, but also the capacity to do so under credible conditions and while maintaining the rule of law."
"Mr President, we do of course take extremely seriously the case that we are discussing today, which has to do with possible abuses that touch the very heart of our democracy and our opinions on human rights."
"The statements we have received from the US so far are unsatisfactory. The story does not stand up to scrutiny."
"I do not want to enter into the detail of it, but the explanation by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, does, indeed, beg more questions, to which we want answers."
"Something to which reference has already been made in this Chamber, and which, to my mind, plays a significant role, is the fact that we are also concerned about the USA’s attitude to the fight against international terrorism."
"In Guantanamo Bay, the United States has, since early 2002, been detaining hundreds of people without any form of trial or independent control."
"In the fight against terrorism, American politicians regularly talk about the need to use unconventional methods."
"The US has been known to apply its own rules in this respect."
"Although the US administration assures us that it does not use torture and that all human rights are respected, it still adopts a hesitant attitude towards Senator McCain’s proposals to improve anti-torture legislation and to declare it fully applicable also outside of the US."
"The European Union has the duty to guarantee the letter and spirit of the treaties and guard our values."
"There is currently insufficient information available to assume that nothing is wrong, but the European Parliament also has its own responsibility."
"We have to consider the possible involvement of Member States and future EU Member States in the matters in hand, and, perhaps, the European Union’s relations with the United States."
"As a directly-elected institution, we in this House have a duty to find out whether there is any truth in the allegations."
"The first impressions gleaned by the Council of Europe’s rapporteur, Dick Marty, strengthen us in the belief that an inquiry of our own is certainly not a luxury."
"We should therefore, as a matter of urgency, launch our own inquiry, possibly in cooperation with the Council of Europe, so as to try to find real answers to the questions we are still left with, whereby a temporary committee should be set up as soon as possible, to be followed by a real inquiry committee if that turns out to be necessary."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the allegations with which we are dealing are extremely serious ones."
"If confirmed, they constitute a plain breach of the principles listed in Article 6 of the Treaty, namely freedom, democracy, protection of human rights and the fundamental freedoms and the rule of law."
"Since the latest change to the Treaty, Article 7 offers the possibility of acting against a Member State on account of serious violations of these principles."
"Such action may go as far as suspending certain of that Member State’s rights, including its right to vote."
"It is precisely for that reason that we need to act with the greatest caution."
"It would go too far to my mind if I were to commit to the mechanism of Article 7 being activated at this stage."
"Needless to say, I too am highly indignant about the CIA’s suspected actions and I am extremely concerned that Member States may have feigned ignorance of them, but a sanction mechanism cannot be activated simply on the basis of indignation."
"For the first time in history, Article 7 offers us the opportunity of penalising the misconduct of Member States."
"This mechanism can be activated only when sufficient and conclusive elements have been collected."
"I trust that this Parliament and its Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs will do this with great meticulousness."
"Mr President, it is self-evident that terrorism must be fought effectively, and that this fight must therefore be ruthless in certain respects."
"Intelligence activities, special units and, in many cases, operations on the fringes of the law play a key role in the fight against terrorism."
"At the same time, however, the war on terror is being waged in defence of fundamental liberal and democratic values."
"The foundations upon which these values are based include the , or in other words the right to personal inviolability, the ban on holding anyone in prison without a warrant and the ban on the use of force to extract testimonies during interrogations, which equates to an absolute ban on torture."
"The CIA-run centres operate outside the reach both of the Geneva Conventions and of the American justice system, civil and military alike."
"The same authorities carry out investigations, make arrests, detain people for months on end, stop at nothing when interrogating them and, in some cases, decide to release them."
"The level of control exercised over the activities of the intelligence services is one of the chief indicators of the quality of democracy in this new global era."
"A dangerous trend can be observed in Europe."
"I refer to the fact that the European Union is being treated like an economic club, the sole aim of which is to develop the common market."
"The European Union is not merely a club of this kind, however, but also a political community."
"Membership of this community requires the signature of the Treaty on European Union, which guarantees the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"I say these words exactly 24 years after martial law was imposed in my home country, Poland."
"One of the characteristic features of this period was the fact that those suspected of carrying out trade union activities would be held in detention centres for months on end without having been sentenced."
"I am speaking today on behalf of all the citizens of the European Union for whom human rights, political freedoms and civil liberties constitute the very reason for the existence of the Community."
"We have a right to know the truth."
"The European Union’s institutions must investigate this matter thoroughly, and ensure that the governments of the Member States abide by the Treaty on European Union within the territory of the EU."
"– Mr President, we know with certainty that: a) the USA have in the past engaged in the torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners, as in Abu Ghraib; b) the president of the USA has threatened to veto the amendment by the US Senate prohibiting torture of prisoners outside US borders; why did you not mention that also, Mr Alexander, instead of simply submissively welcoming the statement by Mrs Rice? and c) the US Congress, to its credit, frequently investigates accusations of this sort."
"We do not know with certainty: a) if the USA or European countries run or used to run secret detention centres and where; b) if the USA have removed European citizens or other people from European soil in order to transfer them, interrogate them and, possibly, torture them; c) if European governments or authorities have tolerated or participated in such illegal activities."
"The question, therefore, is what the European Parliament will do now."
"Will it also investigate this or will it wait for others to do so?"
"If we do not take direct action, then the elected representatives of our peoples will end up monitoring revelations in the international press and will react simply as commentators to the facts."
"I therefore support the immediate setting up of a parliamentary committee but, apart from the question of detention centres, I believe that you should turn your attention, Mr President, to a broader question which is at the root of all today's evils: the relationship between the fight against terrorism and the protection of citizens' fundamental rights."
"Unfortunately, this relationship – including after Mr Alexander's statement – tends thoughtlessly, ungracefully and even illegally to incline very dangerously towards the former and away from the latter."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unlike Minister Alexander, who is very young and very enthusiastic, this Parliament is not at all happy with the statements made by Condoleezza Rice – neither with what she said nor, above all, with what she chose not to say."
"There is no anti-American feeling in this; let us just say that the balance between security and liberty, between human rights and the fight against terrorism, has been tipped away from the side of human rights."
"This Parliament is no longer content with the solemn assurances made by the governments involved."
"History is full of lies told equally solemnly by those very same governments, and the Iraqi chemical weapons affair is a reminder of that."
"At the moment, says the Commission, there is no proof."
"We have to reach an agreement on what we mean by proof."
"Do we mean a public admission by a prime minister appearing on television and saying, ‘Yes, it is true: I have allowed secret prisons run by US secret service agents to operate in my country, and torture has been used in them’?"
"I think it would be difficult to expect that kind of proof."
"Mr President, we believe that the statements by Condoleezza Rice – who claims that many human lives in Europe have been saved because of preventive actions by the CIA – are more than an admission of guilt."
"I should also like to mention that we consider the need for proof sacrosanct only for governments, but sometimes forget about it in the case of citizens, who are quickly transformed from suspects into terrorists without the necessary legal guarantees."
"We have many good reasons to call for a committee of inquiry to be set up, not in order to make accusations but to seek the truth."
"We appreciate the firmness shown by Commissioner Frattini and endorse his support for the work done by the Council of Europe, but we cannot delegate our responsibility for political vigilance and our duty to ascertain the truth to any other institutional body: it is our job and our responsibility."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the Resistance and the Cold War, people died under torture in every one of our countries in order to protect the most precious thing we have: freedom."
"It was out of this sacrifice, too, that Europe emerged, founded on a specific idea: respect for the law as an inalienable prerequisite for freedom and democracy, with no ifs or buts."
"The choice is not between the life or death of one or more people, but between the civilisation of democracy and the barbarity of arbitrary power."
"Our continent has millennia of experience of torture and knows that not only is torture unreliable in the information it extorts, but above all it irremediably corrupts those same civilised values that it claims it has to protect."
"It is an insult to our freedom and intelligence, as well as vile blackmail, to claim that torture has helped to thwart even a single terrorist attack in Europe or elsewhere in the world."
"It is now our duty to discover the whole truth about the reports of the kidnapping and mistreatment of alleged terrorists by the CIA and their illegal transfer to other countries, with the complicity of certain European governments."
"The action by the Milan Public Prosecutor’s Office on the disappearance of the imam Abu Omar, for which 22 members of the CIA are under investigation, and the Council of Europe initiatives are tangible expressions of the rule of law."
"Those who have nothing to hide have nothing to fear."
"We must play our part by setting up a parliamentary committee; it does not matter whether it is an investigative, temporary or committee, but it must undertake to discover the truth."
"Our Parliament also calls for a different United States, one not subject to the fanaticism and economic interests of the George W. Bush Administration."
". Mr President, I judge this to have been a valuable debate and I am grateful to all honourable Members for the varied contributions we have heard this afternoon."
"As I made clear in my introductory remarks to this debate, the security and liberty of all our people are important issues, perhaps the most important issues that our governments presently face."
"I also said that it was right for democracies and their institutions to debate the questions that arise when defending both principles in our modern world, vital that we recognise the unprecedented threat from contemporary terrorism and the longevity of that threat, and crucial that we all respect the rule of law in the process."
"I said it was important to recognise the need for governments to take tangible steps to fulfil their principal responsibility – the security of their people, right to respect the word of other sovereign governments including our allies, and incumbent on European governments and institutions to lead by example and conduct informed debate."
"Overall I think we have achieved those objectives in the conversation and discussions we have had on the threat this afternoon."
"The images of the terrorist attacks – on commuter and underground trains in Madrid and London, places of worship, diplomatic premises, banks in Istanbul, hotels in Jordan, residential compounds in Saudi Arabia, and restaurants and bars in Bali – the list goes on – are not computer-generated."
"They are a reality with which we live. They are the new and frightening reality of our modern world."
"The contemporary terrorist is not content to limit himself or herself to conventional attacks."
"If he can, he will acquire and use chemical and biological means to reach his ends."
"On respect for the rule of law, I mentioned the question of torture – a central issue that featured in our debate – in my opening remarks."
"Let me reiterate the position of the United Kingdom Government."
"The prohibition against torture is absolute."
"The British Government, like all European governments, unreservedly condemns its use."
"We never use it for any purpose, including to obtain information."
"We never instigate, condone or otherwise support others using it."
"Indeed, we condemn it."
"We have worked hard with our international partners to eradicate an abhorrent practice."
"On government action to counter the threat within the rule of law, I am pleased that under the UK Presidency the European Union has agreed a new counter-terrorism strategy and thereby provided a clearer framework in which Member States can take forward their national and European work, striking a balance between citizens’ rights to life and to liberty."
"These are not just words."
"The recent extradition of a man from Italy to the United Kingdom to face charges connected with the terrorist attacks in London in July would not have taken place so quickly but for European arrest warrants."
"That is a practical example of European Union counter-terrorism and judicial cooperation."
"On respect for sovereign governments, I remind honourable Members of the words of the United States Secretary of State on 5 December 2005."
"She stated, and again I quote directly for completeness: ‘The United States has respected – and will continue to respect – the sovereignty of other countries."
"The United States does not transport, and has not transported, detainees from one country to another for the purpose of interrogation using torture."
"The United States does not use the airspace or the airports of any country for the purpose of transporting a detainee to a country where he or she will be tortured."
"The United States has not transported anyone, and will not transport anyone, to a country when we believe he will be tortured."
"Where appropriate, the United States seeks assurances that transferred persons will not be tortured’."
"Of course, a number of honourable Members have raised the issue of the response of European Union Member State governments to the allegations that have received wide publicity in recent months."
"Let me just for a moment digress from my responsibilities as the President-in-Office of the European Union and share with this Chamber the approach of the United Kingdom Government to dealing with these very serious allegations."
"We have researched the question of US rendition via the United Kingdom carefully and we have not identified any occasions since 11 September 2001 or earlier during the period in office of the Bush administration when we received a request from the United States for a rendition through United Kingdom territory or airspace, nor are we otherwise aware of such a case."
"On providing a lead to our constituents with informed discussion, it is right that the Council of Europe be allowed to conduct a factually based examination of how its members ensure the effective implementation of the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, which has featured prominently in this afternoon’s debate."
"This debate today has raised numerous points – many held with great conviction – for the Council of Europe to address in its coming inquiry."
"For its part, I can assure this Chamber that the United Kingdom will respond fully to the Council’s queries."
"I trust and hope that other Member States will do so as well."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this afternoon’s debate has revealed a widely held position in this Parliament, and it is one that I too fully endorse: there can be no compromises with terrorists, but there can be no compromises, either, on the protection of people’s fundamental rights."
"On the one hand, we have to clarify matters and discover the whole truth – a truth that we may or may not like, but the truth all the same."
"We have to find out the truth and, as Mr Schulz rightly said, avoid making hasty judgments."
"I should like in particular to reply to Mr Geremek, whose speech caught my attention."
"I said in my introduction, regarding your country, Poland, exactly what you are calling for, which is that I have respectfully noted the solemn denial by the Polish Government authorities and that I do not believe that individual European countries can be regarded as being on trial or under suspicion, but that the truth needs to be sought in respect of the whole territory of Europe: all the countries of Europe and all the candidate countries."
"I specifically ruled out any possibility of claiming that this search for the truth only concerns Poland and/or Romania."
"The truth needs to be ascertained everywhere."
"Part of the debate on Europe’s essential values concerns both the citizens’ right to security – and on this point I believe the European Parliament has already said on several occasions that international cooperation with the United States is indispensable if we want to win the fight against terrorism – and the duty of the European Union and of all democratic countries to respect the dignity of every individual."
"Today you have voted by a large majority for an important measure, a useful measure in the fight against terrorism, and one that achieves a balance between security and freedom."
"It sets a good example which, I believe, should be a benchmark for us all."
"It is an exemplary balance between the fight against terrorism and the protection of people’s fundamental rights."
"As Europeans we have worked alongside the United States against terrorism and we shall continue to do so. For instance, ladies and gentlemen, I regret to say that the extradition treaty specifically aimed at suspected terrorists, which was signed in 2003, has been ratified by the United States but not by the European Union Member States."
"You realise how important it would be to have a clear extradition treaty in force today, containing strict rules including, of course, a ban on inhumane treatment."
"This goes to show that unfortunately we Europeans also have to do things a little faster."
"Finally, I believe it is possible to interpret the action and efforts to seek the truth not as an action directed against the United States but, as someone said, as an action to seek the truth that will strengthen us all."
"We shall all be stronger, whatever the outcome, because the truth can, I repeat, either make us discover something or make us discover that this something did not happen."
"In any case, the truth would strengthen us because, in the US Constitution, the Treaty on European Union, the Nice Charter and the European Convention on Human Rights, in all of these documents – and I mentioned the US Constitution in first place – the principle of human rights is fundamental and absolute."
"I wonder, therefore, why we should not also work together in this area, to ensure that those solemn principles are put into practice."
"That will be my personal commitment."
"I have received six motions for resolutions(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 10.00."
". Mr President, it is only six weeks since this House last debated Bulgaria’s progress towards European Union accession."
"I have been back to Bulgaria since then, as indeed has the President of Parliament."
"We met the President and the Prime Minister of Bulgaria and many ministers."
"I visited a children’s home in an area that had been badly affected by floods and a factory that had benefited from EU funding."
"I had discussions with the Foreign Minister, the Interior Minister, the President of the Supreme Court and police chiefs, including those running the national organisation for combating organised crime."
"I also met the chairmen of key committees of the parliament and representatives of all political parties."
"None of them seemed to be under any illusion about the work that needs to be done, or indeed the urgency of addressing the areas that have been highlighted by the Commission and the Parliament as being still of serious concern."
"Many however, are increasingly alarmed that Bulgaria’s accession is being caught up in the wider controversy over the future extent of the EU and over the EU budget."
"Mr President, bearing in mind that I am otherwise speaking for my current political group in this debate, I hope you will excuse me if I make two personal comments on these matters."
"Firstly, many of us are disappointed that following the defeat of the Constitution, the opportunity has not been seized to have a wide ranging and open discussion about the nature and direction of the EU in order to take full account of the real wishes of our citizens and make it more relevant to the needs of the 21st century."
"Secondly, as Mr Barroso observed this morning, there is a structural problem in the budget."
"I am not sure that he and I would agree on what that problem is."
"To my mind, it is the fact that some 40% of the EU budget is spent on the common agricultural policy and it is also the fact that the United Kingdom, year on year for twenty years, has been paying double the amount in net terms into the EU budget, even with her abatement, in comparison with a country such as France that has a similar-sized economy."
"Let me revert now to my rapporteur’s role."
"The point is that accession countries such as Bulgaria should certainly not be disadvantaged because of those wider issues."
"The timing of accession should not be vulnerable to unrelated concerns about future enlargement."
"Let us remember that neither Bulgaria nor Romania form part of future enlargement rounds; they are part of the previous enlargement."
"Their accession is already secured."
"Indeed, their budgetary arrangements for the first two years after accession are also secure."
"I am sure the Commissioner will confirm this."
"Bulgaria’s financial provisions are fixed from 2007 to 2009 in the Accession Treaty, Title III, which was signed on 25 April this year."
"These determine the amounts Bulgaria will pay into the EU budget in various forms, as well as what she will receive in cohesion funding, nuclear decommissioning assistance, the transition facility, the Schengen facility, agriculture payments and other structural actions."
"So, leaving aside any negative attitudes to enlargement in general that have begun to develop in some countries, what are the substantive obstacles to be overcome by Bulgaria in the next few months?"
"Firstly, the Accession Treaty must be ratified by all Member States."
"So far, only seven have done so, Parliament urges the remaining 18 Member States to ratify as soon as possible."
"Secondly, there is the question of the precise timing of accession."
"Parliament supports the common objective of Bulgaria’s accession to the EU on 1 January 2007, provided that certain matters of serious concern are dealt with."
"Without this firm target, a major incentive to increased effort by the Bulgarian authorities is removed."
"They are making an increased effort."
"I can report that in the past month a further six major legislative acts have progressed through the Bulgarian National Assembly and I am advised that key constitutional changes that we have called for will be presented to the National Assembly this year."
"However, while legislative change is essential, I cannot re-emphasise too strongly the need for tangible and concrete outcomes."
"We must see the evidence of change, particularly in the vital areas of justice and policing and the fight against organised crime and corruption."
"It is this area, more than any other, that has been the focus of my report on behalf of Parliament."
"There are, of course, other areas of concern, including child welfare and the support for and integration of the Roma communities."
"I commend my report to Parliament."
"It had the widest possible support in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and I regret that the GUE/NGL Group has chosen to re-table amendments that were rejected by the committee."
"With the exception of my own Amendment 16, I do not recommend support for any other amendments."
"I urge the Bulgarian authorities to take very seriously the need to deliver on reform."
"The changes are, of course, beneficial in themselves, not just as a prerequisite for EU membership."
"I ask the Commission to ensure that Parliament remains fully involved on a timely basis in any consideration of the use of safeguard clauses."
"1 January 2007 is an achievable date for Bulgaria’s accession to the European Union."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by echoing Mr Van Orden’s comment on an extremely decisive point: the issue of funding."
"Even though I do not entirely agree with his way of thinking – which will not surprise him – I share his concern regarding the financial perspective, which will neither enable the enlargement of ten new Member States so far to succeed, nor allow us to prepare for the next enlargement under the proper conditions."
"Having said that, I would like to refer you to the spirit of my report, which is to prepare as well as possible for Romania’s accession in 2007, because I too think that both Romania and Bulgaria will be able to accede on 1 January 2007."
"The report I am presenting aims to be a useful and effective instrument for the coming months."
"The Commission’s report, which Mr Rehn presented on 25 October, was also exemplary in this regard."
"I would like to thank the Commission once again for its work and, at its roots, the report I am presenting to Parliament follows the same way of thinking as the Commission’s."
"I would like to reaffirm the European Parliament’s friendship towards Romania and our desire to work towards a common objective – to enable enlargement to 27 countries following the fall of Communism and the great liberation movement in Eastern Europe – but, in parallel with that, we must stress that we are serious in our requirements and that our criteria are firmly set."
"That is why Parliament must both be conscious of the progress made by Romania towards accession – which, I believe, has acted as a catalyst for many changes and reforms – and also show itself to be demanding and vigilant and monitor the practical implementation of these reforms."
"In addition, my report is conscious of the problems faced by Romania, particularly in the field of justice and home affairs regarding the transparency of the legal system, the fight against corruption, organised crime, border control, administrative capacity, recognition or protection of the Hungarian minority – to which I shall return – and also in the environmental sphere and in terms of the implementation of legislation."
"And we are aware that there is a whole series of requirements and subjects on which the Romanian Government needs to focus."
"I myself would add that we still have the option of turning to the safeguard clauses."
"The safeguard clause is not just a gadget."
"It is a specific and concrete provision and a guarantee of the seriousness of the accession process; even so, it must not be seen as a threat or a punishment, but as a mechanism intended to give Bulgaria and Romania the time they need to prepare for integration in the internal market and to ensure that accession takes place under the best possible conditions both for the existing Member States and for the new ones."
"That is the spirit of my report, a spirit, moreover, that closely mirrors that of Mr Van Orden’s report, and I think that, tomorrow, Parliament will be able to demonstrate its desire to take one more step towards accession on 1 January 2007."
"I would now like to say a few words on the amendments discussed and prepared in the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"There, too, we are very close to consensus and it is true that the report was also adopted by a large majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"However, I believe that three or four delicate issues remain that will have to be discussed tomorrow, and I would like to express my feelings in that regard; that is the role of the rapporteur."
"First of all, there is the issue of whether to link the cases of Romania and Bulgaria."
"Although they are, of course, linked in practice, they still need to be judged on their own merits."
"I myself cosigned an amendment tabled by Mr Lagendijk on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, adding to paragraph 3 a specific mention of the fight against corruption and of the transparency of the legal system, applicable both to Mr Van Orden’s report and to mine."
"A second very delicate and very important issue relates to adoption."
"It is the subject of an amendment by Baroness Nicholson, whose commitment to the law as adopted in Romania we all know."
"To my mind, we perhaps need to put more emphasis on the interests of the child and on the legal framework of the UN, in addition to Romanian law, in resolving contentious issues arising from the moratorium – and, as rapporteur, I am aware of a number of such issues."
"Several amendments have been proposed by Mr Wiersma and Mr Lagendijk."
"I hope that we will adopt one or other of these amendments or reach a compromise between them."
"Then there is the issue of minorities."
"In my report, I proposed the idea of self-governance."
"It was apparent from the discussions in the Committee on Foreign Affairs that many took the view that, while respect for minorities was vital, we should not be giving the Romanian Government orders regarding the method, the procedure or the practical form that this increased autonomy should take."
"We must avoid meddling and try not to provoke conflicts through clumsy phrasing."
"On this subject, too, a number of wordings have been proposed by Mr Wiersma, once again, or by Baroness Nicholson."
"Be it greater decentralisation or cultural autonomy, I hope that, here too, Parliament will be able to affirm the rights of minorities, particularly of the Hungarian minority, whilst remaining flexible."
"Finally, we reached a consensus last week that this report should avoid mentioning the rumours regarding the secret activities of the CIA."
"I still think that this progress report is not the place to express our very real concerns on this subject; it must deal with the accession and only with the accession."
"For my part, I would like to thank all those who have worked on these accessions for the support they have given to this report."
"I am delighted at how it has been improved by their judicious additions."
"I think that we can do even more during the vote tomorrow morning and I hope that we will take another step towards the accession of Romania on 1 January 2007."
". Mr President, I am glad to address the House again as regards the preparations of Bulgaria and Romania for accession to the Union."
"Much has happened in the past year."
"Negotiations were completed at the end of 2004, and Parliament gave its assent to the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, after which the accession treaty was signed in April."
"Currently, the treaty is being ratified in the Member States."
"Our focus, in the Commission and, I trust, in the other institutions, such as Parliament, is now firmly on encouraging and supporting Bulgaria and Romania to successfully complete all necessary preparations for accession."
"Neither country should spare any effort or time in completing the challenging work still to be done on the domestic front."
"I welcome the active part played by the European Parliament and its Committee on Foreign Affairs and the reports prepared by Mr Moscovici and Mr Van Orden, which highlight the strong and weak points relating to the progress of both countries to date."
"As you have seen from the Commission’s comprehensive monitoring reports, which I presented to you on 25 October, our assessment is broadly the same: both Bulgaria and Romania meet the political criteria."
"At the same time, they need to make further efforts, in particular to strengthen the rule of law, to improve public administration and the justice system, to fight corruption and to protect vulnerable groups effectively."
"Structural economic reforms need to be continued in both countries for them to meet the economic criteria for membership fully."
"As regards the EU , both Bulgaria and Romania have continued to make progress in adopting and implementing EU legislation."
"They have reached a considerable degree of alignment 13 months before their envisaged accession on 1 January 2007."
"Nevertheless, in some areas there are still serious shortcomings in preparations and, in general, more attention needs to be paid to effective implementation and enforcement of the legislation."
"So, it is far from plain sailing for the moment."
"Bulgaria and Romania still have a lot more to do and it is important that we, together – Parliament, the Member States and the Commission – keep reminding both countries to stay focused on the significant internal work still to be done."
"On 7 November, I sent a letter to both Foreign Ministers Kalfin and Ungureanu, in which I urged Bulgaria and Romania to take immediate and decisive action to address the gaps and shortcomings in their preparations."
"As regards the remaining issues in Bulgaria and Romania’s preparations, the Commission will continue both to monitor and support them intensively up to accession."
"I welcome Parliament’s help and efforts in this regard."
"Our next rendezvous on this topic will be to discuss a report focusing on the actions taken by Bulgaria and Romania to address the main remaining shortcomings that were identified in October’s comprehensive monitoring report."
"The Commission intends to present this report to Parliament and to the Council in May 2006."
"At that moment, the Commission may recommend that the Council postpone accession until 1 January 2008, if there is a serious risk of either country being manifestly unprepared to meet the requirements of membership by January 2007 in a number of important areas."
"As President Barroso promised earlier this year, and in the spirit of our discussions in April to create an extended assent procedure, the Commission will use its regular dialogue with the European Parliament and will listen to Parliament’s views on the possible use of the postponement clause."
"The Commission would seriously consider these views before issuing any recommendation to associate fully the European Parliament in any possible decision to postpone accession."
"I am ready to meet the Foreign Affairs Committee in the course of the spring, for instance in April, to exchange views on the situation then in Bulgaria and Romania."
"Let me conclude by thanking the European Parliament for its constructive and balanced approach towards Bulgaria and Romania’s accession to the European Union."
"This has again been illustrated in the very sound, solid reports from Mr Moscovici and Mr Van Orden."
"The Commission always welcomes the strong commitment of Parliament in the accession process and its close follow-up of developments in Bulgaria and Romania."
"I trust that together we will complete the fifth enlargement round and make a success of it."
". Mr President, let me begin by paying generous tribute to the work of both Mr Van Orden and Mr Moscovici for their work on these dossiers as rapporteurs and also by saying what a particular pleasure it is to follow Commissioner Rehn, who has been a dedicated and effective advocate of taking forward the work both for Bulgaria and Romania’s accession."
"I warmly welcome this debate today, which is held at an important juncture in Bulgaria and Romania’s accession processes."
"From previous exchanges with honourable Members, I know that this Parliament maintains a close and detailed interest in both countries’ European Union preparations and wider enlargement issues."
"I look forward to a stimulating and thought-provoking discussion this afternoon."
"The December 2004 European Council concluded that both Bulgaria and Romania will be able to assume all the obligations of membership from January 2007, provided they both continue with efforts to implement the necessary reforms and commitments undertaken in the ."
"The June 2005 European Council reiterated these conclusions and welcomed the signing of Bulgaria and Romania’s accession Treaty in Luxembourg on 25 April."
"As the Council noted, this marked a further important step towards accession, and it was a step firmly supported by this Parliament when it voted to approve the signing of the Treaty."
"It is not difficult to see why the European Parliament and the Council have supported Romania and Bulgaria’s European Union aspirations."
"The prospect of EU membership has acted as a major lever for reform already."
"Since they started on the path to EU membership, both Bulgaria and Romania have implemented far-reaching political and economic changes."
"Living conditions and economic opportunities have improved."
"In the space of only 16 years, two dictatorships have been supplanted, I am glad to say, with democracies."
"These are substantial achievements by any measure and we should credit those who have worked so hard to bring them forward."
"The stage is now set for full membership, something that will bring us much closer to healing the artificial division of Europe after the Second World War."
"It will contribute to a more stable, secure and stronger Union."
"Neither Bulgaria nor Romania’s accession processes are yet complete."
"Indeed, as Commissioner Rehn has emphasised and emphasised previously in July, it is crucial to the success of enlargement that any new country joining the Union is well prepared to cope with the obligations of membership."
"As the Commissioner made very clear in his public statement in October, the jury is still out on when Bulgaria and Romania will join."
"It is in all of our interests that Bulgaria and Romania are ready to join the European Union on 1 January 2007, as has already been suggested in the course of our debate."
"This goal is achievable as long as both countries step up the pace of reform in the short period of time left between now and that critical date."
"The comprehensive monitoring reports identify clear areas where both countries must now focus their efforts."
"The report on Bulgaria shows that it meets the political criteria for membership, but further work is still needed to address remaining shortcomings. These include taking decisive action to reform the justice system and substantially stepping up the fight against organised crime and corruption, including at a high level."
"Pursuing reforms of the public administration system should also be a priority."
"In the area of human rights and the protection of minorities, more efforts are needed to prevent the trafficking in human beings, a subject on which this Parliament has repeatedly made clear its views, as well as to improve child welfare and the situation of the mentally disabled and to further the integration of the Roma minority generally."
"The Commission also assesses that Bulgaria should be in a position to comply with the economic criteria of accession, provided it continues on its current reform path and deals with the current account deficit."
"To this end, it should seek to maintain a prudent fiscal policy, improve the business environment and pursue accelerated labour market reforms."
"On the adoption and implementation of the , the report notes that Bulgaria has made further progress in particular on competition rules and culture and audiovisual policy."
"However, developments in a number of other areas have been frankly insufficient."
"Generally, Bulgaria needs to step up its efforts to complete preparations and to develop a sufficient administrative and judicial capacity to implement and enforce our Union’s legal order in full."
"I mentioned some particularly pressing implementation gaps earlier, such as the need to tackle corruption and organised crime effectively."
"Other concerns relate to the implementation of the European Union’s external border requirements and procedures, police cooperation and the effective enforcement of intellectual property rights in order to fight piracy and the broader issue of counterfeiting."
"The weak enforcement of rules on motor vehicle insurance also remains an issue of serious concern, as are shortcomings in the areas of agriculture, animal welfare, veterinary public health and food safety."
"Turning to Romania, the Commission assesses that she meets the conditions for membership, but further work is still needed to address remaining shortcomings."
"Romania needs to take decisive action to reform the justice system and substantially step up the fight against corruption, including at a high level."
"It should also pursue reforms of the public administration system and further efforts are needed to improve the situation of the disabled and mentally ill, a topic which I know is close to this Parliament’s heart."
"I would agree with the Commission’s assessment that Romania should be in a position to comply with economic criteria by accession, provided it continues and intensifies its efforts, in particular by paying attention to its external balance, public sector wage policy and the government’s revenue base."
"Romania has made further progress in adapting and implementing the , in particular on areas concerning the free movement of persons, telecommunications and consumer protection."
"However, shortcomings remain in other areas."
"Generally, as with Bulgaria, Romania needs to step up its efforts to complete preparations and to develop a sufficient administrative and judicial capacity to implement and enforce the European Union’s legal order in full."
"It too needs to tackle corruption, including high-level corruption."
"As with Bulgaria, Romania must address concerns over the implementation of the European Union’s external border requirements and procedures, and concerns over the effective enforcement of intellectual property rights."
"A number of grave shortcomings that need to be swiftly and decisively addressed also relate to the area of agriculture and food safety and to the protection of the environment."
"The first months of next year will be crucial periods in Romania’s accession process."
"Romania has made substantial progress to reach this stage."
"I clearly acknowledge that before this Parliament today."
"However, it must now renew its efforts to tackle those remaining concerns."
"Bulgaria must also in the first months of the year focus all its efforts on addressing its remaining shortcomings."
"The Commission’s report provides an effective roadmap, identifying clearly the key weaknesses, and should help guide Bulgaria’s approach."
"Bulgaria too has made substantial process to reach this stage."
"The finishing-line is now in sight and Bulgaria will cross it, as long as it increases its efforts and implements those outstanding reforms."
"This will require hard work, but it will be well worth it."
"The European Union will continue to provide any assistance and support to both Bulgaria and Romania in their endeavours to make that final push towards accession."
"I hope that accession in 2007 will be achieved by both Romania and Bulgaria."
"That accession will bring real benefits to both countries and – I would argue – clearly to the European Union as a whole."
"As my Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said to this Parliament in June, enlargement is an historic opportunity to build a greater and more powerful Union."
"I hope that this time next year both Romania and Bulgaria will be only a fortnight away from becoming full members of our European Union."
". Mr President, just a month and a half ago we talked in this Chamber about Romania’s accession to the European Union."
"Then it was to discuss the report presented by the Commissioner, Mr Rehn."
"We are doing so again today in order to discuss the report which this Parliament will approve tomorrow and which I hope will receive full support."
"There is a fundamental coincidence between the two reports."
"Much significant progress has been made in Romania, but efforts are still needed in several areas, which we are all aware of and which have been mentioned today."
"The two reports also coincide on one fundamental point: it is very important that progress be made in the field of justice and home affairs, particularly with regard to the implementation of the reform in the justice system, better border controls and the fight against corruption, the latter being an essential issue and one on which Parliament wants to see results."
"There is another significant coincidence between the Commission’s report and the Moscovici report: these are decisive times."
"As the Commissioner has said, in the spring the Commission will produce a report on Romania’s degree of preparedness and give its opinion on the possible creation of a mechanism that could delay effective accession by one year."
"This Parliament will then also issue its opinion on this issue, as laid down in the text that we will vote on tomorrow."
"We want to be closely involved in this issue."
"The results in the field of justice and home affairs and the fight against corruption will be very important in this spring’s assessment."
"The Romanian Government must therefore carry on making the greatest possible effort in this and other areas."
"The example of the successes achieved in the field of competition policy, which was previously an issue of immense concern, must serve to stimulate the work still to be done."
"Mr President, it is true that the accessions of Romania and Bulgaria should not fall victim to the new climate of crisis and fatigue amongst the citizens demonstrated by the failures relating to the Constitutional Treaty."
"But we must be realistic; that climate exists and it is difficult for it not to affect the Members of this Parliament, who are close to the citizens and who will be watching the degree of preparation of the two countries very closely."
"In summary, Romania has an historic date with the European Union on 1 January 2007."
"As the report states, Parliament is reiterating its desire for this to take place, but it also stresses that achieving that objective depends, firstly, on the Romanian authorities fulfilling their commitments."
"We support and applaud the efforts they are making to get there on time and to achieve their goal, but that is a job for the Romanian authorities."
". I would like to welcome the work of both rapporteurs."
"One of my reasons for doing so is that as a Hungarian MEP I have been following the efforts of these two countries and the assessments of Parliament and Commission day by day since I joined Parliament."
"With a few amendments, I am happy to say that both reports are balanced and accurately reflect the current situation of the two countries."
"I do not wish to repeat the statements of those who spoke before me nor the criticism given by the Council and the Commission, because, as I already mentioned in October, during the debate following the country report of the Commission, the observers from the two countries are here in order to be able to provide a first-hand report to their decision makers both on deficiencies and on the desirable decisions proposed by Parliament."
"In the course of the debate this morning, during the preparation of the summit that will take place this weekend, it became unequivocally clear that all Groups of Parliament emphasised the importance of solidarity throughout the European Union, because this is the only way we can maintain our competitiveness."
"As the two rapporteurs have also mentioned, the importance of solidarity must be emphasised even more in the case of the two countries under discussion."
"As a Hungarian I cannot avoid mentioning the situation of Hungarians living in Romania."
"I expect the Romanian Government to adopt the Minority Act specified in the Coalition Agreement as soon as possible, as promised."
"I know that all those present in the House are already aware of this, but I still have to emphasise the importance of cultural autonomy, which forms the basis of the above-mentioned law."
"This is the law that, when adopted and observed, will be able to ensure the harmonious coexistence of the minority and majority living in Romania in the long term."
". Mr President, the Liberal Group is appreciative of the progress that Bulgaria and Romania have made in their efforts to draw closer to the European Union."
"We shall continue to support both countries as they progress along this road, while also observing very closely the manner in which they discharge their responsibilities as candidates."
"As my group has repeatedly emphasised, both countries must be judged on the basis of their own performance and independently of one another."
"The Commission will be producing its next progress report on the two countries early next year, and, as Mr Millán Mon has remarked, it will be doing so in a changed climate, one brought about by the constitutional crisis in which the EU finds itself."
"The debate on this will be held in mid-2006."
"That makes all the more important the two countries’ efforts, now that they are on the final straight, to become as efficient as possible and to perform as well as possible, for those are the sort of Member States that the European Union needs."
"There is also the issue to the EU’s capacity to absorb new members and, associated with it, that of the future of enlargement policy."
"It is worthy of note that the debate in the Council on Macedonia is a symptom of this changed climate."
"Let me just say a few things with specific reference to Bulgaria."
"Here we have a balanced document from Mr Van Orden, which gives the Bulgarian Government credit for its efforts and, while highlighting the country’s economic dynamism and average 4% growth rates, spells out in clear terms where Bulgaria still needs to make progress."
"One important aspect of the text from the Committee on Foreign Affairs is that it calls on high-ranking civil servants in Bulgaria to make public their renunciation of every kind of corruption and to support the enactment of regulations to disclose their incomes and financial arrangements."
"This would make for greater transparency and enhance trust in them."
"The Liberal Group would like to see Romania and Bulgaria become Member States of the EU in 2007."
"I might add that I believe that we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while acknowledging the efforts made by both these countries, we are concerned by some of the points of criticism made in the Commission’s report."
"We tabled amendments to the Van Orden report relating to the environment and human rights, but they were, unfortunately, rejected."
"Turning to the deadline for the decommissioning of the nuclear power plant at Kozloduj, I would like to ask Commissioner Rehn what the Commission thinks about paragraph 29, which allows for greater flexibility with regard to the closing down of Blocks 3 and 4."
"To what alternative sources of energy is it giving consideration?"
"This House has been involved in the deliberations on the use of the safeguard clauses; we will take a critical view of accession and will base our decision on the extent to which reforms have been implemented in the justice system, in the fight against corruption, in the protection of children and in the integration of the Roma."
". Mr President, although Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accessions have already been the subject of a vote, the disappointing situation in those countries can cause delays of one year."
"My group has tabled a number of amendments on this score, including Amendment 7, about the continued extortion engaged in by the police and customs to the detriment of EU citizens of Turkish origin travelling through Bulgaria."
"The developments within the European Union itself are also hampering further enlargement, though."
"France is threatening to veto negotiations with Macedonia, a country cooperating closely with Croatia in the hope of joining simultaneously with it."
"The possible approval of ex-Commissioner Bolkenstein’s services directive means that the economic discrepancies between the Member States will become a competitive factor."
"This causes public opinion in the current Member States to turn itself against further enlargements."
"The people in the Netherlands and France who voted against the proposed Constitution are opposed to the neoliberal policy that destroys their welfare provisions and takes away their social security."
"There are now forces both in and outside of governments who wrongly interpret this as an aversion to payments from regional funds to countries with a low standard of living."
"If we want further enlargement, we will need to ensure that those problems are resolved in good time."
". Mr President, the Polish people are particularly sympathetic to the EU ambitions of Bulgaria and Romania, and they have always supported these countries in their efforts towards European integration."
"This is not only because of our geographical proximity, but also because we have shared a difficult history over recent decades."
"We continue to follow the progress of political and economic reforms in both countries very closely, and with every hope that they will be successful."
"I should like to make it known, however, that I have grave doubts about whether it will be possible to fulfil both countries’ hopes of joining the European Union."
"The British Presidency’s proposal for the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective makes no provision for the costs of the new enlargement."
"Contrary to the statements by its politicians, the EU will not be able to make good on its earlier commitments."
"What this also means is that there will be nowhere near enough EU funding available to create a level playing field for Bulgaria and Romania in development terms, both before and after they join the EU."
"This can be taken as yet more proof that the EU principle of solidarity has been a dead letter for many years."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"I have already made my support for Romania’s accession clear on more than one occasion."
"I am sad to see, however, that no progress has yet been made on the issue of the international adoptions that were pending at the time of the 2001 moratorium, despite Parliament’s repeated recommendations and the statements of willingness from the government in Bucharest."
"On 14 January 2005, to be specific, the Romanian Prime Minister assured the Italian press that all pending cases of international adoption would be analysed one by one by a committee of international experts."
"To date, however, as far as I know, neither the families involved nor the European Union itself have been informed about the working party’s procedures or the conclusions it has reached."
"When I asked the European Commission, it was unable in fact to offer me any clarification, and I was also disappointed with the replies I received from Commissioner Rehn to my enquiries."
"He defended the current Romanian law, which nobody is questioning, without giving any undertaking to resolve the cases that were pending prior to the entry into force of that law, as expressly requested by Parliament."
"I myself have also addressed the Romanian Government through its ambassador in Brussels, but it has not given me any useful information or cooperation either."
"I have today written a letter to the observers here, informing them of this, in the hope that they will take my appeal into serious consideration."
"Europe has always been willing to help the candidate countries and human rights cases throughout the world, but perhaps for once it deserves greater recognition, when what is in fact quite a simple request is denied like this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, Romania and Bulgaria are among the twelve countries to which we extended an invitation after the Wall and the barbed wire were brought down."
"Whatever other considerations we may now have in mind, we must not forget that they are among that number, and that it is for that reason that they form part of a package."
"The Treaty has been concluded, but the treaties with these countries are equipped with safeguard clauses."
"That is what makes it of the utmost importance that we should look to see how the timetable is adhered to, and how the Commission’s report is presented early next year."
"It is on the basis of this report’s assessment and of our own conclusions that we will then have to take a decisions as to whether these safeguard clauses, which provide for a delay of one year, should actually be applied, and whether, as can be the case, they should apply to both countries, to neither of them, or to one of them."
"Nothing has been decided, but we should be clear in our own minds about the need for the public not to get the impression that there is anything automatic about it, in other words, that if you start negotiations, you get in automatically on the date you want."
"Hence the need for implementation in the areas mentioned by the Commissioner in his last report and in his letter – dated 9 November, I believe – to the governments of the two countries, and to which the President-in-Office made reference here today, namely corruption, organised crime, border security, food safety within the European single market, consequences for the internal market itself, the rule of law and the development of administration and the justice system."
"The Commission, and Mr Moscovici and Mr Van Orden, with the reports they have presented today, deserve our gratitude for pointing out that this is not just about setting these things down in the form of laws."
"What we need to do now is to exert the necessary pressure and provide the necessary support in order that these countries can meet the conditions, but accession is conditional upon their doing so, and whether or not they make the necessary progress is entirely in their own hands."
"Mr President, our group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, has always been an unfailing advocate of the European Union’s enlargement by countries in Central and Eastern Europe."
"Bulgaria’s and Romania’s accession will complete the fifth enlargement round, finally bringing to an end the division in Europe that lasted for decades."
"Just like the accession of ten new Member States last year, we want Bulgaria’s and Romania’s accession to be a success, not only for the people of those countries, but also for the European Union."
"My group believes that both countries are capable of taking, and implementing, all the necessary measures before the final accession."
"The Commission’s progress reports give an indication of what still needs to happen."
"The areas of concern and criticism are, above all, a guidebook for those countries’ governments and parliaments to take the necessary measures in the time that is left."
"We assume that both countries will make every effort and take action in order to achieve the objectives for EU membership in January 2007."
"They need to give more attention to the fight against corruption and organised crime, as well as to the reinforcement of the judiciary."
"In addition, the European Parliament, in its reports, highlights the importance of the position of the Roma in both countries."
"In April of last year, we gave our formal blessing to Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession."
"At that time, 20 months before the planned date of accession, we did this in the full knowledge that considerable progress needed to be made in important areas in both countries."
"The inclusion of a safeguard clause which makes it possible to move the date of accession back one year was important in this respect, as well as the pledge by the Commission and Council to involve Parliament fully in the decision as to whether this safeguard clause should apply or not."
"We think there is every reason to be moderately optimistic that both countries will be able to meet the prescribed requirements by the next assessment."
"We will state our opinion on this in the spring of 2006."
"One last point is, of course, our own readiness to enlarge."
"Tomorrow and the day after, the EU’s post-2006 multi-annual budget will be discussed in the European Council, something that has already been discussed at length this morning."
"I would like to stress once again that we share the responsibility of making Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accessions successful, and I would therefore urge the Heads of Government to consider this enlargement as one of their guiding principles in their decision-making, particularly in both debates tomorrow."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two months after the last Commission and Council report on Romania’s level of preparation for accession to the European Union, we are once again examining the progress made."
"We can agree on the fact that progress has been made, but it is undeniable that other conditions laid down in the accession treaty also have to be met, if accession is to be achieved in January 2007."
"As the Moscovici report shows, today these areas still require a great deal of work."
"That is the case, for instance, with freedom of expression, justice, the fight against corruption, antidiscrimination measures, child protection and the protection of people with mental health problems, the excessive use of force by the police authorities, industrial and domestic waste management, food safety and environmental protection, as well as the implementation of legislation on the return of properties."
"That is not to mention – and here I absolutely underline what a fellow Member has already said – the international adoptions problem, to which no solution has been found even under the new law. This law does not apply retroactively, but it has effectively blocked even those families who had already started adoption proceedings when the moratorium came into force."
"Mr President, this is a question of human rights."
"Denying a child a family, after the child has already hugged and come to know and love his or her potential adoptive parents, can in no way be justified; the child’s interests must remain paramount in all circumstances."
"For that reason we called for an analysis of all the issues and all the situations by the committee that has been set up."
"Nevertheless, we have not received any response to date."
"We also tabled an amendment in committee with Mr Podestà, which was subsequently taken up."
"Further amendments have been tabled today by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"As the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe we shall support them, because we want the situation to be duly acknowledged by the Romanian authorities and a solution to be found to it."
"I therefore believe that the observers, who have been here in Parliament since 26 September, can very usefully help their government to fulfil the commitments it has made, including by exchanging experiences with colleagues from other countries."
"Mr President, the Verts/ALE Group has tabled an amendment to paragraph 19 of the Bulgaria report."
"Although the rapporteur welcomes practical measures taken to improve integration, key reforms to combat discrimination are still at the early stages."
"Our amendment stresses that fact."
"In other fields the situation is worsening."
"The trafficking of children has doubled."
"The good news is that 86 Bulgarian institutions recently started legal proceedings against Mr Siderov, leader of the neo-Nazi party Ataka."
"He will be brought to court for his hate speeches against Roma, Jews and Turks."
"This initiative deserves our support."
"However, if MEPs are not cautious in expressing themselves, they run the risk of being exploited by parties like Ataka."
"Mr Van Orden’s frequent use of the word ‘adapt’ made the rapporteur popular in Ataka circles."
"I am going to show you the Ataka newspaper with a picture of Mr Van Orden and an article inside."
"I think this is a sad day for Parliament."
"– As of 1 January 2007, Bulgaria and Romania will be EU Member States."
"Some of the conditions laid down in the Treaty of Accession work to the advantage of these countries, whereas others are nothing short of discriminatory from the point of view of the first pillar."
"After all, those of us from the new Member States have ample first-hand experience of such discrimination, an example of which is the establishment of the free movement of persons as an ideal from which the accession arrangements are far removed."
"I am somewhat alarmed by the US administration’s efforts to establish or take control of military bases in the Balkans, and by the relentless pressure to exempt US citizens from the jurisdiction of the Hague-based International Criminal Court."
"The end result of negotiations on this matter should in fact be that the common interests of the EU Member States, including the new Member States, are given clear priority."
"The reports pass over this issue."
"Conversely, I believe that it is high time that negotiations were opened on energy security."
"It is particularly important that such security be guaranteed in terms of electricity supply to the region that may be affected by the decommissioning of several blocks of the Kozloduj power plant, as mentioned by Mr Horáček."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would call on you once again to help ensure that the new Member States’ accession to the European Union proceeds smoothly."
"We should not allow these countries to endure continued hardship after 1 January 2007, confronted as they are by massive problems, caused by the pressure to privatise that has been exerted unscrupulously by external influences."
"We should not forget that we are setting a precedent for negotiations with other Balkan states, and they should receive an appropriate welcome into the EU."
"Mr President, the Bulgarian customs officers still have a bad reputation for fleecing travellers."
"In fact, travellers have now started to anticipate the officers’ behaviour, and so it is that, according to an official report by the Dutch Government published just one and a half weeks ago, many people crossing the Bulgarian border have a small amount of money tucked away in their passports that is intended for the Bulgarian customs officers."
"According to one person in the know, it would certainly help if the Bulgarian media were to film the corrupt practices that go on at the border."
"This may well be a piece of advice that the Commissioner will want to pass on to his Bulgarian opposite number."
"The fact is that the Romanian authorities set just as much store by the fight against corruption."
"What the Netherlands does regard as worrying, though, is the area of conflict that appears to exist between the wish to give the fight against corruption a public airing, both in terms of the EU and the population, and the detachment that simply needs to be displayed in court cases."
"Does the Commissioner share this conclusion on the part of a Member States and if so, what concrete action is he considering taking with regard to the Romanian authorities?"
"After all, in this debate, we have discussed the fight against corruption and the reinforcement of the judiciary, although surely that creates an area of conflict?"
"The Commissioner knows this very well, given his Romanian expertise."
"In short, the nascent Romanian judicial system should not be sacrificed on the altar of EU integration, for then we will miss the boat."
"By way of conclusion, I should like to add a brief observation on the protection of intellectual property. This is something for which we usually call China to account."
"Mr Moscovici, in his report, is right to press Bucharest for this as well, for the Romanian shops are well-known for being stacked with counterfeit goods."
"In a word, Bucharest has been asked to take action."
"Mr President, I believe Romania remains on track for accession by 1 January 2007."
"However, the new government must continue reforming the judiciary, upholding media freedom, enabling property restitution, protecting minorities and children and fighting organised crime."
"Particular attention must also be paid to the reform of public administration and the fight against corruption, including delivery on the promise of indictments of high-level officials alleged to have committed serious offences."
"The situation of disabled and mentally ill people is also of concern."
"Romania’s control of its borders and collection of customs dues – with the settlement of the Snake Island dispute in the Black Sea – is important, as is improving food hygiene, environmental pollution and intellectual property protection."
"However, Romania’s recent handling of the avian flu outbreak was excellent."
"Romania continues to comply with the criterion of being a functioning market economy, but there are still concerns on state aid and bankruptcy laws."
"Lastly, I want to raise the tragic issue of international adoptions, which affects hopeful parents from the European Union, the United States and Israel."
"I urge the Romanian Government to consider concluding these adoptions, in particular the 1 100 pipeline cases of orphans and abandoned children for whom caring foreign families had registered adoption petitions prior to the January 2005 ban."
"That ban was largely brought about at the request of the European Union, eager to clean up a previously chaotic and sometimes corrupt system."
"The UN Convention on the Child does not forbid international adoption."
"It simply makes it the last permanent solution."
"The Romanian Government should seriously reconsider the heartless position it is currently maintaining."
"Mr President, I first visited Romania for a skiing trip during the Christmas/New Year period in 1989."
"The Romanian flags being waved then had holes where the symbol was cut out in the middle."
"Sixteen years on, we have Mr Moscovici’s report which shows quite amazing achievements and huge progress."
"I speak now as one who has been a Member of the EU-Romania Joint Parliamentary Committee since 1994 and who has visited many times, seeing the significant advances, particularly in the fields of freedom of expression, justice, minorities and children."
"What we are talking about is reuniting the people of Europe."
"People who share a common culture, a common heritage, a common history and who have great linguistic links."
"Romania is European in every sense; its mere name gives that away."
"I look forward to the day when Romanian colleagues are in this Chamber as elected Members of this European Parliament."
"Mr President, the preparations of both Bulgaria and Romania for EU membership seem to be proceeding as expected."
"Both countries have encountered problems, which can nevertheless be overcome."
"It needs to be stressed that the accession of either country must be assessed on the basis of its own achievements."
"Hopefully both countries can join the Union at the start of 2007."
"The Union is both politically and institutionally prepared to accept Bulgaria and Romania as its members."
"With regard to future enlargement, however, the situation is unclear."
"This is also evident from the fact that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has not reached consensus on the report on enlargement strategy."
"Future enlargement and the reworking of the Treaties should be examined together."
"Many are endeavouring to restrict future enlargement and believe that a Constitution which has been rejected in a national referendum should be put swiftly into effect."
"This strategy is associated with debates on the Union’s ability to accept more members and alternatives to full membership."
"This is not a realistic path to follow: it will lead to a dead end."
"The future has to be built on two fundamental facts."
"Firstly, it is obvious that the Union will continue to expand vigorously, and, secondly, the Constitution has been rejected once and for all."
"It would therefore be wise to start drafting a new Treaty more suited to an expanding Union and one that will have the approval of the citizens of the Member States."
"The expanding Union may not be very close-knit, so we need more arrangements for closer cooperation."
"As it expands, the Union thus needs to be internally differentiated."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, I should like to counsel meticulousness and appeal to you all to take our own criteria and procedures seriously."
"This remark is addressed particularly to Members who already know that Romania will not make it next year."
"They thought, or think, that Europe has, in the past, taken hasty decisions where enlargements are concerned and now believe that we should be somewhat stricter and that whatever Romania does, it will never be good enough."
"It is also addressed to those Members who already know that Romania will succeed anyway, irrespective of the fact whether it will meet the conditions prescribed."
"There is every reason for Parliament to remain critical to the last moment, particularly in the areas that are so sensitive and difficult as the reform of the judiciary and the fight against corruption."
"These form the biggest problems not only in Romania, but in all candidate countries."
"The questions that were asked six months ago are still crucial: is it, with the help of its very determined Justice Minister, managing to carry out the reform of the judiciary?"
"Will new people with new insights fill important positions?"
"Is it really possible to fight corruption at the highest level?"
"Those are questions to which we do not have to find the answers right now."
"What matters now is for us to be focused, clear and unambiguous, to make it clear what we think should happen in Romania, and Judgment Day is set to fall in May 2006."
"Mr President, these reports state the wish of the majority in this Parliament to see Bulgaria and Romania join the European Union by 1 January 2007."
"However, these reports contain many instances detailing their total unsuitability to join according to the EU’s own membership criteria."
"These reports highlight their levels of corruption, the proliferation of organised crime, and the need for the reform of their legal and economic systems among many other things."
"It is unlikely that these countries will be able to transform themselves into the paragons of virtue they are supposed to be before they can join in one year’s time."
"But we all know that sadly it does not matter what state they are in."
"It does not matter what their levels of corruption and organised crime are."
"They are going to be welcomed in anyway."
"Their membership is part of the grand plan for the creation of a United States of Europe, and all other factors are subordinate to that ambition."
"In spite of all the accusations voiced in the Romanian press and in many press briefings, I am not against the accession of Romania, I am not speaking out against the interests of Romania."
"But – with deep respect for the population of Romania – I know that accession must be successful for each Romanian citizen."
"This is their only chance to avoid missing the vitally important modernisation."
"And the European Union constitutes a chance today, perhaps the very last chance for the population of Romania."
"However, I believe that this chance must also be provided to the Hungarian community in Romania, who have already had their fair share of political window-dressing, but what they actually see is that only a few of the essential issues have been solved."
"Please allow me to give an example."
"When the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament votes that the situation of this community should be settled on the basis of European principles such as self-governance and subsidiarity, the Romanian Prime Minister asks the Liberal Group in Brussels to remove the principle of self-governance from the text and replace it with ‘cultural autonomy’."
"In the meantime, in the background, the two large government coalition parties – Liberal and Democratic – agreed in Bucharest on Monday to remove the essence of cultural autonomy from the draft Minority Act, robbing the minority community of all forms of self-governance."
"They would remove from the rather unstable draft Minority Act the very essence for which it is being created, allowing no opportunity for dialogue."
"This constitutes further evidence of the Romanian political window-dressing."
"They say one thing to Europe, and do something else at home."
"Could it be that they use the same political window-dressing in other areas, as well? Regarding the issues of the Roma people, environmental protection, property restitution, corruption?"
"Please support me in ensuring that we adhere to our basic European principles, to our April resolution – and let us not amend paragraph 26 of the Moscovici report."
"The report that we had voted for is good as it is, and Mr Moscovici deserves to be commended for it."
"If we do not demand that these basic principles be implemented, no one else will do it in our place."
"– Mr President, it is a fact that Romania and Bulgaria have made significant progress in incorporating and applying the , thanks to consistent support in the enlargement strategy on the part of the European Union."
"We welcome all these changes and reforms in the political, economic and social sectors."
"Today both countries, Bulgaria and Romania, are at a critical stage and there are some real serious deficits."
"The question of environmental protection, the question of external border controls, the question of the fight against organised crime, the safety of nuclear energy and food safety are questions which also worry and interest European citizens."
"At a time when there is a crisis as regards the legitimacy of the enlargement strategy, the European Union must, for its part, remain constant in its decisions on the two countries, decisions which must not allow discounts in principle."
"That would be a mistake for both countries and for the European Union."
"For its part, the European Commission must help within the framework of the pre-accession strategy and within the framework of the programmes which exist for the transfer of Community know-how."
"Finally, I should like to comment on two individual demands which particularly concern and worry European citizens: the first is the question of Bulgaria's obligation to respect the provisions and arrangements of the accession act on the safety of the Kozloduy nuclear power station and the second, for Romania, is the major humanitarian problem which has been generated with child adoption."
"I believe and trust that the Romanian authorities, with respect for international law and with respect for Romanian law, will resolve this humanitarian problem, which is worrying adoptive parents in Europe."
"Mr President, it is good that the ground rules for the accession process should be clear and, in my view, they are indeed so."
"There is no doubt whatsoever that both Romania and Bulgaria understand what is required of them."
"During my visits to these two countries and my conversations with the people there, I have seen this for myself."
"Everyone in Romania and Bulgaria knows that we are concerned about the remaining areas in which improvements are required."
"Everyone knows perfectly well that we are watching them and monitoring every stage of development."
"However, no one with whom I have spoken, from government representatives to people on the café terraces, are as strongly convinced that we really want to see them join as early as 2007, despite our saying that we do and despite our saying so in our resolutions and reports."
"Why is this the case?"
"Obviously, we are sending extremely clear signals about the negative things – problems, difficulties and requirements – but less clear signals of encouragement and appreciation and, above all, of the sincerity with which we shall welcome them."
"What I mean is that it is good that we should carefully monitor the reforms that are implemented and the ways in which both Romania and Bulgaria fulfil the requirements for membership."
"Given the repeated references in this Chamber to protection clauses, postponement of the accession, absorption ability and the debate on the EU’s external borders, I am afraid that the signal we are sending not only to Romania and Bulgaria but to the whole region is that Europe has been transformed into a colder place that is more closed in on itself."
"That is not the Europe I know. It is not the Europe I fight and work for and defend."
"I believe that all the reforms recently implemented by Romania and Bulgaria are testament to these countries’ efforts and to the fact that they give high priority to their membership."
"Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession to the EU will be a strong catalyst and a factor that will increase security throughout the region."
"I am convinced that, with our help, these countries can successfully accede to EU membership no later than in January 2007."
"I am also convinced that this is not possible without our help and support and without a positive perspective."
"I too should like to take this opportunity to call on the Bulgarian and Romanian authorities to step up the pace of their work and to speed up their preparations for joining the European Union."
"Examples of areas where efforts need to be intensified include the functioning of the judiciary, the fight against corruption and the integration of minorities, including the Roma minority."
"A very accurate account of these weak points is given in the Van Orden and Moscovici reports."
"To my mind, compliance with these requirements and with the others that have already been mentioned today is of crucial importance, and there are two reasons why this is the case."
"Firstly, these requirements must be met in order to make it possible for Bulgaria and Romania to become full members of the EU as of 1 January 2007."
"Secondly, and in my opinion equally importantly, they must be met so that both countries can continue to set a positive example to their neighbours, such as Macedonia or Serbia and Montenegro."
"Both Bulgaria and Romania played a very positive role during the 1990s when war was raging in the Balkans, and acted as a stabilising force."
"It is my firm belief that the two countries will continue to play such a role, and that they will set an example not only to their Balkan neighbours, but also to certain small-time politicians, most of whom hail from the old Member States, who are starting to lose heart and to cast doubt upon the very purpose of European enlargement."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I too agree with everyone in this Chamber who has stressed that, only with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania on 1 January 2007 will the fifth enlargement be complete."
"It is important that we remember this."
"Throughout the accession procedure, both Bulgaria and Romania have achieved a great many things."
"There are without doubt still a number of matters outstanding, but the fact that they have achieved this much illustrates the political will of both countries to honour the commitments which they made towards the European Union, so that they can become full and active members of the European family."
"As far as Bulgaria is concerned, I have two comments to make: the first comment concerns the Kozloduy nuclear power station."
"I believe that Bulgaria should honour the commitment it made when it signed the Accession Treaty and close units 3 and 4."
"At the same time, however, I consider that Bulgaria needs help in filling the energy vacuum which will be created, help like that which is to be given to Slovakia, according to my sources, so that it can honour its commitments relating to nuclear energy."
"My second comment concerns the strategic position of Bulgaria on the external borders of the European Union."
"I believe that it is very important, precisely because with Bulgaria we shall have new borders, for controls to be coordinated, in order to prevent and combat organised crime."
"Finally, as far as Romania is concerned, I too believe that the very important question of adoptions must be addressed in its correct dimension."
"Mr President, the enlargement has been of great benefit to the European Union, including its old countries, and we must turn away from the populists who claim otherwise."
"I am convinced that Romania and Bulgaria will also enrich the EU."
"Their accession will not only benefit them, but will also add something to the EU."
"When I say this, it does not mean that we must not be strict where the EU’s criteria and values are concerned."
"The simple fact of the matter is that much remains to be done in that area."
"According to last month’s Transparency International list, Bulgaria is ranked Number 55 and Romania Number 85 on the list of corrupt countries, which puts them alongside such countries as Mongolia and the Dominican Republic."
"What is particularly cause for concern is the fact that corruption even pervades the highest echelons."
"Another area for improvement is border control and all the related activities, as well as the rights of minorities."
"Bulgaria and Romania have done a great deal, but much is yet to be done before the criteria are really met."
"This House was forced to decide really early on, 20 months prior to accession, but we will not take the actual decision on the question when those countries can join until we have received the last piece of information, namely in April, although it is more likely to be May, of next year."
"I think we should be fair in this, that we need to let the facts speak for themselves, that we need to ratchet up the pressure now and that Romania and Bulgaria should now pull out all the stops in order to make actual progress in the area of corruption."
"It would be tremendously symbolic if we were to see representative senior officials and former political figures brought to court on account of their corruption."
"That would be a wonderful symbol."
"Our verdict will depend on this: fair but objective and also faithful to our values."
"Knowing the Commissioner, I trust that he will also operate along those lines, that, if the outcome is good enough, the countries in question can join in 2007, but that, if there is a shortcoming, the Commission will suggest postponing their accession by one year."
"It is good to maintain the criteria in order to retain the support for enlargement."
"It also benefits the EU’s credibility and, last but not least, it is a very good thing for the people of Romania and Bulgaria who deserve our level of freedom and democracy."
"The government of Romania is systematically working on meeting the requirements raised by the European Union and the European Parliament."
"However, there are still a great number of issues to be tackled in numerous areas."
"The tabled motion for resolution addresses deficiencies critically but fairly."
"I would like to call attention to the importance of the following amendment proposals, accepted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"The situation of the draft Minority Act included in the programme of the Romanian Government is uncertain."
"The delaying tactics of the Romanian governing parties is unacceptable, and this is why it is necessary to issue a strict warning to Bucharest."
"A further important issue is the provision of mother-tongue university education for ethnic minority citizens, particularly in view of the fact that the situation of the more than 1.5 million indigenous Hungarians, of the Hungarian community, is not satisfactory in this respect."
"I emphasise that the unquestionable means of protecting minorities and ensuring their legal certainty is the actual implementation of the principle of subsidiarity and self-government, including the establishment of certain types of autonomy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us not amend paragraph 26!"
"The draft report mentions property restitution, but the issue of church property restitution has not been settled yet."
"Romania needs reforms and many new laws in the area of environmental protection."
"Once more, I would like to point out critically the exploitation plan of the gold mine at Rosia Montana, which must be solved taking into account the opinion of the competent civil organisations and affected countries, such as Slovakia and Hungary."
"Finally, it is very important to express firmly the possibility of enforcing the safeguard clause."
"Compliance with the requirements listed means the implementation of the Copenhagen criteria."
"Like all candidate states so far, Romania can only obtain the licence needed for accession on the basis of actual results."
"Mr President, I am very glad to participate in this debate, mainly to give a voice to the many children, young adults with handicaps and those living in inappropriate state institutions in Romania, which I visited recently."
"However, before I do that, let me just say a few words about the EU budget talks that are ongoing for 2007 onwards."
"The British Presidency proposal does not make adequate provision for the enlargement of Romania and Bulgaria and we can only hope that the talks will change that situation."
"Whatever emerges, there is a duty on the EU to continue to press for reform in Romania’s state residential institutions."
"This is detailed in the monitoring report of the Enlargement Commission."
"It is no coincidence that practically the only area that has experienced substantial reforms is that of child protection, to some extent due to the interest taken in this by the European Parliament."
"The adult handicapped sector has plans for reform but there are no substantial initiatives as yet, again reflecting the recent interest we have taken in this in the EU."
"As for the mental health sector, where some of the worst conditions can be found, there are no substantive plans for reform and this area has been largely ignored by the European Union."
"We need to address it."
"I would like to mention, as some of my colleagues have, the issue of the ‘pipeline children’, the inter-country adoptions."
"I share the concerns of colleagues."
"We need to get clarification from the Romanian authorities about these children."
"They need to give us assurances that it is in the best interests of the children to stay in Romania and indeed we need to know that they are in appropriate homes as we speak."
"I understand the anxieties of the adoptive parents, but I also appreciate the reasons behind the ban on inter-country adoptions."
"However, what is most important is that the needs of the children are placed above all else."
"In some cases, this may mean allowing the adoptions to proceed."
"Human rights lobbyists I have spoken to contend that much of the reforms in Romania are of the ‘smoke and mirrors’ variety and that the theory does not always translate into real progress on the ground."
"I hope that is not the case and I applaud Romania where it has made improvements, but much remains to be done."
"Too many people still live in unacceptable conditions in Romania’s institutions."
"We represent their best hope."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking in place of Mr Podestà, the Chairman of the Delegation to the EU-Romania Joint Parliamentary Committee, and therefore my speech will deal particularly with the situation in that country."
"We agree with the basic points illustrated in the Moscovici report."
"The considerable progress made by Romania is also clear from the progress report put forward by Commissioner Rehn in the last part-session."
"On 22 and 23 November this year, the EU-Romania joint delegation met to discuss this candidate country’s actual current stage of advancement."
"The meeting was also attended by Vice-President Frattini, Commissioner Rehn, the Romanian observers to the European Parliament and the Romanian Government representative."
"Following all these reports, which bear witness to the efforts made by Romania, we reaffirm the need for that country to sustain its commitment in order to be able to join us on 1 January 2007."
"Notable and undeniable improvements have been achieved in the areas of freedom, communications, the media, education, and human rights for the country’s ethnic minorities, without forgetting the significant results achieved in the economic field."
"The situation of the Romanian market today is no different from that in which Spain, Portugal, Greece and the 10 countries of the fifth enlargement round found themselves 12 months before their accession."
"While acknowledging that there are still important areas for improvement, such as justice, the fight against high-level corruption and the return of confiscated properties to others, in early December the Romanian Government launched an action plan setting irrevocable deadlines in order to meet the conditions agreed with the European Union."
"Work had started on the monitoring systems and the reorganisation of the institutions responsible for those areas back in April 2005, and now they need to be given the time they require for their activities effectively to come on stream."
"A serious problem that remains unresolved, however, is that of the children who have already made contact with their potential new families, because of the new legislation that prohibits international adoptions."
"In that respect, we shall maintain Amendment 38 to paragraph 14 of the Moscovici report, in the hope that the Romanian Government will adopt immediate decisions to resolve this issue."
"In any case, I should like to give our Romanian and Bulgarian colleagues my best wishes and hope that from 1 January 2007 they can be sitting on a par with us here in Parliament."
". Mr President, I welcome the informed and thought provoking-debate that has taken place this afternoon on this important issue for the European Union."
"The interventions we have heard have reinforced the importance of enlargement in my mind and underlined the benefits it brings to candidate countries and indeed the wider Member States."
"As in our previous debate, honourable Members’ points and questions went to the heart of the issue and raised some interesting issues for us to consider about Romania and Bulgaria’s accession processes and the wider policy of enlargement."
"Given the constraints of time, I shall limit my concluding remarks to a few of the points that were addressed directly by honourable Members."
"Mr Tannock and Mr Belder mentioned the issue of corruption and, in particular, concern in relation to border guards and the security thereof."
"Both countries certainly face major challenges in tackling corruption, and Bulgaria, in particular, must step up the fight against organised crime."
"The new governments have demonstrated a real commitment to tackle these problems and we have seen some progress, but there is still a long way to go."
"It is right to acknowledge that before this House today."
"In Romania examples of progress include: a new head of the anti-corruption department in the General Prosecutor’s office; 11 new senior prosecutors removed for ineffectiveness; and 22 cases of corruption by former and current senators and deputies now under way."
"In relation to the further work that Romania has undertaken, border police and customs have dismissed large numbers of senior border and customs officers at several posts for ineffectiveness and corruption."
"But let us be very clear: there is considerable and important progress that needs to be made on these important points."
"Mr Beglitis and Mr Tannock also mentioned the issue international adoption, a point that was then touched upon by Ms McGuinness in a later contribution to the debate."
"Corruption in international adoption has been clearly a problem."
"Recent measures have been introduced to protect the interests of the child, as we have heard from a number of speakers, to improve domestic child protection and family facilities and to reduce the numbers of institutionalised children, in line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and European Union norms."
"In relation to the specific question as to why the Romanian Government is blocking pre-arranged adoptions, for example to the United States, a number of the so-called pipeline cases, which have been mentioned in the course of contributions to this debate, relate to requests made during the period of the 2001 to 2004 moratorium on international adoption."
"The Romanian authorities set up a group of experts in June 2005, who are working through the files of the children concerned, to analyse each specific case and to look for solutions within the context of the legislation currently in force."
"Ms McGuinness, Ms Sbarbati and Ms de Groen-Kouwenhoven also mentioned children in the wider sense and asked what is being done in relation to the treatment of children in both of these countries."
"We are certainly concerned about the plight of institutionalised children whose living conditions are generally inadequate in both of these countries."
"More work is needed to improve conditions, but we are encouraged by both governments’ recent actions."
"For example, in the case of Bulgaria, the government has established six regional offices of the State Agency for Child Protection since early 2005 to take forward improvements."
"It has started to implement a new action plan to close old state care homes."
"In the case of Romania, the government is working hard to take children out of care homes and move them in with foster parents or relatives."
"It has closed almost all of the 85 large, old-style institutions for children and replaced them with modern child protection alternatives."
"Since 2000, it has reduced the number of children in care homes from 37 000 down to the present figure of 32 000."
"Mr Piotrowski suggested – on a different matter entirely, but one that it is apposite to respond to, not least given the timing of this debate – that the Presidency’s proposals on the financial perspective for 2007 to 2013 could not accommodate Romania and Bulgaria and failed to meet the criteria for solidarity."
"I do not accept either charge."
"On Romania and Bulgaria, our proposals fully respect their allocations under the accession agreements and provide for a historic shift of spending towards the new Member States and accession states and offer them greater flexibility as to how to distribute those European Union funds to the greatest possible effect."
"That historic shift in funding, which includes significant cuts in receipts for the United Kingdom, shows why our proposals are all about solidarity, which featured prominently in his remarks."
"There is no virtue in repeating the word ‘solidarity’, while avoiding the difficult challenge of finding the common ground on which both net contributors and net recipients can meet in the course of the coming hours and coming days."
"In relation to both Bulgaria and Romania, I would recognise that significant progress towards European Union accession on 1 January 2007 has been made, but more work needs to be undertaken."
"The Commission, under the capable leadership of Commissioner Rehn, will continue to monitor progress closely and will produce a follow-up report in April or May next year."
"This report will provide the basis for any decision on whether to activate the so-called ‘safeguard clause’."
"To avoid delay, Romania and Bulgaria must now step up the pace of reform in the critical months at the beginning of the coming year and, in particular, tackle corruption, which has featured so prominently in this debate this afternoon."
"They have a short space of time in which to implement these reforms, but accession in 2007 is still achievable, as long as they fulfil those important, outstanding commitments."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I wish to thank the Members for their objective and informative debate and their well-chosen words."
"It is also good that there was emphasis in the speeches on the fact that this is now about bringing to conclusion the latest, which is to say the fifth, round of enlargement."
"This is an addition to the historic upheaval which started with the collapse of the Berlin Wall more than 15 years ago."
"My opinion is that the Commission and the European Parliament, as well as the Presidency, with reference to Mr Alexander’s important speech, should consider Bulgaria’s and Romania’s preparations for membership very much in the same way and putting emphasis on the same things."
"Reform of the judicial system in particular is absolutely essential."
"It is essential for the legal protection of the citizens of Bulgaria and Romania, it is essential from the point of view of economic dynamics and foreign investment, and it is also essential for the implementation of EU legislation in these countries."
"We have a responsibility for ensuring that we assess fairly and objectively whether these countries are ready in this respect to accede to the Union in 2007."
"The same also applies to administrative reform, and especially the fight against corruption and criminality, and the elimination of problems in the area of agriculture and food safety."
"The coming months will be decisive for both countries."
"Both have a chance to join in 2007, but only if both do all they can to meet the requirements and take the challenge absolutely seriously."
"I trust that there is nothing unclear about this, but, to be quite sure, I will repeat my message."
"What is crucial now is not any charm offensive in the capitals of the EU countries, but purposeful, practical action to carry through reforms in the legal system and in administration, and very determined action to combat corruption and crime."
"Come spring, I would not like to find myself in a situation where, on behalf of the Commission, I have to propose recourse to the safeguard clauses, but it needs to be said that they have not been entered in the accession treaties for fun."
"This chance should be taken seriously in Bulgaria and Romania, and every endeavour should be made to achieve eligibility for membership, so that both countries can join in January 2007."
"We will be completely objective in our assessment of how prepared these countries are in the light of hard facts."
"The Commission will support the reforms in Bulgaria and Romania, follow developments and in due course present Parliament and the Council with an assessment of this progress."
"It needs to be emphasised that we will need regular dialogue, as Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs Elmar Brok, as well as others, said."
"I would suggest that we return to the matter during the spring, when we will have a more accurate idea of how Bulgaria and Romania have progressed in their efforts to achieve eligibility for membership at the beginning of 2007."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"I would like to draw your attention within the framework of the Moscovici Report on the importance of safeguarding the rights of the Hungarian minority, the largest minority in Romania."
"More specifically, I would like to draw your attention on paragraph 26 of the Report."
"I understand that attempts have been made in order to erase from this paragraph the references to the principles of subsidiarity and self governance."
"My opinion is that these principles are fundamental principles of the European Union and therefore should not be erased."
"Many promises were made by the Romanian political leadership for the safeguard of the rights of the Hungarian minority."
"It is about time now that Romania shows real political will to concretely implement these promises."
"The question is: if there is no problem with Hungarian minority's rights why would the Romanian leadership want to erase parts of paragraph 26?"
"I strongly believe that it is the political responsibility of the European Parliament to ensure that all aspects including minorities' protection are appropriately dealt with while addressing Romania's readiness to access the European Union."
"In my opinion, minority issues are indeed at least as important as economic issues."
"In spring 2006, the European Commission will submit to the Council its Final Opinion on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania in January 2007."
"The accession of these countries depends on their ability to meet the commitments made in the accession treaty."
"If they cannot, the safeguard clauses delaying accession to 2008 could be invoked."
"Although the reports relating to the readiness of Romania and Bulgaria stress how much progress has been made, particularly in terms of the market economy, it is clear that the pace of reform needs to be increased, particularly in Romania, in order to strengthen the administrative and legal system, fight corruption, integrate the Roma and improve border controls."
"Worrying delays have also been observed in implementing the in the areas of agriculture, public contracts and the environment."
"This enlargement faces the European Union with a twofold challenge: we must not disappoint the Bulgarian and Romanian citizens who have great hopes for this accession; but at the same time we need to explain to our citizens, at a time when the European Union is going through a major political and budgetary crisis, the good reasons for this enlargement, which is opposed by the large majority of public opinion."
"A delegation from Austria, headed by Vice-Chancellor Gorbach, has arrived in the Chamber."
"It will take part in political meetings ahead of the Austrian Presidency, which is due to begin on 1 January 2006."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0343/2005)."
"We will take the following questions to the Council."
"We will not be taking Questions Nos 2 to 8, as they deal with a matter that has already been on this afternoon’s order of business."
"Addressing the European Parliament on 26 October, in preparation for the next informal European Council, the Council President remarked, ‘On the Working Time Directive, I hope that we can reach agreement under the UK Presidency’."
"What exactly has the UK Presidency done to achieve this objective and what progress has been made?"
". I can assure the honourable Member that we are endeavouring to reach an agreement on the amended proposal for a directive amending the Working Time Directive."
"In-depth discussions, both bilaterally and in the Council working groups, have enabled progress to be made on some key issues."
"Discussions at the Employment Council only last week were very positive."
"We made significant progress towards identifying the possible elements for an agreement."
"Regrettably, however, due to differences in labour market situations across the Member States, as well as the complexity of new provisions, it was not possible to reach overall agreement at this stage."
"It is obviously vital that any solution strikes the right balance between the objectives of health and safety protection for workers, and the protection and promotion of Europe’s competitiveness in the context of globalisation."
"President-in-Office, thank you for that reply."
"I understand that, as you said, no agreement was reached."
"It is becoming very clear that a lot of Member States that are trying to get rid of the individual opt-out – which you are working to retain, as I am – are trying to get around the use of the opt-out, either by using autonomous workers as a way of opting out or by making sure that there are multiple contracts, i.e. two or three contracts for one employee, which makes the whole idea of the Working Time Directive seem ludicrous."
"I should be grateful if you could say whether the Socialist Group of MEPs, including the Labour MEPs, might support us now on the retention of the individual opt-out?"
". I am sure that honourable Members as experienced as Mrs Lynne recognise that it is not my responsibility to answer on this occasion on behalf of individual Members of this Parliament or of any group within this Parliament."
"My responsibility instead is to answer on behalf of the Presidency."
"However, I can assure her that she is correct in her analysis, in recognising that one of the main outstanding issues is how to apply the directive: per contract or per worker."
"This confusion has arisen out of the discovery that, as she suggested, some Member States were applying the limits in the Working Time Directive per contract, thereby allowing people to work much longer than 48 hours per week by having more than one contract."
"We now need to consider further how to resolve this and seek to build on the significant progress that was made in the course of our Presidency, including last Thursday."
"Minister, I do not understand the British Presidency’s concern about multiple contracts."
"It would be all very well if you were against the opt-out but, with a directive with an opt-out as you advocate, it is irrelevant whether the contract or the worker is seen, because everybody will be able to do more than 48 hours."
"I believe that this is a tactical manoeuvre; a manoeuvre that has divided the Council, which is wasting time and which is not going to bring us any closer to a final solution."
"You should read this Parliament’s resolutions more carefully."
"Parliament has found a way that is flexible and secure."
"Please do not invent new issues and get down to the job of resolving the important problems."
". With the greatest of respect, it is not the British Presidency that has been inventing responses to the working time directive."
"Let me assure the honourable Member that we remain committed to securing a European solution that respects national labour practices whilst providing appropriate levels of worker protection and promoting European competitiveness in line with Europe’s jobs and growth objectives."
"I should like to congratulate the Presidency and indeed those other countries within the Council that recognise the importance of retaining the opt-out."
"I know this is a difficult dossier which all of us would like to see resolved some way or another."
"Although the ‘double deal’ of the opt-out is potentially on the table, and taking into account the issue of on-call time, given that it is clearly impossible to do the double deal, is it not at least still sensible for you and/or the Austrian Presidency to try and clear up the issue of on-call time in isolation?"
". In response, I am grateful to the honourable Member for having rushed to the Chamber to ask the question."
"Let me seek to assure him that we came very close to being able to find that agreement which secured the objectives that I described last week."
"That is what gives me cautious optimism that we will, in time, be able to find a way forward in relation to the question that he put to me."
"Our proposals, tabled for that discussion last week, marked a serious attempt to meet practical objections on the opt-out and reflected extensive consultation with Member States."
"No doubt there will now be further opportunities for discussions within the Council to see whether we can finally reach the consensus that has so far eluded us."
"In view of the oil crisis and high road transport costs, what specific short- or long-term measures does the Council intend to take to promote the development of electric-powered rail transport, particularly in the outlying areas of Europe?"
". I hope I do not disappoint the honourable Member, who has now joined us in the Chamber, with the answer that I can offer, but the Council has received no proposals from the Commission on this subject and it therefore has not addressed the issue."
"– Madam President, I thank the Minister for his reply, but I should like to ask if any such measures will be included in future planning for development, job creation or mobility, which we are celebrating in 2006."
"Preparations should have been made in 2005."
". I fear I must simply reiterate the point that I made in my earlier answer that no proposals have been received by the Council from the Commission in relation to this matter."
"I would respectfully suggest that, if this is a matter which she feels is more appropriately directed towards the Presidency rather than the Commission, it might be a matter she would wish to raise with our successors, the Austrian Presidency."
"As the author of the question is not present, Question No 10 lapses."
"What is the Council's view of the situation in Macedonia and what are the next steps in the pre-accession process for this country?"
". On 9 November, the Commission presented its opinion on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and its application for European Union membership, and recommended that it be granted candidate country status."
"The European Council next week is likely to assess the opinion with a view to establishing the European Union’s position."
"The Commission’s opinion notes the important progress achieved by FYROM."
"Less than five years ago, the stability of FYROM was threatened by an internal conflict."
"Fortunately, the country is today engaged in a constructive drive for European Union membership."
"The Commission’s opinion notes that FYROM is now a functioning democracy, with stable institutions generally guaranteeing the rule of law."
"Important steps have been taken towards establishing a functioning market economy, and FYROM is likely to be able to take on most of the obligations of membership in the medium term, provided that considerable efforts are made in its alignment with the ."
"Although important progress has been made, it is clear that there are many areas where more and harder work is now needed: the effective implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement must continue, public administration and institutions should be strengthened, the rule of law has to improve, including through a determined fight against crime and corruption, and the economy needs to develop."
"The Council’s recommendation to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia at this stage is to stay focused on reforms and to implement fully all the measures identified in the new European partnership."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, I would like to ask you, by way of a supplementary question, what the European Union is doing in practical terms to address the youth unemployment and the sense of hopelessness among young people in Macedonia, and whether it is envisaged that the country will actually receive more substantial economic aid, since the very vague prospect of accession to the EU will do the country no good."
"Apart from that, what is the situation as regards the mobility of young people, specifically their opportunities for study and training in the European Union?"
". In the course of our Presidency, I myself have had the opportunity to travel to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and meet directly with the Deputy Prime Minister of that country."
"That meeting afforded me the opportunity to discuss with her the very ambitious plans she had for continued economic reform."
"I believe that the kind of economic reforms of which I spoke in my initial answer is the surest foundation on which to tackle the kind of youth unemployment of which the honourable Member speaks."
"In relation to the specific financial contribution that the European Union is making to that country for the year 2005, the European Union will provide EUR 34.5 million intended to support its European integration reform agenda, as well as an additional EUR 2.8 million for cross-border cooperation."
"Between 1992 and 2004 the European Union committed some EUR 736 million to the country."
"Question No 12 has been withdrawn by its author and will therefore not be taken."
"The Council has indicated that it would like to see the public sector play an exemplary role in energy end-use efficiency."
"Does the Council agree that the monthly movement of the European Parliament between Brussels and Strasbourg is an example of energy being used inefficiently by the public sector, and what steps does the Council propose to take to redress this situation, given that the Council alone has the power to decide where Parliament shall sit?"
". As the honourable Member will be aware, Article 289 of the EC Treaty provides that the seat of the institutions of the Community shall be determined by common accord of the governments of the Member States."
"In accordance with the Protocol (8) annexed to the EC Treaty, and I quote directly from it: ‘The European Parliament shall have its seat in Strasbourg where the twelve periods of monthly plenary sessions, including the budget session, shall be held’."
"The Council has not discussed the question of energy efficiency and the monthly movement of the European Parliament between Brussels and Strasbourg."
"Is this key issue not a sort of litmus test for the adaptability of the Union?"
"Energy saving was not an issue in Europe 50 years ago but it is now and the Council and Parliament agree on that."
"The public is entitled to some joined-up thinking."
"So, as you say, it is in the Treaty but it is up to Member State governments to change that."
"Therefore will the Council agree to include discussion on a single seat for the Parliament in the forthcoming Plan D post-Constitution debate?"
". Let me reply, firstly, by saying that the spirit of the honourable Member's question suggested that the process of Treaty change could be easy or quick."
"I have to say that one needs only to reflect – during this period of reflection – on the fate of the draft Constitutional Treaty in the hands of the voters of France and the Netherlands to call that assertion somewhat into question."
"I certainly take seriously the question of energy efficiency and there have been various steps taken by the European Union – commendably – in that regard."
"However, again, if this is a matter which is of concern to the honourable Member, I would suggest that, given the very heavy programme that we face in the next couple of days in relation to future financing, it might be an issue better directed towards our successors."
"It is not just a matter of energy efficiency, but of financial efficiency."
"The EUR 300 million a year spent on bringing Parliament here for part-sessions amounts to EUR 2 billion over a financial perspective."
"You mentioned the need to ratify any change to this system."
"Seeing that the own-resources decision is likely to need national ratification, could not a few extra clauses that would save the European taxpayer an enormous amount of money be added at the same time?"
". The honourable Member who raised this question is not the first colleague from the EPLP to do so."
"I perhaps have a clearer understanding of the potency of this issue for MEPs after taking up my responsibilities as Minister for Europe in the course of the Presidency and having seen for myself the challenges that all Members face in negotiating the journey between Brussels and Strasbourg on a monthly basis."
"I have to say, respectfully, however, that, given the sentiment within Parliament this morning about the urgent and pressing need to find agreement on future financing, I am not entirely convinced that raising this issue with our colleagues from Paris, at this particular stage, would be considered the most constructive contribution the British Presidency could make to finding agreement on future financing."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, can you confirm that, according to the Treaties, the European Parliament has one single seat?"
"The fact is that it is wrong to describe it as having two."
"That single seat is Strasbourg."
"We could well, without further ado, do away with the mini-plenaries in Brussels and would thereby save an enormous amount of energy, since we could, in the weeks left to us, stay at home and get the work out of the way on Fridays here in Strasbourg."
". I do not wish to intrude on what appears to be an interparliamentary debate now on the relative merits of Brussels and Strasbourg."
"Suffice to say, on the legal basis for the establishment of Parliament, I have nothing to add to my previous answer."
"Does the Council believe that the fact that the British Welfare State is almost 30% smaller (as a percentage of GDP) than its French and German equivalents explains why, in the UN’s ‘Human Poverty Index 2004' (dealing with issues such as health, education, standard of living and social exclusion), the UK comes off worse than its continental counterparts, and why its child poverty rate is 51% greater than Germany’s and over twice that of France?"
"Does it believe that the development of the European social model is best served by adopting the British approach in which, since the Labour Party's entry into power in 1997, inequality has risen, while it has fallen in France, Germany and Italy?"
"Given that the Nordic countries, which have a high level of social protection, also rank higher than other EU Member States in the Global Competitiveness Index, does the Council believe that the Lisbon Strategy would be better served by concentrating on social protection and social cohesion?"
". The Council is not in a position to comment on the ranking of the Member States in the United Nations Human Poverty Index 2004."
"The Joint Council-Commission report on social protection and social inclusion provides useful information on policies for combating poverty within Member States."
"There is no single European social model."
"Although we share a common and distinctly European commitment to social justice and, indeed, solidarity, there is enormous variety in national responses to welfare and social challenges within our Union."
"It is right that the different models should reflect the very different traditions and practices in individual Member States."
"Heads of State and Government agreed back in October in Hampton Court that, whilst the operation of their social systems was a matter for individual Member States, Europe needed economic reforms and social modernisation to safeguard its values and meet the challenges and opportunities of globalisation and demographic change."
"This agreement will build on the outcome of the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy agreed at the European Council in March, which set out a new strategic focus on jobs and on growth."
"The spring European Council specifically reaffirmed that strengthening social cohesion would remain a core objective of the Union and that modernising social protection and fostering social inclusion were key priorities."
"I suppose, very much like motherhood and apple pie, everybody in the European Union, the Member States, all the political groupings, rhetorically at least, share a commitment to social solidarity, social justice, social cohesion."
"However, I would put it to the Council that, particularly in the course of this Presidency, much of the credibility around that rhetoric has been undermined."
"I do not believe that there is a faith amongst people in the Member States that in fact what we rhetorically commit ourselves to we are prepared financially to commit ourselves to."
"Can I ask you to comment on a number of things, please: Firstly, on the issue of the budget and the financial perspectives, I am sure you have a view in terms of how this will be financed, and secondly to comment on measures such as the Services Directive ..."
". I shall endeavour to answer at least the first part of the honourable Member’s question."
"Firstly, if she is talking about solidarity, I recognise that is a concept that is of relevance to us, as is social justice, not simply within the borders of Member States or European Union, but far beyond the boundaries of the European Union."
"That is why it is a matter of immense pride to me that, in recent months, we have seen a commitment from European Development Ministers, and then a decision endorsed by European Finance Ministers, to effectively double the level of European overseas development assistance, from USD 40 billion to USD 80 billion."
"I make no apology, therefore, and in no way resile from the fact that every Member in this House should feel huge pride in this matter as we seek to meet our obligations towards the world’s poorest people."
"In relation to the honourable Member’s specific question in relation to the Services Directive, the charge is often levelled at the British Presidency that an element hostile to the founding principles of the European Union is present in Britain’s national approach towards this Union."
"I believe in completing the single market and I believe the services directive, given the original terms of the Treaty of Rome, has a contribution to make towards finishing and completing that single market."
"However, we must recognise that the market has to be balanced by the kind of social funding which has been provided historically within this Union."
"That is why, on the second point raised in relation to the coming financial prospective, I want to see the position articulated by the British Presidency this afternoon, the second negotiating box, form the basis on which agreement can be reached."
"The sums of money in question are considerable and will provide the basis on which not just the new accession countries but all countries can strengthen their economies and thereby strengthen their capability to secure the very solidarity and social justice so often discussed in this Parliament."
"Which social model is chosen has an incredible effect on equality."
"Recent studies I have examined show that the model of society that best favours equality is that involving a public welfare system and relatively high taxes etc."
"My question is: does the Council share my view of this model’s importance for equality, linked as it is to a commonly and publicly funded welfare state?"
". There is an important gender perspective towards the policies that we should advocate for our welfare states, but it is right to recognise that there is, as I said in my introductory remarks to this question, a diversity of social models within Europe."
"It is a matter of profound concern to me that 20 million fellow European citizens are out of work."
"Upholding the European social model, as is often suggested, is of little comfort to those 20 million citizens."
"The necessary practical steps must be taken to secure the economic reforms that will create the prosperity to provide further opportunity for those individuals."
"The core insight that the surest means to tackle poverty is to provide somebody with a job – one of my main political convictions – must also be recognised."
"May I say again that I welcome your remarks about there being no such thing as a single European social model."
"I believe that is absolutely right, but could you confirm to me and colleagues whether, in making that remark, you feel that you are just saying that on behalf of the Presidency, or are you speaking on behalf of the Council as a whole?"
". I am reflecting both the spirit and the outcome of the discussion at Hampton Court of which I spoke earlier."
"There was a clear recognition both of the challenges that Europe faces in the face of globalisation and that different courses have been set, in the face of those challenges, by individual Member States."
"Bearing in mind the delay in the process of ratifying the European Constitution, Article 167 of which provides for a special status for the outermost regions in the context of state aid, is the Council planning to adopt transitional measures to guarantee this special treatment in the light of the distance separating these regions from the geographical nucleus of the internal market and other factors which place them at a disadvantage?"
". Any amendment of the Treaties on which the Union is founded can enter into force only after being ratified by all Member States."
"Under the current Treaty, the Council can already adopt specific measures aimed at the outermost regions."
"This includes common policies."
"The regional state aid guidelines, which are currently being revised, already make special provision for the outermost regions."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his comment on the planned new guidelines in the field of State aid for the outermost regions, but it is the case that treaties signed but not ratified have certain legal consequences in international law."
"Specifically, in my region, the Canary Islands, the European Constitution was approved with 90% of the vote."
"As things stand, more than half of the European population has approved the ratification of this Constitutional Treaty and my impression is that this ratification is not irrelevant in terms of European law."
". I stand by the answer I have just given in terms of European law."
"In relation to the Canaries in particular, however, Parliament should be aware that the NUTS level 2 region of the Canaries will benefit from an additional envelope of EUR 100 million over the 2007-2013 period under the envisaged proposals."
"Madam President, I would like the President-in-Office of the Council to tell us how it is envisaged that such provision can be made for our outermost regions, which are to be found in both the South and the North, in the absence of any budget framework for all these measures."
". I hope that we are able to secure that budget framework."
"The important first step is to secure the agreement at the European Council on the future financial perspective and I assure the honourable Member that we will be giving it our very best endeavours in the hours and days ahead."
"Can the Council give its view on the recent disturbances in France and indicate whether there are any lessons to be learned for wider integration and equality issues across the EU?"
"Will the Council, for example, give its view on the sharing of best practice on integration policy, using devices such as the open method of coordination, or does it believe that there is a need for further EU proposals?"
". It would not be appropriate for the Council to comment on the specific recent events in France, but while Member States are and remain primarily responsible for the adoption and implementation of their national integration policies, the Council seeks to provide support to them, in particular by promoting the exchange of experience and best practice."
"The Hague Programme for strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union, approved by the European Council in November 2004, has invited Member States, the Council and the Commission to promote the structural exchange of experience and information on integration, supported by the development of a widely accessible website on the internet."
"In December, ministers agreed on the need to reinforce cooperation on integration, in particular via the network of national contact points on integration."
"This commitment built on the Commission communication: A common agenda for integration of third-country nationals in the European Union."
"This integration network, established in 2003 and supported by the Commission, has played an important role in the framework of the exchange of information and best practice and has provided very valuable contributions in the drafting of the ‘Handbook on integration for policy-makers and practitioners’, published by the Commission in 2004."
"An expanded handbook is due to be published next year."
"I should like to ask the President-in-Office to continue the good work done during the UK Presidency of looking at the best possible models of diversity and of best practice and integration."
"It is valuable work, which we must keep up in the coming months."
"It is a very serious issue for EU Member States, in particular EU cities."
"As this is your last Council Question Time, let me take this opportunity to say what many Members across this House have said to me: that you have answered criticism with good grace and you and your civil service team sitting behind you will leave this Presidency with a reputation for listening to Members and making every effort to answer their questions."
". I am almost speechless, given the level of criticism usually directed towards me, that such a generous compliment has been paid, albeit in the final hours of my appearance before Parliament."
"Let me return the compliment by saying that I know that the honourable Member has a strong reputation in the United Kingdom for his committed work on diversity over many years."
"It was therefore no surprise to me to see that he had tabled such a question before this Chamber today."
"I can certainly give him the assurance he seeks: we will continue to work hard to share the best practice, as I described, to ensure that there is effective cooperation on this issue of diversity, both in the remaining period of the British Presidency and well beyond that in the years to come."
"There has been a great deal of debate about the Doha round of negotiations at the WTO, most of which has focussed on the concessions that will be required from all partners, with particular regard to the EU's agricultural market, in order to bring this round of negotiations to a successful conclusion."
"I do not believe that enough detail has been provided about the benefits that an agreement will have for Europe's Member States and its citizens."
"Could the Council give its considered opinion on the specific benefits that an agreement at the Doha round of negotiations would bring for the EU's economy and its citizens? If no deal is done, what will be the consequences?"
". The Council has on several occasions noted the possible benefits of an agreement on further changes in the World Trade Organization’s outcomes during negotiations in the framework of the Doha Development Agenda within the WTO."
"The Council has expressed support for future comprehensive multilateral negotiations, which reflects its wish for substantial progress in world trade liberalisation, securing continuing global economic growth, increased job creation, prosperity and sustainable development, and addressing the concerns of civil society."
"The Council has noted that a further multilateral change of trade was the best way to meet the challenges posed by economic and technological change and increasing globalisation."
"The Council sees this multilateral change as the most appropriate approach for achieving substantial and balanced results for the benefit of all WTO members."
"A number of studies have tried to assess the magnitude of the benefits for the European Union."
"For example, a widely-cited World Bank study in 2005 estimates that the potential gains from full liberalisation of global merchandise trade would be around USD 65 billion for the EU-25 and the EFTA countries by 2015."
"The Council has not explicitly commented on the consequences ‘if no deal is done’."
"The ramifications of a failed round go much wider than trade."
"It would send a negative message about multilateral cooperation."
"On the contrary, a good trade deal is an important part of our efforts to tackle poverty and promote global security in the long term, which have been such a focus of our work in the course of our Presidency."
"As it is Christmas, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his handling of Question Time and his wit."
"Very often a laugh is no harm in this Chamber, and you have given us a few this evening."
"Well done!"
"If we had the chirpiness of your voice in airports when they called for the last passengers to board, I would be grateful!"
"With regard to the WTO, could you comment on the difference between free trade and fair trade?"
"There is a world of a difference."
"We need to be honest in terms of what we are looking for."
"When you talk about the benefits, we need to know how they are distributed."
"Who gains?"
"Because not everyone gains equally."
". I am increasingly humbled by the compliments that are being paid to me."
"I now see a whole new employment possibility opening up before me."
"If we fail to reach agreement at the European Council this weekend, you will be able to enjoy my dulcet tones at Brussels airport in the future, announcing flights departing for Dublin and for Edinburgh."
"I sincerely hope that does not turn out to be the outcome of the European Council this weekend."
"I am not sure if my observations were always intentionally humorous, but I shall take the compliment in the spirit in which it was intended in this holiday season."
"On the serious and substantive point that the honourable lady raises with me, I can assure you this has been a matter that we have given much thought to in the course of our Presidency, both as a result of the extraordinary meeting of the General Affairs Council that took place to discuss the terms of the mandate for Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson, in light of the fact that, from the government that presently holds the Presidency, not only Margaret Beckett but also Hilary Benn and Alan Johnson are presently in Hong Kong doing what they can to sustain our case that the best outcome in Hong Kong would be a balanced and ambitious outcome which would allow a successful conclusion of the round."
"However, that raises exactly the point that the honourable Member addressed: what is a balanced and ambitious outcome for the Hong Kong talks and, indeed, for the Doha development round in general?"
"I have always been clear that there is and should be no contradiction between an agenda which is pro-jobs in the European Union and pro-poor in the world."
"One need only consider the potential gains for the developing world from a successful outcome to the Hong Kong meeting and indeed the Doha round to be encouraged to take whatever steps are necessary to see the progress that would not only be in the interests of this Union, but in the interests of the broader cause of proving that globalisation can work, not simply for a minority of the world’s citizens but, if the right public policy choices are made, in the interests of the poorest people and well as the rich people in this world today."
"The standards of care of children and the disabled in Romania undoubtedly constitute a human rights issue, and the Union has a basic obligation to ensure the well-being of these future citizens of the EU."
"There have been improvements in this area, which I welcome, but more needs to be done."
"The 2005 Comprehensive Monitoring Report for Romania welcomes the new legislation on children's rights and adoption, which came into force in January 2005."
"However, the Monitoring Report goes on to state that, three years on from the adoption of the Law on Mental Health and Protection of People with Psychological Disorders, persons with a mental disability in Romania still suffer from overcrowding, ill-treatment and violence."
"What is the Council's opinion on this situation, in particular as the law on the mentally disabled actually pre-dates the recent law on child protection?"
". The Council is aware of Parliament’s long-standing interest in this issue and has already had the opportunity to reply to several questions from Parliament on these matters."
"This was a subject that featured prominently in the debate we have just concluded on the potential accession of Bulgaria and Romania."
"Parliament has consistently stressed the great importance that it attaches to the issue of care of children, the disabled and the mentally ill in Romania."
"The Union’s clear position that Romania, as a future member of the European Union, must comply with high standards in these areas, has been expressed throughout Romania’s accession process."
"The Union’s views were reiterated during the latest meeting with the European Union-Romania Association Council on 14 June 2005."
"The Commission’s 2005 comprehensive monitoring report on Romania, to which the honourable Member refers, is still being examined by the Council."
"The Council’s general opinion, however, remains clear on these issues."
"These are priority areas, in which remaining shortcomings must be adequately addressed as soon as possible."
"The progress already made needs to be followed by further implementation, further improvements and the allocation of both adequate funding and staffing levels."
"This applies to all areas of care, but is particularly important with regard to the situation for the disabled and the mentally ill."
"The Council will closely follow and evaluate future developments and continue to raise these concerns directly with Romania."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his reply."
"The EU monitoring and advocacy programme of the Open Society Institute has stated that there is a total absence of reliable, comprehensive data on mentally disabled persons in Romania, which has contributed to a general lack of public attention to people with intellectual disabilities."
"From the Minister’s reply, I take it that assistance in this area would be an immediate priority as part of the EU’s monitoring of issues in relation to persons with mental disabilities in Romania."
"I should like to ask the Minister, in the spirit of Christmas, by wishing him well, if he does get that job at the airport, could he do something about direct flights to Strasbourg?"
". Firstly, in relation to his final remark, I have even more sympathy with him on exactly that point than I did at the beginning of the UK Presidency."
"If I do not manage a job in Brussels airport, perhaps I will manage one in Frankfurt airport, to where I often have to travel, given the length of the questions I face here in this Chamber."
"In relation to the substantive point that he raises, however, this matter was addressed directly in the Commission monitoring report to which I referred."
"Romania has started to develop a strategy to close large residential institutions for the disabled and replace them with alternative Community-based services in smaller residential units."
"A public campaign is also under way to raise awareness of disabled rights, I hope addressing some of the points that the honourable Member raises."
"However, clearly, as he suggests, more work is needed."
"But the new policies, I have to say, are encouraging."
"Psychiatric care requires more immediate attention: living conditions for patients are poor and budgetary resources, as was implied, are limited."
"The 2002 Law on Mental Health and Protection of People with Psychological Disorders is still not being implemented."
"The government has begun to tackle this issue and we want to see this work stepped up."
"This is a very serious issue."
"I have recently been to Romania and visited some of the institutions we have discussed."
"The conditions are deplorable from a health and safety point of view, if nothing else."
"I ask you to do whatever you can, in your last days in office, to ensure that this issue is given a higher priority in the progress towards accession."
". The comments that have been put to me today are communicated, in turn, to the European Commission, in view of their ongoing monitoring role in this accession process, and given the strength of feeling being communicated in the Chamber this evening."
"Council Regulation (EC) No 27/2005 of 22 December 2004(1) concerning the size of fishery quotas in the Baltic and elsewhere includes provisions on sharing of quotas and closed seasons."
"These quotas are valid for each calendar year and are therefore negotiated on an annual basis."
"Given the lack of specific information on negotiations in the Council on these matters and in view of the approaching deadline for the final decisions, will the Council say what progress has been made in this area, particularly as regards changes in fishery quotas for 2006 compared to the current year?"
". Fisheries quotas for the Baltic Sea for 2006 were jointly agreed by the European Community and Russia in September on the basis of scientific advice produced by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea in May."
"The relevant details are set out in the Commission’s proposals to put such quotas into Community law."
"This should be adopted at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 20 and 21 December 2005."
"Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Alexander for his answer."
"I would have preferred, however, to receive a clearer response to the substance of my question, which related to the rules governing the sharing of quotas and closed seasons."
"It is high time that the annual negotiations in this field were based on objective and convincing findings."
"I do not believe that the advice to which Mr Alexander referred meets these criteria."
"As we are all aware, the scope of research into fish stocks in the Baltic has so far been limited by an inadequate number of fishing surveys, and by what essentially amounts to a lack of consensus on the methodological basis for biomass assessments."
"When Mr Alexander grows weary of airports, I should like to invite him to the Baltic."
"We would be delighted to welcome him there."
". The Council will meet on 20 and 21 December to agree next year’s fishing deal for European Union waters."
"I referred the honourable Member to the relevant details that have been set out in the Commission’s proposals and, for his assistance, I would recommend document COM(2005)0598, which sets out the relevant details for the Commission’s proposals to put such quotas into Community law."
"It may also be of assistance to the honourable Member to be aware that there will be two separate regulations, one for the north-east Atlantic, but one, which I judge to be his primary interest, for the Baltic, in particular."
"Children are European citizens and have the same right as adults to be spared violence."
"If they are nonetheless exposed to it, there must be legislation to protect them."
"However, progress on the adoption of legislation banning corporal punishment of children in EU Member States is slow."
"17 Member States have no such legislation."
"What measures will be taken within the EU to ensure that children enjoy the same rights throughout the EU?"
". There is at present no proposal before the Council to establish a European Union ban on corporal punishment of children in European Union Member States."
"The Council does not have information on, nor does it deem it appropriate to comment on the state of the domestic legislation of Member States in this regard."
"– Thank you for that very succinct answer."
"We do have a community of values in the EU."
"I wonder if it is conceivable that, just as they have done regarding the social situation in France, the EU countries, headed by the Council, might alter their practice so that children are not exposed to violence in the home or at school in our democratic European countries."
". I would reiterate that the Council does not deem it appropriate to comment on the state of domestic legislation of individual Member States, but I would certainly recognise that the use of corporal punishment in individual Member States and the rights of children are not within the competence of the European Union, which explains the brevity of my response."
"Madam President, unfortunately I have to say that I did not find Mr Alexander’s response very convincing."
"The Council has done very little to encourage the EU Member States to ratify the Hague Convention on parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children, which regulates such issues."
"We are all aware that only six Member States have ratified this Convention."
"The other Member States have not yet done so, which means that such forms of punishment can still be used."
"I should like to ask what action the Council has taken in this respect."
". In relation to this question, I would suggest that this is not a matter for the Presidency."
"Member States are signatories to conventions individually, rather than collectively."
"I would, however, refute the allegation that no action has been taken on the general issue of child welfare."
"Over the past few years, the European Union institutions, working with Member States, have made significant progress on children’s rights."
"The European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights (2000) explicitly recognises the rights of children as fundamental to European values."
"Article 24 of the Charter is based on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), which has been ratified by all Member States of the European Union."
"Madam President, I too am not satisfied with the answer given by the President-in-Office, on the grounds that, even if the Presidency of the Council has not given priority to this issue during its term in office, I do believe – as probably everyone here in this House does – that we, in the European Union, live in a community founded upon values, and that violence aimed at children, which includes corporal punishment, really is a crime committed against them."
"I ask emphatically that there should in future be action on this front with the support of the Member States."
". Nobody is denying that there can be a community of values."
"What, I sense, is an issue between me and the honourable Member is whether there is a legal basis for the Council to take action in this regard."
"In that sense, I would simply reiterate the points that I have made previously, that I judge this not to be a matter for the Presidency."
"Member States are signatories to conventions individually, rather than collectively."
"As the author is not present, Question 21 lapses."
"When will the period of reflection, introduced following the results of the referenda in Holland and France, come to an end?"
"Is the Council now prepared to consider proposals for reform which happen to be included within the EU Constitutional Treaty?"
". Given that the period of reflection will itself extend beyond the British Presidency, it somehow seems fitting that the final question that I answer in this Parliament, as the representative of the British Presidency, anticipates what will be an important subject in the months to come."
"Perhaps with your indulgence, Madam President, I could also take this opportunity – given that you have intimated that this is the final question to be answered – to thank all the members of the Council secretariat for their very considerable hard work in producing the draft replies in the course of our Presidency to the questions that have been raised by Members of this Parliament."
"Rather like an author in the foreword to a book, I would, at this point, respectfully say that all the mistakes are entirely my own, and I am sure all the factual accuracy is reflective of the considerable expertise of the Council secretariat."
"To address myself directly to the honourable Member’s question, as he is aware, Heads of State and Government agreed on 17 June that there was a need for a period of reflection to enable a broad debate to take place within each Member State."
"Provisions for reform within the Constitutional Treaty – and I have certainly experienced this in the course of our Presidency – may be sensible to one Member State but controversial to another."
"Therefore, the focus of the United Kingdom Presidency has been to engage consciously in a wider debate about the future of Europe."
"It was agreed to come back to the matter in the first half of 2006, in the Spring Council of the Austrian Presidency, to make an overall assessment of the national debates and agree on how to proceed at that stage."
"If you indulge me, may I take the opportunity to thank the representatives of the Presidency for all the help and assistance they have given my colleagues over the recent months."
"May I thank the President-in-Office in particular;"
"I have much enjoyed these exchanges over the recent weeks, taking place in a rather empty public library though, sometimes it may seem."
"I welcome the opportunity to come back to an oft-repeated subject."
"Every head of government has publicly supported the principle that the Council should meet in public when it is debating legislative acts."
"If the fine words and good intentions of the President-in-Office could deliver firm results, the Council would have ensured that changes in its Rules of Procedure were now on the way to being put into practice."
"Instead we have the suggestion that the Council will review the functioning of these measures in future presidencies and examine how further to increase openness and transparency, including the possibility of amending the Rules of Procedure."
"Will the President-in-Office say where the substance is in this proposal?"
". Let me seek to answer the honourable Member’s question directly."
"Firstly, we will both recall the terms of the statement made by our Prime Minister before this Assembly at the outset of the British Presidency and that has informed the approach that I have taken to this issue of transparency in the Council."
"It explained the basis on which I first sought the agreement of colleagues within the United Kingdom Government and the process on that basis that we then took forward with other countries in the course of our Presidency."
"The Presidency tabled an options paper on improving Council transparency in November 2005."
"The proposals have been discussed by the Antici Group and by both Coreper I and II, and we now aim to agree Council conclusions on 20 December."
"The honourable Member will have to wait a little longer before, I hope, we secure the kind of agreement that will give him the satisfaction he seeks this evening."
"On the wider package of the Constitutional Treaty as a whole, does the President-in-Office of the Council accept that the European Council was right, in the light of the fact that a majority of Member States have actually ratified this Constitutional Treaty?"
"It was right not to declare the text dead, but to inaugurate a period of reflection – one which has been much more about the context than about the text."
"Does he agree that in due course, once we are in a new context, we will have to return to the question of the text and what to do about it, if not in 2006, then in 2007?"
". I find myself in agreement and sympathy with the point the honourable Member makes."
"The British Government, even before assuming the office of the Presidency of the European Union, argued for the need for a period of reflection."
"We did not feel it was appropriate for any one government to make a unilateral declaration as to the status of the draft Constitutional Treaty, given the fact that the Constitutional Treaty was owned by the totality of the members of the European Union."
"It is right to recognise that, even before the decisive votes in France and the Netherlands, there had been, in the case of Spain, a referendum which had found in favour of the draft Constitutional Treaty and a whole range of other countries had in turn ratified the draft Constitutional Treaty by parliamentary procedure."
"That is why I hold to the position that was first articulated immediately prior to the British Presidency."
"During our Presidency we have maintained that position."
"In the course of that Presidency our Prime Minister has made clear his personal judgement that he believes it is necessary to get the politics in a better place before returning to the institutional question."
"But in the course of this Presidency we have also made it clear that we regard it as necessary to have the kind of practical, sensible reforms that will allow a Union of 25 to operate more effectively than on the basis of the present Treaty arrangements."
"If I could join with other colleagues from the United Kingdom to thank you for your efforts over the last six months and also say that, in connection with the Constitution, we were delighted that there were two ‘no’ votes in Holland and France and we will not – unexpectedly to you – be demanding a referendum in the United Kingdom if any part of the Constitution is proposed for bringing forward in future."
". I am deeply conscious of my responsibilities, not least in my final answer, to seek to answer on behalf of the Presidency and not simply indulge in what would be a fascinating debate with a domestic political opponent in relation to their present position, not only in terms of where they sit within this Chamber but where they sit on the issue of the draft Constitutional Treaty."
"The statement I have just heard is clearly in contradiction to at least some of the assertions that have come from other Conservative colleagues in relation to some of the practical and sensible changes of which I have just spoken."
"However, I have a clear feeling that there are much bigger issues at stake for the modern Conservative Party in terms of its engagement with Europe than even the answer we have just heard."
"I wondered whether the Minister would like to make any comment on the possibility of British Conservative MEPs sitting on the same bench as Mrs Mussolini?"
"If I can manage just under the wire before the conclusion, let me simply say this. Kenneth Clarke is a serious figure within the United Kingdom, a figure well known to this Chamber."
"He has described the modern British Conservative Party under its new leader as being faced with a proposal – and I quote directly – that is ‘head-banging’ in its extremism."
"He has said that the modern Conservative Party is more extreme than the Conservative Party under William Hague or indeed Iain Duncan Smith."
"It is up to the honourable Members on the Conservative benches in this Chamber to decide whether to marginalise themselves further, not simply within the United Kingdom, but also within the European Union."
"I have already paid generous tribute to the work of one of the British Conservatives in this Chamber today, who through his role as a rapporteur in relation to the accession of one of the potential candidate countries of the European Union, has undertaken important work on behalf of this Parliament."
"The marginalisation of what was once a great political party, as envisaged by its new leader, would be a diminution not simply of the Conservative Party but of Britain’s national interest."
"But ultimately it is not the only misjudgement they will make."
"I fear it will be the first of many by the new Conservative leader."
"Question 23 lapses on the grounds that it relates to a problem that we have discussed this afternoon."
"Since the period of time allotted to questions has expired, Questions 24 to 54 will be answered in writing (for questions not taken see the ‘Question Time’ annex)."
"Perhaps I might be permitted to close with a personal comment."
"Mr Alexander, you have discovered today that you get not only criticism from this House, but also praise for the work you do."
"I wish you a successful career in office, a relaxing holiday, and thank you for your cooperation."
"Question Time is closed."
"– The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0338/2005), on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on machinery, and amending Directive 95/16/EC [5786/2/2005 – C6-0267/2005 – 2001/0004(COD)] (rapporteur: Andreas Schwab)."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before turning to the Machinery Directive itself, I should like to start by extending very warm thanks to all those involved in this process, and especially to the shadow rapporteurs of the various other groups."
"They were prepared to make many compromises, and I am particularly grateful to them for that fact."
"I should also like to thank the Commissioner responsible, who is present in the Chamber today, for his willingness to compromise on many points of detail that were of crucial significance for Parliament. This will make it a great deal easier for Members to vote in favour of a slightly amended version of the Common Position."
"I should like to address five issues that we regard as being of paramount importance."
"The directive – which, it must be admitted in a spirit of self-criticism, is not immediately comprehensible to the general public – was aimed at establishing a clearer distinction between this and other directives."
"One problem has arisen in this regard, however, namely the Tractor Directive."
"Whereas tractors did not previously fall under the scope of the Machinery Directive as well as that of the Tractor Directive, they are now covered by both."
"This is a heavy double burden to impose on manufacturers, and one that we would have liked to avoid."
"The Tractor Seats Directive is of course a further issue, and Mr Verheugen cannot have failed to notice the reports in German newspapers claiming that this Directive is regarded, both in Germany and elsewhere, as nothing less than a bureaucratic monstrosity."
"It is for this reason that I am extremely grateful to him for working together with us towards our goal, even though the work is perhaps not progressing quite as quickly as we might all have liked. This goal is to achieve a solution whereby machinery falls under the scope of only one directive, or in other words whereby the Tractor Directive applies only to tractors, and the Machinery Directive applies to all other types of machinery."
"Our task now is to ensure that we achieve this goal as soon as possible."
"My wish would of course be for the revision of the Tractor Directive, and the incorporation of all the risks not yet addressed, to be completed within the 18 months that the Member States will need to implement the Machinery Directive."
"I am aware that such wishes cannot always be granted immediately, but I should like to set a goal of 18 months, which would take us up to the deadline for implementation."
"It goes without saying that I would have liked to make more headway on certain issues in my capacity as rapporteur."
"An example of one such issue is the granting of exemptions for harmless types of machinery such as wristwatches."
"In the end, however, I withdrew my amendment to this effect in response to the serious concerns, most of which were voiced by the Commission, over the safety loopholes that could arise as a result."
"At the same time, however, Parliament has made a considerable step forward from the original Common Position as far as the confidentiality of trade secrets is concerned, and in my opinion the same also applies to the scrapping of machinery."
"We are of course all aware that sustainable production is crucially important for Europe, with a view to meeting the Lisbon goals, but there can be no question that we were right to avoid making manufacturers responsible across the board, as it were, for the scrapping of machinery, since it is genuinely impossible for them to know all the details of the scrapping process in advance."
"Furthermore, these manufacturers are often small and medium-sized enterprises. It is also my belief that we still have more work to do together on the matter of certification, and especially third-party certification, since the position outlined in the Common Position with regard to the CE marking was in no way acceptable for the Members of this House."
"Regardless of the number of meetings that were needed to draft this Common Position, in our opinion it is not enough for the Council to cater to the lowest common denominator, and to put forward formal compromises worded in such a way that it is hard for anyone to understand them, let alone a member of the public or an SME owner."
"Needless to say, we too are aware of the difficulties faced in this respect, for example with regard to translation."
"In spite of this, however, our goal must be to draft legislative texts that the general public can understand, and indeed this is a cause that Mr Verheugen has made his own."
"I am delighted that we have taken a small step forward on the issue of the CE marking."
"Although in my opinion we still need to do more, you did in fact make express reference to the ‘new approach’ to the CE marking in your 2006 work programme, so I do not want to spend too much time complaining about it now."
"I believe that the time has now come to take a broader and more coherent approach and to ensure that the regulations governing the use of the CE marking are the same in all sectors. Not only would this be advantageous in itself, but in my opinion it would also fall under the heading of better regulation."
"Nevertheless, when drafting this legislation we must once again give serious thought to the role of the CE marking in the European Union, to the quality and safety standards that we associate with it and to the bodies that are responsible for monitoring these standards. The reason I say this is because I believe that we still have work ahead of us in the Member States in terms of explaining and debating the issue of market surveillance."
"It must not be the case that the European Union is made responsible for any problems that arise, even when the Member States have shirked their duties with regard to the time spent on surveillance."
"All in all, I should like to reiterate my warm thanks."
"I believe that we have made a certain amount of progress in terms of achieving better regulation and reducing red tape, but that much remains for us to do."
"In this connection, I am counting on the Commission to make good headway with new proposals, in particular on the subject of tractors, in order to bring us closer to our goal of better regulation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, and the shadow rapporteurs for their commitment and their constructive cooperation, without which an agreement would not have been reached at second reading."
"The situation in which we find ourselves today could be aptly summed up by the famous proverb, ‘good things come to those who wait’."
"The history of the revision of the Machinery Directive is a very long one."
"It originally began with a recommendation by the ‘Molitor group’, which was a forerunner of the present Commission’s ‘better regulation’ initiative."
"When the Commission presented its proposal for a directive in early 2001, following lengthy discussions with all those involved, no one expected that it would take five years and a record-breaking 43 Council working group meetings to complete this revision, to say nothing of Parliament’s work."
"The length of these discussions was due to the considerable size and complexity of the sector affected by the directive, by which I mean the mechanical engineering sector, which covers a very diverse range of products, including machinery, mechanical appliances and their components."
"At the same time, however, it is also a sector that is of crucial importance to the EU economy, and one of the best-performing industrial sectors."
"In 2004, the mechanical engineering sector in the European Union produced goods worth EUR 402 billion and employed over 2.6 million engineers, technicians and other workers, most of whom were highly qualified."
"Mechanical engineering production in the EU exceeds that in Japan and the USA by a long way."
"The European Union is the world’s largest exporter of machinery and mechanical appliances with exports worth EUR 150 billion, which puts us ahead of the USA with EUR 62 billion and Japan with EUR 67 billion."
"This is proof that we are dealing with a sector which can rightly be called a jewel of European industry, and which therefore really does merit particular attention."
"Now that we have a recommendation concerning amendments to the Common Position, we are very close to completing the legislative process involved in drafting a new Machinery Directive."
"I am delighted to be able to tell you that the Commission can accept in full the compromise reached by Parliament and the Council."
"In actual fact, the outcome of this compromise represents a significant improvement over the Machinery Directive 98/37/EC that is currently in force, and, as Mr Schwab has already mentioned, it is an excellent example of better regulation."
"The scope has now been defined in more detail and ambiguities ironed out, which means that legal certainty has been improved."
"The Directive had previously been given a number of different interpretations, which will no longer be the case."
"A much clearer distinction has been made between this and other directives, such as the Lift Directive or the Low Voltage Directive."
"Implementation of the Directive, including market surveillance and the monitoring of bodies charged with the task of certification by the Member States and notified to the Commission as such, has been made more efficient as a result of Parliament’s far-reaching amendments at first reading."
"The manufacturers of certain types of machinery which the scope of the Directive has been extended to cover will now also reap the benefits of the internal market."
"Users and workers will benefit from improved health protection and consumer protection, with such improvements having been made on the basis of our experience with the present Directive."
"Turning to the highly contentious matter of the relation in which other markings stand to the CE marking, I should like to confirm that this issue will be resolved in the course of the revision of the ‘new approach’, as stated in the following Commission declaration."
"I shall read out the Commission’s formal declaration once again:"
"‘Without prejudice to respect for Community legislation, the Commission, within the context of the revision of the new approach planned for mid-2006, will clarify the conditions for the affixing of other markings, whether national, European or private, in relation to the CE marking.’"
"As far as the equally contentious issue of tractors is concerned, I should like to make it known that the Commission is absolutely committed to the principles set out in the two declarations, which I should also like to read out again."
"The first declaration reads:"
"‘Parliament, the Council and the Commission declare that, in order to cover all aspects related to the health and safety of agricultural and forestry tractors in one harmonising directive, Directive 2003/37/EC on type-approval of agricultural and forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units needs to be modified so as to address all the relevant risks of the Machinery Directive."
"Such a modification of Directive 2003/37/EC should include an amendment of the Machinery Directive, in order to delete the expression ‘for the risks’ in Article 1(2)(e), first indent.’"
"The second declaration is as follows: ‘The Commission recognises the need to include in the Agricultural and Forestry Tractors Directives further requirements for risks not yet covered by those directives."
"To that end, the Commission is considering appropriate measures that include references to the United Nations regulations, CN and ISO standards, and OECD codes.’"
"I hope that that answers any remaining questions to everyone’s satisfaction."
"I should like to reiterate my thanks for the genuinely positive and constructive cooperation afforded by the House, and also to thank you for your attention."
". Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Schwab, on the excellent job he has done on a very complex and difficult text, made more difficult because he took it over from our previous rapporteur and colleague, Mr Wieland."
"I am very pleased with what the Commissioner said and with the agreement that we have reached to secure a second reading confirmation with the Council."
"I would like to pick up one or two of the policy issues."
"As the Commissioner indicated, it has been a long and sometimes bumpy road towards the final agreement on this very complex text."
"Looking forward, and in the light of his determined commitment to the better regulation agenda, we need to keep a close eye on the implementation and effectiveness of this directive."
"I fear that it may be extremely costly to implement and we need to make sure that his services are keeping an eye on it and that it is not being duplicated by the national regulation."
"I welcome what he said about different marks, but we need to give serious consideration to the cost of regulatory compliance."
"In that connection, I want to make two other points."
"I am pleased that the Council has recognised that it has to speed through the issue of tractors, because the lack of a harmonised type-approval process for a very important sector is scandalous, and Member States should be ashamed of their foot-dragging on this."
"I want to draw his attention to another crucial machinery category, which is also partly affected by this directive, which is the whole issue about road-going machinery."
"I recently went to a conference of construction equipment manufacturers."
"They told me that, on their estimates, 70% of their research and development costs are absorbed by complying with regulation."
"How can we run a competitive European economy when we saddle a major industry with those sorts of compliance costs?"
"I think we may have problems with this machinery directive, but the Commissioner must address that."
"I want to bring a delegation from the construction equipment manufacturers to see him as soon as possible to address their issues as well."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no question that 18 months is a long time for a debate to go on within the Council."
"Yet this is no time at all in comparison to the service lives of machinery."
"Speaking as someone who has worked in the field of mechanical engineering for 20 years, I am of course aware of the significance of this directive, in terms of making legislation more consistent."
"Although many users were initially sceptical, it is my belief that more or less all doubts have now been dispelled."
"The first letters have arrived from people expressing their approval, and since our aim is to focus on the user and not to ignore public opinion, this approval is important."
"This directive is not only important for users, however, but also for millions of consumers, since it contains legal provisions that are of crucial significance for their health and safety."
"As the Commissioner said, one of the reasons why this revision was necessary was because earlier directives did not go far enough. Further reasons included the need to improve the necessary legal certainty, to define the scope in more detail and to safeguard the free movement of goods at the same time as ensuring a high level of health and safety protection for consumers."
"This should also be a priority goal for European industrial policy."
"I should like to thank the Members of this House and, above all, the Commission and the Council for their excellent cooperation."
"It was nonetheless necessary for the Social Democrats to incorporate a number of key considerations, and indeed this meant that we had more in common with the Council during most of the rounds of discussion."
"For example, we want the Commission to develop guidelines to help the Member States to increase their capacities. This would enable effective market surveillance with a view to the uniform application of the directive."
"At the same time, however, the Social Democrats also believed that confidentiality and trade secrets must not have a negative impact on personal health and safety."
"Another of our goals, and one which we have now achieved, was to lighten the burden on SMEs, without affecting the substance of the Directive or imposing additional costs."
"A further important aim for us was to ensure that the standards for disabled people using lifts were not compromised as a result of the revision of the Directive."
"We have achieved all these goals."
"We were opposed to agricultural and forestry tractors not being included, but we accept the Commissioner’s explanation."
"We would have preferred him to set a date, and to set a date of 2008, but since we will all still be Members of this Parliament at that point we will be able to ensure that the necessary steps are taken."
"We do not want to exclude small appliances, Mr Schwab, because it is not just wristwatches that we are talking about, but fire extinguishers and similar small appliances that are relatively dangerous."
"Nevertheless, I believe that we have achieved a good compromise."
"The Social Democrats will vote in favour of it, and for once this week I should like to praise the British – and such praise is not something that can be taken for granted – since our cooperation with the British Presidency on this matter has also been excellent."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on machinery we are looking at today revises a directive, as you said, dating from 1998."
"It is a highly technical subject, but it will have a major impact on the European engineering industry and on the European economy as a whole."
"I would like to remind you of the figures that Mr Verheugen has already quoted, which, in fact, are even better than the ones I had."
"I cannot resist reminding you that the annual turnover in the sector is EUR 402 billion, of which EUR 113 billion a year comes from exports to third countries."
"The first reading reflected a reasonable compromise reached after years of debates."
"I well remember that simply laying down the definitions of machinery and partly completed machinery took considerable commitment during the previous mandate."
"During the second reading, for my part, I paid particular attention to the provisions of that directive relating to CE marking, as I felt that the wording was insufficiently clear in legal terms."
"I am grateful to the Council for having accepted my amendment, but I am delighted that the Commission is working on this subject, which still needs to be looked into more deeply."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for the way he led the negotiations."
"We were able to make considerable progress towards a common position thanks to the informal three-way talks he arranged, bringing together the chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the shadow rapporteurs, the representatives of the European Commission and those of the Council."
"We have reached a consensus awaited by all those in the industry."
"There are still some points that need to be clarified, particularly with regard to tractors, but I remain optimistic and I hope that the problems will be resolved by the effective implementation of this directive."
"As a consequence of this, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will vote for the compromise."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just heard that mechanical engineering is a crucially important sector of the European economy."
"Although this is the case throughout the European Union, there can be no question that it holds particularly true in my home country."
"An interesting point that should therefore be stressed in this connection is that this Directive was drafted, , in response to calls from industry, which went to a great deal of effort to get this Directive on the table, with the slogan of ‘one product, one regulation for the internal market’."
"It goes without saying that this is a positive development, given that one of the advantages of this legislation is that the same type of machinery, with the same design, can be put into circulation anywhere in the internal market. Additional tests in the various EU Member States would of course be unnecessary."
"On the occasion of this second reading, and with the debate on the Services Directive in mind, I should like to make the following comment. If we were always to take this approach as our starting point for debates on the Services Directive, we would doubtless also make progress with that dossier."
"In this connection, I cannot help but mention that mechanical engineering in Europe is in fact particularly dependent on the Services Directive, because services as well as products are sold with machinery."
"While on the subject, I should like to make a second comment of a political nature."
"It has been reiterated during today’s debate that this Directive was a very long time – five years, to be precise – in the making."
"For most of this time, the European Union had only 15 Member States."
"As we are all aware, the EU is now operating with 25 Member States."
"In view of this fact, and also in view of the planned reduction in the number of regulations, it should be noted that it will probably take a great deal longer to reach agreement on similar regulations in the future, and both industry and the political bodies responsible for such matters should be aware of this fact."
"The principle of ‘less is sometimes more’ also applies in this instance."
"If I may, therefore, I should like to emphasise once again how much I welcome this Directive."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to join in thanking Mr Schwab for his excellent work. I should also like to thank Mrs Weiler and Mrs De Vits, who have shown a high level of commitment and involvement on behalf of my group, thus ensuring that a certain amount of progress has been made in the course of their work with Mr Schwab."
"Previous speakers have already referred to such key considerations as health, safety and consumer protection."
"These considerations are the basis for the quality characteristics that ensure that products such as machinery are market leaders, and that mean that our manufacturers are able to capture a large global market for their products."
"This is very much to be welcomed."
"In this context, I can only agree with Mrs Weiler, who said that legal certainty is crucial in this connection."
"What legal certainty means is that mechanical engineers know exactly what rules they have to follow and what regulations are actually in force, and that they are not left in the dark."
"This in turn would also make it possible for us to have a well-functioning market in this sector."
"At the same time, however, legal certainty also means that we must avoid a situation in which several different directives apply to one product."
"It means that we should push forward measures to put in place a uniform regime, especially in the case of the tractor directives."
"It is far from ideal that manufacturers should have to juggle different regulations, and it is also highly regrettable that we were unable to gain approval for our proposal that this issue should finally be resolved by 2008 at the latest."
"This is a real shame."
"I have not forgotten that we were told, when we discussed this issue once before with the Commission and the Council at first reading, that the goal was to have everything settled within the next six months."
"That was eighteen months ago."
"We were told the same during this year’s debate on the issue, namely that it would all be sorted out within the next six months."
"I would therefore call on all those involved to ensure that this problem really is resolved without delay. We should not leave people in the dark, and this includes mechanical engineers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I regard the Machinery Directive, on which we have to deliver a verdict, as much more than simply a technical internal market directive."
"It illustrates that we in the European Union can make social legislation, even though we like to give it an economic twist."
"The upshot of the negotiations illustrates that Parliament very much has what it takes to make the difference, and I am indebted to the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, and to Mrs Weiler for the way in which they have dealt with this issue."
"It is thanks to Parliament that consumers can no longer be led up the garden path and that the administrative burden for our companies will, as a result of markings other than CE, no longer be excessive."
"Parliament also made sure that real inspection of the most dangerous machinery becomes possible and that this will not be a formality, but it is now up to the Member States to really make something of this directive and turn it into an ambitious working instrument."
"That is why all Member States must get down to effective market control, for without this market control, this directive remains a paper tiger, as was already the case with the previous directive."
"I would like to say to the Commissioner that the Commission should, in my view, closely monitor the Member States’ commitment, check whether they carry out this market inspection and if necessary in future, take an initiative if it were to transpire that they fail to deliver on their promises, in the interest of workers, consumers and manufacturers alike."
"Our work is done for now, and I think that we will therefore be able to approve this directive tomorrow."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"– The next item is the report by Mrs Attwooll (A6-0341/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on women's networks: fishing, farming and diversification (2004/2263(INI))."
". Mr President, frequently in this House, speakers in a debate will pay some kind of tribute to the rapporteur."
"This ranges from a rather guarded expression of thanks for a great deal of hard work, to the offer of congratulations on the production of an excellent report."
"Were I in that situation on the present occasion, I could not in all honesty take the congratulatory line, for I believe the report to have some obvious shortcomings."
"That is not to say that it does not make very valuable points, or that there is anything in it with which I am in substantive disagreement."
"I am very grateful, too, to colleagues for the interest that they have taken."
"My concern is two-fold: first, the extent of redundancy in the text – there may be circumstances in which repetition is used to good effect, but I do not consider that this is one of them; secondly, the range of issues covered – I believe that the European Parliament should be taking seriously all aspects of the lives of women in the fisheries sector and doing its best to address the problems that affect them."
"But the original intention of this report was to concentrate on the role of women’s networks and their potential to contribute to the socio-economic fabric of fisheries-dependent communities."
"We have mentioned two of the parallels between their situation and that of women similarly engaged in the agricultural sector and of the possibility of joint action on their parts."
"That focus has been lost."
"I find that unfortunate, since women’s networks are central to achieving the other objectives itemised in the report."
"So, I shall state quite simply and briefly what my own message to the Commission and Council would be: please give your encouragement and support to the creation and development of women’s networks, at both domestic and pan-European levels."
"Please also give your encouragement and support to their activities in diversifying local economies, in contributing to the development of the common fisheries policy and in providing a coordinated approach to tackling issues of common concern."
"Encouragement and support, however, call for more than just a few kind words; they entail active assistance in accessing the necessary financial means and specific measures to remove all existing social and administrative barriers to women’s full participation and progress in all areas of the fisheries sector."
"Commissioner, thank you for listening."
"I thank you, too, in anticipation of concrete actions to come."
". Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for her report."
"I welcome the initiative of the European Parliament and share the rapporteur’s commitment to equal opportunities in the fisheries sector."
"I also share her opinion that the participation of women’s networks is particularly important in this context."
"In the next programming period, 2007-2013, the Commission will attach great importance to promoting the role of women in the fisheries sector."
"The proposed European Fisheries Fund reflects the Commission’s commitment to equal opportunities."
"The future fund is even more specific about the role of women in fisheries than the current Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance."
"The integration of the gender perspective is promoted during the various stages of implementing the Fund."
"We will ask the Member States to ensure that operations to enhance the role of women in the fisheries sector are promoted."
"The report under consideration calls on the Commission to provide active support for existing women’s networks and the creation of new networks."
"I am very pleased to inform you that the European Fisheries Fund proposal will support specific actions like networking and the exchange of experience and best practice among organisations promoting equal opportunities between men and women."
"For the next programming period, the Commission suggests including the actions relating to networking and the exchange of experiences among organisations promoting equal opportunities in the Member States’ operational programmes."
"This replaces our past approach of launching calls for proposals for innovative actions directly managed by the Commission."
"We believe that this option will have more added value than funding small-scale projects, which was the case under the innovative actions formula."
"An ex-post evaluation of transnational projects for innovative actions was conducted in 2005."
"One of the main findings of the evaluation was that the operational programme projects were more highly performing than the innovative action projects."
"The evaluation also showed that the EU added value of the innovative actions, as well as the exchange of experiences and good practices were fairly limited."
"In your report you called on the Commission to promote more vocational training and education specifically geared to the activities of women working in the sector."
"I am pleased to announce that the European Fisheries Fund’s new priority – the sustainable development of fisheries areas – will make an important contribution to these needs."
"Support can be granted for the diversification of activities and the promotion of multiple employment opportunities for fishers outside the sector."
"Measures, such as the promotion and the improvement of professional skills, worker adaptability and access to employment, particularly in favour of women, are foreseen."
"The measures aimed at the diversification of economic activities, as well as education and professional training, will be of particular benefit for women in fisheries-dependent areas."
"The Commission also shares with you the concern about the difficulty in recruiting young people in the fisheries sector."
"The sector suffers from a poor image with the younger generation and an effort has to be made to attract young people to join the profession."
"In this regard under the European Fisheries Fund, we are considering more incentives for young fishers, in addition to the measures already foreseen under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance such as training, including training on health and safety, and the upgrading of professional skills."
"There will also be limited assistance offered under the EFF for first-time young fishers entering the profession."
"In addition, there will be increased possibilities for the participation of women in the decision-making process."
"The new priority ‘sustainable development of fisheries areas’ will be implemented through a bottom-up approach."
"The local actors, including women’s associations, will be the motor in designing and implementing the local development strategies."
"This new approach is a further opportunity for women at local level to get involved in decision-making and to ensure that their specific concerns are taken into account in the local development strategies."
"Likewise, for the establishment of the National Strategic Plans, a wide partnership with all relevant actors, including women’s representatives, is foreseen."
"Women’s organisations should therefore give their input for the analysis of the trends in the fisheries sector and the development of a strategy for its sustainable development."
"Women and their representatives are also encouraged to participate in the regional advisory councils, which are the cornerstone of the ‘governance’ pillar of the reformed common fisheries policy."
"For instance, women’s associations already have a seat in the North Sea RAC, which was the first to be created as a result of the common fisheries policy reform in 2002."
"Women are also represented in the North Western Waters RAC."
"Finally, following the conference on the role of women in fisheries organised in January 2003, I am pleased to inform you that the Commission is planning to organise another conference on equal opportunities in 2006."
"This conference will take stock of the situation of women in the fisheries sector and reflect on ways further to improve the situation and make further progress."
"I hope that the views of this Parliament will also find reflection in the proceedings of the conference."
"In conclusion, I would like to underline the Commission’s determination to attribute great importance to equal opportunities in our policy."
"However, in order to make equal opportunities a reality, all policy-making levels need to take responsibility: the Commission, and national as well as regional and local levels."
"Your own commitment to this objective will assist in keeping and furthering the importance given to equal opportunities at all levels."
". – Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, and I would like to join with the rapporteur and the Commissioner in saying that the role of women in the fisheries sector should be better recognised."
"Although just 3% of people employed in extractive fishing are women, women do participate actively in all the other activities relating to fishing."
"As a result of their invisibility, many women working in the sector do not enjoy social and economic rights."
"We would therefore call upon the Commission, together with the Member States, to take the necessary measures to guarantee fully the rights of these women."
"We also agree that they should have access to professional training, to funding and to credits under the same conditions as men."
"It is also necessary to increase the participation of women in decision-making processes, and therefore a recommendation from the Commission to the relevant bodies so that they take the necessary action in this regard would be very positive."
"It is essential to help women’s organisations and networks, and we therefore welcome the Commission’s commitment to carry on actively supporting existing ones and the creation of new ones, since they are absolutely essential tools for the exchange of information and for good practices."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I must not end without mentioning in particular shellfish gatherers, the majority of whom are women of over 50 years old whose health suffers directly as a result of their work and who in many cases do not have the right to unemployment benefits, to health services or to job security."
"We cannot allow groups such as this to carry on with so little protection and, as a member of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I would call for greater recognition of the work of women in the sector and that we provide solutions to the problems resulting from this work without delay."
". – Mr President, as a representative in this Parliament of a European region in which the presence of women in the fishing sector is extremely high, including in the extractive sector, through activities such as shellfish gathering, I would like to thank Mrs Attwooll for her report, which stresses an extraordinary formula that will re-evaluate the role played by women in society and allow them to take more advantage of the different possibilities that are opening up to improve their training, their degree of specialisation and their future prospects."
"I am proud to be able to say that, over recent years, the fisheries authorities in my region have paid particular attention to the role of women, promoting ― and indeed calling urgently for ― the creation of associations and unreservedly supporting the integration of those associations into the existing networks, and arranging international forums and conferences to strengthen them and create new ones, with a view to the exchange of knowledge and experience amongst women from all parts of Europe."
"The results are spectacular, particularly with regard to making women themselves more aware of the economic and social importance of their work, moving on from seeing their role as one of supporting the family economy, which had traditionally fallen to them, to demanding the compensation to which they have a right as workers: better salaries, social benefits and training."
"The report by Mrs Attwooll accurately illustrates the role that they have played and the role that women’s networks may yet play in this field and calls upon national administrations and the Commission to continue providing and intensifying their support."
"For all of these reasons, our political group supports the fundamental points of this report and hopes that the plenary of this Parliament will support it as well."
". Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my agreement, as shadow rapporteur for this report, with the words of the rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll."
"I believe that we can see from reading this report that women’s networks play numerous roles in fishing areas and could play a greater and better role in the future."
"It is important to make the extremely important work carried out by women in this sector more visible and thereby to ensure that these activities are better valued and remunerated since, in many cases — as has already been said — women work for nothing and sometimes without any social protection."
"We still have a long way to go."
"The report also acknowledges the effort that the Commission has already made, holding the Conference on the role of women in the fisheries sector in 2003."
"We eagerly await the conference scheduled for 2006."
"There is still a lot to do, however."
"I am therefore pleased to have noted a change of emphasis on the part of the Commissioner, and this is very necessary for women in the fisheries sector."
"I believe that the measures that the Commission must take in order to support these networks must be aimed in four directions, which are indicated in the report: information, funding, representativeness and training."
"A more exhaustive report must be produced."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the report on women’s networks does not impress us very much."
"An exhaustive report must be drawn up, which accurately reflects the situation of the existing networks, and their development must then be monitored."
"Funding is required, since these networks are playing, and can play in future, more and better roles of public interest, from economic, social and also ecological points of view, and they therefore deserve funding instruments."
"The training that the Commissioner mentioned is needed."
"Aware of the important work done by women in the fisheries sector, the Commission should promote the education and training of young people in these activities so that they can take over this work in the future."
"As has already been demonstrated, certain situations provide examples, such as the situation of the shellfish gatherers."
"I therefore believe that we must support organisations of women that form around networks, so that they can achieve and consolidate better living conditions."
"I would like to announce that my Group is also going to support Mrs Attwooll’s report."
"Mr President, I too should like to add my warm thanks to Mrs Attwooll for her work, her report and the way in which she has put the women’s networks in Europe on the map."
"I am also indebted to the Commissioner."
"It is not the first time that he displays great social concern in the fisheries sector."
"I should also like to thank him for the way in which he wants to actively involve all social strata within the fisheries industry."
"Why is that so important?"
"There are three points why it is vital that the scope of fisheries is widened to include factors other than economic ones."
"What is apparent to me from the shrimp crisis in my own region, and the role that VinVis has played in this, is that the women’s network has contributed towards a solution, and I have to conclude quite simply that it is very much to be welcomed that the fisheries sector is being broadened socially speaking."
"I am also delighted that this network has now been given its rightful place in the regional advisory council for the North Sea."
"It is of particular importance, though, in the area of training, social position, and economic impact on the fisheries industry."
"If I consider the high fuel prices and a number of other factors which certainly have social implications within the fisheries industry, then I consider it to be a good thing that the women’s network, VinVis, but also other organisations, are given their rightful place."
"In that respect, I was also very taken with the hearing which the rapporteur organised in July that involved a large number of women’s organisations, and I think it would be good if activities of this kind were also organised by Parliament and the Commission."
"I would once again like to thank the rapporteur for this report and I hope that the Commissioner will also follow up the recommendations."
"His response in this respect creates reasonably positive expectations to this effect, and I hope that we politicians will also ensure that all social strata within the fisheries industry are given their rightful place within the sector."
"– Mr President, I too should like in turn to congratulate and thank the rapporteur for the exceptional work which she has done in her report."
"We all know that women engaged in coastal fisheries are at a disadvantage, because their work in this sector is classified as supplementary work rather than as a profession."
"What is missing is the recognition of their work, at both a legal and social level."
"We need to support and to safeguard the social and economic rights of women in all sectors of the fishing industry: equal pay, pension rights, social security and access to public health services."
"We need to step up efforts to implement policies which support initiatives to create women's networks throughout the European Union, especially in remote island areas."
"The development of these networks should not be based merely on voluntary or one-off actions."
"These networks must be institutionalised so that their role in the areas in which they develop can be strengthened and they can act as advisors and experts on the councils in their areas."
"As far as the full application of the principle of equal treatment and equal opportunities in the fisheries sector is concerned, I consider that we have fallen a long way behind."
"I think that the time has come for a bold decision, so that the contribution of women to the development of fisheries and of economic life in general is recognised."
"Let us not address women's networks merely with sympathy and understanding."
"Let us turn them into an important tool, which will promote fisheries policy, sustainable development and respect for the environment, ecosystems and man."
"– Mr President, all the previous speakers recognised the need to maintain fishing not only as an economic activity but also as a social and, one might say, a cultural activity."
"The traditional role of women in fisheries and the various modern forms of participation in the women's job market by areas with fishing activities were certainly strengthened decisively following the Commission conference in 2003 and the start of networking of this specific category of workers."
"We cannot but welcome the initiative by the Committee on Fisheries and, more importantly, by the excessively modest Mrs Attwooll, in drafting the report."
"I, in all events, as shadow rapporteur for my party in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, thank her for including most of my committee's comments."
"All that remains, therefore, is for us to trust that the Commission will help at the new conference in 2006 to integrate a pan-European network of women engaged in fisheries."
"Not only the European Fisheries Fund but also the Structural Funds and other programmes, such as FEMMES and LEADER, can become tools for special actions, in parallel to educational development and the development of professional skills, the development of adaptability, research programmes into the impact of restructuring in the fishing and farming industries, innovation in production and the promotion of consumption with environmental awareness and respect for biodiversity."
"It depends on these actions as to whether or not young boys and girls remain in fishing areas, so that traditions, with valuable, long-standing practices, can be maintained with new technology and can bring about added value for the European Union."
"However, added value will also come from maintaining everything provided for in Council Directive 86/613 and I would ask you, Commissioner, to address its extension to the fisheries sector."
"The application of the principle of equal treatment of men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity, including agriculture, and protection during pregnancy are important sectors and the Gender Institute being set up will have a role to play with special research into the matter."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to extend warm thanks to Mrs Attwooll for managing to pinpoint exactly what the role and significance of women in the fisheries industry can be."
"The work of women is often invisible, and Mrs Attwooll’s report helps at any rate to bring it into the light."
"The fisheries industry is a heavy industry, one with regrettably long working hours and also dangerous work."
"More women on the ships can help improve working conditions there."
"Work that is too heavy or dangerous for women is often detrimental to men too."
"In many sectors, it has turned out that, as soon as women joined their ranks, the working conditions improved."
"Greater involvement of women in the safety of ships is essential to make actual progress in this area."
"A concern for sustainability is something else we can expect from women and women’s networks."
"Sustainable fishing is essential to provide future generations with fish."
"Sustainable catching methods with minimal bycatch and sound monitoring are essential."
"The quotas will be laid down this month, and it is very important to take the scientific recommendations into consideration; if not, future generations will be fishing behind the net, something of which women often bear the brunt."
"It may be time to adopt fresh policy, to experiment with fish reserves for a few years, to put fish reserves on the map, or to give fish stocks the chance to recover."
"The maritime strategy that is now being prepared is an appropriate time to hold the discussion on this."
"I would invite everyone to involve women in particular in this discussion in all countries."
"Women often trade in, and buy, fish."
"The viability of sustainable fishing is dependent on the full involvement of consumers, as also on the introduction of quality marks that guarantee quality and sustainability."
"It is good to involve women in this as much as possible."
"In short, like Mrs Attwooll, I have great expectations where women are concerned."
". Mr President, I thank the rapporteur again for her report."
"I would also like to thank all the speakers for their remarks, for the determination they have shown on the subject of equal opportunities for women in fisheries, and for the proposals that they have made to the Commission."
"On women’s networks, let me state again that the European Fisheries Fund aims to support networking and the exchange of experience and best practice among organisations promoting equal opportunities."
"The European Fisheries Fund will also provide for educational and social needs in the fisheries sector, with particular emphasis on women."
"Women’s networks in fisheries are already benefiting from Community funding under programmes such as EQUAL, and certainly this funding will be enhanced with the entry into force of the European Fisheries Fund."
"The focus in the fund on young fishers will also help in the field of equal opportunities."
"An important milestone in the reform of the common fisheries policy was in the field of governance through the creation of the regional advisory councils."
"I can only express the hope that women’s organisations will take up their place in the regional advisory councils in the same way as they have already done in two out of the three existing regional advisory councils."
"Participation in such governance fora will see benefits for equal opportunities at various levels."
"On the point raised with regard to shellfish gatherers, I would like to point out that they benefit from assistance from the FIFG under the Spanish operational programme."
"I trust that such funding may also be requested by the Spanish authorities under the European Fisheries Fund and I am confident that the Commission can continue to support such activities."
"In fact, such an example can certainly be promoted further."
"In conjunction with the Commissioner responsible for equal opportunities, I will do my utmost constantly to underline to Member States the importance of promoting equal opportunities in the fisheries sector."
"As I stated before, there will be another conference in 2006, following the conference of 2003."
"The purpose behind that conference is to take stock of the situation concerning equal opportunities in the fisheries sector and then to consider what further initiatives can be taken in conjunction therewith."
"I look forward to Parliament’s constructive contribution to that conference."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"– The next item is the report by Mrs Stihler (A6-0340/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing Community financial measures for the implementation of the common fisheries policy and in the area of the Law of the Sea [COM(2005)0117 – C6-0131/2005 – 2005/0045(CNS)]."
". Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the honourable Member for her report on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing Community financial measures for the implementation of the common fisheries policy and in the area of the Law of the Sea."
"The funding proposed by this regulation will be an essential part of the fisheries financial perspectives package for 2007-2013."
"Next to the European Fisheries Fund, this regulation represents the legal basis for most other expenditure allowing the continuation of the common fisheries policy and, based on the Commission’s original proposal for a financial perspective, it will cover more than EUR 2.5 billion worth of spending in the seven year period from 2007-2013."
"The proposal aims to provide a more transparent and simplified framework for the execution of Community financial interventions."
"It is geared towards improving the effectiveness of financial interventions in the field of control and enforcement, in the area of data collection and scientific advice, in the strengthening of the governance of the common fisheries policy, and in the area of international relations and the Law of the Sea."
"Let me now turn to the amendments proposed in the report before us."
"The Commission can accept Amendment 1 and will continue to do what is possible within its competence to work towards ensuring the sustainability of the resources in third countries."
"Whereas the Commission is in agreement in principle on the substance of Amendment 2, it has difficulty accepting the form of such an amendment."
"The proposed amendment could have the effect of restricting the scope of what is designed to be a broad and general paragraph dealing with the crucial aspect of control capacities of third counties."
"Furthermore, the Commission plans to concentrate on developing common objectives with third countries, rather than prescribing to them detailed means as to how to get to those objectives as different countries have different needs."
"Amendments 3 to 8 should be considered together with Amendment 17, since they quote objectives which were already covered in the Council’s conclusions of 19 July 2004, regarding fisheries partnership agreements."
"However, the legal provisions of this regulation are not the right place for policy statements."
"The Commission therefore considers that a reference to these conclusions in the recitals of the proposed regulation, as proposed by Amendment 17, is the most appropriate way to include these aspects and can therefore accept Amendment 17."
"As a consequence, the scope of Amendments 3 to 8 will be covered through this recital."
"Since the Natura 2000 network falls under the Community’s environmental policy, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 9 in a regulation which exclusively concerns the common fisheries policy."
"The Commission will, however, ensure coherence of the common fisheries policy with environmental objectives."
"For similar reasons, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 10."
"In the framework of fisheries partnership agreements, the Council conclusions referred to earlier require coherence between the objectives of the CFP and the objectives of other Community policies such as environmental objectives."
"The Commission appreciates the support the Committee on Fisheries has demonstrated and continues to demonstrate towards the regional advisory councils."
"The proposed Amendment 11 clearly sets out the desire of the Committee to see the role of the regional advisory councils facilitated through indefinite funding."
"Whereas the Commission is willing to explore options for funding beyond the currently prescribed five-year period, a commitment cannot be made at this stage since this would not be in line with the current regulation that has established the regional advisory councils, but this request can be reconsidered in the first evaluation of the functioning of the regional advisory councils three years after their establishment."
"On the cost of commissioning scientific advice, the Commission is already paying independent and credible bodies to deliver the scientific advice."
"RACs are welcome to highlight to the Commission any need for scientific advice."
"However, the Commission reserves its right to decide on the justification of such a request on a case-by-case basis and will lead the process of obtaining this advice."
"Although the Commission is in agreement in principle on the substance of Amendment 12, it has difficulty accepting the form of such an amendment."
"The proposed amendment could have the effect of restricting the scope of what is designed to be a broad and general paragraph dealing with the objectives for fisheries partnership agreements."
"Value for money is just one of the principles mentioned in the Council conclusions of 19 July 2004 regarding fisheries partnership agreements, and it should not be highlighted individually to the detriment of the other principles and objectives defined in the Council."
"The Commission has difficulty in accepting Amendment 13."
"Most of the aspects mentioned in the amendment are covered either by the Council conclusions on fisheries partnership agreements, or by the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities."
"The Commission agrees on the substance of Amendment 14, but not on the form."
"In principle, the Commission agrees to provide summaries and aggregations of the collected data on request or for specific needs, but it is not planned at this point automatically to issue this data in the form of a periodic publication or report."
"Amendment 15 cannot be accepted by the Commission, as fisheries partnership agreements are in essence based on a commercial relationship."
"The third country is responsible for and sovereign to spend its revenue under the agreement, in whole or in part, in support of its fisheries policy for the purposes jointly agreed in a common approach with the Community."
"The parties will jointly review the results obtained by this policy."
"However, in this context, the Commission cannot impose financial audits or on-the-spot checks on third countries without their agreement."
"For similar reasons, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 16."
"Each fisheries partnership agreement contains provisions on the payment of funds, as well as on the use of the share of these funds foreseen for the fisheries policy of the third country."
"On the basis of indicators and benchmarks, both parties will jointly evaluate the results of this policy and, where appropriate, will make the necessary adjustments."
"As regards its national budget and financial administration, however, the third country is sovereign."
"As said before, the Commission can accept Amendment 17."
"Concerning Amendment 18, the Commission welcomes the support from Parliament to reinforce the budget for the common fisheries policy in the course of the negotiations on the 2007–2013 financial perspective."
"The proposed regulation, by definition, can be adopted only once the financial perspective has, hopefully, been agreed."
"Therefore, adding a recital, as proposed in this amendment, is probably obsolete."
"The Commission agrees on the substance of Amendment 19, but not on the form."
"Small-scale fisheries, as part of the catching sector, are already included as RAC members by virtue of the RAC decision."
"Thus the Commission already promotes their participation in RACs as full members."
". Mr President, I should like to thank all colleagues for their support so far for my report."
"This report replaces a number of existing legal measures which provide the basis for current funding beyond monies provided by the European Fisheries Fund."
"This is in line with the policy of achieving better regulation and simplification of legislation."
"It sets out objectives for: expenditure, rules for eligibility of expenditure, the level of the Commission contribution and control measures."
"The key areas covered are: control and enforcement, data collection, scientific advice, governance of the CFP and international matters."
"The total budget foreseen for 2007-2013 is EUR 2 625 million, although the actual amounts, as the Commissioner has said, will depend on the EU budget negotiations."
"On control and enforcement, the aim is to improve the control of fishing activities in order to combat those fishing activities that are damaging the conservation of resources within and outside Community waters."
"This is to be achieved by providing Community financial support to Member States to reduce weaknesses in their fisheries control programmes and by assisting coordination of control measures, particularly via the Community Fisheries Control Agency."
"Within the area of data collection and scientific advice, Community support will allow for the collection and management of the data needed to evaluate the state of fisheries resources and the fishing industry within and outside Community waters."
"This will assist the Member States to establish multiannual, aggregated and science-based data sets which incorporate biological, environmental and economic information."
"In the area of governance, the goal is to ensure the involvement of stakeholders at all stages of policy development up to and including implementation."
"In the area of international relations and the law of the sea, Community financial support is given for the conclusion of fisheries agreements with third countries, including partnership agreements, and participation in international organisations relating to fisheries or the law of the sea."
"This area is allocated the lion’s share of the budget – EUR 1 592.5 million, of which EUR 1 522.5 million will go to fisheries agreements."
"In addition, some money has been allocated to technical and administrative assistance, including related staff costs."
"However, although the sums allocated by the Commission have been increased in committee, MEPs expressed concern that the allocation would not cover all the tasks required."
"These have been increased by enlargement and the need to collect data on the new seas – for example, current data on the Black Sea scarcely exists."
"Uncertainty over funding – not least as we await a new EU budget – poses the question of whether more funds can be made available, and if so, how they should be allocated."
"If more funding is not available, then the question of whether funding is appropriately allocated by this proposal arises."
"The creation of RACs is a vital and most welcome development."
"They will play a key role in the management of the CFP."
"However, we need to ensure that the RAC areas are adequately supported."
"They are unlikely to generate sufficient resources of their own after the start-up phase and, indeed, the operating costs are certain to increase after the start-up phase, as the RACs and their working groups – the North Sea RAC already has four of them – progressively generate and implement new projects in support of management guidance to the Commission."
"Even in the start-up phase, the level of support to the RACs from the Commission diminishes progressively and steeply and continues to do so, year on year, as the RAC itself is expected to become increasingly self-supporting."
"Moreover, the secretariats of the RACs have only limited capacity to seek alternative sources of funding, notably from Member States."
"There is only limited opportunity – or justification – to pass the burden of cost on to the stakeholders – members of the general assembly and executive committees – especially as individual stakeholders – such as NGOs – seek to be involved in several RACs simultaneously, which incurs significant resource costs."
"It is vital to press for finance to be available for RACs beyond the initial five-year period."
"The financial support for the collection of data on the impact of fisheries on the environment in relation to adopting an ecosystem-based approach is also important."
"Almost 60% of all the money goes on international fishing agreements, and it is only right that we make sure this amounts to value for money and is a fair development."
"Expenditure on agreements should be eligible for Community financing only if it has been recommended as value for money under an evaluation report on the relevant agreement."
"It is also important to develop control capacities of third countries to ensure sustainable fishing monitoring and control of fishing activities."
"If cuts need to be made in the Commission’s indicative budget, savings should be found from the international relations area, the largest budget area."
"I thank colleagues for their support and urge them to support this report tomorrow, and I wish everybody a Happy Christmas."
". – Mr President, although this is a premature discussion, since the financial perspective has not yet been approved, I believe that we should approve Mrs Stihler’s report as an anticipatory measure, but I would like to make several comments, some of which coincide with those of the Commissioner."
"Firstly, we do not agree with the rapporteur’s statement that, in the event of a reduction of the appropriations laid down in the Commission’s proposal, they should be taken without any justification whatsoever from the heading corresponding to fisheries agreements, despite the fact that the rapporteur appears to have forgotten that the majority of these funds are now intended to meet the costs of development aid, and not the commercial part of those agreements."
"Furthermore, the usual cliché of linking the funding of fisheries agreements to prior cost-benefit analyses is not practical at this stage."
"Firstly, the and studies carried out by the Commission for each protocol show that the agreements are still bringing benefits that are greater than the cost to the European Union and, at the same time, due to their new status as association agreements, we need to take account of other parameters which cannot be measured by means of a mere cost-benefit analysis."
"Secondly, neither do we agree that Natura 2000 network measures should be funded by means of CFP funds."
"In this regard, I would refer to what this Parliament said in the Böge report on the financial perspective."
"Finally, and with regard to the regional fisheries committees, I do not believe that there is any justification, for the moment at least, for extending the period for their funding laid down in Community legislation, particularly when the majority of the RACs are not yet operating, since less than half of those planned have been set up."
"The logical thing is for the RAC to be an instrument that will eventually be self-funding, if it is as useful as we hope, and not to become an additional burden for contributors, particularly within a policy for which the financial contribution is always below the minimums."
". Mr President, I would more or less follow on from Mrs Fraga’s last sentence."
"I do not know why it is precisely the common policy with the least funds that is most besieged by requests of all kinds."
"In this regard, although I am genuinely grateful for the work of the rapporteur ― as she knows ― I feel obliged to make a series of comments, or rather discrepancies, in relation to the text that has been approved in committee and on which we are going to vote tomorrow."
"I am referring specifically to Amendments 6, 9, 11, 12 and 13, on which I shall comment briefly."
"Within the context of this Regulation, and aware of the beneficial consequences of international agreements in the Community’s regions in terms of employment, I understand the Commission’s position on this issue."
"Maintaining employment is a specific objective that nobody questions."
"To set this objective without specifically mentioning the Community, as Mrs Stihler does, could be a mistake."
"It is a laudable desire, but it does not fall within the scope of the CFP and furthermore it does not seem to me to be a realistic objective."
"With regard to data collection for Natura 2000, proposed in Amendment 9, I believe that it should be financed by means of funds intended for the environment policy ― as I have always said ― and not by means of the CFP."
"Those of us who deal with the CFP know that through this policy we are paying for other obligations laid down within other Community policies, as demonstrated by the increasing economic weight of development cooperation within the fisheries agreements."
"Furthermore, when, in Amendment 12, Mrs Stihler proposes the criterion of providing value for money as a determining factor in fisheries agreements, I feel obliged to ask what kind of value for money she is referring to. Value for money for the third country?"
"Furthermore, Mrs Stihler, I believe that, if we work on the basis of this criterion of value for money, I do not know whether we will be able to implement the cooperation policy to which I have just referred, and to which you yourself refer."
"I genuinely do not know whether or not you, as rapporteur, have given this criterion of value for money, which I find so difficult to understand, sufficient thought."
"I accept the two amendments presented by Mr Guerreiro, as well as Amendment 17, presented by Mrs Stihler."
". Mr President, on this occasion I would like to offer very genuine and heartfelt congratulations to the rapporteur and thank her for her support for the ALDE amendments."
"These largely related to the issue of international fisheries agreements."
"I have to say, Commissioner, I was rather disappointed by your response to them."
"We do not deny the importance of these agreements, but we believe that if we are expending European taxpayers’ money, whether for targeted assistance or in relation to fishing rights, we should know exactly how this money is being expended."
"Amendment 16 in particular was crafted very carefully to get over the international legal difficulties in that respect."
"We are talking about fisheries partnership agreements with obligations on both sides."
"If we do not have this information, if we cannot evaluate what is going on, how can we decide whether we should renew them when the time comes?"
"There are serious concerns about what is going on in some third-country waters."
"Only last week, the Environmental Justice Foundation published a report on illegal fishing in Guinea and its links to the European Union."
"A telling statistic cited in the report is that Guinea is losing over 34 000 tonnes of fish every year to illegal fishing, worth an estimated USD 110 million."
"The EU fleet is only one of several implicated in this, but it is implicated all the same."
"It seems to me that this one example demonstrates why it is crucial that care is taken with regard to the EU’s fishing agreements, ensuring that the Union is helping to improve governance in third-country waters, but also addressing the urgent need on all sides to step up the quality of monitoring and enforcement."
"Several of the amendments in this report would help the Union move towards more responsible fishing agreements."
"On a slightly different topic, the ALDE Group welcomes Amendment 11 proposing that funding for the operating costs of regional advisory councils should not be restricted to the first five years."
"As the Commissioner has said, they are the cornerstone of the governance of the revised common fisheries policy."
". – I should like to highlight an issue that was raised in the debate in committee."
"The funding provided for in the Commission’s proposal will not enable us to achieve the objectives set out in this regulation, such as the financing of control and enforcement measures, conservation measures, data collection and improvement of scientific advice, governance, international relations and the Law of the Sea."
"The financial resources for this important common fisheries policy instrument must be increased, in light of the enlargement of the EU and the more ambitious objectives that have been set out."
"Yet no such increase is forthcoming. The British Presidency’s proposal is just another in the series of cuts being made to the 2007-2013 Community budget."
"Accordingly, we have tabled a proposal for an amendment stating that the global financial envelope for fisheries, and specifically for this proposal for a regulation, is woefully inadequate if we are to address the economic and social crisis facing the sector and to meet the needs arising from the 2002 review of the common fisheries policy, and proposing adequate financial resources for the fisheries sector."
"That being said, given that, in our view, it is of key importance that fishermen be involved in setting out and implementing the common fisheries policy at every level, we have also tabled a proposal that support should be provided for setting up or promoting representative associations of small coastal fishing, far and away the most important part of the sector, and that such fishermen be involved in decision-making processes in regional advisory councils."
"Lastly, I wish to say that the regulation continues to be guided by the idea that the sole factor in conserving fisheries resources is to reduce fishing activities at EU level, disregarding other determining factors."
"As far as we are concerned, the primary objective should be to promote sustainable modernisation and development in the sector. It is also essential that the balance of fisheries resources be maintained so as to guarantee that fish supplies to the public are not interrupted, jobs are not lost and fishermen’s living and working conditions are improved."
". Mr President, the common fisheries policy affects the UK more than many other Member States."
"A UK minister in the late 1940s once remarked that Britain’s economy was safe for years to come because, he said, we live on an island of coal, surrounded by fish."
"The coal is still there, if we care to use it, but the fish have almost gone, due to the disaster that is common fisheries policy."
"Designed to conserve fish stocks, this misbegotten scheme has reduced some species to near extinction."
"Among the most depleted are the plentiful stocks once found in the North Sea and Irish Box, up until 1973 the exclusive province of British fishermen who looked after the fishing grounds and reaped a rich harvest."
"Then we joined the common market and the CFP, and now these seas are a marine desert in the making, if not already so."
"Fair shares for all under the CFP, do I hear?"
"If so, why does Britain have lower quotas in the waters around our shores than some other countries from further afield?"
"And what does it profit anyone to fish our waters out?"
"Too many boats taking too few fish is the cry."
"Just so."
"Under the CFP vast fleets of trawlers from countries previously excluded are rapaciously fishing these grounds to extinction, while fertiliser factory ships vacuum up vast quantities of marine life on the seabed, destroying the bottom of the food chain."
"How could any sane person devise the CFP scheme of quotas resulting in fish caught in excess being thrown back?"
"Do you not know that the discarded fish are dead when they are thrown back?"
"Do you not know that for some species the annual weight of useless discards is as much as the weight of the fish legally landed?"
"Compare that to Norway and Iceland who both refused to join the EU: their fish stocks remain plentiful and their fishing industries flourish because they look after them, forbidding discards."
"Meanwhile, the British fishing fleet has sunk to less than a quarter of its previous size."
"Destruction of the fishing industry means that the fishermen are out of work and on benefit."
"It means that fishing ports are in terminal decline, so structural funds are poured in."
"It means that the social and economic fabric around the ports declines, while the EU claims to be combating this particular misery."
"If you think this is a purely British complaint, think again."
"The fishing industry is a factor in the UK’s GDP to which contributions to the EU budget are geared, and that comes on top of the destruction of a priceless natural resource."
"And so, another Christmas goose reduces its output of golden eggs!"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, these are difficult times for Europe and the economic crisis has not gone away."
"The EU must now focus on how to manage and distribute its budget accordingly."
"In order to pursue a sound, sensitive and sustainable strategy, we need to have tools at our disposal allowing us to take appropriate action, in line with what I believe were the wishes of all of us."
"This proposal for a regulation establishes a framework of measures for the purposes of implementing the common fisheries policy, complementing the proposal for a Council regulation on the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), which we debated in the Chamber some months ago."
"As I said of the EFF at the time, it is crucial that the funds earmarked for these regulations be consistent with the actual needs of an integrated fisheries sector within an enlarged Europe facing fresh challenges."
"Although I welcome the Commission’s efforts to make the financial agreements under the common fisheries policy (CFP) clearer and more coherent, I must express my displeasure at the mismatch between the professed objectives and the funds set aside."
"Given that objectives following the EU’s enlargement need to be more ambitious and farther-reaching, I feel that it is inappropriate to impose a 6.3% cut on this financial instrument."
"I wish to highlight the fact that 60% of the budget of EUR 2 625 million, spread across four main operational objectives, has been set aside for international fisheries agreements."
"The strand relating to partnership agreements on fisheries is vitally important on account of its prominence in the budget."
"This report maintains the consistency between the conclusions of the recent Fisheries and Agriculture Councils regarding the new CFP and the EU’s international relations, and this strikes me as being of paramount importance."
"Lastly, the setting up and maintaining of regional advisory councils (RACs) are key to the new CFP."
"It is therefore vital to ensure not only that funding is available to cover the start-up costs of the RACs, but also that the councils remain viable. To this end, the Commission must clarify more clearly to what extent all areas relating to the RACs are to be funded."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, fishing – just like agriculture – is not an economic sector like any other."
"Fishing contributes to improving quality of life at European level and to protecting the coastline and the environment."
"In many cases, small-scale fishing even helps to bolster tourism."
"It is worth emphasising that the fishing community plays an important role."
"The job they do with such passion is demanding, tough and dangerous and their income is dependent on too many uncertainties."
"Often in debt, and subject to the continually rising price of diesel, fishermen and their families live with the fear of not being able to make ends meet and of losing their jobs."
"Throughout its existence, the common fisheries policy has failed to relieve their fears."
"On the contrary, it has contributed to the loss of thousands of small-scale fishing jobs and to the social insecurity of fishermen, without achieving convincing results with respect to the conservation of resources."
"What is worse, this policy has often given the impression of being subject to the law of the lobbies, who are more interested in cultivating their media images and in chasing subsidies than in making a serious effort to protect the environment."
"That, Commissioner, is why fishermen are fed up with continually being suspected of being the criminals of the sea, by a European Commission that, in contrast, is far too lenient on the real pirates of the sea, by which I mean flags of convenience."
"Commissioner, contrary to the prejudices of your learned assembly of scientists, nobody is more committed to conserving fishery resources than fishermen."
"It is their livelihood, their heritage and the future of their children."
"They have had more than enough of a situation in which quotas for fishing days and catch sizes, often laid down without a real scientific basis and traded any old how between the States, are involved in establishing fishing zones."
"The Commission must not continue to favour fishermen of one nationality over those of another."
"Everyone must be on an equal footing within Europe."
"It is true that your text represents a certain amount of progress in the field, in setting as one of its formal objectives the involvement of all stakeholders, but you will forgive me for describing it as vague and timid."
"We cannot save fishing and fishery resources without the fishermen and their professional associations and trade unions."
"Fishermen, through their representatives, must be truly involved in all decisions affecting them."
"The Union must also provide financial aid to the Member States to help them protect their territorial waters against illegal fishing."
"I am thinking in particular of the territorial waters of the outermost regions of the EU."
"Insofar as there is a real problem of funding a fair, sustainable and bold European fisheries policy, we must not forget that one of the threats to resources comes from pollution caused by maritime transport."
"The system of flags of convenience is behind this pollution."
"If, therefore, we can point the finger at those responsible for this ongoing ecological disaster, we will be in a position to launch a really ambitious policy."
". Mr President, first of all I would like to say that funding has in fact been increased under this instrument."
"This is due to a number of reasons: enlargement, new technologies, broader scope of data, the new control agencies and the establishment of the regional advisory councils."
"On the latter point, I wish to say, as I said before, that the Commission is willing to consider the funding of the regional advisory councils during the review to be undertaken after the third year of their operation."
"With regard to the extent of the funds, were more funds to be made available the Commission would surely not complain."
"However, in reality we will hopefully have a 150% increase in control and enforcement, a 160% increase in data collection and scientific advice, a 110% increase in governance and a 120% increase in international relations."
"If all goes well, there will be an overall increase of 130% if one compares the 2000-2006 financial period and the 2007-2013 financial period."
"If there is a reduction, we have a cushion to some extent, so we do not have to deduct from any one specific heading."
"If there is going to be a drastic cut, all headings will be affected linearly."
"We will know hopefully before the end of the week what the situation is going to be."
"So far, from the indications we have, the cuts envisaged under the financial perspective as regards fisheries are relatively small, especially in the second instrument, and hopefully it will stay that way."
"On the international agreements, the Commission believes that the proposal strikes the balance between internal and external policies, between international agreements and conservation, control and governance."
"At this juncture I wish to highlight that the allocations to the various areas are only indicative and based on current forecasts."
"Adjustments for each programme will in any case be submitted and adopted every year in the annual budgetary procedure."
"I would like to pick up on the point made by Mrs Attwooll with regard to Amendment 16."
"Since these are commercial relationships, the monies often go directly to the treasury budget as part of the budget of the state."
"However, we intend to strengthen our dialogue with the Commission’s development services, to enhance the effectiveness of these monies in these countries’ general development objectives, in particular in the fisheries sector."
"With particular reference to the fisheries partnership agreements, I need to underline that each fisheries partnership agreement contains provisions on the payment of funds under the agreement, as well as on the use of the financial share foreseen for the fisheries policy of the third country."
"On the basis of indicators and benchmarks, as I have said before, both parties will jointly evaluate the results of this policy and where appropriate will make the necessary adjustments."
"With regard to the remarks made by Mr Clark, I cannot agree with his assertions."
"The lower stocks of fish are the result of year upon year of uncontrolled over-fishing and not of the common fisheries policy."
"That policy, through its measures, seeks to address the need for balance between the availability of stocks and the fleets that target them."
"Finally, the point on coastal fisheries and small-scale fisheries is better addressed under the European Fisheries Fund, which will hopefully be adopted early in 2006."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, there is increasing agreement between scientists, researchers and environmental NGOs that sustainable fishing requires a stable, long-term link between fishermen and their environment, and between this economic activity and controlling and sanctioning predatory practices."
"In her excellent paper on the functioning of a fisheries association in Cangas, in the Spanish region of Galicia, Dora Jesus noted that when that particular fishing community enjoyed exclusive fishing rights in the area, or, more precisely, when it took on the rights and duties of owning natural resources and began to manage its own primary control and sanction systems, it succeeded in recovering stocks of goose barnacle and in making the species ecologically and economically sustainable in the area covered by the association."
"Sadly, the EU has opted for a diverse policy, of enormous variations between fishing rights. Europe is exclusively responsible for granting those rights and, for some species, they are determined for virtually the whole of Europe’s sea area, yet control and sanction systems are left to individual discretion."
"The funds and take-up rates proposed by the Commission to support investment in fisheries control by the Member States have been cut to EUR 32 million in 2006, a small amount given the responsibilities awarded to some regions and Member States."
"Furthermore there is no Community assistance for controlling and monitoring the CFP."
"In this connection, I should point out that Portugal, for example, accounts for little more than 2% of Europe’s population, but over 50% of the area covered by the European Economic Exclusive Zones (EEZs). What is more, the Azores region alone is a bigger EEZ than that of any Member State, even though it only has 250 000 inhabitants."
"In this context, the waters off the Azores have only been controlled once since they were liberalised on 1 August 2004, in spite of the fact that many dozens of external vessels have been detected by the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) in this EEZ during that time, and that there have sometimes been two dozen at once."
"This is in stark contrast to the numerous inspections carried out on the traditional Azores fleet by the regional, national and Community authorities, on land or not far offshore."
"In the absence of any kind of VMS, there is still, as we have just said, no effective protection against unregistered fishing boats and, indeed, legally registered boats, in the poorest and outermost areas of Europe. The reason why the VMS is functioning so incredibly badly is because of a number of derogations from key areas, and because the high-seas control system is so inactive and ineffective."
"At a conference on Maritime Policy and European Sea Strategy held last week by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in Ponta Delgada, we learned that around 150 different species have been found in the waters off the Azores, many of which are native to the area and some of which can live for literally thousands of years."
"These include dense black coral forests, some more than two metres in height."
"The value of these corals and other deep-sea organisms to our heritage will be seen over time and it is widely acknowledged that they have huge biotechnological potential."
"Whilst it is true that bottom trawls and bottom gillnets have been banned in the region, it is difficult to ascertain whether these bans have been effective, when the Community has done little or nothing to monitor, control and protect these European treasures."
"The announcement of the Commission’s proposed maritime strategy gave us all hope that we would see some changes in this state of affairs, but to our great dismay we discovered that this proposal envisages zero Community financing."
"In other words, it advocates the same approach as before, whereby everyone in Europe can enjoy maritime resources, whereas the responsibility for protecting those resources falls entirely on the people who live in the regions in question."
"As regards maritime security and environmental protection, in the Azores we are currently facing a tragedy of enormous proportions."
"A huge container vessel carrying a number of containers with dangerous chemicals, and flying a flag of convenience, has run aground on a reef designated a site of Community interest as part of the Natura 2000 network."
"In spite of the various packages, in the wake of the and the , and despite the creation of the European Maritime Safety Agency, Europe still does not have the capacity to respond either to these disasters, or to tragedies arising from unsustainable fishing."
"We therefore feel that a European Coast Guard must be set up as a matter of urgent priority, whereby fisheries control would be integrated with other sea control operations and fisheries would be opened up to the entire European fleet; an effective, modern and harmonised system of control and sanction."
"The liberalisation of access to waters is totally unacceptable unless these requirements are met. Otherwise there can only be one outcome – Europe’s natural maritime heritage will fall into rapid decay."
". Mr President, the issue of sanctions is of some urgency."
"A level playing field is essential to giving fishermen faith in the fairness of the common fisheries policy."
"Without that faith it becomes much more difficult to put well considered and effective management tools in place."
"The Commission’s latest report on behaviour that has seriously infringed the rules of the common fisheries policy demonstrates once again how uneven the playing field currently is."
"In 2003 there was a range within Member States of between 24% and 100% of the infringements that were actually followed by a sanction."
"Average finds for the same offence also vary considerably between Member States: for example, for keeping prohibited fishing gear on board, between EUR 451 and EUR 9 000; for unauthorised fishing, between EUR 375 and EUR 8 379, and for falsifying data, between EUR 98 and EUR 132 056."
"Over three years ago my own report on infringements urged the Commission ‘to examine the possibility of introducing a uniform system of minimum penalties across the European Union ... to strengthen fishers’ confidence in the fundamental principle of equal treatment, which implies objective criteria for classification and rating, as well as for infringements and penalties’."
"I accept that it is agreed minima to which we look, as there must be some room to align the penalty to the value of the catch and to penalise repeat offences more seriously than first offences, but I believe that we need greater uniformity in both the level of penalties and the type of penalties and procedures involved."
"Members of the Committee on Fisheries would be grateful for the Commissioner’s answer to our question, bearing in mind that the preliminary statement should be clarified to the fact that what it is stating is that 86% of all offences are currently covered by administrative sanctions and 14% by penal ones."
"We would be grateful for the Commission’s view on the issues that we have raised."
". Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur and the Committee on Fisheries for its report on this proposal from the Commission."
"I am pleased to note that the committee has given a favourable assessment to this scheme, which is aimed at improving the Member States’ control capabilities, and that it fully supports the extension of its validity for a further year."
"I also note that the committee is favourable to financing, under the Community budget, administrative arrangements with the Joint Research Centre with a view to developing new technologies in the area of control, and to the financing of studies on control-related areas, to be carried out at the Commission’s initiative."
"The committee has, however, tabled seven amendments to the proposal."
"I regret that it is very difficult to accept any of the amendments, mainly for formal reasons, which I would like to explain."
"Amendment 2 proposes a change to the time limit for the presentation of national programmes."
"We would like to keep the existing date of 31 January, as the submission of requests early on in the year will allow the Commission to adopt a decision granting the financial contribution in the first semester."
"This will, in turn, ease the planning requirements for national administrations."
"It should also be noted that the national administrations are already fully aware of this time limit."
"On Amendment 3 and the related Amendments 1 and 6, the Commission shares the committee’s view that these expenses should be financed under a different heading."
"This can be done through a budgetary arrangement."
"However, it is not possible to finance these two new actions if they were not foreseen in the legal text."
"The Commission deems that this proposal is the appropriate legal text to introduce them and cannot, therefore, accept these amendments."
"In Amendment 4, the committee asks the Commission to establish criteria in order to allocate grants when the amount of request exceeds the available appropriations."
"The Commission’s policy is to allocate grants only when the need for investment has been proven, namely through the national report on control activities, irrespective of the overall amount requested."
"Establishing criteria will introduce some rigidity to the selection of projects and could entail a risk that grants will be given for projects that are not of general interest."
"This amendment cannot, therefore, be accepted."
"Amendment 5 refers to the contribution rate for the most expensive items, i.e. patrol vessels and aircraft."
"Increasing the rate to up to 75% of the eligible expenditure will reduce appropriations for other actions."
"The Commission considers a rate not exceeding 50% to be appropriate, as a general rule, for all kinds of investment."
"It cannot, therefore, accept this amendment."
"Finally, the Commission cannot accept 7, since at the end of 2006 most of the projects will not yet have been completed, meaning a report on the decision will be of little use."
"I should like to recall that the Commission will present a report on this decision to the European Parliament by 30 June 2008 at the latest."
"Concerning Mr Morillon’s oral question to the Commission, may I say that I fully share the view that sanctions, including in the fisheries sector, must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offences committed."
"They must also effectively discourage any further infringement of the same nature."
"Moreover, sanctions should be non-discriminatory between nationals and non-nationals of Member States."
"We cannot achieve compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy without creating a level playing field across the European Union for all fishermen."
"With a view to promoting transparency and to encouraging the application of adequate and dissuasive sanctions against those who commit serious infringements, the Commission publishes an annual communication on serious infringements to the rules of the community fisheries policy."
"The Commission has published four of these communications so far."
"In its comments on the tables annexed to the communications, the Commission stressed the need to reduce existing disparities regarding the level of sanctions imposed across the Community."
"On the same communications, the Commission has also declared its preference for the use of administrative procedures and sanctions when dealing with breaches of the common fisheries policy rules, since they are imposed in a swifter manner and are more effective."
"The Commission believes that a sanction, such as the suspension of an authorisation to fish, decided by the administrative authority and entering into force immediately, subject to the possibility of a judicial review, is a stronger deterrent."
"The choice, however, between a penal or administrative procedure lies with the Member State."
"In conformity with Article 25(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, the basic regulation on the CFP, the Commission intends to present in due time a proposal aimed at harmonising at Community level sanctions for serious infringements."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, fisheries control is an important factor in sustaining the sector."
"In view of the need to recover certain at-risk fish stocks, support for the Member States must continue in such a way that they can meet their obligations to control, monitor and inspect fisheries activities in the areas under their jurisdiction."
"The strategic discussion of 2001, when control strategies were among the most important axes of the Green Paper of that year, led to the Fisheries Control Agency being set up in April 2005, and this may yet, in my view, herald a new era."
"Although this agency organises and coordinates the control and inspection activities carried out by the Member States, it has not taken the Member States’ powers and obligations away altogether."
"As we await a decision on the financial perspective and the new Community framework for 2007-2013, these amounts are as yet unknown and as such Decision 465/2004 should be extended."
"I wish to congratulate my compatriot Mr Casaca on his excellent work as rapporteur on this issue."
"Commissioner, despite your remarks, I feel that the amendments made to the original text are indeed appropriate; they would help strike a better balance and make the text more consistent with what it is actually trying to achieve."
"Nevertheless, although I lend my wholehearted support to this document I should once again like to draw attention to the fact that it remains extremely difficult, from a financial point of view, for the Member States to implement all of the desired measures."
"The Commission’s 2003 communication and reports of non-compliance with the common fisheries policy (CFP) are evidence that much remains to be done."
"In order to ensure that the Member States honour their commitments to comply with the rules laid down by the CFP the Commission must continue to support its commitment to control and inspection."
". Mr President, there can be no doubt that Decision 2004/465/EC, on a Community financial contribution towards Member States’ fisheries control programmes, has helped to improve both control structures and the provision of funding for controls in the individual Member States, and to make the flow of information more efficient."
"It has also made it possible to confer greater powers on EU inspectors in the field of monitoring and control."
"Control programmes are always and everywhere regarded as a nuisance, and often as discrimination, by those who have to undergo the controls."
"It is an unfortunate fact, however, that controls on fishing activities under the common fisheries policy are indispensable, as we have learnt from experience."
"The success of any legal framework depends on the effectiveness and ease of controls on compliance with the rules it lays down."
"It goes without saying that the measures carried out in the framework of these control programmes cost money, and that the necessary funding should accordingly be provided for them."
"We therefore support the rapporteur’s proposal to extend the period of validity of Decision 2004/465/EC by one year."
"This would safeguard the Community financial contribution towards the fisheries control programmes at least until the end of 2006, even if the budgetary environment changes."
"We concur with the rapporteur’s assessment of the amendments outlined by the Commission in the proposal for a decision, and we should also like to thank him."
". Mr President, I would like to thank the author of the oral question and Mrs Attwooll for presenting it, particularly as she is missing her group’s Christmas party this evening by being here, which shows her true dedication."
"The question of sanctions and whether they are criminal or administrative is very important."
"Obviously nobody within this House would condone a breach of the regulations or rules."
"It is appropriate that we are having this debate as a joint debate with the Casaca report, because the whole issue of fishery control measures and what is required is one that not only can deliver more environmentally and economically sustainable fisheries; it can also give certainty to many fishing families, so that they can continue to live their lives in the way that they have enjoyed up to now."
"However, outside the question regarding the effects on stocks and stocking levels, and the new rules and regulations with regard to fishing effort and everything else, there is a further layer of bureaucracy which has a direct impact on the fishermen’s ability to make a living."
"Commissioner, you have stated on a number of occasions that you have a preference for administrative sanctions as against criminal sanctions."
"There has also been the question of giving certainty with regard to some form of uniformity: not a harmonisation but a uniformity of sanctions and penalties as they apply across the Member States."
"Mrs Attwooll mentioned some of the divergences in her presentation."
"I would like to give you a few more figures from the last Commission report received relating to fisheries offences."
"There were 1 785 offences in Spain; 1 641 of them were dealt with by administrative sanctions."
"There were 1 579 offences in Portugal; three of them were dealt with by criminal sanctions."
"Out of a total of 26 offences in my own country, Ireland, 20 were dealt with by the criminal courts."
"The average fine in Portugal was EUR 491; the average fine in Spain was EUR 2 126."
"The average fine in Ireland was EUR 11 978, which under proposed new legislation to be introduced next year will increase to EUR 220 000."
"Obviously, there must be some fairness and equity with regard to the way that these fines and penalties are imposed."
"Ultimately, it is up to the Member States to put in place the legislation to transpose properly the ideology behind the fisheries regulations and directives."
"There must also be equity and proportionality within that sanction regime."
"There must be a preference towards administrative sanctions rather than criminal sanctions."
"There has been some talk recently in certain quarters that the Commission was considering taking action against Ireland for failure to implement new legislation, which is currently going through the national parliament in Ireland."
"Indeed, officials from your own office, Commissioner, recently met representatives of the fisheries committee in the Irish Parliament, as well as meeting members of the Committee on Fisheries here in the European Parliament, to discuss the issue of criminal sanctions and administrative sanctions."
"I hope these rumours of so-called financial sanctions to be taken against Ireland are untrue."
"I hope that tonight you could encourage us with the legislation that exists in Malta, where for a small offence, a small sanction applies – administrative only."
"For a larger offence, a larger administrative sanction applies."
"For a serious offence, a criminal sanction will apply."
"For a continuous offender, then there should be the most rigorous enforcement of criminal sanctions."
"But there is no equity or fairness when a logbook offence in one country leads to a fine of only EUR 96, whereas in another country this could lead to the confiscation of boat, catch and gear."
"There must be proportionality."
"Mr President, I am somewhat intrigued by the background giving rise to the oral question before the House."
"Since 1999, countries that obey the rules have been honouring Council Regulation (EC) No 1447/1999, which required proportional, effective and dissuasive penalties with regard to serious infringements of the common fisheries policy."
"It is no surprise to find that the United Kingdom is at the top of the class in its dedication to meeting the Commission’s demands, whereas some of those countries that speak the loudest about their commitment to the European project – such as Spain and Germany – are among the main defaulters."
"The latest figures of serious CFP infringements are – as we have heard – those published by the Commission for 2003."
"They show that the average fine in the United Kingdom was almost EUR 78 000 whereas the EU average was a mere EUR 4 500."
"On the serious matter of falsifying records, the UK average fine was EUR 132 000 while in Germany it was a derisory EUR 98 – but EUR 98 more than in the Republic of Ireland which, according to those official Commission figures, had no penalties to declare in 2003, although it belatedly admitted that it had 103 serious infringements!"
"Wherever the last speaker conjured up his figures, he certainly did not conjure them up from the published Commission figures."
"It is not without significance that only when a red-faced Dublin Government published proposals for penalties to deal with this issue that, at the behest of Irish MEPs and others, this oral question was raised."
"Let me make it clear: I see merit in equitable and proportionate penalties across the EU, but I am less than impressed by the fact that, so long as the fishermen of the United Kingdom were bearing the brunt of punitive action, nobody cared."
"But once one of the free-wheeling states is asked to pedal, then there are cries for equity, for fairness and for a level playing field."
"The disparity that has been in operation for years has a practical detriment for those states that have been complying."
"Take the situation in the Irish Sea, where most of the fishermen from my country, Northern Ireland, have to compete to fish."
"There, we compete with fishermen from the Republic of Ireland, whereas the Northern Ireland fisherman for years has been subject to those draconian UK penalties."
"Indeed, at present, some Ulster fishermen are awaiting trial in Liverpool Crown Court."
"Yet, for years it seems that their southern counterparts have had the benefit of flouting the rules without serious penalty."
"Think what that does to competitiveness."
"Every time the Northern Ireland fisherman goes to sea, he has to factor in the risk of savage penalty if he seriously infringes the CFP, but, according to the Commission’s figures, the Republic of Ireland fisherman in the same waters has no worries at all."
"Until now, his government has not seemed to bother about serious infringement."
"So, by all means, let us have parity of treatment, but let us understand the detriment suffered to date by those who, for years, have kept to the rules on pain of savage punishment."
"How, Commissioner, is that historic wrong to be righted?"
"You said tonight that you very much favour administrative sanctions."
"If that is so, would you now publicly support and encourage the United Kingdom to discontinue its present prosecutions?"
"That would greatly help."
"Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate, as I believe it gives us the chance to raise the difficult degrees of sanctions imposed on the fishing fleets in different Member States of the European Union."
"We have heard from various Members about the disparities in fines and controls in Member States, which I do not have enough time to address now."
"In the United Kingdom, draconian measures have been introduced."
"Now draconian measures are being proposed in the Republic of Ireland."
"As the previous speaker said, the British Government has had these implemented perfectly from day one, as it always does, while everybody else lags behind."
"There is nothing new in that, however, and we should not be surprised at it."
"Our fishermen and farmers, and many other industries, have suffered this state of affairs, whilst the situation in other states barely compares."
"The result of this European Directive, implemented by the Member States, is a total disparity among the Member States."
"This is unacceptable and unworkable."
"Like the previous speaker, I come from Northern Ireland."
"A very small off-shore fleet operates in Box 7A in the Irish Sea, subject to the draconian rules imposed by the British Government."
"They are now going to be facing the draconian rules introduced by the Republic of Ireland Government."
"At times they fish in those waters and there is great cooperation among the fishermen in those areas."
"However, that is of little use to the fishermen if, as the previous speaker says, they find themselves before the courts."
"This is the type of directive that brings the European Union into total disrepute in the Member States, as there is no semblance of a level playing field."
"You talked about a level playing field."
"It does not exist."
"There should be proportionality and equal treatment."
"I realise that there is no easy solution."
"You know that yourself, as you recently visited Northern Ireland."
"I understand that, but I believe the Commission must urgently review this entire issue of sanctions in the fisheries sector."
"Let me make it clear."
"I believe we require sanctions and controls."
"There is no question about that and we are not advocating anything else."
"However, we must be realistic and they must be able to be implemented, unlike these present and unacceptable proposals."
"As the fishing industry goes to Brussels next week to look to its future and fate on tax and quotas, this is the type of problem they do not need to face."
"I would like to leave you with one point, if you will allow me."
"I want to put one question to the Commission."
"It does not help us to stand in this House tonight and trade insults with each other, about what this or that Member State does."
"In the long term, we need each Member State to respect each other’s position."
"You said you were going to harmonise sanctions."
"So when are you going to come forward with the proposals?"
"– Mr President, I listened to your speech, Commissioner, with enormous interest, and, with the greatest of respect, I should like you to clarify your highly ambivalent position on Amendments 2 and 6, which were repeatedly supported by the Commission in the clearest terms, both in the Committee on Fisheries and via email."
"It was on the basis of this explicit support that we jointly drew up the budgetary amendments with the aim of adapting these very amendments – 2 and 6 – and now you tell us that the Commission does not support what it has been saying all along it supports."
"It would appear that there have been some confusing messages on this matter, and I should like you to clarify matters, Commissioner. Otherwise, I shall have a great deal of difficulty in working with the Commission in future."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by saying – on the previous point made by Mr Casaca – that when preparing the allocation of grants, the Commission examines the requests submitted by Member States, taking into account the needs and efficiencies of each Member State, as they result mainly from the national programme and from the earlier report on control activities, which each Member State must transmit to the Commission."
"Priority is given to those investments which are deemed more cost-effective, bearing in mind the general interest in achieving a high level of control throughout the Community."
"Therefore, priority may change over the years and be different for different Member States."
"I totally agree with Mr Kindermann that control and enforcement is a cornerstone of the effectiveness of the common fisheries policy."
"I am committed to continuing to strengthen control and enforcement activities."
"The establishment of the control agency this year will certainly make an important contribution in this area."
"On the points raised by Mrs Attwooll, Mr Crowley and other speakers with regard to the whole question of sanctions, let me say that the main trend, as published in the communication, shows that the total number of serious infringements has varied considerably from one year to another – from 4 180 in 2000 to 9 502 in 2003."
"It is difficult to know if this increase in the infringements detected means that the rate of detection of serious infringements is improving or if the number of infringements committed has increased."
"One notable element of progress with regard to deterrence is the fact that the average amount of fines imposed has increased from EUR 1 757 in 2002 to EUR 4 664 in 2003 – that is an increase in one year of 165%."
"However, the fact that fines imposed in 2003 amount to only 0.004% of the value of landings in 2002, makes us think that fines remain too modest to represent a real deterrent for rule breakers."
"Having said that, this is a general statement, and one would have to look into the various subsectors and offences with regard to which these fines have been imposed."
"Some conclusions from the previous communications are, firstly, that there are substantial differences between the average penalties applied – as a number of Members have made clear tonight – and that the amount of penalties remains too low to represent an effective deterrent against non-compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy."
"Regarding whether criminal procedures or administrative procedures are the best option, Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 foresees that Member States are to take appropriate measures against responsible persons when the common fisheries rules have not been respected."
"Member States can prosecute infringements through criminal or administrative procedures, provided that these measures are effective and proportionate to the seriousness of the infringements."
"The Commission cannot otherwise interfere in the choice of the instrument by individual Member States."
"This could touch upon the sensitive issue of state sovereignty."
"Having said that, I repeat that it is the Commission’s view that administrative procedures – and thus administrative sanctions – are preferable."
"They are preferable because they can be imposed swiftly by an administrative authority, as this does not require the lengthy process involved in establishing liability before sanctions can be imposed in criminal proceedings."
"They are less expensive than judicial proceedings."
"Non-criminal sanctions can be swiftly imposed and have been seen to be more effective than more severe penal sanctions."
"For instance, an administrative sanction, such as suspension of a fishing permit, may be an effective way to encourage compliance, as it can be applied quickly."
"I regret that the majority of Member States do not use this tool more often."
"The sanction – be it criminal or administrative – must be tailored to the seriousness of the infringement."
"Mitigating or aggravating factors include: a negative impact of the violation on fisheries resources or type of fish; previous conduct of the violators; repetition of the same infringement; and the estimated economic benefits deriving from the infringement."
"The Commission has launched a consultation process on improving the quality of data collected and reported and the analysis of this data, in order to compare the situation between Member States."
"Furthermore, the Commission intends to propose a catalogue of sanctions to be imposed in cases of serious infringements, for adoption by the Council, as foreseen in Article 25(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002."
"The catalogue should help to increase the level of sanctions and contribute to the establishment of a more level playing field."
"This catalogue is scheduled to be presented by the Commission in the second half of 2007."
"As I have already said, the discrepancies are, therefore, large and our preference is for administrative sanctions, since they are more effective and can be implemented quickly."
"In reply to a specific point that was made, I would say that our proposal for the harmonisation of sanctions for serious infringements will be published in 2007."
"We hope that this will create a more level playing field and, at the same time, address the issue of proportionality."
"With regard to the last point, which was raised by Mr Casaca, concerning Amendments 2 and 6, I apologise."
"The information that I have is that these amendments were not supported in committee."
"However, I will look into this and contact him tomorrow before the vote."
"– The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"– The next item is the report by Mr Morillon (A6-0385/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol setting out, for the period from 18 January 2005 to 17 January 2011, the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Seychelles on fishing off Seychelles [COM(2005)0421 – C6-0321/2005 – 2005/0173(CNS)]."
". Mr President, before I outline the Commission’s position on this dossier let me first extend my gratitude to the Committee on Fisheries, and especially to its Chairman and rapporteur Mr Morillon for his excellent work carried out within the very tight deadlines."
"As you are all aware, the Commission procedures have delayed the finalisation of this proposal."
"The Commission is endeavouring to prevent similar delays occurring in the future."
"We are currently undertaking internal consultations to see how best to overcome the delays which result in very short timeframes being given to the European Parliament to consider the reports."
"I hope to be able to report to the Committee on Fisheries on possible solutions in the near future."
"In the meantime I want to apologise to the rapporteur for the very tight deadlines he had to work within, and I personally commit myself to discuss with him and to search for and find a solution with regard to the future modus operandi."
"On this dossier I would like to say that we informed the Seychelles authorities of the delay in the adoption procedure at an early stage."
"The Seychelles authorities have shown great understanding."
"As the honourable Members are aware, the Community has a long-standing relation with the Seychelles in the fisheries area."
"The first fisheries agreement with the country dates back to 1985 and this is one of the most important tuna agreements in financial terms."
"It is also the cornerstone of the network of our tuna agreements in the Indian Ocean."
"This new Protocol is the first one that fully reflects the new partnership approach."
"Both parties subscribe to a political dialogue on fisheries issues and in particular the fisheries sector policy defined by the Government of the Seychelles."
"More than one third of the financial contribution has been earmarked in support of the Seychelles fisheries policy."
"In line with this desire, the Commission has had a joint committee meeting in April and two technical meetings in July and September 2005 with the Seychelles authorities in order to start the political dialogue on the establishment of a multiannual sector programme to support the development of responsible fisheries in the Seychelles."
"This work includes the establishment of annual and multiannual objectives, the distribution of a part of the financial compensation, the aims to be attained and criteria and procedures to be followed, in order to allow for an evaluation of the yearly results obtained in accordance with Article 7 of the Protocol."
"In this manner, both parties are firmly committed to responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries in the Seychelles waters."
"The new Protocol covers a six-year period from 18 January 2005 to 17 January 2011."
"It grants fishing opportunities for 40 tuna seiners and 12 surface longliners and foresees a financial contribution of EUR 4 125 000 per year."
"The Protocol is of mutual benefit to both parties."
"I shall now turn to the amendments."
"On Amendment 1 we fully share Parliament’s concern and appreciate the speedy procedure undertaken notwithstanding the short time-frames given to them."
"As I said before, the Commission informed the Seychelles authorities of this delay at an early stage."
"The Seychelles authorities have shown great understanding and have accepted to receive the payment of the financial compensation for the first year of the agreement at a later date."
"As I have stated above, the delays in the transmission result mainly from the nature of negotiations, but also because of the length of time involved in internal procedures."
"In view of this and of my commitment to find a solution, I seek the rapporteur’s understanding of our inability to accept this amendment."
"On Amendment 2, as stated in Article 7 of the Protocol, it is up to the coastal state, in agreement with the Community, to decide on the way the financial contribution will be used in support of its fisheries policy."
"It is therefore the responsibility of the Seychelles authorities to identify the main priorities of their fisheries policy to be implemented with the assistance of the Fisheries Protocol."
"Therefore I am unable to accept this amendment."
"As regards Amendments 3 and 5, the Commission is entirely in agreement with their spirit."
"However, the Commission already complies with the transmission of this kind of information, in line with both the current interinstitutional arrangements and in particular with the framework agreement between the Commission and the European Parliament."
"The Commission therefore considers that these amendments are not really necessary, if my information is right."
"Amendment 4 cannot be accepted by the Commission."
"May I recall the basic Community provisions concerning the mandate of the Commission to negotiate on behalf of the Community."
"The Council has authorised the Commission to negotiate fisheries arrangements between the Community and the Seychelles."
"Against this background, the periodic renewal does not require a new mandate each time."
"There is no need for a new mandate, given that the existing mandate covers these negotiations’ objectives."
"On Amendment 6, the new Protocol does not contain any targeted measures but a support to the Seychelles fisheries policy – Article 7 of the Protocol –promoting responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries in Seychelles waters."
"We fully share the concern to keep the EP informed on the various aspects of the implementation of the Protocol."
"However, the Commission already complies with the transmission of such information in line with the current interinstitutional arrangements."
"Therefore the Commission considers that this amendment is not really necessary."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, you have already outlined the contents of the partnership agreement and explained to us that it is one of the first – if not the first – to be negotiated by the Commission as part of the new philosophy agreed by the Council in July 2004."
"I am sure General Morillon will be pleased when I convey to him your commitment to trying to find a resolution to the problem of timing."
"The Committee on Fisheries would like you to think again about your acceptance of amendments."
"We had the final proposal submitted to us on 18 October this year, 14 days after the deadline for first payment."
"I accept that you had already spoken about it with officials in the Seychelles and they were very understanding, but this again was nine months after the agreement was due to come into force."
"We appreciate the exigencies of negotiating a new type of agreement but we on the Fisheries Committee feel that we want to be kept better informed about what is going on."
"We also want to have some kind of input into the kind of agreement that is being reached, hence the emphasis that the financial contribution must be used for the development of coastal populations living on fisheries."
"I revert to the point I made earlier this evening that we are now talking about fisheries partnership agreements in which both sides acquire rights but also take on obligations."
"There is a feeling on the part of the Fisheries Committee that we want to know what is going on, we want the Commission to submit a report to us and to the Council on the application of the agreement and on the conditions under which it was implemented, and to include a cost/benefit analysis."
"If we do not have that kind of information, when it comes to renewal, how can we give a considered opinion on the merits of the new agreement?"
"Please, Commissioner, with regard to our amendments, I would be very grateful if you could see what the Fisheries Committee is trying to achieve in this respect: fuller involvement of the European Parliament, not an attempt to take over the Commission’s negotiating mandate, but to have a real input into what is being decided."
"It is European taxpayers’ money that is involved."
"We are sure that the Commission is doing its very best to ensure that it is put to good use, but we are part of the budgetary authority."
"We would like to be reassured that we can have the observation and control, which is part of our mandate."
"Please, Commissioner, think again about those amendments."
"I am sure that the Members of the Fisheries Committee and General Morillon, in particular, would be most grateful to you."
". – Mr President, thank you very much for your words, Commissioner."
"I believe that the Fisheries Agreement with the Seychelles demonstrates clearly that the objectives of this Community policy are in very good health, despite the criticisms from some quarters, and that this kind of protocol is still essential in order to maintain competitiveness and employment for the Community sector, while it is increasingly involved in the promotion of more responsible fisheries systems outside of Community seas."
"The activity planned for 40 seiners and 12 long liners will enable the Seychelles to benefit, as has been said, from more than EUR 4 million per year, of which 36% will be intended to support their fisheries sector."
"If we add the contribution of shipowners through various elements, however, such as advances for licences, levies, taxes, provisions and the salaries of island seamen, this figure rises, as indicated in the Commission’s assessment report, Mrs Attwooll, to between EUR 17 and 20 million, since, furthermore, Victoria, which is the base port for the whole of the tuna fleet in the Indian Ocean, creates great wealth for the Seychelles."
"In view of this, Commissioner, I believe that this is the time to demand that the Commission give better treatment to shipowners, through the implementation, once and for all, of agreements of a regional nature, which prevent unnecessary multiplications of certain aspects that appear in all of the protocols of the region, in this case the Indian Ocean, such as the need to have an agent in each country, or to take on board seamen in each coastal State and also observers for each of the protocols, while, through rotating systems, all of the countries could benefit equally without leading to ridiculous and indiscriminate increases in costs for shipowners."
"For some time the Commission itself has recognised the need to establish this kind of agreement for fleets that fish within a single area, and I would therefore call upon the Commission, together with Community tuna shipowners, to work to take steps forward that can bee seen as significant in this area."
". Mr President, I shall comment very briefly on this agreement, since it is very late and this is not the time."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for what he has said, because I believe that his views largely coincide with my own, and everybody in this House is well aware that I am one of the Members of this Parliament who are very pleased every time that a new fisheries agreement is signed."
"The EEC/Seychelles Fisheries Agreement is the most significant tuna agreement that the European Community has reached with a third country, and, as I believe some Members have said, it is the cornerstone of the Community fleet’s activity and presence in the Indian Ocean."
"So it is not that this agreement is important in itself, which it is, but also that it has many not just economic, but also geostrategic, implications, because the Seychelles, and specifically the port of Victoria, are an obligatory stop-off point for our fleet operating in this ocean, both for unloading and for docking and provisions."
"Nevertheless, Commissioner, though I am happy about the signature of this agreement, I feel I must criticise the slowness and delays with which the procedure has been applied in this case."
"The first payment of financial compensation – and I believe that this has also been mentioned – should have happened in September and, at that time, the formal consultation of the European Parliament had not even arrived."
"Our internal procedure must be carefully reviewed, so that we can identify our deficiencies and put them right, because it is not logical for our fleet to be fishing as a result of the good will of the third country."
"The delays only reduce the European Union’s credibility in the eyes of other powers such as, in this case, Japan, which are much quicker to fulfil their obligations."
". – Mr President, the Court of Auditors recently remarked that 90% of EU activity is open to fraud."
"So, we come to the award of fishing rights to the EU fleets in waters around the Seychelles."
"A loophole exists in these agreements, whereby EU fleet owners have been known to complete a trawler’s fishing to gain full hulls, and then declare technical problems."
"They are then allowed to replace this trawler with a new one on the same licence, so they get two trawlers full for the price of one."
"It does not stop there: they repeat it time and again, on the same licence, citing this bogus technical problem several times over – and one wonders why fish stocks are depleted!"
"The second half of this scam is to declare ‘zero catch’, so there are no EU contributions to the country in question, and deprivation becomes acute."
"People from several African countries say that everyone knows the huge fraud taking place in their waters under these EU agreements."
"On top of that, we have the new Seychelles agreement, following the agreements for Martinique, Madagascar and the Cape Verde Islands, agreed and approved in this House within the last year – and may I say, to the shame of this House."
"Modern, big EU trawlers force these local fishermen out of business, landing catches at prices with which they cannot compete. A good slice of the economy of a third world country is destroyed, all because EU fleets, due to their reckless rape of their own seas, now move on to other targets."
"I note that Commissioner Borg disagreed with me in my last speech, saying that the problem was over-fishing, which is precisely what I said in my own comments."
"It is not long before the new waters around these islands are fished out."
"The EU trawlers then move on, leaving a deeply wounded economy: fishermen out of work and waters deprived of stock, so that the locals cannot restart properly."
"And the EU says it wants to help the third world!"
"Mr President, I must confess I rise to speak in this debate feeling a sense of anger, not least that it is 11.35 p.m. and many of us have missed our Christmas parties, but because we are here debating the eighth renewal of the fisheries agreement between the EU and the Seychelles, which would normally be considered a matter of simple routine."
"This agreement, as other speakers have said, was due to enter into force on 18 January 2005."
"EU fishing vessels have been fishing continuously in the Seychelles' waters since January 2005."
"However, the Seychelles Government has not yet received a single euro, as we have heard."
"We are taking their fish without paying them a cent."
"We must remember that the Seychelles was one of the countries affected on 26 December last year by the tsunami."
"As we know, it was the fishing communities that were hardest hit by that disaster."
"Here we are, in the European Union, exacerbating the problem by allowing our distant-water European fleet to fish in their waters, yet a year later we still have not paid them one cent."
"How is it possible that this protocol was not submitted to the European Parliament until mid-October 2005, 10 months after the commencement of the agreement and two weeks after the first payment was due?"
"The second instalment under this agreement is due next month and yet we are here at 11.40 p.m. still debating the text of the protocol, all our amendments to which the Commissioner has rejected."
"What are we doing here?"
"Are we here simply to rubber-stamp a Commission proposal when there is not even the slightest hint of humility, of acknowledgement of this delay and acceptance of the Fisheries Committee’s amendments?"
"The Council says it is anxious that Parliament should deliver its opinion as soon as possible."
"The new protocol was signed by the two parties on 23 September 2004, and yet the Council did not request that Parliament should be consulted until 14 October 2005, more than a year later."
"I am well aware of all the internal procedural problems."
"I am well aware that we have to seek 21 different translations of all these protocols, but we have been aware of these shortcomings for a long time."
"Steps should have been taken to ensure that this process was speeded up."
"This situation is intolerable."
"It is grossly unfair to fish in the waters of the Seychelles or any other country while withholding payment from them."
"We have to ensure that this never happens again."
". Mr President, first of all, with regard to the four amendments that have been tabled, I repeat that, concerning acceptance or otherwise of Amendment 1, which is to a recital, it would not give any added value."
"I undertake to discuss this with the president of the Committee on Fisheries and with the committee itself, in order to find some solution on a permanent basis, so that the situation can be resolved, hopefully, once and for all, and the Fisheries Committee will have sufficient time to make its necessary evaluation and give its advice on the proposed agreements accordingly."
"Concerning Amendment 2, as stated in Article 7 of the Protocol, it is up to the coastal State, in agreement with the Community, to decide on the way the financial contribution will be used in support of its fisheries policy."
"It is, therefore, the responsibility of the Seychelles authorities to identify the main priorities of their fisheries policy to be implemented with the assistance of the Fisheries Agreement."
"Therefore, the scope of Amendment 2 would run against such a right exercised by the third country with which such agreements are negotiated, although we try to influence and have indications within the parameters of the agreement reached on the uses of the funds."
"Certainly, the development of coastal populations living on fisheries is an area which we try to impress upon the States concerned and which should be given top priority."
"On Amendment 3, we fully share the concern to keep the European Parliament informed of the various aspects of the implementation of the Protocol."
"The Commission already complies with the transmission of such information in line with the current interinstitutional arrangements."
"However, I will look at ways and means to improve this communication and discussion process with the European Parliament."
"I cannot, however, commit myself here and now to accepting the amendment before I assess the full implications on the resources available at my DG, with the increased responsibilities that we have, without any increase in the number of people."
"This task was a problem – we are speaking about some 30 agreements – and I need to carry out an assessment of what this would imply before I can give positive commitments."
"I will certainly try to find ways and means whereby we can improve this process and hopefully have that included in future agreements; once we include it in one, it will become a standard feature in all agreements."
"I need to underline that I must be certain that if we undertake commitments, we will be able physically to fulfil them."
"The problem that we have faced so far lies in the length of the internal procedures, the consultations at an early stage with the Member States, and the translation requirements that have increased considerably – Mr Stevenson made reference to that."
"We hope to find a solution in the short term and I will be discussing it with General Morillon in January, so that we can work out a solution which I hope will be acceptable to the Fisheries Committee and will not have a repeat of such occurrences, which are embarrassing to the Commission and leave the European Parliament without real time to effect its rightful functions."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"Written Declaration No 52/2005, by David Martin, Neil Parish, Peter Skinner, Terence Wynn and Robert Evans, on rising international concern over the farming of bear bile in China, has been signed by the majority of Members of this Parliament."
"In accordance with Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure, it will be forwarded to the institutions named therein and will be published, indicating the names of the signatories, together with the texts approved on 17 January 2006."
"Mr President, I rise on behalf of all the authors to thank everybody in this Chamber who has signed this declaration."
"It has received cross-party, cross-nationality support and it will now go forward to the Commission and the Council."
"I think it is something the Chinese Government will really take notice of, because I believe bear farming in China must be brought to an end."
"I thank everybody for their support and I hope this will go forward with great vigour."
"Finally, I would like to wish you all a happy Christmas."
"Mr President, I am asking for the floor under Rule 145 on personal statements, which allows me to speak for up to three minutes;"
"I will not take that much time."
"Mr President, the verbatim report of Tuesday’s part-session has only just been made available to us, and it has brought to my attention a personal attack made against me by a man who, until then, I had believed was presiding over the sitting courteously and impartially."
"I am referring to the vice-president of the sitting in question, who saw fit to interrupt me and to take sides regarding the background to my dispute with the French Government. His reference to a historical fact – the tragedy of the Struthof camp – even shows that he is completely ignorant of the ins and outs of this tragedy, and of the most recent work of historians on this subject."
"The president of the sitting also saw fit to make a comment following one of my colleagues’ speeches, even though it contained no personal attacks and no insulting comments."
"In all of my considerable parliamentary experience, I have never seen a sitting president act as arrogantly as Mr McMillan Scott and I find it deeply regrettable."
"Mr President, I was indeed in the Chair when Mr Gollnisch made an explanation of vote."
"He had his full time, I did cut him off and I did make a remark concerning the case that he had raised, in a personal capacity."
"I suggest that the House might like to read what I said, because I think they will agree with me and not with Mr Gollnisch."
"We shall proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as is customary at the start of the vote, the general rapporteur presents some technical corrections."
"As I do not wish to break with this tradition this year either, allow me to outline some such technical corrections."
"I should like, however, to begin by expressing my thanks, because this job has been difficult but, at the same time, extremely satisfying."
"I therefore take this opportunity to warmly thank all my colleagues from the Committee on Budgets, its chairman Mr Lewandowski, the political groups’ coordinators and staff, and the Secretariat and all its members, above all the administrator who made certain that I received the constant, loyal and expert assistance of Richard Wester, assistance that tied in well with the meticulous expertise of my assistant, Annalisa Gliubizzi."
"My thanks go to all of you too, beginning with Mr Borrell, who closely followed all the stages of the procedure, and in addition, of course, to all my fellow Members, who made their own contributions via ideas and proposals, and who I hope today will also use their vote to contribute to a positive outcome, honouring me with their trust."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this truly represents a positive outcome, a sign of a trend that is being reversed, the credit for which goes to all the institutions, but – and I say this with a real sense of pride – above all to our Parliament."
"I hope that this outcome opens the minds of those who still do not wish to recognise how costly a non-Europe would be."
"The technical tasks to be performed are as follows: firstly, following the adoption or imminent approval of a number of legal bases, we should release the appropriations placed in reserve for a series of budget lines."
"I should like to make it clear that this is only technically possible for those budget lines on which an amendment tabled by Parliament already existed."
"Where that is not the case, we call on the Commission to put forward a proposal for a virement as soon as possible."
"The lines in question are 02 01 04 04; 04 01 04 05; 04 05 01; 04 05 02; 04 05 03; 09 03 01; 11 07 01; and 24 02 02."
"Secondly, the section of Amendment 209 relating to line 19 08 02 01 – on the MEDA Programme – is approved in the sum of EUR 25 056 550."
"This amendment is covered by the vote on Block 1."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following these technical corrections, I propose we proceed to the vote and I also take this opportunity to give you all my best and warmest wishes for the festive period."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would just like to concur with Mr Pittella and thank all those who have worked on producing the budget for 2006, and to agree with Mr Pittella’s statement that a fine result has been achieved and that the 2006 budget is one that serves the interests of the European Union."
"I also have one technical correction, which concerns Amendment 193 of Part 11, in connection with the European Court of Justice."
"Due to technical problems the notes are missing there, but the text of the note is as follows: ‘A 3.6 per cent reduction has been made in this part in connection with staff posts: five new staff posts in the IT sector (four B3 posts and one C1 post) and 16 staff posts for Romania and Bulgaria (ten A7 posts, two B3 posts and four C1 posts)’."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to say that, if this amendment were to be rejected, then we would go beyond the ceiling agreed on with the Council and we would therefore have some procedural problems."
"I am therefore relying on my fellow Members’ sense of responsibility."
"Alright, that concludes the vote."
"Normally we would now issue the explicit agreement of Parliament and the Council on the procedure for approving the budget and the maximum rate of increase."
"But the Minister is not here yet."
"We shall therefore continue voting on other things and we shall return to it later."
"Please be courteous towards the British Presidency."
"We shall continue with the vote and meanwhile the Minister will arrive."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this really is a minimal adjustment, just to make it clearer that the letter of amendment is consistent with number two – the agreement made between Parliament and the Council – but it really is an adjustment to the form, which does not in the least affect the content."
"Mr President, I appreciate that the speed with which we vote sometimes leads us to make errors, which we believe are made when there is no call for abstentions, which are a political position that must be recorded."
"Stating simply ‘for’ and ‘against’ naturally reflects the result of the vote, but it does not reflect the particular result of certain votes, as has happened in this case, where we have wished to express various abstentions."
"We shall carry on voting and we shall continue with the Schwab report."
"But could somebody from the Secretariat please verify where the Council is."
"Mr President, I rise under Rule 145 to make a short personal statement following the remarks made by the Presidency in a debate yesterday, which I find unhelpful and not positive at all."
"Whilst I am not of the governing party of the UK, I find it very demeaning that the Council is not here this morning."
"I, and my friends and colleagues from Britain, do not want that kind of discourtesy to be thought of as normal, at least in this Chamber."
"Let us say that it has been a rather sophisticated use of Rule 145."
"Mr President, if we cannot be respectful in listening to one another, there is hardly any reason to be here."
"I rise under the precedent of Rule 145."
"I would like to inform the House that the Council left their building over an hour ago, the traffic in the vicinity of Strasbourg is extremely bad and it is not the intention of Her Majesty’s Government to slight this House or its Members."
"I am told that the government representative is five minutes away."
"I beg the House’s indulgence."
". Mr President, I should like to begin by apologising to Parliament for arriving here late this morning."
"The reason for this is simply that I was told there was an entirely different timescale."
"Because of that I arrived at what I thought to be on time, so I genuinely apologise to all Members of Parliament for that misunderstanding."
"Certainly, had I been aware of the correct timing, I would have made sure, as a matter of courtesy to Parliament, that I arrived on time. So I genuinely apologise for that misunderstanding."
"I am pleased to note that the agreement reached between our two institutions, following negotiations at the conciliation on 24 November and the trialogue on 30 November has now been included in the 2006 budget."
"I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that some small differences remain between us concerning the classification of expenditure in the budget and that the Council reserves its rights entirely in this respect."
"However, I am pleased to confirm that the Council can accept the maximum rate of increase resulting from your second reading."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lewandowski, the two rapporteurs, Mr Pittella and Mr Dombrovskis, and the Commissioner, Mrs Grybauskaitė, for their constructive cooperation in establishing this budget."
"Let us hope this is good news in terms of the delicate negotiations that are taking place as we speak in relation to the financial perspective."
"That will be in the interests of the European Union and its relationship with the people of Europe."
"I thank you very much for the work we have done together to make the 2006 budget possible."
"Once again I apologise for the misunderstanding which caused me to arrive late this morning."
"I would like to thank the Presidency-in-Office of the Council for its statement."
"Before moving on to the signature of the budget, please allow me to point out that the budget that we have just approved for 2006, in terms of commitment appropriations, represents 1.09% of gross domestic product for the 25 countries of the Union."
"In a few hours time, in Brussels, we shall examine a budget for 2007-2013 which proposes an average of 1.03% for 27 countries of the Union."
". Mr President, I would like to thank my colleagues for that very warm endorsement of my report, which marks a major step forward in the rights of disabled people and passengers of reduced mobility."
"It is a tremendous vote in favour."
"It was interesting that there were six people who decided to vote against it, but through the joys and wonders of technology we were able to name and shame them."
"I am sure the House will welcome the fact that the way Parliament voted means we will be able to get an agreement at first reading."
"All 25 governments and the Commission have indicated that they will accept all the amendments Parliament has passed."
"In thanking colleagues, allow me to mention that people will also welcome the fact that this is a major achievement under the British Presidency."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to confirm that Amendment 9, calling for the sum of EUR 40 million to be increased to EUR 80 million, has been withdrawn."
"I would like not only to confirm the withdrawal of the amendment, but also to take responsibility for it."
"The Committee on Development had adopted this amendment unanimously and I am very grateful to the members of that committee for their clear-sightedness and their support."
"The Council, however, has refused to accept even the slightest gesture towards the ACP countries, despite the position and positive actions taken by the UK Presidency, to which I can bear witness."
"The Commission, for its part, was not willing to budge an inch."
"The system, blocked due to this Parliament’s budgetary debate, did the rest and dealt the final blow."
"However, for pressing schedule reasons, Mr President, this regulation absolutely must be adopted at first reading."
"We have therefore accepted our responsibilities and withdrawn Amendment 9, which was calling for EUR 80 million."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am forced, for the reasons I have just outlined, to ask you to vote on this report, and to do so in line with your votes on the budget."
"However, in order to send a message to the ACP countries that some of us here have not forgotten them, I request that my name be deleted from the text, and I have a proposal for my fellow members of the Committee on Development, and for them alone: make a final, symbolic gesture by voting ‘no’."
"Mr President, I would just like to request a purely formal correction to paragraph 6 of the draft compromise resolution, reinstating the final phrase of the final clause starting ‘in order to’ at the end of the first part, in other words after ‘Association Council’, in order to reproduce the text on which we reached agreement."
"I would also request that, where the text simply refers to ‘the summit’, we add ‘the WSIS’ in brackets, to be consistent with the rest of the resolution and in order to avoid confusion if isolated paragraphs of the text are quoted."
"I would like to end by thanking the members of the various groups who were willing to extend the scope of this resolution to the conclusions of the summit."
"I must stress how important this resolution is now that the Sakharov Prize has been awarded and given that we in this House emphasised yesterday that freedom of expression – a fundamental right – and freedom of the press must be a part of all our activities, particularly when we have agreements with partner countries."
". – () Before we proceed to the vote, I would like to propose two more or less technical amendments."
"In paragraph 3 of my report, in the phrase ‘applicable to all three categories set out in Article 87(3)(a)’ at the end of the first line and the beginning of the second line, I would like to delete the word ‘three’, so that the text would then read ‘applicable to all categories set out in Article 87(3)(a)’."
"I would also like to propose another amendment to the paragraph, or to Amendment 31, which is essentially of a technical nature as well, but I will probably do this when we vote on this paragraph."
". – () In the last line, or in the last sentence of this paragraph, I would like to change the words ‘too brutal’ (‘príliš brutálne’ in Slovak) to the words ‘very significant’ (‘veľmi významné’)."
"So, the aim is to change the wording from ‘too brutal’ to ‘very significant’."
"Mr President, the ALDE Group would like to suggest an oral amendment to Amendment 9, so that it reads: ‘Whereas international terrorism poses one of the greatest threats to society within the EU and to those values’."
"Mr President, we would like to suggest an oral amendment to take out the word ‘NATO’, which we thought we had taken out in the negotiations anyway."
"There has been a misunderstanding."
"It should not be there."
"In which case, I propose that the split vote would be unnecessary, because the text would read: ‘including facilities pertaining to military bases such as...’."
"So we should take out the word ‘NATO’, which would enable us to vote on the recital as a whole, without the split."
"Mr President, I should just like to make a point about linguistics, something that colleagues will be interested in."
"The word ‘transportation’ is an American word; the English word is ‘transport’."
"Bearing in mind the nature of the report, we ought to have it in English."
"Mr President, I should like to propose, through an oral amendment, a merger of Amendments 14, 12 and 5."
"This concerns the very important but also sensitive issue of adoption in Romania."
"We want to propose to the Romanian Government that it settle a number of cases that are still pending, as a consequence of a moratorium on international adoption, proposed in the past by this Parliament."
"It is an important oral amendment."
"I will read it carefully so that everybody knows what we are voting for: ‘Notes with satisfaction the improvements made by Romanian authorities in the area of the protection of children and urges the Romanian Government to settle the cases of applications for international adoption made during the moratorium of June 2001, ensuring that all cases are examined in light of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Romanian law on the legal status of adoption, with the goal of allowing inter-country adoptions to take place, where justified and appropriate, in those special cases’."
"Mr President, over the past few days, I have received questions from other groups about the wording of Amendment 2, which was tabled by my group."
"Moreover, a separate debate has been held, and a vote taken, on one aspect of this subject, namely the allegations of the existence of CIA camps in Romania and elsewhere, and also on the need for an inquiry into these allegations."
"I would therefore propose that, in this amendment, we confine ourselves to the position of this candidate Member State and any incorrect actions on its part."
"We can do this by adding ‘allegations of the existence’ to the English version and deleting ‘but also to undertake informal investigations’ from it."
"I assume that, in this way, the objections to the original text would be removed."
"Mr President, I have no desire to hold up proceedings, but, as this is the last vote at which Members will be present in large numbers, I would like, on behalf of my group – and, I take it, also on behalf of all Members of the House – to thank the services most warmly for preparing the difficult votes that we have had over the past year."
"They have done a splendid job and made our work easier."
"We want to wish them a happy festive season and ask them to be just as helpful next year too."
"Mr President, I would just like to point out – not least for Mr Swoboda’s benefit – that this is not the last vote today."
"I think it is a pity that he is departing so soon for his Christmas holidays and would be happy if he were to hang around for a bit longer."
"That concludes the vote."
"We shall proceed to the explanations of vote."
". We have maintained that ACP sugar reform compensation should be at the level of EUR 80 million not EUR 40 million."
"We are also opposed to open-ended CFSP funding without adequate justification."
"We Swedish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the agreement on the 2006 budget, reached between the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"The EU budget must primarily be used to create full employment in Europe and to help bring about sustainable social, economic and environmental development."
"We particularly welcome the fact that our repeated demands for investment in the Lisbon Strategy, including more money for student exchange programmes and for the EU’s research and development programme, have been listened to."
"The payments in the agricultural category are lower than those originally proposed, and we think that this is fair."
"There is too much in the way of direct agricultural aid, and this leads to inefficient agriculture that damages the environment and widens the gap between rich and poor in the world."
"We cannot, therefore, support wordings that regret the cutbacks in agricultural aid decided on by the Council."
". The UKIP MEPs are voting for the rejection of the Draft General Budget, not because they support an increase in the budget, but on the principle that the UK should take its own decisions regarding funding priorities and not contribute to the EU budget."
"In the vote on the budget, the Social Democrats have voted in favour of block 1, involving a strengthening of central budget headings for research, development etc. It must, however, be stated, that the Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament cannot support the EU’s contributing financially to the spread of nuclear power, either within or outside the Community."
". I voted for this amendment NOT to support an increase in the budget, but because I do not wish any monies to be spent by the UK, which should rather be spent in fulfilling bilateral agreements."
"The June List is voting against all the proposals entailing further increases in costs."
"It believes that each EU budget should be limited to 1.00%."
"On budget issues, Parliament’s role should be limited to determining priorities within the budgetary framework proposed by the Council."
"Instead of accepting the Council’s first proposal concerning the level of the budget, Parliament chose, at first reading, to table amendments increasing both payments and forthcoming commitments."
"As a consequence of these proposed increases in expenditure, there were new negotiations with the Council."
"Unfortunately, the Council accepted certain increases in expenditure in the course of these negotiations."
"In spite of all this, Parliament chooses again to propose new increases in expenditure in the run-up to the second reading."
"This development is extremely regrettable and shows the importance of not increasing the European Parliament’s influence."
"I voted against because of the explanatory statement concerning growth and Turkey."
"I am opposed to short-term growth and in favour of Turkish accession, not the other way around."
"Unfortunately, I could not therefore support this proposal to reject the budget."
". The UKIP MEPs are voting for the rejection of the Draft General Budget, not because they support an increase in the budget, but on the principle that the UK should take its own decisions regarding funding priorities and not contribute to the EU budget."
". I am voting in favour of rejecting the budget, not because I am in favour of increasing it, but because I do not wish for United Kingdom funds to be spent in this way, or in any way by the European Union."
". British Conservatives support the general direction of the 2006 budget, particularly approving of increased support for the Lisbon objectives and maintaining the overall budget level at 1.01% GNI."
"However, we urge more radical reform of the overall budget."
"Regarding letter of amendment No 1, the Danish Liberal Party does not believe that the destruction of foodstuffs is appropriate."
"However, the problem is aid for production, not aid for destruction. The amendment concerns the effects of the problem, but does not tackle its cause."
"Regarding letter of amendment No 2, the Danish Liberal Party wishes to solve the problems of famine in developing countries, but believes that doing so requires a far more serious and coordinated effort than that indicated in this proposal."
"Regarding letter of amendment No 3, the Danish Liberal Party is opposed to aid for the export of live animals, but the amendment will not solve this problem."
"The wording is also fairly unclear."
"Regarding letter of amendment No 6, the Danish Liberal Party supports reform of the reimbursement of travel expenses, so that all reasonable and necessary travel expenses are refunded."
"Such reform has, however, already been decided on with the new Statute for Members."
"Moreover, the amendment could not be implemented in practice."
"Overall, Mr Bonde’s amendments have to be characterised as ill thought-out."
"We Moderates wish to develop and modernise the European Union’s budget."
"That means that we are looking for less in terms of subsidies and more in terms of investment in what is required by a modern economy and global competition. We also wish to strengthen the EU’s ability to be a strong international partner in pursuit of freedom, peace and security."
"As it currently stands, the budget is outdated and lays too much emphasis on agriculture and on subsidies to the old Member States to cover expenditure that those countries themselves should be able to meet."
"Aid from Structural and Cohesion Funds should in the first place go to the new Member States and the poor regions."
"In the light of this, we have sought an end to export subsidies and aid to tobacco cultivation and have sought to phase out agricultural aid."
"However, we wish to increase aid for research and development, as well as efforts to promote security and the development of the Neighbourhood Policy."
"The EU needs a budget, and we are therefore voting in favour of the proposal, even though we believe that it needs to be changed in significant ways."
". The 2006 budget is the last one in the 2000-2006 financial perspective and also the last one before the accession of Romania and Bulgaria on 1 January 2007."
"I have three brief comments: the share of the total budget given to agriculture and rural development is now only 43%, which gives the lie to the United Kingdom’s argument that the CAP is too expensive."
"Next, whatever the European Parliament and the Commission may say, the budget is steadily increasing unchecked: payment appropriations have increased by 5.4%, which is more than all the national budgets."
"Finally, the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council is the result of a shameful bargain negotiated behind the backs of the European citizens: the Council got what it wanted on the CFSP; in exchange, Parliament has kept its priorities: culture, youth, ecology and federalist propaganda."
"The only ones not satisfied by this budget are the European taxpayers, who are seeing their taxes increase to pay, amongst other things, their countries’ financial contributions to the European Union."
"In 2005, France paid EUR 16.7 billion."
"What will it pay in 2006 in a Union of 25 Member States, which expect better?"
". I shall use this explanation of vote as a way of reflecting on the negotiations and agreements on Community budgets."
"1."
"There have until now been more contradictions than anything else in the Council."
"Running scared, the political forces and major economic interests at the root of so-called ‘European integration’ sound their warnings of the consequences of disagreement between the so-called ‘powerhouses’ of the EU."
"A second crisis, following the resounding ‘no’ votes delivered by the French and Dutch people to the so-called ‘European Constitution’, would intensify the feeling that the path that they tell us is the only one to follow lacks ‘credibility’."
"This is why they are calling for ‘agendas’ to be harmonised, not least at the World Trade Organisation."
"2."
"It does not matter how much Parliament glosses over its complicity in the systematic reduction in the Community budget in recent years – surely this reflects the commitments made by the right-wing and social-democrat forces in the Commission, the Council and in every EU Member State – but the (cold) figures are there for all to see."
"Overlooking its previous proposals, and throwing consistency out of the window, Parliament’s proposal for 2006 is virtually equivalent to what the Luxembourg Presidency proposed for 2007-2013."
"Experience has taught us that this story is far from over; after all, Parliament has a habit of lauding today what it found unacceptable yesterday."
". Unlike the ongoing negotiations on the financial perspective, the EU’s budget for 2006 gives Parliament some cause for satisfaction."
"By keeping payment appropriations at 1.01% of EU GNI, Parliament has achieved a slight increase on last year’s figure."
"The real plus point here, however, and the reason for my full support, has been the increased funding made available for a range of programmes that impact directly on the lives of Europe’s citizens, such as LIFE and SOCRATES."
"A further reason to be pleased was the increased budget for initiatives in the area of research and support for SMEs, which are crucial if we are to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"As for structural actions, I agree with the idea of not raising the amount of future funding to the new Member States until there has been an improvement in the rate of use of the current funds."
"Lastly, by adopting this 2006 budget, Parliament will be sending out a highly symbolic message for the ongoing debate on the next financial perspective 2007-2013."
"If the perspective is not adopted before the end of the British Presidency, it will be the 2006 budget that will act as the basis for negotiations on the next annual budget, using the so-called ‘duodecimal’ system."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur again for an excellent report, while also pointing out that I believe that an error has crept in to the vote, since we should have voted on Amendment 24, moved by Mrs Lichtenberger from the Group of the Greens/Free Democratic Alliance, which would have included the automatic 60% mark-up on the infrastructure charges."
"Apart from that, I am well satisfied with the report."
"The report before us concerns the charging of heavy goods vehicles. It is an issue of great importance to the proper operation of the internal market."
"As matters stand, there are quite a few different models for road charges in the European Union, a state of affairs that can bring about a distortion of competition."
"Road tolls may be justified, enabling charges to be levied to cover environmental pollution and wear and tear on the roads."
"In today’s vote, the June List has chosen to support quite a few of the amendments in the report."
"We believe that heavy goods traffic is an important part of the internal market. We also believe that environmental problems are cross-border in character and that there is thus added value in dealing with these issues at EU level."
"– () The reason I voted for the report is that it improves on the Commission’s proposal whilst also eliminating discrimination and ensuring equal rights for all people travelling by air."
"This regulation is the first time that legislation has specifically dealt with the transport of persons with reduced mobility who are put at a disadvantage due to disability, age or for other reasons."
"I appreciate the fact that the single market in the area of air traffic services will serve all citizens equally and ensure that passengers are not refused air transport on the grounds of reduced mobility."
"The approval of the report sends a positive signal from the European Parliament to the disabled, and I feel that it will make a nice Christmas present for them as well."
". UKIP fully recognises the desirability of improving conditions for handicapped people, particularly in some states on mainland Europe."
"However, we reject the notion that improvements should be carried out under the competence of the Commission."
"This should be the sole prerogative of democratic national states."
". I voted against this proposal NOT because I wish to hinder persons with reduced mobility but because,"
"a) this should be left to member states to make appropriate arrangements"
"b) current law requires the airline to make provision, to require travel agents and booking firms do so will place an intolerable administrative burden on them, will seriously confuse the area between the agent's responsibility and the airline's, and will raise costs, and is probably against EU law."
". This report is a welcome addition to the ongoing debate on the rights of passengers with limited mobility."
"As a person with a disability, I have experienced both the best and the worst of treatment as a passenger, and should like to emphasise that, in most cases, the service providers try to achieve the maximum efficient service."
"However, there are times when particular airline rules, or, indeed, the attitude of a captain, can have a very negative impact on the travelling experience."
"The most important aspects of improving the service relate, in my opinion, to the training of personnel, as well as clear and coherent guidelines for operators across the sector."
"Also why not ask the passengers rather than assuming that their needs will be known?"
"I welcome the common agreement from the Commission and Council on this matter and congratulate the rapporteur on his ability to garner the House."
". According to non-governmental organisations, this is the first Community-level regulatory instrument specifically geared towards the 50 million or so disabled persons in the EU."
"The purpose is to ensure that disabled persons (as Parliament proposed) and persons with reduced mobility have access to air transport."
"The regulation before us establishes rules to protect and to provide assistance to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility travelling by air. This will be achieved by protecting them from discrimination, and by ensuring that they receive assistance at departure, transit and arrival airports, which should be provided at no additional cost to the passenger."
"Further initiatives include a range of measures to inform disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility of their rights."
"We welcome the idea of training ground staff and flight crew, and of ensuring that the necessary infrastructure and aircraft are in place for the service to be provided."
"We voted in favour of this initiative."
"Having worked with the disabled community for many years, I should like to give the following explanation of vote."
"Disabled persons and persons whose mobility is restricted due to disability or other conditions, such as old age, still have the same rights as other citizens."
"This also holds true when they travel by air."
"Blind and deaf and dumb people should be included in this group too, since they need appropriate access to information when they travel."
"It would be wrong to ask disabled air passengers to pay additional charges."
"A proposal should be made to include these costs in the general expenses of the individual carriers."
"After all, we are not talking about huge sums of money."
"There should be a guarantee that the needs of disabled persons will be met throughout the EU, regardless of which airline or airport they use, and assistance should be provided at each stage of their journey."
"Examples of such assistance include help when moving around the terminal, boarding or leaving the plane, collecting luggage or transferring to other flights, and the provision of a wheelchair with an attendant at the check-in counter."
"It would be advisable to ask carriers to install appropriate devices that make it easier for disabled persons to board and leave planes."
"Designers of passenger planes should also ensure that features such as gangway width and toilet size are tailored to the needs of persons with restricted mobility."
"On top of this, a uniform EU-wide system must be put in place for the provision of assistance to disabled air passengers."
"This should include the development of service standards that are mandatory in all Community airports."
"I should like to congratulate Mr Evans on his important report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the rights of persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air, to which I lend my full backing. I particularly welcome all of the amendments aimed at introducing an integrated service to facilitate access to air transport for disabled persons or persons with reduced mobility, at no extra cost to those passengers."
"Given the impact that this regulation will have on the air travel market, and the objective that the EU has set itself, this proposal should indeed take account of the difficulties experienced by people with reduced mobility, but should also take into account the difficulties of all those in need of guidance, communication or written assistance when they travel."
". I voted enthusiastically for the Evans Report, because I believe it is a significant contribution to anti-discrimination policies for people with disabilities who want the freedom to fly without hindrance."
". UKIP fully recognises the desirability of improving conditions for handicapped people, particularly in some states on mainland Europe."
"However, we reject the notion that improvements should be carried out under the competence of the Commission."
". – The objective that the Council and the European Parliament have set themselves in this field, namely the principle of an integrated service to help passengers with disabilities and reduced mobility to access air transport, is not only laudable but indispensable, because there was an urgent need for action."
"There is currently a striking disparity in situations and treatment, whether with regard to access to airports or in terms of the assistance provided by airlines and airports."
"Be it the lack of a seat for a companion to sit next to the person with reduced mobility, the lack of medical equipment on board and on the ground, such as electric wheelchairs for example, or the lack of disability awareness training for airport staff, it is obvious that the principle of equality for all passengers is not respected to the same extent in all airports and by all European airlines."
"I am also pleased to note that the efforts that must now be made by the various airlines and airports must not entail specific supplementary charges for disabled people or those with reduced mobility."
"It is the least we can do."
". I applaud this report and am delighted by the size of the majority it achieved in this house."
"Many of our citizens think that disability issues have been resolved because legislation in many of our countries has been in place for years."
"That is just not the case, the reality on the ground often does not match the aims of the legislative framework, and further urgent action is very necessary to ensure that all our citizens have access to travel."
"This is a good news story of the European Union taking action where Member States have not, and I am very very pleased to support it."
". It is not the business of the EU to run airlines."
"If recommendations of this kind are to be internationally effective the measures must be enforced by the body overseeing airlines, not the EU who like to dictate on all subjects, including the rules of football!"
". I fully recognise the desirability of improving conditions for handicapped people."
"However, I reject the notion that this should be done, by the EU on behalf of any one, let alone sovereign Nation States."
"I also reject the notion, implicit within this that agents booking any travel arrangements should bear the contractual responsibilities and liabilities of either party"
". I consider the ongoing reform of the sugar regime to be unfair on two counts:"
"1 - First for the European producers themselves, because there is a risk that the big multinational companies that consume sugar, such as Nestlé, will be the principal beneficiaries of the reform."
"The smaller producers, on the other hand, could suffer from the 31% reduction in the guaranteed price."
"2 - Above all, though, this reform is unfair to the poor sugar-producing countries."
"Once again, they are the ones who have to pay the price."
"The figures speak for themselves."
"European producers can count on a package of EUR 1.5 billion in compensation and EUR 4.2 billion for restructuring the sector, while the ACP countries currently have only the prospect of EUR 40 million."
"This amount is obscene."
"In the Committee on Development, we proposed EUR 80 million."
"Mr Lehideux’s report aims to soften some of the pernicious effects of the reform of the EU’s sugar regime, by proposing:"
"- to make the aid complementary to the other financial instruments of EU development policy,"
"- measures to diversify the economies of countries that are highly dependent on sugar, such as the islands of the Caribbean or Mauritius."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have voted in favour of the report, because it is crucial to devise accompanying measures for the Sugar Protocol countries."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament must, however, express regret about the fact that the agreement on the 2006 budget, entered into between the budget authorities, does not make it possible to increase the aid to the Sugar Protocol countries, as the proposed level of support has to be regarded as inadequate."
"The June List welcomes the reform of the EU’s sugar regime and finds it encouraging that this sector is being adapted to the market to a greater degree."
"We are critical of the EU’s export subsidies to domestic sugar producers and welcome the fact that it will be possible for sugar to be traded under fairer conditions in the future."
"Through advantageous agreements, the ACP countries have had special access to the EU’s market."
"The new organisation of the market for sugar will thus have consequences for certain ACP countries."
"The change to the organisation of the market is, however, necessary and is in the long-term interests of all the parties."
"The European Parliament’s rapporteur recommends that significant economic adjustment aid be paid to the ACP countries."
"We wish to emphasise that such measures would scarcely guarantee that necessary restructuring would be carried out."
"We are looking for clearer strategies and priorities in terms of what the financial resources are specifically to be used for."
"Otherwise, there is a significant risk that the restructuring necessary in the long term will not be implemented to the degree that is to be desired."
". As we have previously stated, we object to the premises on which the reform of the Common Market Organisation for Sugar is predicated."
"It is being used as a bargaining chip by the EU to obtain benefits in the trade in industrial goods and services, and is a further example of the liberalisation of the worldwide farming trade, a phenomenon that promotes competition and concentrates production into the framework of the international division of labour."
"This policy penalises small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector in the most economically developed countries. It also leads to monoculture, the concentration of holdings and the abandonment of farming by millions of country people in poor and developing countries, which in turn undermines their food sovereignty and safety."
"This report aims to improve upon some of the Commission’s proposals for the signatories to the Sugar Protocol, yet falls a long way short of what is required, because it does not even question, let alone reject, its basic premise, namely its liberalising approach."
"The report’s main proposal is to offset the ‘serious social, economic and environmental consequences’ that the ‘adjustment process’ will have on these countries."
"To sum this up in one sentence, the losers will be the farmers and food sovereignty, whereas the winners will be agri-business and the major distributors."
". The Lehideux report is a catalogue of good intentions with no concrete results, apart from EUR 40 million of financial support in 2006."
"The 18 ACP countries, signatories to the Sugar Protocol, export 1.6 million tonnes of cane sugar a year to the European Union at the EU price."
"The Council’s decision to reduce the price of sugar by 36% over four years will result in an equivalent reduction in their export earnings."
"The WTO is dealing a harsh blow to countries as poor as Swaziland and Malawi by forcing the European Union to reform its sugar sector on the basis of a complaint by Brazil."
"As the ACP countries have quite rightly said, the reform is too fast and too extensive."
"In reality, the only winner will be Brazil, the top worldwide exporter of cane sugar, which will take advantage of this situation to increase its share of the export market to the detriment of the ACP countries."
"At a time when the WTO is discussing the development round, this is a very poor example for the European Union to give to Africa, even if the ‘everything but arms’ initiative is an attempt to disguise our divisions and our egotism."
"This reform of the sugar regime will increase their poverty, with all the consequences you can imagine in terms of immigration."
"I support this report because it reaffirms the Council’s conclusions that the EU’s bilateral fisheries relationships should graduate from being access agreements to being ‘partnership agreements’. Such a move will contribute towards responsible fishing in the third country concerned, and ensures fishing opportunities for the EU’s distant fishing fleet."
"The agreement in question safeguards fishing opportunities for around 52 Community vessels, including five Portuguese surface longliners."
"I welcome the fact that this agreement is an instrument that will protect fisheries activities and jobs in fishing fleets, and the fact that it upholds the general principles for preserving fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy."
"The June List believes that the EU should immediately cease concluding fisheries agreements with third countries."
"The common fisheries policy has led to many European waters being depleted of fish and to irrevocable damage to sensitive marine environments."
"The fisheries policy also has devastating global consequences."
"The fisheries agreements concluded by the EU with third countries generate short-term income for the countries concluding the agreements."
"In the longer term, the agreements lead, however, to the depletion of fish stocks and make it difficult for local fishing industries to develop."
"Only a limited amount of the compensation paid out goes to the local population."
"The agreements should be paid for by those countries or fleets that choose to make use of these agreements."
"The fisheries agreements should not be concluded at all within the framework of the EU."
"The report contains a positive amendment to the effect that the financial contributions should also be used for the development of coastal populations dependent on fisheries for their living (Amendment 2)."
"The report as a whole emphasises, however, that the agreements are of benefit both to the EU and to third countries."
"We do not share this view and have thus voted against what is being proposed on this matter."
"The position that we are expressing through this explanation of vote constitutes the attitude that we have adopted on principle where this issue is concerned. The explanation of vote will thus apply to future matters of a similar kind."
". We voted in favour of the Fisheries Protocol because it guarantees fishing opportunities for the various fleets of the Member States operating in Seychelles waters until 17 January 2011, including five Portuguese surface longliners."
"The renewal of this protocol is an important factor in guaranteeing the survival of Member States’ surface longliner fishing, a section of the fleet that has been severely affected by the crisis in the fisheries sector in recent years."
"A case in point is Portugal, where the number of vessels has dwindled year on year."
"Nevertheless, even taking account of the fact that this new Protocol will last for six years, and bearing in mind the take-up levels of the fishing opportunities on offer, we must highlight the reduction in the number of surface longliners and the increased cost of licences, which we feel is unjustified. This will lead to higher equipment costs and thus a loss of income."
"It should be highlighted that there is a proposal to increase the cost of licences to EUR 1 000 for surface longliners over 150 grt and to EUR 750 for surface longliners less than 150 grt."
". I voted against this report because the Fisheries Agreements in practice merely export our own disastrous fisheries policy to the rest of the world."
"The Common Fisheries Policy is untenable, illogical and has been an unmitigated disaster."
"More so, in our Union of 25 it will collapse under the weight of its own contradictions."
"We need to ensure that EU decision making is logical, the Common Fisheries Policy is not and puts those of us who are pro-European in the unenviable position of having to explain such an illogical and disastrous policy to our increasingly rightly sceptical electorate."
". I am, of course, pleased that the fishing agreement between the EC and the Seychelles, the first agreement negotiated within the framework of the Partnership Agreements, has been extended."
"This agreement is an opportunity for all and beneficial to everyone:"
"- It will give Community vessels transparent and managed access to the fishery resources of the Seychelles;"
"- In return, the financial compensation paid by the EU will be a great support to coastal populations, by assisting in the development of certain vital economic sectors, such as the processing industry and port services."
"- I would add that the agreement allows for the option of increasing the financial compensation paid by the EC depending on catch volumes."
"That is why I support this report unreservedly."
"The only fly in the ointment now is the lack of consideration given to the European Parliament."
"It is not right that we had to wait for almost a year to receive the text of the Protocol, for administrative and technical reasons."
"I hope that, in future, the European Parliament will be more involved in monitoring this agreement throughout its lifetime."
"Hopefully that is not just pie in the sky."
". In light of the difficulties experienced by businesses and ship-owners involved in fishing in third countries arising from the gap between the expiry of one protocol and the entry into force of its replacement, I feel that the Commission’s proposal should be adopted as quickly as possible."
"I also agree with the rapporteur, however, that a more stable solution needs to be found than the one in the Commission’s proposal, a solution that would preclude the need to use a range of provisional procedures that cause problems for Community operators and the fisheries sector in the third country."
"The time that elapses between the signing of the Protocol and its adoption by the Council must be made shorter, in such a way that both provisional application and the advance issuing of licences become no more than a last resort."
". We regret the fact that our proposal in support of increasing the global financial envelope for fisheries was rejected."
"This rejection is typical of the inconsistency of both Parliament and the rapporteur; both acknowledge that the budget falls short of what is required if we are to address the economic and social crisis facing the sector, and yet despite the fact that it is one of the key issues in the report before us, it is not being increased."
"We are very pleased, on the other hand, that our proposal aimed at funding measures to promote or set up small-scale coastal fishing representative associations, and to ensure their involvement in the decision-making process of the common fisheries policy was adopted."
"This proposal was in line with the outcome of the public hearing on this section of the fleet held by Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries."
"I should like to point out that there are aspects of the current regulation on which we have reservations, due to their ramifications for the sovereignty of Member States."
"Examples of this include the role of the Community Fisheries Control Agency, and the rapporteur’s proposal to set up a framework agreement as regards the fisheries agreements with third countries."
"We therefore opted to abstain."
". I believe this report is a well balanced and thoughtful response to EU fisheries policy, which is why I supported it wholeheartedly."
". I would like to thank all colleagues who have today voted for my report."
"The overwhelming support for Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) sends a clear signal to the European Commission that these organisations require funding after the transitional period."
"RACs allow local stakeholders to have a voice in decision making which affects their local interests."
"We must now call on the Commission to come forward with clear proposals to help RACs."
". The extension of financial aid to Georgia is a practical demonstration of the EU reaching outward to our near neighbours with real assistance."
"The Caucasus countries are working hard to rebuild themselves and the EU can, must, play a role in their reconstruction and expand our area of peace and prosperity to cover them also."
"The area is not without problems, but the EU as interested and friendly outsiders can assist in dialogue and progress, so I am happy to support today's proposal and would be happy to support more."
"The Swedish Conservatives have today voted in favour of the European Parliament’s joint resolution on the Commission’s work programme for 2006."
"We believe that the Commission’s main priorities should be to develop the internal market, strengthen the EU’s foreign and security policy, continue with its work on the planned enlargement and make efforts to strengthen the EU’s competitiveness."
"We are, however, doubtful about certain parts of the resolution in which the principle of subsidiarity is not respected, for example those parts in which a desire is expressed to overhaul maternity and paternity leave in the EU and to increase efforts in the sphere of tourism."
". I fully support this Resolution, especially Para 9 which stresses the need to take full account of the quality of public services in completing the internal market; calls for a framework directive on services of general interest; insists that the single market can only be developed in a context of fair competition, fighting social dumping and promoting cohesion; calls on the Commission to contribute to the fight against the ‘race to the bottom’ approach in all fields, including in relation to maritime re flagging."
"We must listen to the 100,000 people who took to the streets in Ireland last week to express their anger at the 'Race to the Bottom' threatened by the actions of the Irish Ferries company and the Bolkenstein Directive."
"100,000 people expressed their anger and made it clear they will not accept a European Union based on the lowest common denominator in social, employment, and public service provisions."
"I call on Commissioner McCreevy as a matter of urgency to reintroduce Manning of Ferries Directive, unblock the Temporary/Agency Workers Directive and fundamentally amend the Bolkenstein Directive."
"This resolution, which has regrettably been adopted, albeit by a very narrow margin, is one of Parliament’s most damaging resolutions in support of current Community policy."
"There are key aspects of the resolution that are tantamount to an attack on fundamental democratic rights and the Treaty on European Union."
"A case in point is the call for ‘a properly coordinated interinstitutional campaign and strategy facilitating the rapid adoption of the European Constitution based on the existing draft Constitutional Treaty’, which disregards the ‘no’ votes delivered by the people of France and the Netherlands in referendums on the so-called European Constitution."
"Similarly alarming is the call for improved computer systems and increased use of biometric data, for example the Visa Information System (VIS) and the Schengen Information System (SIS II), for the purpose of reducing immigration, and for repressive measures and the erosion of fundamental rights to be stepped up, on the pretext of combating terrorism."
"In the area of internal market and monetarist policies, the emphasis is on the all-too-familiar tools of neoliberalism, namely liberalisations purporting to increase competitiveness, the integration of the financial services markets and the enlargement of the euro zone."
"Hence our vote against."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues support calls for a renewed focus in achieving the Lisbon objectives, to stimulate growth and employment and to give sufficient resources to framework programmes on research, competitiveness and innovation."
"The completion of the internal market should be a priority and the initial steps taken by the Commission to withdraw unnecessary regulation are welcomed."
"However, we are concerned that there are continued attempts to facilitate the rapid adoption of the EU Constitution and implement legislation for an ""Area of Freedom, Security and Justice"" which we do not support."
". – The Commission’s legislative programme for 2006 illustrates a concept of Europe that is now obsolete:"
"- an antidemocratic Europe, following an underhand ‘plan D’ to force on us a constitution that the French and Dutch rejected;"
"- a Europe without borders, open to worldwide immigration, allowing, in particular, the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants regularised in Spain and Italy to settle in other Member States;"
"- an antisocial Europe, which, by implementing the ultraliberal Lisbon Strategy, causes our businesses to relocate and dismantles our employment law (the Bolkestein directive, which Mr Chirac promised in April was dead and buried, will once again be put to a vote here in Parliament);"
"- a Europe with no identity, which, by opening accession negotiations with Turkey, an Asiatic, Muslim country, will soon be European only in name;"
"- an antinational Europe, dissolving our nations into a bureaucratic superstate."
"Today, our people need not the umpteenth legislative programme, but a different Europe, founded on the principles that identify it: the freedom of its nations and the spirit of its civilisation."
". The European Union must publicly condemn the breaches of human rights and freedom of the press in Tunisia so that Tunisian public opinion is aware of it."
"The Tunisian Government is quite happy engaging in backroom diplomacy to brush under the carpet the increasingly worrying situation of the 401 political prisoners, the five political parties not permitted to speak freely to the Tunisian citizens, and the large number of associations that cannot operate freely."
"These lawyers, journalists, workers and intellectuals are being repressed and gagged."
"Let us, for once, address the people of Tunisia directly to tell them that the European Parliament will not fall into the trap set for it by Mr Ben Ali by continuing to accommodate a dictatorship that is no longer even attempting to disguise itself."
". The Community budget provides for funding and specific programmes to protect consumers, for example by supporting organisations or bodies involved in protecting the interests of consumers and promoting the involvement of such organisations and bodies in the Community-level decision-making process."
"We therefore feel it is only right that the new Member States should fully enjoy the same support for their activities and that high levels of consumer protection should be promoted in all EU Member States."
"This is especially important in the new Member States in view of the amount of deregulation, privatisation and liberalisation that their economies have undergone in the so-called transition process to market economics and now that they have joined the Union there are hardly any consumer protection bodies."
"That being said, we do not share the rapporteur’s underlying philosophy regarding the concept of ‘consumer’ and consumer protection, from the perspective of completing the internal market, promoting the entrepreneurial spirit, and attempting to create a ‘consumer’ culture in those countries via a market economy approach."
"Such a philosophy severs the cultural roots that were in place before the transition, when a person’s value was not measured by their capacity for consumption. Nowadays, the focus has shifted towards ‘selling’ that value and towards promoting the kind of consumerism that fuels the contradictions inherent in capitalism."
"According to the rapporteur, the general public and businesses in the ten new Member States are unaware of the rights and opportunities offered by the harmonised EU legislation on consumer protection."
"We fully share the view that consumer protection is a significant issue."
"We are, however, critical of quite a few of the measures proposed in the report, for example the following:"
"– the fact that the rapporteur recommends that consumer awareness be given higher priority in school curricula throughout Europe, this being something we believe should be decided on at national level, and not by the EU;"
"– the fact that the Commission is to conduct a ‘strategic information and education campaign’ to prepare consumers for the introduction of the euro in the new Member States;"
"– the fact that the Commission is to prepare a special strategy for promoting the development of a consumer culture in the new Member States, something that can be implemented independently by individual Member States;"
"– the fact that consumer organisations are to obtain extensive EU funding, without the report specifying the relevant amounts;"
"– the fact that the new Member States’ governments are called on to fund the formation of consumer organisations, something that we believe should be decided on at national level."
"We regret that the European Parliament is again using a very important political issue to introduce new budget headings and unduly far-reaching EU measures."
"– () I voted in favour of this report because I regard it as very important for all regions that are unable to initiate their own development measures without financial support."
"I myself live in one of the poorest regions of Europe – the Prešov region – where GDP is less than half the European average."
"I therefore welcome the fact that job creation and the promotion of growth are to be viewed as the paramount aims of state aid."
"From the standpoint of cohesion, it is very important to adopt transparent criteria that allow all disadvantaged regions to receive financial aid."
"The inclusion of regional governments in the distribution of state aid is a very positive step, because this guarantees the transparent allocation of these funds."
"In connection with this report, I would like to express my doubts regarding the British proposal for the Financial Perspective, as it disregards one of the basic objectives of the EU – the levelling of regional differences."
"This report addresses the issue of state aid to enable neglected regions to develop."
"The June List’s position is that regional policy can be conducted at national level so long as it does not distort competition in the internal market."
"We are very disappointed that most of our proposals were not approved, not least those concerning the problems of relocations and the protection of public services, on which state aid has an impact. As regards the former, the report does not put forward one single practical proposal, and the latter is not even mentioned."
"We welcome the fact that, despite the Commission’s original proposal with regard to regional state aid, those regions affected by what is known as the ‘statistical effect’ will retain the same regional state aid status as the convergence regions until 2013, without any review period. This alone does not, however, lead us to change our minds and vote in favour."
"We continue to vote against because Parliament has accepted the Commission’s proposed policy on state aid, which, on the pretext of tackling the problem of unfair competition, is aimed at reducing the amount of aid and at placing restrictions on the Member States by specifying what aid can be granted horizontally."
"Let us be clear that the Commission’s proposed new reform of state aid provides for substantial reductions to the scope in which state aid can be granted."
"This reform would, to all intents and purposes, go against the idea of a public policy that places state aid at the forefront of support for ‘cohesion’ countries as they strive towards regional development."
". In its initial draft, the European Commission planned to ban State aid to business in France as of 2007."
"This draft, like that of the Bolkestein directive, is part of the implementation of a highly competitive internal market that was agreed during the Barcelona summit, where France was represented by Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin."
"Mr Koterec’s report introduces a number of improvements: France will retain the option of granting State aid, but that aid will be considerably reduced."
"European regional policy, which is largely paid for by French taxpayers, is therefore not content with being more and more stingy towards our regions (the French-speaking region of Hainaut has lost the structural funds under Objective 1 as a result). By preventing France in future from having an independent industrial policy, it is compromising the very existence of hundreds of businesses, which, in the absence of targeted public aid, will either have to relocate their activities or to shut up shop."
"That Europe, a Europe which manufactures unemployment and which is antisocial because it is antinational, was rejected by our fellow citizens on 29 May."
"They want a different Europe, a Europe that, in respecting national sovereignties, will respect employment."
". I wish to congratulate Mr Koterec on his outstanding report on the role of state aid as a tool of regional development."
"I should like to take this opportunity to express my support for the rapporteur’s opinion that in the new programming period the ceilings of aid intensities applicable to the EU’s outermost regions should be exactly the same as those in force during the previous period (2000-2006)."
"I also endorse the rapporteur’s view that, in this connection, the status described in Article 87(3) of the European Community Treaty should automatically apply to the outermost regions, which is, after all, laid down in the Treaty approving a Constitution for Europe."
"."
"I abstained on the final vote on this report as while many of the inconsistencies in the report were amended in the votes, the report could still do better in terms of clarity and precision."
"Many of the amendments of my group were sadly unsuccessful, though would have improved this report, which I believe comes too late in any case in order to influence the thinking of the European Commission on this vital matter."
". I am pleased that the Commission listened to the Member States and redrafted their proposal on regional selective assistance (RSA)."
"I agree that there should be less but better targeted state aids."
"However there is still much to be done to ensure that there is flexibility."
"Scotland has directly benefited from regional selective assistance securing thousands of jobs and helping many companies successfully develop."
"We have to allow this to continue."
". I voted for the joint resolution on the issue of extraordinary rendition."
"No one can yet be convicted in Europe of illegal activity, but the weight of evidence suggests that European law has almost certainly been breached in a number of Member States and applicant countries."
"The work of the Council of Europe's rapporteur on the subject supports that conclusion."
"I support the establishment of a temporary committee, but we have to be careful not to bolt the stable door after the horse has bolted."
"The particular circumstances around extraordinary rendition will have been investigated to death by the time our committee is established."
"Rather, we need a wider investigation that looks at causes rather than symptoms; an investigation that looks at protecting democracy at home and abroad that looks at how we can fight terrorism protect human rights."
"We share the view that it is very important to make EU aid effective and that coordination of the existing aid efforts is needed."
"It is encouraging that the resolution addresses these aspects of development policy."
"The June List believes, however, that the EU should not concern itself with aid issues."
"This important area must mainly be dealt with at national level."
"Measures must be coordinated internationally within the framework of existing international organisations that possess legitimacy and experience."
"We are critical of certain wordings in the resolution, such as the wording to the effect that the EU should step up its present aid efforts."
"For the above-mentioned reasons, we have chosen to abstain from voting on this issue."
". The British Presidency has pulled off the historical feat of achieving unanimity in terms of the criticisms levelled at it."
"All Member States and political parties are unanimous in recognising that there has been no tangible result."
"In June, Prime Minister Blair’s rhetoric of reform aroused great expectations; six months on and nothing has been achieved."
"The negotiations on the 2007-2013 financial perspective are a telling example of the way in which the United Kingdom has conducted its Presidency."
"Jack Straw showed tremendous insensitivity when he described the British proposal as disciplined, fair and geared towards enlargement and greater economic competitiveness, while vehemently criticising the Luxembourg proposal as unrealistic and unbalanced."
"The response to this could hardly have been clearer."
"The Luxembourg proposal could have lasted the pace, having enjoyed the support of 22 of the Member States, whereas the British one has been rejected by every Member State and every political group in Parliament."
"The United Kingdom has dug itself into a hole and has no idea how to extricate itself."
"The European Project and the citizens who believe in it have no truck with the kind of national self-interest thus far demonstrated by this Presidency."
"Mr President, we abstained on the joint resolution on the covert transport of prisoners suspected of Islamist terrorism by the CIA."
"Without wishing to take a position on the facts, we feel that, whilst protests must be raised against such practices, assuming they have indeed occurred, those protests should come from the governments of the Member States, some of which are allies of the United States."
"However, we also feel, and I would like to state this quite clearly, that this situation is not right."
"The law exists, and it also protects those who break it in the most shameless way, by which I mean terrorists."
"It is completely contrary to our traditions for people to be detained with no access to the outside world and no opportunity to defend themselves."
"One of two things is true: either those detained by the United States are considered to be prisoners of war and have to be treated as such, for example receiving regular visits from the Red Cross and being freed at the end of hostilities – I am thinking in particular of the prisoners of war captured in Afghanistan – or they are considered to be criminals under ordinary law by virtue of the actions of which they are accused and can therefore be defended by lawyers, have the opportunity to defend themselves and be told the charges against them."
"That is the cornerstone of our civilisation."
"We must not let terrorism destroy our basic values!"
". It is absolutely vital that the European Parliament supports the proposed establishment of a Committee of Inquiry to investigate prisoner abuses in alleged CIA-operated prisons, and secret flights over EU."
"Europe must stand up to the Bush administration which seems to see us as 'client states' who will rubber-stamp their every excess."
"It is ridiculous that the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, seems to expect us to tolerate their excesses on the premise that their actions may save European lives."
"I expect it is also the case that European security strategies will save American lives - but neither they nor we should do so using torture."
"I fully support my Socialist Group's demand that this whole matter be investigated by a European Parliament Committee of Inquiry."
"That Committee must also be mandated to investigate the whole issue of protection of human rights and democratic transparency in the context of the fight against terrorism."
"I hope that all MEPs endorse the demand now being made by Socialist MEPs and agree to the Committee of Inquiry being established immediately."
"The resolution addresses a serious issue; but what, in this situation, are speculation and loose assertions, and what are facts?"
"We welcome a special committee of inquiry in the European Parliament."
"Any inquiries in search of the facts of this matter are welcome."
"Various political groups are now, however, trying to play politics with this issue."
"We think there are not enough facts to enable us to express a definite view one way or the other."
"The European Parliament has, as usual, been late in considering amendments and motions for resolutions in plenary."
"In this situation, we have therefore tried to avoid adopting unduly sensitive positions until the facts of the case are known."
"We merely wish to express our definite view that cooperation within the intelligence sphere falls within the area of competence of the Member States and is something that they themselves can decide on in the context of bilateral and multilateral relations."
". More and more facts are coming to light about the US security services and agencies, such as the CIA, illegally kidnapping people, flying them to Europe, detaining them and then subjecting them to isolation and torture."
"These disgraceful and unlawful acts, which violate the most basic rights, deserve forthright condemnation."
"This is especially worthy of condemnation because, contrary to what some would have you believe, this is not some isolated incident or a series of unsubstantiated allegations."
"Quite the opposite, the reports emerging of this appalling state of affairs are merely the tip of the iceberg of US imperialism, which, under the cloak of the so-called ‘fight against terrorism’, rides roughshod over the United Nations Charter and international law, and uses the UN for its own ends."
"Although it likes to play with words, the US administration has never denied the existence of the flights, the kidnappings or the illegal prisons."
"It is crucial that this appalling situation be thoroughly investigated and that measures be taken to stop such unlawful activities from happening."
". I voted as I did on this resolution because, along with many concerned London constituents, I believe there should be an objective investigation of allegations, both of the alleged use of EU countries by the CIA for the transportation of prisoners, and the alleged use of European soil for the illegal detention of prisoners."
". The first lesson from the affair around the CIA flights must be to close the US and NATO military bases such as Aviano in Italy, Ramstein in Germany and Kogalniceanu in Romania in the EU and the future member states."
"After all, they are the infrastructure for the torture flights."
"EU interior commissioner Franco Frattini plays things down, wherever this is possible, and pushes the responsibility back to the member states."
"This is all the more dishonest, since the affair quite clearly also has an EU dimension."
"The EU, in the security political arena and precisely as far as the so-called struggle against terrorism is concerned, has agreed on a close cooperation with NATO and the USA."
"Agreements on secret service cooperation and on the unlimited transfer of information classified secret are part of the “Berlin plus agreement”, which allows the EU to take military action using NATO capacities."
"In February 2003, there was agreed directly with the USA a close cooperation in the transport of suspects."
"The scandalous behaviour in this sense is not only that of the US government, but the blame must also rest with the EU officials and the EU governments in the know."
". The presumed use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners should be condemned and investigated thoroughly."
"I am pleased that the UK Government has stated categorically that it will cooperate fully with the Council of Europe investigation."
". Every year Parliament introduces a ‘set of recommendations’ in one of its own-initiative reports on EU candidate countries, whereas there is no mention of any ‘set of recommendations’ that the Bulgarian people might have for the EU."
"We are once again seeing an utterly unacceptable exercise in interference."
"For example, Bulgaria is called upon to carry out ‘substantial structural reforms’, and is then congratulated on its ‘privatisation programme’."
"Naturally, if that be the right word, greater transparency is called for in the ‘processes of public procurement, tendering and contracting’, much to the delight of the large economic and financial groups in the EU."
"It does not stop there, however."
"Bulgaria is called upon to introduce ‘measures to bring greater flexibility to the labour market’ and ‘to increase mobility of the workforce’. The country is also reminded ‘that it needs to make increased efforts in all areas of the internal market … so as to guarantee its effective functioning’."
"Precedence is given to ‘resolving issues of land ownership’, yet who will be keeping an eye on this?"
"There are other areas that I could mention, but I think these are enough to show the EU ‘at its best’."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to highlight the fact that we voted in favour of the compromise amendment presented last night by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament – to which I personally contributed – even though I believe that this amendment is weaker than the text in Article 21, which we had contributed to defining."
"We voted in favour of this amendment for the sake of the children, because we wanted this Parliament to adopt a united, strong and determined stance and send out a message to Romania so that the issue of international adoptions might be successfully resolved."
"We do not expect this to happen before Christmas, but we do still hope that it happens so that these children – whose right to a family is a priority, as is decreed by all the legislation in force at international level – can be reunited with their parents."
"This is a question of a human right and a fundamental right that Parliament wants to highlight to Romania, because, among the various things that the country must do to comply with the European acquis, it must above all ensure respect for human rights – in this case, the right of children to experience the joy and happiness of a family."
". The report before us reaffirms the EU’s desire to see Romania become a Member State on 1 January 2007, but attaches certain conditions to that accession."
"The rapporteur expresses his concern at persistent delays in a number of areas, such as improving administrative capacity, combating corruption and implementing the ‘acquis communautaire’ in certain areas of agriculture, public contracts and the environment."
"It is clear to see that these demands are nothing short of interference in Romania’s political life, in areas such as the country’s right to food sovereignty and safety, public contracts and administrative capacity, which should be left to the Romanians to address."
"The aim is more to appease the interests of the economic and financial groups in the most powerful countries than to improve the well-being of the Romanian people."
"We therefore opted to abstain."
". I voted for the Moscovici report on Romania, but I believe that, on some key issues, the Romanian government must make accelerated progress - namely the widespread, institutionalised discrimination against the Roma, clearing up allegations of the use of alleged illegal detention sites and state corruption."
". I should like to begin by welcoming Parliament’s initiative in drawing up this report, as I feel that the role of women in this and other sectors is crucial to the sustainable development of the EU’s economic and social fabric."
"As regards this particular report, I am in favour of the proposals put forward to the Commission aimed at fair treatment between the sexes and equal rights at work."
"Furthermore, women’s networks in the fisheries sector in the EU should be set up, and women should be involved in Coastal Action Groups and in the new Regional Advisory Councils."
"I also welcome the approach made to the Commission for specific aid to back up the initiatives proposed in Mrs Attwooll’s report."
"This report recommends far-reaching EU measures aimed at improving the situation of women within, primarily, the fisheries sector."
"The June List believes that the EU is a union of values and that women and men should be treated entirely equally and have exactly the same opportunities and rights."
"We believe, however, that research projects, programmes of measures, women’s networks and special professional training should be devised on a national or local basis and not be regulated and controlled from the top by the Commission and the EU."
"We have thus chosen to vote against this report."
". Women play a similar role in the fisheries sector and fishing communities as they do in farming communities, which is to support activities relating to catching."
"This work comes on top of the work they do in the home, is often unpaid, is potentially damaging to their health and carries no guarantees of social protection."
"Women account for only 3% of the workforce in catching, yet there is a much larger proportion of women active in harvesting and aquaculture, which shows that progress has been made in bringing more women into the workforce."
"Gender issues continue to take a backseat in this sector, and levels of female involvement in fisheries bodies and associations remain very low."
"Against this backdrop, we support the setting up of women’s networks and associations in the fisheries sector at both local and national level. These will enjoy Community support and will have the following objectives: to make the role of women in the sector more visible; to increase the involvement of women in the decision-making process on the common fisheries policy; and to draw attention to the need to preserve fisheries as an economic, social and cultural activity that is of key importance to the development of fishing communities in different countries."
". Women's role in fisheries is often forgotten and yet women play a pivotal role."
"This report gives recognition to women in the fisheries sector and should be wholeheartedly supported."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"Mr President, I would like to express my gratitude to the House for the endorsement given to this written statement by some 400 Members."
"There has been support across all party and national boundaries for the idea that there should be one telephone number in Europe that children can call in order to express their worries and needs."
"In so doing, we are giving hundreds and thousands of disadvantaged children a great big Christmas present, and I hope that the Commission is listening very carefully to this appeal."
"I hope that we will not leave it at that, but that the worries and needs of the weakest members of our society will continue to spur us into action."
"My warm thanks to all those who have made this commitment and will continue to do so in future."
"The next item is five motions for resolutions on the human rights situation in Tibet and Hong Kong(1)."
". – Mr President, my group has serious concerns about human rights in China."
"We have regular reports of the continued use of the death penalty and inhuman and degrading treatment in prisons with reports of the use of torture."
"Those concerns are particularly true in Tibet, where we continue to receive many reports of violations in particular against Buddhist monks and people who follow the Buddhist faith."
"As for Hong Kong, we strongly support demands for the provision of universal suffrage within the territory."
"I would note, however, that in far too many countries in the world the demonstration on 4 December of tens of thousands of people in favour of such universal suffrage would not have been permitted."
"However, we have a problem."
"Paragraph 14 of the resolution – on which we have asked for a split vote – invites the Dalai Lama to address Parliament in what would be seen as his capacity as a head of state."
"I do not believe it is our place to make such a momentous change to our one-China policy in the middle of an urgency debate."
"I personally have met and talked to the Dalai Lama on two occasions."
"I have no objection to his being invited to the Committee on Foreign Affairs or anywhere else."
"However, I and the PSE Group will not be able to support this resolution if that paragraph remains in place."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is unfortunate that we have to keep on drawing the attention of this House to the human rights situation in China, and, much though Europeans would like to see that situation improve so as to enable us to maintain intact and fruitful relations with China, it would appear to have been getting much, much worse recently."
"Again and again, we come up against the problem that the Dalai Lama is treated as a separatist, even though he has always explicitly supported the ‘one China’ policy, does not support any secessionist movements, and even though his own requests for negotiations on autonomy are couched in the most pacific terms."
"The second point I would like to make is that monasteries are now being used as places where pressure is exerted not only on monks, but also on the general population, in an attempt to re-educate them, and it is because this sort of thing is unacceptable under any circumstances that I ask you to vote in favour of this resolution."
"Mr President, two months ago we adopted an urgent resolution in this House regarding Tenzin Delek Rinpoche and he still has not been released from detention."
"Once again we are here, this time to seek to highlight the ‘patriotic education’ campaign conducted in Tibetan monasteries."
"Last month five Tibetan monks were arrested in Drepung Monastery."
"We hear they have also been tortured in detention."
"But what is their crime?"
"Their crime is that they refused to sign declarations denouncing His Holiness the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist."
"Public education began as a tool of repression in 1996 in China, but it has escalated since 2005."
"The Chinese Government is attempting to brainwash the people."
"This is not public education, it is a suppression of human rights."
"No doubt the Chinese will again say this is an internal matter for China, but the international community cannot sit idly by when peace-loving people are subjected to this kind of treatment."
"We need to know in particular what happened to the young Tibetan monk Ngawang Jangchub, who died in October during a ‘patriotic education’ session."
"The Chinese Government must listen to our calls for respect for human rights."
"If it does not, the least we should do – and I mean the least we should do – is maintain our EU embargo on trade in arms."
"Unlike one of the previous speakers, I would like to see the Dalai Lama coming here and addressing Parliament."
". Mr President, it was at the beginning of October that the 28-year old monk Ngawang Jangchub died in his cell in the Drepung monastery."
"His death resulted from his interrogation by cadres of the campaign for so-called ‘patriotic education’."
"The object of this is that critics of the regime should be brought back into line by means of drastic physical and mental re-education measures."
"Over 10 000 monks and nuns in Tibet have been obliged to undergo brainwashing since 1996, something that constitutes a flagrant breach of freedom of opinion and religion."
"The intention is that threats, periods of detention, and torture should induce the inhabitants of monasteries to denounce the Dalai Lama, in writing as an enemy of the state and a separatist."
"Mrs Lynn has already described how, on 23 November, Chinese security forces occupied the Drepung monastery near the capital, Lhasa."
"When they arrested five senior monastics, 400 monks mounted a peaceful demonstration for their release."
"The police and special units responded promptly to this by sealing the monastery off from the outside world for days on end."
"Are human rights resolutions adopted by this House a matter of indifference to the Chinese?"
"It is evidently not enough for them that the Commission, Commissioner Verheugen, and the Council should intervene."
"Or are they no more than footnotes to the loudly-heralded dialogue between the EU and China?"
"Speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, let me remind the House of our debate in October, on which occasion we demanded, as a matter of urgency, an improvement in the conditions under which the highly regarded Lama Tensin Delek Rinpoche were being held, which were putting his life at risk, in order to make it possible for him to receive a fair trial."
"The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, Manfred Nowak, has just published the results of his inspection of Chinese prisons, labour camps and police stations."
"He confirms that torture is taking place, and that prisoners and persons regarded as suspect are being mistreated."
"The effect of the Chinese system of re-education through work is that people can be sent, without a court having passed sentence upon them, to a camp for up to three years."
"That is a manifest offence against their personal integrity and against the dignity of every human being."
". Mr President, in October 2005 the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the Chinese authorities’ unjust imprisonment of the Lama Tenzin Delek Rinpoche."
"This resolution achieved nothing, however, as Tenzin Delek Rinpoche is still being detained and tortured, in spite of his poor state of health."
"It merely demonstrated the extent to which human rights are violated in China."
"The Chinese authorities are currently implementing a policy of ‘patriotic education’, and forcing Tibetans to sign declarations in which they reject the Dalai Lama as their spiritual leader and acknowledge that Tibet is part of China."
"Anyone who refuses to sign such a declaration is threatened with persecution and arrest."
"As Members of this House have stressed repeatedly, Tibetan monks are at particular risk."
"These extraordinary ‘patriotic education’ sessions have already resulted in the death of one monk in unknown circumstances and the arrest of five others."
"What is more, the 7 000-strong Drepung Monastery has been occupied by the Chinese Special Forces since 25 November, and hence completely cut off from the outside world."
"In view of the situation in Tibet, it is clear that the international community must continue to exert pressure on China to improve the conditions in which prisoners are held and to abolish the use of torture and the death penalty."
"In addition, the Tibetan people must be supported in their fight for life and a continued national identity."
"It is also worth mentioning in passing that only a dozen or so of the over 3 000 Buddhist monasteries that were once found in Tibet are still in existence."
"In the hope that we will finally achieve our goal by adopting yet another resolution, we must do everything in our power to ensure that the Chinese authorities put an immediate stop to such blatant violations of civil liberties."
". Mr President, due to time constraints I will make only one comment, a self-critical one, with regard to Hong Kong."
"We are calling for the abolition of the system whereby the Chief Executive is chosen by a committee made up of about 800 Hong Kong residents selected by Beijing."
"To be fair, however, such a system is arguably better than the previous system whereby the ex-British colony was administered by a governor appointed by the Queen of England."
"I cannot recall the European Parliament passing any resolutions at that time condemning Britain for imposing such an undemocratic system on the people of Hong Kong."
"Then again, what right does this House have, even today, to criticise British colonial policies?"
