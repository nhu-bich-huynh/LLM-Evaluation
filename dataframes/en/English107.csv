"We would be putting our own forces in extreme danger and making them less effective if we said that for reasons of principle we Europeans could not allow such a thing."
"I want to draw attention to these problems again to show that I am very much aware of them."
"They relate both to our space policy and to the area of security research."
"I can only urge Parliament to see its role as also ensuring that in this difficult situation in which we find ourselves, where things are not just black and white but there is also a large grey area, we still proceed in a manner that does not compromise our values and our principles."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to take up what Mr Verheugen said and also answer Mr Pflüger and Mr Batten on the question of what the citizens of the European Union want."
"Eurobarometer surveys show that 70% to 80% of EU citizens believe we need a common security and defence policy."
"That became particularly clear with the terrible events in the Balkans."
"The 27 European countries spend EUR 170 billion a year on defence, yet these countries were unable to put an end to the bloodshed in the Balkans because we simply do not yet have a common European organisation for such operations."
"There were German, French, British, Italian, Luxembourgish and other forces, yet at the time it was only the Americans, not the Europeans, who had the capability to put an end to the bloodshed."
"Mr Morillon saw that with his own eyes and experienced it very much in person."
"It is also quite wrong to refer to weapons in space here."
"What threat is there?"
"If, for instance, we station Galileo or observation satellites in space to find out what is happening, it is done for the security of our citizens."
"The real danger is that weapons are stationed in space and used to destroy our communications satellites, because then our entire social system could be disrupted by relatively minor means."
"Just imagine what would happen if the telecommunications satellites for TV, for radio, for everything that makes up our society today, were destroyed."
"That is why I believe we are on the right track, including with Galileo."
"We will probably find at the vote tomorrow that there has been a change of mind in the European Parliament."
"The first step was that we managed to get Galileo financed out of the European budget."
"The Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Foreign Affairs urged this very strongly and managed to obtain it."
"The second step is that Galileo is of course a civilian project, somewhat different in type from the American system, but that it is also necessary and that it is available for operations by EU forces in, for instance, Congo, Bosnia and Herzegovina or Chad."
"I believe, therefore, that tomorrow will see a change in the majority view in the European Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, 10 July 2008."
"EC/Mauritania Fisheries Partnership Agreement for the period 1 August 2008 to 31 July 2012 (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Carmen Fraga Estévez, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for the period 1 August 2008 to 31 July 2012 - C6-0199/2008 -."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to say that, once again, we have worked very hard in the Committee on Fisheries so that the Commission and the European Union can honour their commitments."
"It was perhaps the Commission's initial lack of interest in the negotiations that led to some of the criticisms in the report about the procedure that was followed, despite the fact that Mauritania continues to be one of the European Union's major fishing partners and despite the fact that the financial contribution is still one of the largest and involves ever-greater commitments towards developing the Community fisheries sector."
"It is therefore difficult to understand why the text that has been negotiated entails a big reduction in the permissible catch of between 25% and 50% for almost all categories of fish and why, in addition to the technical measures, conditions have been accepted which for us are difficult to understand."
"As we have said on several occasions in this forum, and as Europêche said in a letter to you, Mr Borg, there is not much point in negotiating marvellous fishing opportunities - which is not the case in this Agreement - if we then accept technical conditions which prevent us being able to take proper advantage of those possibilities."
"The minimum size set for octopus bears no relation to the size set for adjacent areas; the additional two-month biological recovery period negotiated at the last minute, virtually unbeknown to the fisheries sector, was based on a poor quality scientific report and was introduced at the request of the Mauritanian party without the necessary prior consultation of the joint scientific committee; it is based solely on cephalopods, despite the fact that the recovery period affects all categories."
"All of this is a disturbing indication of how the European Commission sometimes negotiates."
"It is for this reason, Mr President, Mr Borg, that we must renew our insistence on greater involvement for the European Parliament, at least as an observer at the joint committee meetings, as a minimum institutional transparency requirement, which should have been met some time ago."
"It would not be a bad thing, given the new powers which we hope the European Parliament will acquire with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty - which was imminent and I am convinced must take place soon - for the Council and the Commission to prepare themselves for involving Parliament in a role which, sooner or later, it will be called upon to fulfil."
"We also hinted in the report that we were disappointed that the Commission, and here I am afraid that I have to disagree with you, Mr Borg, had failed to respect the relative stability of the Agreement, by giving itself powers to relax a criterion which on other occasions it has regarded as virtually sacrosanct, an action which we will keep a very close watch on, as our remit demands."
"I hope that in the case to which you referred, that of cephalopods, the allocation keys based on relative stability and on the historic fishing rights in this fishing ground will be respected."
"We will be very keen to know the outcome of the meetings which have been scheduled in various fora and joint committees to resolve some of the technical questions to which I referred in the report and which can, as is still the case in Morocco, tie up a fleet which desperately needs access to the fishing opportunities for which it is paying large amounts of money."
"Despite all this, with its duration increased to four years, as you said, this protocol continues, along with the Morocco protocol, to be the most important fisheries collaboration between the European Union and developing countries, and for this reason we obviously seek a vote against the two new amendments proposed and swift approval of the Commission proposal."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) The fisheries agreement with Mauritania, concluded as recently as 1 August 2006, was due to be extended this year."
"On 14 December last year the Commission suddenly suggested that it should be terminated since the fishing opportunities were not being fully used by the European fishing fleet, particularly those relating to small pelagic species."
"This came as a great surprise to us."
"Partly at the urging of Parliament itself talks were held to re-negotiate the fisheries protocol."
"The new protocol now put to us by the Commission represents very rigorous cuts compared with the old one."
"Not only are the fishing opportunities for species not fully taken up in previous years cut, but there are severe cuts for all fish species: 25% for cephalopods, 10 to 50% for demersal species and 43% for pelagics, whilst the financial compensation paid to Mauritania remains unchanged or only slightly reduced in the years ahead."
"We wonder if these cuts were really necessary and what was the rationale behind them, especially since the fishery sector is currently experiencing great difficulties due to the crisis over fuel prices and the cuts in fishing opportunities."
"There would thus seem to be no obvious reason to limit fishing opportunities further, certainly when there was no biological or scientific need to do so."
"The fishery sector must be able to use any fishing opportunity there is just at present."
"One possibility, for example, might be to switch the Mediterranean tuna fishery to Mauritania."
"The Dutch pelagic fishing fleet is also hit by the proposed restrictions, especially on pollock, herring and mackerel."
"So much for Mauritania."
"A brief word or two on the Commission's proposals."
"I am very happy with these, if not with the proposals on Mauritania."
"I think there are many useful pointers for adapting the fleet in response to the fuel crisis and I hope that these new measures will be enough to prevent job losses in the sector."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the noteworthy fact about this new protocol is that although its duration has been extended from two to four years, fishing opportunities have been reduced."
"The allocation of licences under the protocol for category 5 (cephalopods), which gives Spain 24 licences, will not please the Spanish administration because that number is not enough to satisfy the applications from the sector directly affected by this category."
"The Council has the power to decide on a new allocation of licences, taking utilisation into account."
"However, in this case it has not been based on averages but on the period between late 2007 and early 2008, when the situation engendered by the disputes with Mauritania, due to the use of certain technical measures, led to a large part of the European fleet being reluctant to conclude this Agreement, due to the fear of boarding, as happened in the first quarter of 2008."
"Since the new protocol has solved the technical problems and opened up a more secure procedure for settling technical differences between the parties, that will surely lead to a greater number of vessels wanting to access this fishing ground, which is becoming safer by the day, and therefore offering more guarantees, than in the previous protocol."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when it comes to fisheries agreements, we Greens have an interpretation which is slightly different from those of the other groups."
"We regard fisheries agreements as falling not only under the heading of purely and strictly commercial agreements, but also under the heading of European policies."
"That is why I shall be referring to the opinion of the Committee on Development, which also emphasises our commitments on providing development aid and supporting democracy and good governance."
"The question which we have already asked in the discussions within the Committee on Fisheries is why the Commission has threatened to terminate the fisheries agreements with Mauritania barely a year after they were signed."
"As far as we are concerned, fisheries agreements are not merely agreements in which we are allowed to utilise a resource and pay for it, and when we utilise less we pay less."
"No, we are cutting fishing opportunities because the European fishing fleet has utilised less in the areas concerned."
"Yet is it Mauritania's responsibility, is it Mauritania's fault, if the European fleet has gone elsewhere for certain fishing categories?"
"We have always asked that fisheries resources be respected in other fisheries agreements, and we have always said that too much was being utilised and that in any case there would come a time when resources would be reduced."
"This is exactly what is happening at the moment."
"We agree with the Commission that resources should be restored to the level at which fishing is viable, and that that is a good thing."
"However, there is something else which we certainly do not agree with."
"During the discussions which took place we asked what would happen when the compensation is reduced in line with the level of fishing, so that the compensation would be reduced from EUR 86 million to EUR 70 million, which would mean that Mauritania's income would be reduced by EUR 40 million over a period of three years."
"You told us, 'There is no problem."
"We cannot switch from the fishing quota to something different, and decide to work on development instead'."
"We understand this too, and you undertook, on behalf of the Commission, to ensure that there would be compensation for those EUR 40 million as part of development policy."
"Yet today, in this agreement, we cannot see any sign of this compensation except in a footnote which says that the possibility of compensation exists."
"So we do not believe in this compensation, and I think that you have deceived Mauritania to some extent in this agreement, because no provision has been made for the agreed compensation."
"If you will permit, I should just like to remind you that when I was head of the EU mission covering the elections in Mauritania, the European Union undertook to support this young democracy, yet our first political act is to threaten to terminate the fisheries agreements."
"This is not, in my opinion, a policy of development aid, and I should really like to know what guarantee you can give us, as MEPs, regarding this compensation for the reduction decided on."
"(FR) Mr President, the fisheries agreement between Europe and Mauritania, about which our fellow Member and friend Mrs Fraga Estévez has written a report, covers one of the richest regions of the world in terms of fish stocks."
"That is why, for example, in Dakhla, the former Spanish capital Villa Cisneros, in that part of Western Sahara now under Moroccan control, there is a 40 km sea inlet which is called the Rio de Oro, or Gold River, because of the reflection of sunlight on the scales of the shoals of fish."
"In the past, this abundance of fish has actually caused us problems with Morocco."
"Now we are having to tackle a similar problem, but one which concerns fishing in Mauritania from 2008 to 2012."
"This is an area where octopus and cephalopod stocks, for example, may decline, hence the biological recovery period, but where, conversely, it is essential to fish for sardines, since the sardine is a predator of the octopus."
"In practical terms, this means first of all distributing the fishing quotas, the licences, between five European countries, including Spain, obviously, and Italy, but also Portugal, Mr President, and there are some other vessels, freezer trawlers, perhaps from the Baltic States."
"After that, it is a matter of reducing catches from approximately 400 000 tons to 250 000 tonnes because, strangely enough, these quotas are not being used, and this also applies to Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara, which is something, General Morillon, that our Mediterranean tuna fishermen can only dream about."
"In Mauritania, the average use of fishing opportunities ranges from 90% for crustaceans to a mere 22% for tuna."
"As in all these agreements and protocols, there is obviously a financial contribution which is paid for the right to fish, and which is round EUR 300-305 million over four years, at the rate of EUR 70 or 80 million a year."
"Mr Borg has told us how important this contribution is, since it represents approximately 15% of Mauritania's annual budget."
"This operation is also advantageous for Mauritania because the contribution remains at more or less the same level whereas catches, by contrast, are declining."
"Nevertheless, the Mauritanians are causing a serious problem by their harassment of our vessels, and by the boardings which they carry out simply in order to collect fines along the way, although it is true that the European Commission, as Mrs Isler Béguin reminded us just now, has not been particularly sympathetic here, and is now putting pressure on the Mauritanian Government."
"Although fishing is obviously very important in these areas, on the Moroccan side, for example in Dakhla, the fish is exported to Brazil and provides a living for the entire town, hence the concern, on the part of the FAO and the ACP countries, to have a sustainable fishing industry and a code of good conduct."
"Mr President, perhaps in spite of the conduct of the European Commission, which has not always been very 'good' during these negotiations with the young democracy of Mauritania, we should nevertheless welcome this agreement, because it is perhaps one of the last that we shall obtain in this region, now that Morocco wants to preserve and resume control of its natural resources."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we had great hopes that renegotiation of the protocol to the Agreement with Mauritania might be able to make up for the previous poor negotiation; we also thought that it would serve to rectify the unsatisfactory outcome to the negotiation of the Morocco Agreement for the commercially important cephalopod fleet, which has huge socioeconomic significance in Galicia and has therefore been suffering the effects of these two poorly negotiated agreements, in addition to the general crisis in the fisheries sector."
"However, it was not to be, and so we cannot praise or congratulate the Commission on this outcome."
"In general, there is a huge reduction in fishing opportunities and financial compensation is not tailored to that reduction."
"Little heed has been paid to the sector affected, and the technical measures which have been agreed, besides being ambiguous, are prejudicial to the Community fleet."
"In the case of cephalopods, the minimum size for octopus, as the report said, is the highest in the region, and there is no need for it, with the result that this cephalopod fleet has effectively been finished off and, as if that were not enough, the allocation of licences is damaging to relative stability, which is harmful to the Spanish fleet."
"As you will understand, Mr Borg, although we very much regret the fact, all these considerations mean that we cannot congratulate you on the results achieved in this case, because I believe that they could and should have been much better."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank you for the interesting comments and the debate that we have had."
"I would like to pick up on a couple of points that have been raised."
"First of all you are correct to point out that there are fewer fishing opportunities under this revised protocol."
"This was precisely the reason behind our decision to effect a renegotiation, because we needed to ensure maximum utilisation of the fishing opportunities, whereas under the previous situation there was significant under-utilisation of the fishing possibilities both with regard to small pelagics and with regard to cephalopods."
"On the issue of technical requirements, for example with regard to dredges, we hope that we will find a solution quickly to this issue, and the Mauritanian authorities are very well disposed to finding a solution to the satisfaction of both sides."
"Regarding rest periods, this request came originally from the industry since they maintain that, after such rest periods, catches become more profitable."
"On the question of setting the minimum size for octopus at 500 g, I need to make the point that we are dealing with a third country, a sovereign nation, Mauritania, and its own regulation specifies that the minimum size for octopus is 500 g."
"This was a line we could not cross during negotiations: one cannot ask a third country to change its legislation because it is interesting to our own fishermen to catch smaller-sized cephalopods."
"However, we do recognise that there is not one harmonised regulation on the subject in the region."
"There are other countries which allow catches of cephalopods of smaller size, and therefore a decision on this matter should be taken within the COPACE organisation."
"On the issue of allocation keys, i.e. what is known as 'relative stability', as I said before the Commission is not bound to transfer relative stability from one agreement to another or from one protocol to another."
"However, it is provided for in the agreement and in the protocol that, should Member States need more opportunities, and should such requests be based on science, on the state of the stock, then such requests could certainly be considered, and I would undertake to take them up with Mauritania in order to negotiate increases, as in the case for example of cephalopods, if there is a specific request to do so."
"I need to make the point that with regard to cephalopods licences were utilised on 22 occasions and in the new protocol there is provision for 25, so we are actually catering for creating a buffer, allowing for utilisation."
"If the particular Member State involved maintains that they have requests in excess of 25, as long as they give us the specific facts, we will take those up with Mauritania in order to bring about an increase, always as long as the state of the stock allows."
"I need to underline the fact that with regard to cephalopods we do have problems concerning the sustainability and the health of the stock."
"Again on the question of this whole issue of relative stability, I would also like to point out that one cannot have one's cake and eat it."
"On one hand, when it comes to the allocation of cephalopods, the allocation seems not to please one particular Member State."
"But then when it comes to tuna where there is a significant increase of allocations for that same Member State, then that works out in the Member State's favour and we have received no complaints in that regard."
"Concerning the reason for the denunciation and the renegotiation of the protocol, namely that it was under-utilised, again I would like to make the point made by Mrs Isler Béguin that such agreements are not only about fisheries but also about development assistance."
"In fact, whereas we have decreased the financial component for fishing opportunities, there is a clear undertaking on our part to increase the development component, and we are fully committed to respect this."
"Therefore, in total, the financial allocation has been maintained over the four-year term."
"The budgetary support to the 10th EDF will compensate for the remaining EUR 40 million for 2009/10-2012 at the rate of EUR 10 million per year and this means that Mauritania will be receiving a financial package which, when you take into account both what they are receiving by way of compensation for fishing opportunities - which have been reduced on the basis of what was actually being fished in Mauritanian waters - and the increase to the budgetary support through the 10th EDF ad hoc compensation within this protocol, we end up with a situation where the total package is equivalent to the fishing package that they had under the previous financial protocol."
"Finally on the issue of boarding I would like to say that a meeting of the working group will be held this Sunday, this weekend, in order to discuss this specific issue and to agree on recommendations and guidelines that should solve the issue."
"On the point made by Mrs Fraga at the very outset concerning participation of MEPs, the Commission considers that the same approach that is followed for the participation of MEPs in bilateral negotiations has to be followed as regards joint committees where the two parties are officially represented."
"The Commission will, however, continue to cooperate with Parliament on the basis of the framework agreement that exists."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, I will try to be systematic."
"In the first place, with regard to the point made by Mrs Isler Béguin, I would point out that the funds for development cooperation increase over the four years that the protocol is in force."
"It is the total financial contribution which is being reduced by 19 %, but amounts allocated to development cooperation are increasing to EUR 11 million, EUR 16 million, EUR 18 million and EUR 20 million, so as far as development cooperation is concerned you need have no worries, because those amounts are actually being increased."
"Mr Borg, as regards the minimum size for octopus, and since the technical measures are important for take-up of fishing opportunities, I would say that this is not a problem which needs to be dealt with at this juncture."
"You know very well that the matter is still pending."
"I keep on saying this: the size is the highest in the whole region."
"The Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic (CECAF) said at its meeting this year that a common minimum size should be set for the whole region and I think that here the Commission should make an effort to ensure that this matter ceases to be an issue."
"The report drawn up by the Mauritanian scientific committee states that in November, for example, 50% of the catch in the Mauritanian fishing ground can be octopus of between 300 and 500 grams, in other words there is a problem with minimum size in the Mauritanian fishing ground and elsewhere."
"With regard to relative stability, I am not going to get into an argument with you, but this is a topic which we have discussed in Parliament, one which is in the basic regulation which we have been discussing along with the regulation of licences for third countries, but the initial allocation is another matter."
"The initial allocation needs to respect historical rights and then if, under that allocation, fishing opportunities are not taken up, the Commission may, I agree, give them to whoever wants them and applies for them, but initially it is the historical rights which must be respected and, in the case of category five in Mauritania, this has not been the case, Mr Borg."
"I will not elaborate any further."
"I could answer more questions, but I think that, even though I cannot see very well without my glasses, I have run out of time."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, 10 July 2008."
"Common consular instructions: biometric identifiers and visa applications (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Sarah Ludford, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Common Consular Instructions on visas for diplomatic missions and consular posts in relation to the introduction of biometrics including provisions on the organisation of the reception and processing of visa applications - C6-0166/2006 -."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, in my opinion, the vote on this proposal is taking place at a stage in the discussions where perhaps not all the options for achieving agreement at first reading have been sufficiently explored."
"Following the adoption of the draft report by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on 29 November 2007, the Slovenian Presidency tried to reach a consensus between Member States on the rewording of several aspects of the text, so as to take into account the concerns expressed by the European Parliament."
"In spite of this, there was disagreement with the report adopted by the Committee on three major issues."
"The first of these was the age limit for obtaining fingerprints, the second was the diplomatic and consular immunity granted to the premises of external service providers, and the third was the conditions for using such external service providers, together with the question of visa fees."
"On these three issues, the Slovenian Presidency proposed new wording to take into account Parliament's amendments."
"At the tripartite ministerial talks on 17 June, the discussion essentially concentrated on the issue of diplomatic and consular immunity for external service providers, and its corollary, the transmission of data, without any agreement being reached."
"The other subjects were not discussed."
"Since then, there has been no new debate within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"On the extremely sensitive subject of the age limit for fingerprinting, the additional technical information provided to the rapporteur by the Commission confirms the technical reliability of taking fingerprints of children from the age of six."
"Nevertheless, the Commission supports the Presidency's proposal that fingerprints should be taken from children between the ages of six and twelve only for verification purposes and not for identification in the VIS (Visa Information System)."
"In addition, the Commission has also undertaken to carry out the study requested by the European Parliament."
"Moreover, I note that this solution seems to have been chosen for the proposal on passports, on which the European Parliament has to make a decision."
"It seems to me, therefore, that it would be useful to continue discussions on this point, in order to find out whether this suggestion might meet with Parliament's approval."
"Another issue concerns the use of external service providers."
"The conditions in which Member States may use such service providers, as a last resort, have been specified, and a list of requirements to be complied with has been drawn up, based on Parliament's amendments."
"Discussions on this subject should also continue."
"I should like to remind you that the adoption of this amendment to the common consular instructions constitutes an essential prerequisite for the implementation of the VIS."
"Even though the regulation and decision establishing the VIS were adopted at first reading following an agreement between Parliament and the Council, it is true to say that if the present proposal has to go to a second reading this will run the risk of compromising the launch of the VIS in May 2009."
"It is therefore essential to reach a rapid overall compromise on this proposal."
"Well, I am here, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to confirm the Commission's commitment to continuing the negotiations and discussions, particularly, of course, with your rapporteur Baroness Ludford, and also with the Council, in order to achieve a satisfactory compromise in the coming months."
"Once again, it seems to me that this compromise is something that is achievable, provided that the work is carried out thoroughly and that there is a sustained dialogue between the Council and Parliament, a dialogue which the Commission will obviously do its best to assist and encourage."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, this is the third element of the Visa Information System (VIS) package."
"In modifying the existing Common Consular Instructions, it provides, firstly, for the obligation to give the biometrics to be stored in the VIS and the standards for doing so and, secondly, for the organisation of the reception of visa applications."
"It would, indeed, allow the VIS to start operations."
"Although a complete revision of the visa rules is foreseen with the Visa Code on which my colleague, Henrik Lax, is rapporteur, the rationale for making a specific proposal separately is that the adoption of the Visa Code is likely to take even longer."
"But it is important to ensure coherence between the two proposals."
"I have been discussing and negotiating with the Council for a considerable period."
"The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted my report last November and I am sorry I am not able to present a first-reading agreement today, but I believe that is partly because the Council has been rather slow, but also because it does not appear willing to respond with a real movement towards the points that we are making."
"So I am asking my colleagues to endorse the report, as adopted in committee, and hopefully the new presidency will be able to persuade Member States to take our opinion more carefully into account."
"I would cover the same ground as the Commissioner but would put the issues into four groups rather than three."
"The first concerns what I see as the Council's willingness to go forward with fingerprinting young children, while ignoring both the issues of principle and the significant costs and inconvenience for the parents with the problems of frequent changes of child fingerprints and also the problem of false matches or rejections."
"I do not believe I have had full information from the Commission."
"Secondly, what I feel is a lack of willingness to work together on the part of the Member States in trying to deal with the new challenge of organising the collection of biometrics together."
"Thirdly, insufficient regard for data protection and data security: despite a series of data loss scandals, Member States are not sufficiently sensitised to safeguarding personal data from loss, interception by a third state or technical faults."
"Lastly, the question of the visa fee."
"I do not think it is right that Member States should make visa applicants pay for their own administrative choices by allowing commercial companies with which they make contracts for collecting biometrics to charge an extra fee on top of the visa fee."
"I believe that, despite repeated requests, the Commission and Council have failed to provide credible substantive evidence supporting the proposals to start fingerprinting children from the age of six."
"I think there could be considerable extra costs if you have to take them every two years."
"So what we are proposing is to exempt children under 12, initially, from the obligation to provide fingerprints, but have a review after three years, following a detailed study on the technical feasibility, reliability and proportionality of the taking of fingerprints from young children."
"I believe that would be a sensible way forward."
"On outsourcing, I have no problems with the general concept, in so far as it improves services for visa applicants and as long as it takes place under conditions ensuring the integrity of the visa-issuing process, that it is a last resort and that the service provider operates in the building under diplomatic protection, ensuring consular officials are present to supervise the staff of the service provider."
"This would guarantee that data protection is ensured and the material protected from seizure, but I am not getting any concession from the Council on this point."
"Also I am finding that Member States are not even willing to explore co-location with another Member State or a common application centre."
"I will just finish by saying that I went for an opinion to the Article 29 Working Party of national data protection supervisors."
"They pointed out a paradox whereby, while there is reinforcement of the reliability and security of visas by introducing biometrics on the other hand, if you have means of collection which are not of the same level of security as can be ensured in a consulate or consular section of an Embassy, this weakens the reliability of the whole process."
"I will deal with any other points, particularly on the visa fee, in my concluding remarks."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal to amend the Common Consular Instructions is urgently necessary in an EU of open borders."
"My group strongly supports Sarah Ludford's report."
"I thank the rapporteur for the good cooperation, thanks to which the European Parliament's Groups managed largely to agree on a joint text."
"The Common Consular Instructions need to be redefined and adapted to the situation today."
"In future applicants for visas will be identified beyond any doubt by the collection of biometric data such as photographs and fingerprints."
"It became clear in the past that some Member States, among them Germany, were interpreting and applying the existing rules differently and therefore not uniformly."
"In 2000, for example, German consulates and embassies were instructed to be less bureaucratic in issuing visas and when in doubt to decide to grant a visa."
"As a result of the generosity with which the German Embassy in Kiev tended to grant visas, the number of visas issued to Ukrainian nationals rose from about 150 000 in 1999 to about 300 000 in 2001, which led to a considerable rise in illegal immigrants in the Schengen area."
"It is therefore urgently necessary to ensure that all Member States apply the rules on issuing Schengen visas in a uniform manner."
"My Group is in favour of seeking a compromise between the Council and the European Parliament, as Commissioner Barrot just suggested."
"Our Group endorses nearly every point in Baroness Ludford's report."
"The only points we cannot endorse concern the age limit for children and fingerprinting."
"We support the Commission's proposal to set the age limit for children at six years."
"My Group considers it most important to keep to that age limit in order to prevent child trafficking in the European Union."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank Baroness Ludford for her proposed report, which my Group fully endorses."
"The European Union's visa policy is a reflection of how we welcome people."
"That is why we want to find a solution that will enable us to guarantee the security of European visas while respecting the fundamental rights of third-country nationals who apply for them, particularly with regard to the protection of personal data."
"With this in mind, I hope that the Council can understand the European Parliament's requirements."
"We must find a solution which is acceptable to everyone."
"I share the rapporteur's concern about the outsourcing of the collection and processing of the biometric data inserted into the visas."
"We do not believe that it is enough simply to validate the practices of Member States."
"If we are to have a real common visa policy, it is essential that Member States study the feasibility of the other options proposed before resorting to outsourcing."
"It is also our priority to ensure that the privacy of people who provide biometric data is protected."
"We believe it is essential to define very clearly the contracts of the external service providers who might be collecting these biometric data."
"Moreover, in order to guarantee the security of these data it seems to me absolutely vital that they should be collected on premises which enjoy real protection."
"Regarding the age limit for the collection of biometric data, I do not have any ideological opinion on the subject."
"However, I think that our present level of experience does not enable us to guarantee that the fingerprints of children less than 12 years old are sufficiently reliable to enable them to be collected in order to be used."
"I think that that would give a false impression of security."
"That is why I should like us to adopt a precautionary principle by fixing a lower age limit of 12 years for the collection of fingerprints, and that limit can then be revised, once we have at our disposal the independent study which the Commissioner has promised us, which will supply all the necessary information about the reliability of children's fingerprints."
"As for the price of visas, fixed of course by the Council, this should be a maximum price."
"We cannot expect visa applicants to bear the financial burden of the additional requirements of the European Union."
"Finally, I should like to say, Commissioner, that I appreciate the work that you have put into these negotiations, because the European Parliament wants its voice to be heard, and at the moment the Council does not seem to be listening to our basic arguments."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, first of all, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group I would like to thank to thank Ms Ludford for the excellent cooperation she demonstrated, as usual."
"Nevertheless, a number of principal points make us very anxious."
"We fully agree with the European Data Protection Supervisor that using biometrics in information systems is never an insignificant choice, especially when the system in question concerns such a huge number of individuals."
"Therefore, in our opinion the VIS regulation itself would be a more appropriate place to include provisions specifying both general rules and exceptions."
"Also the age under which the children are exempted from the obligation to provide fingerprints raises many questions, as we have heard."
"Here we thank the rapporteur and other colleagues for the sensible decision to change it from 6 to 12."
"However, the scientific literature does not present evidence that fingerprinting of children below the age of 14 can provide for reliable identification."
"The second problem is the outsourcing of visa applications."
"Here we need to provide for the necessary safeguards to ensure data protection compliance."
"Also, in this respect the rapporteur has managed to achieve significant progress if we compare the initial text of the Commission with the text suggested now."
"Nevertheless, our group strongly opposes the extensive introduction of biometrics."
"We believe that it has crucial implications for data security and for fundamental rights without highlighting any significant gains."
"Also, recent events in Italy clearly show how easily the use of fingerprinting can become the abuse of power."
"To sum up, we really appreciate the rapporteur's efforts and her courage in order to achieve the best results."
"Nevertheless, the Verts/ALE Group is very reluctant to accept any use of biometrics in the EU until its necessity is proven beyond reasonable doubt."
"Therefore we cannot vote in favour of the report."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, I am in favour of introducing uniform conditions for issuing visas in order to prevent what is called visa shopping."
"I am, however, opposed on principle to including biometric data in visas, especially in the case of small children."
"I find that totally inappropriate."
"Moreover, we cannot propose to fingerprint six-year olds without, for instance, first being able to produce a broadly-based independent study on the use of fingerprints of children of that age and without knowing how long such children's fingerprints can be kept in the first place."
"I do not think we can or should pass laws on that kind of basis."
"I also see problems with implementing the proposed new regulation."
"All applicants, including children, are now supposed to appear in person at the consulate in order to be fingerprinted."
"That may be too much to expect of people living in remote areas in large countries."
"It could mean that the less well-off, especially families, will find it almost impossible to apply for a visa to travel to the European Union."
"Is that really the image the European Union wants to project abroad?"
"The Council and the Commission are trying to counter that by looking to the private sector."
"They propose giving external service providers the right to receive visa applications and biometric data and forward them to the appropriate consulates."
"The costs involved are then actually to be passed on to the applicants."
"And that is not all!"
"In my view that is not the way to ensure that all these extremely sensitive data are kept safe and confidential."
"It is, therefore, essential to ensure that outsourcing, which should in any case only be allowed under the most stringent conditions, is permitted only on premises that enjoy diplomatic protection."
"On this issue, I emphatically support the rapporteur."
"(PT) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it was our intention with this initiative to guarantee interoperability between all Member States, ensure the same level of protection for personal data and equal treatment for all asylum seekers."
"I particularly support the efforts to facilitate procedures for issuing visas to applicants through the one-stop shop principle, and with the collection of biometric identifiers, that is, a facial image and ten fingerprints from the applicants, for storage in a centralised Visa Information System (VIS)."
"We should emphasise that these data will be used for identification, as Vice-President Barrot has already pointed out."
"This is very different to what happens with European passports, where it is only permitted to take two fingerprints so they cannot be used for anything other than verification, that is, 'one-to-one' comparison."
"From this point of view, I welcome the European Commission's willingness, as revealed just now in plenary by Vice-President Barrot, to cooperate by conducting the study requested by Parliament on the feasibility of taking the fingerprints of children."
"Mr President, given that we are going to carry out a complete review of the Community Code on Visas, separate discussion of this specific proposal would only have made sense if it would have speeded up the process."
"However, this objective will not achieved."
"We will be voting tomorrow on a proposal on which no agreement was reached at first reading and that represents only the first phase of a slow process."
"I therefore have serious doubts about the need to continue discussing this proposal separately, when its timetable seems to be very similar to that of the review of the code itself."
"Mr President, just a quick point."
"The greatest civil liberty we all have is life itself."
"There is always a debate and polarisation when we are discussing issues around extra security measures - issues which might be perceived to be limiting what we generally refer to as civil liberties."
"I just want to be sure that the Commissioner is satisfied that the necessary checks and balances will go hand in hand with what is before us here now; to be sure that we are not going one step beyond what is actually warranted; to ensure that we are only putting in place the security measures, the identification measures that the world we are living in today actually warrants."
"We have just been reminded by my colleague Mr Coelho that failure to reach agreement on this at the first reading carries a huge message."
"This is a very sensitive area and more and more our citizens are questioning the 'liberty' - to use the word generically - being removed from them."
"I finish on this point: the greatest civil liberty is life."
"We must do all that is genuinely warranted to protect life in terms of security and extra measures."
"I would like assurances from you that the checks and balances are there nonetheless."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I have listened carefully to the various speakers."
"First of all I should just like to remind you of the information which has already been added to this file."
"On the subject of children's fingerprints, it was said that figures showed that the quality and reliability of fingerprints on a data base containing details of 1.5 million visa applicants were of a high standard, and I was told that a technical document supporting this position had been sent to Baroness Ludford."
"However, for my own part I should like to assure you, in any case, that I am perfectly ready to launch the study which you have quite rightly asked for, so that we can really see how reliable these biometric data are, and also whether they are advisable or not."
"I think that that is a very good idea."
"I did wonder, Baroness Ludford, whether perhaps we might reach a compromise by making a distinction between the fingerprints taken from children between the ages of six and twelve, which would be used solely for verification purposes, and the fingerprints of children older than twelve, which could actually be used for other purposes."
"Anyway, I shall continue to do what I can to reach a compromise with the new Presidency of the EU, by trying to ensure that Parliament's wishes are taken into consideration to a greater extent."
"On the second point, i.e. outsourcing, we have certainly had some concerns about the annex, which lists the minimum requirements to be included in contracts signed by Member States with external service providers."
"The Commission had also issued a document listing the various technical methods for making data secure."
"However, I appreciate your concerns about this issue of data security, and it is true that there could be a risk, in a third country, that data held at the premises of an external service provider might be the subject of seizure or compulsory search."
"It is essential to recognize that we should be on our guard against this risk."
"I am cautiously optimistic that the dialogue on this question will continue."
"Those are my thoughts."
"It is true, as Mr Coelho has said, that we could try to ensure that this report and the visa code are processed side-by-side, as it were."
"Having said that, I can only confirm, to Parliament and to the rapporteur, Baroness Ludford, whom I should like to thank for all her work, that I am nevertheless determined to reach a compromise fairly rapidly, by asking the Council to listen more to Parliament, and also by hoping that Parliament, for its part, bearing in mind the commitments which the Commission will be making, will show a certain amount of understanding."
"This is the price we shall have to pay if we want to achieve a compromise."
"I am emphasising this point slightly, because we want a visa information system which is effective and fair, and if we are to achieve such a system, then the problems which we have discussed will have to be resolved, Mr President, and I should like to thank those MEPs who have expressed their opinions this evening."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to thank all colleagues and especially the shadows I have worked with. We have had very constructive work together and I have welcomed their positive contributions."
"They have all been very engaged and I have been very grateful."
"I want the VIS to work and to get going as soon as possible."
"In a sense it is my baby, as I was the rapporteur on the system itself."
"But, as colleagues have stressed, we are talking about very sensitive personal data and maybe 70 million entries at any one time."
"The VIS cannot afford to be treated as one vast experiment."
"We must proceed on a precautionary basis."
"I agree with those like Mrs Ždanoka and Mrs Roure that we do not have enough experience to be confident of avoiding problems, for instance with fingerprinting six-year-olds."
"The Commissioner talked about whether we might not get going on the basis of having only verification between 6 and 12."
"Now that might meet some concerns, but not, I think, those of practicality and the cost of having to collect them every two years."
"Frankly, I do not think the Council thought that one through at all."
"As Mrs Roure pointed out we are supposed to be building - or already to have - a common visa policy."
"That is why it is so disappointing that Member States basically have no willingness at all to cooperate on the same premises, and that they want to apply different visa fees by topping up the EUR 60."
"I would like the Commission to be rather proactive in trying to push the Member States to cooperate in different locations."
"Mrs Klamt, whom I very much thank for her constructive criticism and willingness to work with us, has suggested that taking fingerprints of children from the age of six would be an effective tool against child trafficking."
"I have to say I am not aware of any serious research suggesting it would achieve this aim."
"Why choose the age of six?"
"Why not five, or four, or three, or indeed zero?"
"There might be a far bigger risk of baby-snatching than of six-year-olds being kidnapped."
"Finally, Mr Coelho's suggestion to merge this report with the visa code is an interesting one."
"He has thrown what cricketers call a 'googly' into this debate and I think we will have to take that back to the committee and see what they think about that."
"In one sense I am open-minded but I think it is up to the committee."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 10 July 2008."
"European Union fishing fleet affected by the economic crisis (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the proposal for a Council Regulation instituting a temporary specific action aiming to promote the restructuring of the European Union fishing fleets affected by the economic crisis (Committee on Fisheries) - C6-0270/2008 -."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, firstly I am very grateful to the European Parliament for arranging this debate at such short notice."
"As you are aware, yesterday the Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation containing key elements of the EU package of emergency measures to address the fuel crisis."
"Today I am seeking your agreement to this proposal."
"Unfortunately it was impossible for the Commission to adopt its proposal on 3 July as had initially been planned."
"The reason for that is the depth of the analysis that had to go into the proposal, to guarantee that it is a really effective instrument to address the severe problems the sector is facing."
"The Committee on Fisheries held a useful discussion this morning, for which I am thankful."
"A number of questions could be clarified and debated and I hope to be able to take the important and useful suggestions into consideration during negotiations in the Council next week."
"I am looking forward to more debate with you, now hoping that this can pave the way to your favourable opinion on our proposal in the vote tomorrow."
"As I explained to you only three weeks ago, the fisheries sector is facing a crisis which is structural and long lasting."
"For many years, the EU fleet has suffered from a vicious circle of overcapacity, overfishing and declining profitability."
"At the same time, fishers have been unable to benefit from reduced supply and rising retail prices for fish products."
"As a result, profits are decreasing, making the sector more vulnerable than others to a drastic rise in costs, such as we have seen with the price of oil."
"The Commission understands the need for coordinated action at EU level to avert a severe crisis for the industry and to ensure that the problem is really tackled head on."
"This means not only providing the possibility of emergency relief but committing to finally addressing the underlying issue of overcapacity, which is undermining all our attempts to get the industry back on a sustainable and profitable footing."
"For these reasons, the Commission has proposed an emergency package of measures to tackle the immediate social and economic hardship triggered by the dramatic rise in the price of oil, while also tackling the underlying structural problems of the European fleet."
"I believe that it is vital to focus aid on the fleets which are most dependent on fuel and thus most affected by the current overcapacity."
"We therefore propose that Member States can immediately grant temporary cessation aid as a lead-in measure to restructuring and that they can then set up Fleet Adaptation Schemes under which limitations on access to permanent cessation - scrapping - premiums will be lifted."
"Additional aid for temporary cessation, as well as modernisation and energy efficiency, would be available for vessels involved in such schemes. Partial decommissioning aid would be granted to operators who replace larger old vessels with smaller, more energy-efficient ones."
"Based on further economic analyses, possible modifications to the de minimis regime for fisheries may also be considered."
"We will, furthermore, propose provisions to allow for temporary reductions in employees' contributions to social security payments."
"A number of specific initiatives to promote the value of fish at the first point of sale are also envisaged."
"The Commission is planning to assist ad hoc projects in this area, in addition to the funds available under the European Fisheries Fund."
"Further measures are planned to encourage the shift to energy-saving technologies, cushion the socioeconomic impact of the crisis, and facilitate the reprogramming and the disbursement of EFF funds."
"The above measures will consist of temporary derogations to the rules of the European Fisheries Fund so as to support faster adaptation of the EU fleet to the present situation and provide temporary relief during the transitional phase."
"I believe that these measures will help give an essential thrust to the industry to structurally adapt, whilst easing the transition for fishermen, vessel owners and people employed in support services during the period of adaptation."
"The Commission has engaged in very important and constructive discussion with the industry on this matter and the industry gives general support to our initiatives."
"With regard to the official amendments that have been tabled by Parliament to the Commission proposal, we can accept the amendment referring to Recital 13 and, in fact, it should be applied to all vessels."
"However, the Commission cannot support the amendment to Article 18(2) as this would make the partial decommissioning measure virtually impossible to apply in practice."
"Finally, and very importantly, let me express my belief that throughout this process we can give further impetus to the common fisheries policy, in particular in the context of resource sustainability."
"I am aware of the very short deadline and that this leaves the European Parliament with little time to react."
"However, given the exceptional situation being faced by the fisheries sector, I trust I can count on the support of Parliament to adopt the said measures as speedily as possible."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, firstly, I agree with Mr Borg that it is a pity that we have had to work in this way, on the basis of unofficial documents which have not yet been translated into all the languages, when for some considerable time this Parliament has been requesting measures and sounding the alert about the serious crisis threatening the fishing industry."
"Obviously, Mr Borg, we too have accepted the urgency out of respect for our fisheries sector."
"Likewise, I would like to stress that this proposal is, as Mr Borg indicated, just one element of a package of measures and that we do not have a timetable or the salient details which would enable us to make an overall assessment of the new de minimis measures, the amendments to State aid, the guidelines for the new common organisation of the market, or the new ad hoc financial instrument, to which the Commission proposal refers."
"As regards the modification to the European Fisheries Fund proposed by the Commission, I appreciate the efforts at flexibility, although it would have been more practical to follow the European Parliament's proposals at the time they were adopted, proposals which were more appropriate for times of crisis, such as changes to engines, and which might, perhaps, have been able to prevent this steep descent towards scrapping which now faces us."
"I am also very grateful, and I really mean this, for Mr Borg's willingness this morning to include various amendments suggested in the Fisheries Committee, including my own proposal, and for accepting that the period of reference for accessing benefits under the Fleet Adaptation Scheme should include turnover for the first six months of 2008, which was the time of the highest fuel price rises, in addition to 2007."
"Lastly, we would like the Member States affected to make greater efforts to implement these measures, as well as the other measures."
"The ball really lies in their court; they need to act swiftly in order to ensure as far as possible that these measures, and those which are still pending, really help to alleviate the crisis in the fishing industry."
"I would not like what happened with the Regulation on illegal, undocumented and unregulated (IUU) fishing, where the Council decided that it would not enter into force until 2009, to happen here."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I spoke at the plenary in June and emphasised the need for Europeans to tackle this crisis together through an effective and impartial mechanism capable of allowing emergency measures to be adopted at Community level."
"We European socialists are pleased that the problems in this sector have received a response at Community level and that the proposal includes measures which we Members of Parliament, who have debated them here on various occasions, and the governments of the Member States most affected have been demanding for so long."
"We trust, Mr Borg, that the measures which you are proposing will help to highlight two problems which European fleets have been facing for a long time: excessive fuel dependency and the need to improve the marketing of fisheries products."
"We agree, as you might expect, with the financing measures, and with some more than others, as for example the temporary cessation of fishing activities and changes to engines and fishing gear; we are also very pleased that the aid is being extended for the first time to shore-based workers, something which socialists have called for on many occasions."
"We also welcome your own announcement that other, wider-ranging proposals are in the pipeline such as those intended to improve marketing and also the price-setting mechanism, with a consequent increase in the de minimis regime, which, as you said, depends on the outcome of an economic impact study."
"As you are well aware, we in the Party of European Socialists have foregone the opportunity to amend the proposal so that it can be approved unopposed at tomorrow's meeting, as you requested, with a view to its adoption by the Fisheries Council in March next year."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, evidently we are now continuing the debate in which, after almost two hours this morning, we were able to make some progress on this subject."
"I should just like to refer back, briefly, to three points which I believe are essential."
"We fully understand your priorities when it comes to exceptional and temporary measures to be put in place to tackle the problems of our fishing fleets, which are major consumers of fuel oil."
"However, I must emphasise that this should not be at the expense of those who have been able to reduce their energy dependence by using fishing methods and equipment which are better suited to current requirements."
"This is an initial point which I believe, from a psychological viewpoint, needs to be emphasised."
"Secondly, you have proposed measures which will, of course, have immediate effects, but which will also extend over the medium and long term."
"These are measures for regulating the market, and they are very welcome, although unfortunately we cannot expect miracles in this area in the very short term."
"My third and final point is that all this will not prevent us from continuing the debate that we have been having with you since you took up your present position, on a reform of the common fisheries policy which will enable our fishermen to have a better idea of their capacity, so as to avoid the disruptions which occur when TACs and quotas have to be changed suddenly without warning and which, in terms of profitability, are obviously very damaging to the activities of our fishing industry."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Mr President, the title of the Commission communication and of the Commission's proposal for a Council regulation is enough to confirm, if there were any doubts, that the measures proposed do not aim to deal with the causes of the current exacerbation of the socioeconomic situation in the fisheries sector."
"Despite sporadic measures to meet the justified demands of the overwhelming majority of the fisheries sector, we are once again faced with attempts to use the deteriorating financial situation in this sector to introduce measures that further encourage and accelerate the reduction in the number of vessels."
"We would point out that no concrete proposals are being put forward to respond to the two main issues here: the increase in the price of fuel, diesel and petrol, and the formation and increase in the price of fish at the first point of sale without a corresponding increase for consumers."
"There are no financial resources to coordinate and implement measures to help the sector deal with the increase in the cost of fuel, yet there are many hundreds of millions of euros available to promote a reduction in vessels, referred to as market measures."
"No-one wants to grasp the nettle and promote a fair distribution of the added value in the chain."
"Basically, the Commission is putting forward a series of proposals that are essentially inadequate because they do not respond to the needs of the overwhelming majority of the fisheries sector."
"This shows that, at the end of the day, the only real objective is the destruction of much of this strategic economic sector."
"Mr President, I continue to see much to welcome in this package, but I do have an abiding concern, and that relates to the all-important issue of delivery."
"How, Commissioner, do we assure across the EU that these measures do not induce some distortion in competition?"
"Not arising out of anything the Commission may do, but arising from the fact that it is a reality that some Member States are much more enthusiastic about public expenditure and reaching out to help sectors than other Member States, and where there is reticence in some and enthusiasm in others, will there not be an uneven application and drawdown of these measures, with a potential impact on competition?"
"How will you monitor that?"
"Indeed, will you monitor it, and what action will you take if distortion results?"
"My second issue is also somewhat parochial and focuses particularly on the fleet adaptation scheme."
"Within that, you anticipate special support measures, on condition that the scheme brings about a permanent reduction of 30% in a fleet's capacity."
"Take the United Kingdom, Commissioner."
"There we have three of the constituent countries: Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where fishing is a devolved issue, with devolved governments making the decisions."
"It is entirely conceivable that any one of them could come up with a fleet adjustment scheme for their own region whereby fleet capacity would be reduced by 30%."
"But taken across the whole United Kingdom, because others have dragged their feet, that may not be the overall outcome."
"Is that fair?"
"Are there any steps that the Commission can take to alleviate that unfairness?"
"In short, can the Commission look at any steps to deal with that potential inequity in countries where there are regional governments which might be pulling their weight and national governments which are not?"
"(PT) Mr President, I believe that the political direction taken by this proposal, as well as its timing, are absolutely right."
"I think that these are appropriate measures for the situation we are experiencing in Europe's seas."
"I believe that this is the right way to go."
"If we examine this proposal carefully, the major problem is whether it is workable or not."
"As the Commissioner requested urgency, Parliament has acted urgently and foregone its right to analyse and present amendments to the regulation."
"However, the problem is in knowing whether it is possible to implement such complex rules as these within the intended period."
"One clause says that plans for reduction should begin before 30 November."
"However, these plans to reduce the number of vessels must be formulated by Member States and some of these programmes have to be approved by the European Commission, because the financial resources for the programmes will come from the existing European Fisheries Fund."
"Such programmes are extremely complex and involve compulsory percentages and some of the rules are almost impenetrable, as the Commissioner has seen today with Article 19(4)."
"This seems to me to be the major problem: will the detail of this proposal make its practical application unfeasible?"
"If so, this would be extremely regrettable."
"I therefore ask the Commission, the Commissioner and all the Directorate-General officials to think very carefully about the feasibility of what is being proposed here, because if it is not feasible within the proposed period, it is not worth the effort that we are being asked to make here."
"Mr President, the ALDE Group welcomes the proposal for a regulation but shares the general feeling of regret that we have not had time to submit fully considered amendments to it."
"It is good, therefore, to hear that the Commission will take full note of the concerns expressed both in committee this morning and in the course of tonight's debate and that it will negotiate with the Council to make such adjustments as are appropriate."
"Two such concerns relate to partial decommissioning, both in terms of whether it will detract too much from the targets for capacity reduction and about the uses to which any subsidies might be put."
"It would be helpful to gain some reassurances from the Commission in these regards."
"As to the two amendments, the first, we think, is effectively already covered by the text."
"We sympathise a great deal with the second, as we believe it is intended to address the concerns just mentioned, but we feel that it might actually prove counter-productive to capacity reduction."
"So, rather than vote in haste to promote its inclusion in a legislative text, we ask the Commission to consider the merits of the idea, and also that of developing other measures that place emphasis on the reduction of fuel consumption."
"Finally, and on a more personal note, I would point to two sentences in the Commission communication. These read: 'It is essential that this package is applied in a way that safeguards a level playing field across the Union."
"There should be no distortion of competition among EU fishermen resulting from the different ability of Member States to mobilise public or Community funding.'"
"I would endorse the point that has already been made that there should equally be no distortion of competition resulting from the different willingness of Member States to mobilise such funding."
"I trust that all possible steps will be taken to ensure that each and every one of them with a fishing fleet takes advantage of the opportunities that the regulation offers."
"(ES) Mr President, Mr Borg, ladies and gentlemen, in this debate there are a number of things we need to recognise."
"In the first place, if the fishing industry were not crying 'enough is enough', we would not be here today debating the urgent need to adopt measures."
"That is the first thing."
"Secondly, we need to recognise that the European institutions have taken up this cry of protest."
"Parliament in particular has already adopted a resolution on the crisis at its last part-session."
"Moreover, we have to acknowledge, as we told Mr Borg this morning, that the Commission has acted with uncustomary swiftness in presenting us with the package of measures which we are debating today."
"We should all welcome this."
"Is everything sorted out, then?"
"No, far from it."
"We are only just beginning."
"The Commission has submitted what we might call an initial first-phase document to tackle the crisis, an aid plan focussing on fleet restructuring."
"We now need the Commission to submit a plan for the second phase, with the same urgency, containing measures to increase fleet profitability and improve marketing as well as measures aimed at promoting the value of fish at the first point of sale, measures for which we have no precise timetable as yet."
"Nonetheless, the Council and the governments of the Member States have to apply the measures, acting as swiftly as the Commission and Parliament have done, and in line with our requests they must increase controls on imported fish products and launch extensive consumer information campaigns in order to promote the interests of our fishermen."
"If such a plan did not materialise, and if we were left with what we have on the table today, Mr Borg, all we would have is an ingenious and generous operation which takes advantage of the current crisis to reduce the fishing fleet rather than make it more profitable and rescue it from the serious crisis which it is facing today."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the fisheries sector is certainly the economic sector suffering the most from the current oil shock."
"We all know this."
"We therefore welcome the political signal given by the Commission with this package of measures."
"It will not be the European Parliament that stands in the way of its rapid approval, as my fellow Members have said here."
"We know there are no magic solutions, given the scale of the problem."
"Nevertheless, having analysed the Commission's proposals, I cannot hide my enormous disappointment."
"All the measures point in one direction: a reduction in the number of vessels."
"Even allegedly emergency measures, such as temporary cessation, are associated with compulsory reductions in the fleet."
"I do not understand why the measures set out in Article 7 exclude the replacement of engines, and it is also difficult to understand why the Fleet Adaptation Schemes should cover vessels with energy costs equivalent to more than 30% of the production costs."
"What about the other vessels, Commissioner, which includes almost all of them except trawlers?"
"And what about the coastal fleet, which is socially very important?"
"Nor do I understand why the only vessels covered by the partial reduction programme are those that use one and the same fishing gear and represent 70% of the fleet using that gear."
"This requirement, coupled with the rule to reduce capacity by 60% and to limit this capacity to 25% in order to support new vessels, makes this measure completely unfeasible, as my colleague Mr Casaca said a short while ago."
"Commissioner, I understand how difficult it is for you to find solutions for problems on this scale, but we cannot give the sector the illusion that we are trying to cure their ills when this only leads to reduction and abandonment."
"It is better to call a spade a spade and say what you are doing."
"I therefore ask you, despite the short period of time that we have before the Council on Monday, to make an effort to simplify and to be realistic, so that the positive political signal does not become an enormous disappointment to the sector, which is looking to us with great hope."
"Mr President, we are all reacting here within hours of having received the text from the Commission, which contains a package of measures to support our fishing fleet in the present economic crisis."
"The Commission is providing urgent measures of limited duration, and mainly of a social nature, which are welcome."
"The social measures apply to self-employed fishermen as well as to employees."
"In Ireland we have a particular situation following a court judgment some years ago, whereby virtually all our deckhands are self-employed or share-fishermen and have to date been precluded from social security assistance at home when out of work for either economic or weather-related reasons, so I welcome this aspect."
"In terms of the temporary 'tie-up' measures, I would like reassurances from the Commissioner that these will apply to all those who have to tie up for a short time for economic reasons, and that the restriction that they will only be available to those who are part of the restructuring scheme will be applied with the broadest interpretation."
"An application to restructure in any sense should be enough to allow an application to tie up in this particular area."
"I also welcome very much the partial decommissioning aid to allow fishermen to trade down to smaller, more climate-friendly and energy-efficient vessels."
"I would also like to think that the reduced carbon dioxide emissions from such a new contribution to the fleet should be able to be banked by Member States to contribute to their effort-sharing under the climate package, which is rapidly coming down the track towards us, and we should connect the climate package with Member States' efforts in relation to energy-efficient vessels, smaller vessels and trading down in this particular area."
"I also think it is very important that we encourage the partial decommissioning proposed in the text because this will allow fishermen who really would love to continue fishing, who have the skills and the expertise of generations, to continue, albeit in a smaller way, while we get over the present economic crisis facing them."
"So, thank you for the measures."
"I sincerely hope that Member States roll them out even-handedly."
"There is no extra money."
"It is only from within the EFF."
"It is rearranging the financial deckchairs, but let us hope that we do not have anti-competitive measures as a result of the Member States' differing strength of resources to respond."
"Mr President, I think that we are all well aware of the negative impacts of the current oil and fuel prices."
"Only in June, Age Concern Scotland said that fuel price rises will leave more vulnerable people struggling to keep warm this winter."
"A charity spokesman said, and I quote, 'Every time fuel prices increase by 1%, this results in about a thousand people in Scotland living in fuel poverty'."
"Many of these are the poorest pensioners, who are on a very low fixed income and could already be living below the poverty line."
"In this context, we might well ask why the Commission is dashing to the supposed rescue of one particular sector."
"I say 'supposed' rescue because I think we have to question whether the studied rewriting of the EFF guidelines, and potentially the de minimis guidelines, can ensure that we have a sustainable fishing industry."
"I doubt that this package will satisfy the demands of some of the fishing sector, especially if fuel prices remain high and we still have excess capacity."
"In a recent reply from the Commission on the extent of overcapacity in the EU fishing fleet, I was informed that the Commission estimates that we have, and I quote, 'significant overcapacity in some Community fisheries of, on average, at least 40%'."
"The communication and accompanying Council regulation refer to the need to reduce overcapacity."
"Let us make sure that is delivered upon."
"Mr President, the hour is late so I will be brief."
"I think it is important to let you know what the Federation of Irish Fishermen said in June when this package was first announced."
"They were sceptical and said that it was essential that any such proposal be backed up by significant funding."
"I think it has already been said that there is no additional funding, and what we are doing is rearranging the current pool of money that is available."
"I think we need to be honest about that, because this emergency package will take from other measures that may have been needed if oil prices had not caused the problems that they have for the fishing sector and, indeed, for other sectors."
"It is rather a shame that it took the industry to come out of the sea and go onto the streets for us to react in full."
"Having said that, there are parts of this package which, if they are implemented - and I think that is the key - should be very positive."
"I think it is important that fleets that had to get out, so to speak, prior to the announcement of this regulation will be assisted under these measures."
"But there are lots of other issues for the fishing industry."
"One that you mentioned, Commissioner, is the fact that prices for fish have gone down rather than up."
"I would be interested (but perhaps it is too late tonight) to hear how you think that might be addressed, because that is where we will really make progress in the fishing sector."
"Very often when people have a problem, whether they are farmers or fishermen, they say that Europe reacts too slowly."
"In this case we have not reacted very quickly, but at least there has been some speed in how we have reached the position we are in."
"However, as others have said, we have only got the paper."
"It is complex and it is a bit like the Lisbon Treaty, and I hope it will be accepted - certainly in Ireland, where the Lisbon Treaty was not."
"Mr President, I welcome the proposals from the Commission."
"This time last year I visited my own constituency in Castletownbere."
"At that time, in July 2007, fishermen were in a fairly bad state as regards the whole industry."
"Twelve months on, we are now facing up to the problems, and I welcome the proposals that are set out by the Commission here today."
"However, there is also a need for a response from Member States in other areas in relation to the whole fishing industry."
"The whole issue which you have raised in your own memorandum about quantity, quality and supply is a very important one and is about making sure that the people who produce and supply the fish get an adequate reward for the work that they do."
"I think at the end of the day, while the consumer may be paying, it is people in-between who are making quite a large part of the profit from it."
"I think one of the things that we need to change is the whole area of voluntary labelling."
"We need to bring in that mechanism so that we can clearly identify the product that comes from outside the European Union and, in many cases, the product that is not caught in compliance with the regulations that are laid down."
"I think there needs to be change in that area."
"There is too much product coming into the EU which is not properly caught in accordance with regulations, and we are not doing enough in that area to make sure that we do have a level playing field for all the people within the EU."
"I think that is a major area that we need to work on. While I welcome these regulations and these proposals, I think we also need to implement the regulations that are there for the product that is coming in from outside the European Union."
"Mr President, I would like to put a specific question that came up this morning in the Committee on Fisheries, raised by my colleague Carmen Fraga Estévez and myself."
"Article 12(3) states that 'A Fleet Adaptation Scheme shall concern only fleets where the energy costs represent on average at least 30% of the production costs, based on the turnover in 2007, of the fleet concerned by this scheme.'"
"Could you guarantee to us here and put on the record that the first six months of 2008 will be able to be taken into account in the compilation of those figures too, because they have been a critically bad six months in terms of the actual percentage increase in energy costs for the fleet, particularly the more vulnerable aspects of our fleets?"
"Mr President, as we are allowed to ask another question, I would like to put this question to the Commissioner."
"In the light of the partial decommissioning schemes and the proposal that we possibly reallocate 25% of the fishing capacity permanently withdrawn to new vessels, would this effectively mean reintroducing harmful subsidies for vessel construction?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you very much for all those interventions and for the number of questions that have been placed."
"I will try to respond to as many of them as I can given the fact that we did not have sufficient time as we usually have within the Fisheries Committee and in Plenary to discuss proposals given the urgent nature of this proposal."
"On de minimis, as we said in the communication, we will be carrying out the necessary economic analyses in the coming weeks and months and we intend to come forward with a Commission proposal, if appropriate, if the economic analysis shows that we can move forward in this direction and if WTO rules allow, before the end of this year."
"The subsequent, quite lengthy procedure involving consultation of the advisory committee of Member States and of stakeholders, and the final adoption by the Commission will normally take around six months."
"So we are speaking of a time frame which is quite extensive, it is true."
"However, I need to underline that the de minimis is not the solution to the restructuring of the fleet which is needed."
"Whether we like it or not we have a situation of significant over-capacity, and unless we address it effectively we are never going to find a permanent solution."
"It is no use, I have said it on a number of occasions, throwing money at the problem without trying to address the real cause of the problem, and this is what we are attempting to do."
"We are willing to give assistance immediately and in the medium term to fishers but we are also stressing that there needs to be effective restructuring."
"Otherwise we will need to come back here, year in year out, to discuss the same issue."
"So I need to make this abundantly clear: the Commission is not prepared simply to throw money at the problem."
"So any form of permanent operating gate to fishers is a non-starter."
"This is why I need to make it abundantly clear that we need to really address the problem."
"So that is my answer on de minimis, which we are looking into."
"Concerning market measures, we will be providing more specifics and making the situation much clearer, because there are various fronts on which we intend to deliver on this."
"First of all we will be making more financing available for POs and other industry associations in order to elaborate fishing plans, marketing plans, quality initiatives, labelling initiatives and inter-branch initiatives."
"And, as shown in other countries, for example in Norway, we can see how POs can work efficiently to assist the catching sector."
"As we indicated in our communication, these are not new tools or instruments."
"They are outlined extensively in both the CMO and in the EFF."
"The problem is that, so far, industry and Member States have not promoted them sufficiently."
"With regard to the price monitoring system, again, together with the industry and the Member States we will use this additional knowledge to set up monitoring tools along the value chain to help the sector to anticipate price developments more effectively in the future."
"The Commission has launched a study on this issue which will be completed in September."
"There is political momentum on this issue on a wider level."
"The recent European summit has supported wider initiatives of the Commission for monitoring food prices and price development mechanisms."
"Again, additional funding for a price monitoring system on fish prices will be made available by the budgetary authorities by September."
"We will start the work immediately, first through launching a pilot project on the scope and modalities of this exercise, and the full price monitoring system should then be defined and become operational before the end of 2009."
"Concerning more control with respect to certification, labelling requirements and mitigating IEU, here again, the Commission will give financial support to industry initiatives in the area of market monitoring, and in particular in relation to monitoring the sector's compliance with legal requirements concerning certification, labelling etc."
"We plan to launch calls for proposals by the end of 2008 whereby we would invite sectoral organisations to elaborate concrete proposals, and implementation of these projects will start during 2009."
"Then in 2009 we also have the full CMO review."
"So I will try to give some indicative time-frames with regard to the various market measures that we are envisaging."
"On the question of the reference period raised by both Mrs Fraga and Mrs Doyle, I can repeat again that the preliminary assessment of this suggestion indicates that we can take this on board."
"We realise that the fuel situation has changed considerably since 2007 and it does seem logical that current realities should be reflected in the aim of this package."
"We will nevertheless need to ensure that all economic data used for the reference period 2007 to 2008 are an accurate depiction of the economic situation for the fleet and vessels concerned."
"The mandatory 30% capacity reduction will still be maintained."
"The possible impact of using the 2008 figures could indirectly lead to more extensive application of the package."
"So I can confirm that we will be moving forward and taking on board this suggestion that came from the Fisheries Committee this morning."
"Concerning the point as to whether the proposal attacks the causes of the problem, I would state my belief that in fact there are two primary objectives: tackling over-capacity, as I have just said, so that we can survive in a profitable way long into the future, and also trying to assist fishers to get a fair price for their catch."
"I have just outlined the measures that we are proposing in this regard."
"With regard to the question, raised by General Morillon, concerning measures which should not be implemented to the detriment of those who have already undergone restructuring, and with regard to the point raised by Mr Allister and Mrs Attwooll and others, these are very relevant."
"I would like to say that in general terms, if there is further reduction of capacity by some Member States, this will benefit other Member States, because if there is a reduction of capacity with a consequent reduction of effort, there would be more resources and more market opportunities."
"However, more specifically let me say that the proposed ad hoc instrument to which I will come to soon will be designed in such a way as to set criteria that are needs-based and do not follow the EFF so that, for example, the requirements of those who have already undertaken substantial restructurings are recognised and that those who have low EFF allocations are also recognised."
"On the question of social aid, first of all we have to see how this measure will be defined in practice."
"To the extent that the measure only provides benefits to workers and not to companies, it might be that aid elements are not even involved."
"Therefore that would mean that the process of adoption of this would be faster."
"If an amendment to the state aid guidelines is required, then we will prepare a Commission decision, which normally takes two to three months."
"Concerning the Irish court ruling, we shall analyse how the definition of workers as self-employed potentially impacts on the application of this measure, and will seek a solution in order to address the specific problem concerning Ireland."
"On the request that emergency temporary cessation should not be linked to restructuring (which was also raised by Mrs Doyle), restructuring is relatively loosely defined in our package so there should be ample opportunity for vessels in trouble to adapt to new realities."
"They can receive aid now, and then they have six months to adapt."
"This link to restructuring has to be maintained for the emergency package, however, to have the desired result."
"With regard to the question concerning the financial requirement which was raised by Mrs McGuinness, the financial requirement solely for the temporary and permanent cessation of fishing activities is estimated at around EUR 1.6 billion."
"The total financial requirement is estimated to be in the region of EUR 2 billion."
"The current programming of the EFF Axis 1 for these measures is estimated to cover around EUR 600 million with an estimated additional EUR 250 million coming from national co-financing."
"The Commission further estimates that EUR 550 million will have to come from the programming of EFF operational programmes."
"Therefore this would leave a shortfall of EUR 600 million."
"So there is additionality as well."
"We are not just making use of EFF funds."
"There is an additionality of EUR 600 million."
"A substantial part of this amount could be financed through the unallocated margin under heading 2 of the financial framework ceilings for the years 2009-2010, with the bulk coming in 2009."
"It is this additionality which could form the ad hoc instrument I referred to before."
"The ad hoc instrument should be needs-based, so it would not directly reflect the proportionate allocations under the EFF but should target those segments of the fleet that need to restructure but which would not find assistance under the EFF, either because the EFF allocation to the Member State concerned is very limited or because it relates to areas which are non-convergence and therefore which have very limited allocations of EFF, or because there is enormous demand and therefore the EFF falls short."
"So that is my response with regard to the financial allocations."
"I would also like to make the point, in regard to the question raised, that while in the short term we are not proposing any miracle solution, we are providing for immediate temporary cessation for three months effective from 1 July 2008 and, as I said, we will be taking a flexible view with regard to the definition of restructuring, whereas with regard to the further temporary cessation provisions, those have to be part and parcel of a fleet adaptation scheme."
"But with regard to the first three months, as long as there is restructuring in a general way then the entitlement would apply."
"On the point raised as to whether we can deliver within the time-frame because of conditionalities involved, my response is that most of the conditionalities relate to partial decommissioning which is a new instrument and which was very contentious even in reaching this stage."
"Removing partial decommissioning would remove also most of the conditionalities attached to it."
"I am sure, however, that this is not what you would want."
"But I can assure you that the Commission will urge Member States and the industry to take up the fleet adaptation schemes and to ensure that these are properly monitored and properly implemented so that the time-frames envisaged and the conditionalities set will be adhered to and respected."
"Again I would like to say that it is not true to say that all measures relate to decommissioning of vessels."
"It is true that there is a continuation of total decommissioning but there is the introduction of partial decommissioning, and partial decommissioning means that we will be removing older vessels and introducing new smaller ones, and in this sense therefore there will be introduction of new vessels with lower capacity in absolute terms."
"We will have a real effective reduction of capacity but at the same time we will also have properly addressed the fuel problems."
"There are also measures with regard to engine substitution and with regard to gear and equipment change, and there are the measures that I have outlined concerning the market measures and social aid."
"So I do not think it is correct to say that what we are proposing is simply a continuation of total decommissioning of vessels."
"There are various other instruments and I hope that Member States will be able to pick from these the ones that would in the most appropriate way address the concerns and realities of the sector."
"With regard to the point made by Mrs Stihler concerning the fact that these could be harmful subsidies for new construction, I need to underline the fact that we will not be paying one cent for decommissioning for vessels whose capacity is maintained."
"What we will be paying is the scrapping aid for total decommissioning and we will be paying scrapping aid for the part that is decommissioned."
"We are not paying any state assistance for the capacity that remains."
"We are simply trying to find a solution whereby the necessary restructuring through reducing capacity, which we attempted by virtue of total decommissioning which has not proved too successful, might hopefully be more effectively addressed through this new instrument of partial decommissioning."
"The combination of partial decommissioning, total decommissioning, retaining vessels in operation with the possibility of engine substitutions, with the possibility of modernisation on board etc., all measures which already exist, and the whole package within a fleet adaptation scheme, could lead to a situation where we effectively bring about the needed reduction in capacity, which would translate to a reduction of effort to meet with the present state of affairs we have concerning the health of fish stocks."
"I just want to conclude with regard to the original intervention by Mrs Stihler that I can only repeat the well-known maxim that you are damned if you do and damned if you don't."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 10 July 2008."
"Written Statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (IT) I welcome the approval of the proposal for a regulation to address the crisis in the fisheries sector."
"These provisions will undoubtedly not resolve all the problems of a sector which is uniquely complex, as the European Council recognised at the June summit, given the dual constraint of resources and the market which makes the sector less able to withstand economic pressures."
"The measure approved today in the wake of the fuel crisis undoubtedly opens up new prospects and new scenarios."
"It is important for our fishing operators to grasp all the opportunities that it offers."
"It should be borne in mind that the increase in the price of fuel, which has more than doubled in the space of a few months, has not just cancelled out earnings, but is now causing fishing operators to operate at a loss."
"The regulation makes provision for a special temporary measure with a deadline of 31 December 2010 whose objective is to support faster adaptation of the Community fleet to the present situation, cushioning social and economic consequences in the transitional period."
"The package focuses chiefly on reducing fishing effort and overcapacity and modernising and converting fleets with a view to a resolving the problem of high fuel dependency."
"Other measures are intended to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions from fishing vessels, and to encourage a shift away from fishing techniques which are damaging for the environment, such as bottom trawling."
"in writing - The emergency package that has been proposed by the Commission is a step towards putting a stop to the precarious situation faced by European fishermen."
"Irish fishermen have some serious concerns that must be taken into account."
"How will the 2 billion in aid be distributed?"
"Will it be fleet by fleet or by quota allocation?"
"Furthermore, what will be done about the bottom trawlers that make up the vast majority of the current European fleet and are at risk of being wiped out by the current emergency package which has been proposed?"
"This greatly concerns the Irish fishermen as Ireland has experimented with alternatives to bottom trawlers and so far no success has been achieved."
"If Ireland is to continue providing fish to the rest of the EU and still have the means to provide for their families this is not acceptable."
"Ireland has the biggest coastal area in the European Community."
"The common fisheries policy has not worked for Ireland."
"Irish fishermen have faced hard times before but now they no longer have the control to work through their troubles."
"It is time for a change."
"It is time to reinstate Irish fisherman as stewards of Irish waters."

"- Before the vote:"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on Monday night you had a debate following media reports that the Italian authorities would be fingerprinting the inhabitants of nomad camps."
"I can of course confirm the Commission's position on this, as outlined on Monday by Commissioner Špidla, who specifically referred to the letter that I sent to the Italian authorities on 3 July."
"During this debate, Mr Schulz expressed the view that I should inform the European Parliament."
"In addition - since Mr Deprez is here, I can say this before the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs - I kept the Bureau and coordinators informed."
"Yesterday, Madam President, if I have understood correctly, the Conference of Presidents wanted me to make a brief statement to update Parliament on the latest news."
"I will briefly go over the measures taken by the Commission, which is of course extremely vigilant when it comes to these matters."
"I met with Mr Ronchi on 26 May."
"On 3 July I asked the Italian Government to explain the purpose and proportionality of the measures."
"We had an initial meeting with Mr Maroni in Cannes, during the Informal Council."
"Mr Maroni is the Italian Minister of the Interior."
"During this meeting, Mr Maroni explained that the census would be used to check on entitlements to welfare benefits for the inhabitants of the nomad camps."
"He explained that fingerprints would be taken only if it was impossible to establish identity by other means, and that children would be fingerprinted only with a court order."
"(Uproar)"
"I am merely repeating what the Minister said."
"I will tell you in a minute what I did."
"He said that he had asked to abolish any census on the basis of religion or ethnicity, and that the Italian Government, in cooperation with Unicef, had launched an action plan for the education of minors."
"Nevertheless, I have to say that the Italian Government has agreed to send us a status report on the situation by the end of July, which is extremely important."
"After this informal meeting, I asked the Director-General for Justice, Freedom and Security, Jonathan Faull, to write to the Italian authorities to obtain written confirmation of this information and to ask for additional clarification ahead of the report expected at the end of July."
"A letter was sent on 9 July."
"Late yesterday evening my staff in Brussels received a preliminary response."
"This document provides clarification on the identification of ethnicity and religion."
"As for the other aspects, I am unable to say at this point whether these will fully answer the questions asked by the Commission."
"It is our intention to obtain all the necessary information about the fingerprinting process."
"What is the purpose of fingerprinting and how will fingerprints be processed?"
"What is the legal basis authorising this kind of processing of personal data?"
"Will this data be kept?"
"How will it be kept?"
"Can it be used for other purposes?"
"Are the people who are fingerprinted given preliminary information in writing?"
"As far as children are concerned, we requested confirmation of reports that under-14s would be fingerprinted only if this was authorised by a judge, for the purpose of establishing their identity."
"We have also asked about the situation in the 17 regions of Italy that are not affected by the emergency decree."
"Finally, we have asked for texts, measures, decisions and legislative, regulatory or administrative acts to be sent that will give us an idea of the situation."
"It is up to you to decide whether we intend to follow up this issue with all the required vigilance and of course whether we enter into the necessary dialogue with the Italian authorities."
"To conclude, Madam President, the Commission wants this matter to be handled transparently and with respect for fundamental rights and Community law."
"Our role is to act as the guardian of the Treaties, verifying objectively, once we are in possession of all the relevant information, that Italy has correctly applied the Community law applicable in these cases."
"Generally speaking, as Commissioner Špidla explained, I am convinced - and I said as much to the Italian Government - that it is necessary to find effective solutions tailored to the problems faced in particular by the Roma, especially Roma children, who are the primary victims of the situation of poverty and exclusion."
"The Roma must be helped and not stigmatised; this is why, in the report that it presented last week, the Commission emphasised that the European Union, the Member States and civil society must join forces to effectively coordinate their efforts to this end."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to Rule 170 of our Rules of Procedure and wish to table a motion on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats regarding this vote."
"There are issues and political views that divide us, but there are also things that unite us in this Parliament, and these include a commitment to human rights, the fight against all forms of racism, so we should not allow ourselves to become divided on those topics where we are in agreement because, otherwise, we shall weaken the very issue that unites us."
"Our competent Commissioner Jacques Barrot has explained that there continue to be some unanswered questions when it comes to assessing the facts about the problems we may have in Italy."
"At the moment we are referring mainly to articles in the press, and we are referring to a wide variety of forms that have been sent around Parliament over recent weeks."
"Therefore we, the PPE-DE Group, move that today's vote on the resolution be postponed until the September part-session because, by then, the facts will have been clarified and we shall know what we are voting on."
"I should like to say to all the Members who disagree with this that, as long as you are not out to get a quick headline, but instead have the objectives of cooperating to achieve something for the minorities in Europe, and of all groups in this Parliament, both large and small, pulling together, then jointly we can achieve something for these people."
"Those who just want a quick headline, just want to get publicity, should vote now."
"We advocate postponing it until we know the facts of the matter."
"I have to acknowledge that the debate we have had over the last few days has exerted enough pressure to get the matter moving."
"I would ask those who want proper answers to support the motion for us to discuss this in September."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Madam President, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament asked on Monday evening and again yesterday for the Commission to give a report on its discussions with the Italian Government."
"Commissioner Barrot has reported in a very factual but conclusive way that, for one thing, the Italian Government has passed on information that was very incomplete and, it seems to me, not particularly relevant."
"You are all familiar with this form."
"It is a form of the type normally used to record crimes, a form that clearly shows that the Italian Government is taking measures that would be suited to criminal investigations, at the most, but which most definitely do not serve the protection of children."
"Judging by what Mr Barrot has just told us, it is more imperative than ever to adopt this resolution today, to send out a clear signal from the European Parliament."
"(Applause from the centre and left)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak in favour of Mr Weber's proposal and I would like to thank Commissioner Barrot, not only for what he has said today in this House, but also for his commitment to resolving, in the best and most constructive way, a situation that in Italy should be recognised for what it is, namely an emergency involving thousands of people."
"I assure you that thousands of minors are living in conditions of total neglect, with no right to medical treatment, vaccinations or schooling."
"It seems to me that the Commission and the Italian Government are working together... - Mr President, may I finish speaking?"
"May I continue or must I stop speaking?"
"Would you please remind the House that I have the right to speak? - I was saying that the Commission and the Government are going in the right direction and in particular I believe that we should not vote on a resolution that is full of inaccuracies, actual errors from a legal point of view, i.e. full of legal falsehoods."
"It is therefore an entirely political resolution, with no basis in fact."
"Among other things, I would like to remind the House - and I am reaching my conclusion - that, while Commissioner Barrot has been extremely clear today, three days ago Commissioner Špidla said that he had yet to read the act, which I believe consists of no more than two pages."
"Therefore if those on the left must at all costs make a premature judgment on a government's methods, I believe it to be entirely illegitimate."
"(Parliament rejected the request to postpone the vote)"

"(DE) Madam President, we have quite a large number of important votes today."
"With that in mind, it is really not necessary for Mr Cohn-Bendit to provide a non-stop flow of comments and conversation to accompany the voting; it is distracting."
"Madam President, I would like to draw attention to the fact that we have just rejected an amendment asking for the release of someone we nominated for the Sakharov Prize."

"In the run-up to the Irish referendum there were no end of reports saying 'please don't publish this until after the Irish have voted'."
"As soon as the ballots were safely counted, we have gone back to our agenda of harmonising policy, particularly in the field of militarisation and justice and home affairs."
"The last time we met in this Chamber as an Assembly, speaker after speaker spoke about respecting the Irish vote, 'but ...'."
"Now we understand what the 'but' meant."
"The 'but' meant that we should disregard the outcome and push ahead with this process of harmonising criminal justice, civil law, immigration, asylum and the rest of the home affairs field."
"No more are we even pretending to respect the verdict of the people."
"We are back in our own little world where we pretend that the voters do not exist and we continue with what we were doing anyway."
"(PL) Madam President, because of the heavier security precautions in place in Strasbourg today, which is a highly exceptional situation that has never arisen before during a plenary session, I was unable to be present for the first part of the voting."
"May I therefore register my excuse for being absent during the roll call voting."
"The car that was supposed to bring me to the European Parliament was over half an hour late, and I would request that this excuse be placed on record."
"Mr Rogalski, we covered this at the beginning: people who arrive during the proceedings will of course be excused."
"Madam President, I am sure many people are interested in what I am going to say."
"I really want to talk about the idea that we repeatedly go from one crisis to another crisis in the fisheries sector without really trying to tackle the fundamental problem."
"And the fundamental problem with the fisheries sector is actually the common fisheries policy, a policy based on Soviet-style central planning where quotas are allocated to various Member States."
"Surely the time has come to rip apart this piece of Communist central planning and to move to a situation where we have property rights-based solutions."
"Let us look at some of the most successful solutions to preserving fishing stocks: in New Zealand, for example, and in Iceland, where they are based on property rights and transferable property rights."
"It is time to stop the EU thinking in terms of central planning and becoming an 'EUSSR'."
"Let us move to a free market-based economy."
"(NL) The fact that this Parliament has come down like a ton of bricks on a perfectly reasonable decision by the Italian Government in the last few days is symptomatic of the suffocating atmosphere of left-wing political correctness in this institution."
"I can assure you, however, that the thoughts of the vast majority of the population of European countries are absolutely the reverse of what the majority of MEPs are evidently voting for."
"The launch of a fingerprinting system by the Italian Government as an impetus to tackling the enormous problems resulting from mass Roma immigration into the country definitely has the support of the vast majority of the people."
"Besides, European interference in this dossier is unacceptable."
"I am surprised that the European Union does not throw open its own luxurious buildings to the Roma and its private schools to Roma children."
"The much-lauded 'human rights' evidently stop at the borders of the privileged domains of the eurocracy."
"Madam President, I am realising that the Civil Liberties Committee of this Parliament is almost the last place where one expects to find any defence of civil liberties."
"We saw the beginning of a rather worrying streak of intolerance in that committee when Mr Buttiglione was opposed as a Commission nominee."
"We then saw the most draconian legislation pushed through under the pretext of anti-terror rules."
"I cannot forget the Liberal Democrat leader Graham Watson's comment that Osama bin Laden had done more for the process of European integration than anyone since Jacques Delors!"
"And now in the vote we have just had, we see this quite bizarre refusal even to consider the facts of the case."
"I do not know whether the Italian Government is right when it claims that there are inaccuracies in this report."
"My own instincts are liberal on this."
"I do not like the idea of databases, I do not like the idea of finger-printing."
"But surely basic courtesy and basic fairness ought to have prompted us to allow the Government to invite a group from this Parliament to assess the facts of the case, before voting."
"Pushing ahead with the vote before even listening to all the facts confirms that, just as the Employment Committee is the last place to defend employment, just as the Committee on Fisheries is the last place to defend fisheries..."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"(DE) Madam President, on behalf of the Austrian People's Party delegation, I should like to say that, naturally, we are all agreed that we should take every measure to improve the difficult situation of the Roma, not only in Italy but also elsewhere, and to deal with it wisely."
"However, we believe that, in the current situation, in which we do not have all the facts to hand, we should not adopt a resolution, because to do so would be to anticipate the facts."
"(SK) I abstained from voting on the motion for a resolution on the situation in China after the earthquake and before the Olympic Games because the voting did not cover any amendments requiring the release of political prisoners, in particular the candidate for the Sakharov Prize."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to once again draw attention to the importance of freedom of expression which is the main prerequisite for the start of the democratisation process in China."
"Press freedom is very important since it is independent media that provide information on the human rights situation in China without censorship."
"It is therefore essential for independent television stations such as NTDTV to be able to broadcast."
"This satellite television station broadcasts 24 hours a day in Chinese and English via satellites over Asia, Europe, Australia and North America."
"The French company Eutelsat, which facilitates NTDTV satellite broadcasts, suddenly discontinued these television broadcasts over Asia on 16 June 2008, clearly under pressure from the Chinese Communist Party."
"In order to be successful, we must supplement the words of the resolution with actions."
"We call upon the leadership of the European Parliament to insist upon the resumption of these television broadcasts over Asia."
"(DE) Madam President, this House has a strong tradition of human rights, of which we can be proud."
"This applies not least to our policies on China and Tibet."
"That is why I find it all the more regrettable that our resolution today does not live up to these requirements in any way."
"In an historic moment, it did not have the strength to raise what should have been raised in the run-up to the Olympic Games in China."
"Therefore let me state categorically: our President, Mr Pöttering, has represented our human rights principles unequivocally over the last few months."
"German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has done the same, clearly and impressively."
"I should therefore like to call upon this House to return to the clear statements of its policy on China and Tibet in past years and decades and regard this resolution as a moment of weakness before the summer recess."
"(LT) I would like to say a few words about the document, about China."
"I voted in favour of the document, but, much to my regret, many important amendments were rejected."
"Today we have stated that the situation in Tibet is normal, which is not true."
"We have refused to invite Tibet's spiritual leader to the General Affairs Council, and that is a very wrong decision; we were not even able to vote against those who practise Falun Gong."
"I therefore regret this and I do believe that these issues should be approached again as soon as possible."
"Madam President, I want to say only that I and many in my group have been confused by the voting list because, following its suggestions, we have voted for some absurd positions."
"To invite the Dalai Lama - no, against."
"The situation in Tibet is not normal - no, we have voted that it is normal."
"Many of us have been confused."
"Of course, I tried to correct the situation, but the information was falsified and our list was highly incorrect."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not believe that Mr Landsbergis has actually read the resolution that we have adopted with a two-thirds majority."
"If he had, he would know that we mention the insupportable situation in Tibet four times and call on the Chinese Government to respect human rights and cultural rights in Tibet."
"Mr Landsbergis, do not tell untruths."
"The vast majority of us - that is, the majority of this Parliament - have spoken up for human rights and for the cultural autonomy of Tibet."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to state my reasons for voting against this report."
"I feel that this report is actually - and I say this with deep conviction - one of the most controversial documents adopted by Parliament in recent times."
"I am convinced that the lack of any clear plan for how the EU will open up to the East, especially in the context of Ukraine's possible future accession, is an entirely valid reason for voting against the report."
"I shall pass over the fact that the preliminary draft of this report was totally muddled."
"To conclude, a remark to you, Madam President: you have allowed two people to rise who were not down to speak."
"Please keep to the procedure."
"The President can give the floor to whoever he or she chooses."
"I wanted to give the floor to Members who are effectively non-attached, but I am perfectly entitled to do so."
"(NL) One of the reasons why I voted against the Brok report, diluted as it is by amendments, is its recommendation for a 'communication policy' that will in actual fact boil down to even more EU propaganda."
"This is symptomatic of what is going fundamentally wrong in the European Union."
"Instead of taking account of the views of the electorate, the EU is attempting to change these views via propaganda."
"However, the referendum in Ireland has further demonstrated that this kind of social engineering produces the opposite effect."
"Consequently, the EU would do better to stop this and show respect for the opinions and complaints of Europeans instead of doing exactly the opposite."
"(DE) Madam President, I voted in favour of the Brok report, as I believe that it is an important step in the right direction."
"I also endorse the communication policy it calls for."
"However, communication also involves truth and clarity."
"It is time we finally stated clearly that Croatia can and should join the EU within the current decade."
"The countries of South-East Europe have definite prospects of joining the EU in the next decade, but truth and clarity also require an acknowledgment that pushing ahead with the accession of Turkey would undermine the EU."
"We should therefore be honest with our partner, Turkey, and say at last that we shall have to find other ways of cooperating."
"Although the Brok report does not actually put it this way, this is the logical conclusion from its contents, which are as they should be."
"(PL) Madam President, I am one of the authors of this report."
"May I say that the situation in Zimbabwe is like 'The Neverending Story'."
"The European Parliament is making its voice heard once again on this subject, and I am very pleased that we have managed to override political divisions and speak out so strongly and decisively on the scandalous situation that is taking place there."
"This is why I voted in favour of this report, which, after all, I helped to draft."
"Madam President, I am very happy to speak on this motion because I actually voted in favour of it, like many colleagues in this House."
"However, my request to parliamentarians and politicians across Europe is: Let us ensure that this is not just warm words, just to appease our conscience."
"Let us look at actions, not words."
"I refer, of course, to the Lisbon Summit, where we invited Mugabe, despite the sanctions."
"I look, of course, to the Rome Summit on the food crisis and food security: we invited Robert Mugabe and his henchmen to shop in some of the most luxurious shops of Europe while his people were starving."
"The time for warm words is over."
"It is all very well us feeling great about what we said, but we have got to put those words into action: we have got to impose these sanctions against the Mugabe regime."
"Let us stop being hypocritical, especially my Portuguese and my Italian friends."
"Madam President, I voted in favour of this resolution and, like Mr Kamall, I have received an increasing number of letters over the last few years about the situation in Zimbabwe."
"The people I represent across the East Midlands of the United Kingdom simply cannot understand how we can always state such strong opinions about Zimbabwe in this place, but allow Mr Mugabe into the continent to break bread with our leaders."
"There is something seriously wrong and seriously hypocritical about that; it devalues this institution and many others."
"So I hope that in the future we can sort this situation out, get rid of this awful man, and democracy can prosper in Zimbabwe."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by apologising to all my colleagues in this House for holding up the next speaker."
"I forget his name, but I also hope he will stand up when he speaks and show some respect for this House."
"We were promised that Galileo would not be a white elephant, but that we were looking for a role for it."
"If you look at all the other satellite systems - the Chinese and Russian satellite systems and the American GPS - people are asking why we need Galileo."
"It is quite clear, if you look at this system - the white elephant in the sky - that we are looking for more and more uses for it."
"Now we are looking for a military dimension."
"Why do we need this military dimension?"
"We clearly do not need it."
"It is based purely on envy of the Americans and 'me too' politics."
"Let us scrap this complete nonsense and let us save the taxpayers money, return it to the taxpayers and rely on much better technology."
"(DE) Madam President, I am of the opinion that the way we are doing this is not consistent with the good reputation this House enjoys."
"It is unacceptable for the whole Chamber to be chatting when speakers rise to speak."
"I would exhort you, Madam President, to keep the Chamber quiet and to ensure that those who are not listening leave the room."
"I completely agree with you, Mrs Klamt, but as you know, each time we ask the same thing, and each time we have the same problems."
"in writing. - (FR) Based on the report by my British fellow Member Mrs Ludford, I voted in favour of the legislative resolution amending, at first reading of the codecision procedure, the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Common Consular Instructions on visas for diplomatic missions and consular posts in relation to the introduction of biometrics including provisions on the organisation of the reception and processing of visa applications."
"This proposal is aimed at creating the legal basis necessary for the Member States to identify the mandatory biometric identifiers - facial images and 10 fingerprints - of visa applicants and establishing a legal framework for the organisation of Member State consulates in order to implement the Visa Information System (VIS) together with the establishment of Common Application Centres."
"This would avoid all Member States having to supply their consulates with the equipment necessary to collect biometric data."
"I support most of the amendments, particularly those on the representation of one Member State by another, security measures regarding external service providers and information campaigns."
"The objectives of this proposal for a regulation are the organisation of the reception and processing of visa applications in relation to the introduction of biometrics in the Visa Information System (VIS) at EU level, providing, firstly, for the obligation to provide biometric data to be stored in the VIS and the standards for doing so and, secondly, the provisions on the organisation of the reception of visa applications."
"This proposal, which is part of the communitarisation of border management (Schengen Area), will put in place the collection of 'biometric identifiers' (photographs and fingerprints) of visa applicants, a measure which is questionable to say the least, and one where a range of questions remain unanswered, namely regarding: its effectiveness, protection of this personal data, the objectives and criteria for collecting data, the standards governing the content of VIS files, access rights (namely, in the framework of agreements between the EU and various countries on the exchange of information), and finally, safeguarding citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees."
"We disagree with the communitarisation of justice and home affairs and the creation of surveillance and control structures and instruments at EU level, promoting securitarian policies."
"Hence our vote against."
"in writing. - (RO) I hope the vote I have given today will facilitate the negotiations with the United States on visa waiver and that, soon, all the Member States citizens will be able to travel freely and receive the same treatment."
"It is imperative that one of the subjects negotiated by the French presidency refer to the criteria for granting United States visa to all the European Community citizens."
"in writing. - The agreement on fishing between the EU and Mauritania is definitely important for both parties."
"Through this agreement, fishermen from the Mediterranean are able to exercise their trade elsewhere, as the Mediterranean is being over-fished."
"The recent tuna issue is just the beginning."
"I am aware that two fishing companies from Malta have used this agreement to fish in the Atlantic."
"This came to my knowledge when I was on an official EP delegation to Mauritania and the delegation was informed by the President that all endeavours to find a solution to that agreement had thus far failed."
"It was at this point that I asked to speak to the President in private."
"I asked if he had ever discussed the issue with the Commissioner Dr. Joe Borg, who is the Maltese Commissioner."
"The President informed me that he had not talked to him but that I was free to do so myself if I wished."
"I took it upon myself to immediately contact Dr. Borg who, after assessing the file, gave me a synopsis of the issues at stake."
"I brought this to the attention of the President, also informing him of the desire of the Commissioner to restart the discussions."
"in writing. - (PL) The European Union is once more usurping the right to be a separate state."
"I think that the conclusion of international agreements is the domain of a state, not of a regional, international organisation like the European Union, so I have voted against this report."
"The Dutch Labour Party delegation has voted in favour of the agreement with Mauritania, not because it is a good agreement, but because it represents a small improvement in the existing situation (reduced catches)."
"On the whole, we oppose such agreements, as they deprive developing countries of their sources of food and income."
"In the case of Mauritania, it is even more distressing that development funds are being used to support the interest of fisheries."
"This is a disgrace!"
"in writing. - (SV) We abstained in the vote today on the partnership agreement on fishing between the EU and Mauritania."
"We were faced with two undesirable alternatives, either a shorter agreement with higher fish quotas or a longer agreement with lower fish quotas."
"Unfortunately there was no option to vote for a termination of the agreement."
"We moderates are against fishing agreements with African states."
"The report contained very minor improvements compared with the present agreement, but also retrograde elements such as an extension of the period of validity."
"Faced with a choice between these undesirable alternatives, we abstained in the vote."
"I welcome the continuation of the fisheries agreement with Mauritania, although it is appropriate to point out that the negotiation process was not always conducted in the most open and transparent fashion."
"The Member States were not sufficiently consulted during the negotiation period, resulting in a protocol under which fishing opportunities have fallen considerably while financial compensation is held at virtually the same level. Key technical aspects affecting the main fleets have not been resolved; on the contrary, new restrictions such as an additional biological recovery period have been imposed, without much scientific rigour."
"Despite this, Portugal has taken a reasonable stance as far as its fishing opportunities in these fishing grounds are concerned, namely 886 GT annually for Category 1 (Vessels fishing for crustaceans other than spiny lobster and crab), gaining a licence in Category 5 (Cephalopods) and retaining 300 GT for spiny lobster."
"Based on this information, I believe this is a positive agreement for my country and I vote in favour."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the legislative resolution of the European Parliament of 10 July 2008 on the proposal for a Council Regulation instituting a temporary specific action aiming to promote the restructuring of the European Union fishing fleets affected by the economic crisis."
"One of the main challenges facing the EU fisheries sector remains, in many cases, the structural imbalance between fleet capacity and the resources available."
"The overcapacity of the EU fleet was estimated a few years ago at around 40%."
"This overcapacity, combined with the depletion of fishing stocks by decades of overfishing, means that the sector is struggling to withstand external economic pressures such as the sudden rise in fuel prices."
"I wish that a Community instrument annualising the increase in oil prices had been envisaged so that the internal market had time to react to rising cost prices."
"I welcome the actions of the French Agriculture and Fisheries Minister, Michel Barnier, who worked hard to achieve this result."
"Thanks to him, immediate support measures were obtained."
"in writing. - (PT) The fisheries sector has been one of the sectors that has suffered most from the current energy crisis."
"The dizzying rise in fuel prices together with the reduction of the fishing effort introduced by the CFP and the stagnation of first sale fish prices have placed shipowners and fishermen in delicate positions."
"This therefore justifies this proposal for an urgent Council Regulation seeking to ensure that the EU's fleet adapts to the current economic situation dictated by the energy crisis."
"As a matter of fact, this proposal follows a Commission Communication in which the problems and constraints facing the fisheries sector appear to be diagnosed correctly, as well as the necessary measures to alleviate the current crisis."
"Although I consider the initiative behind the presentation of this Regulation positive, I believe that it is somewhat less than could have been expected after reading the aforementioned Communication."
"The temporary cessation of fishing activities mentioned in Article 6, with the obligation of inclusion in fleet restructuring plans, the non-inclusion of engines in Article 7, all of Article 9, and Article 12(3), which merely defends the interests of trawl fisheries, seem less successful points in this proposal."
"Notwithstanding the above, and given the great difficulties the fisheries sector is experiencing at European level, this document deserves my vote in favour."
"in writing. - (PT) As we explained in a speech during yesterday's debate, the reasons for our vote against this proposal for a regulation are fundamental ones."
"If there could be any doubts as to their justness, it would have been enough to follow the European Commission's speeches to dispel them."
"The problem for the European Commission is overcapacity and the target and solution is the 'restructuring of fleets'."
"What about the socio-economic crisis?"
"What about the rising fuel prices (diesel and especially petrol)?"
"What about the first sale fish price?"
"For the Commission, it is quite simple: 'if there is further reduction of capacity by some Member States, this will benefit other Member States, because if there is a reduction of capacity with a consequent reduction of effort, there would be more resources and more market opportunities.'"
"Hence the suggestion of about EUR 1.6 billion (!) just for vessel decommissioning."
"'Simple' - if the disease does not kill the fisheries sector, the 'cure' will."
"There is no funding to help the sector face increased production costs and to safeguard wages."
"However, EUR 1.6 billion is being proposed for permanent, partial or 'temporary' cessation of fishing activities."
"The Portuguese Government is following this maxim and is, for the record, allocating about EUR 8.2 million for the decommissioning of 27 vessels in 2008."
"in writing. - The negative impact of the current oil and fuel prices affects all EU citizens."
"This 'supposed rescue' package will do little to ensure a sustainable fishing industry."
"Although I support capacity reduction - currently some Community fisheries are at least 40% over capacity - I do not think this proposal will achieve the changes required to achieve a sustainable EU fishing sector."
"With 80% of EU stocks at worrying levels we need real capacity reduction, not renewed boat building at the taxpayers' expense."
"in writing. - (RO) The situation of the Roma population is brought into discussion again at an extremely important moment, when specific events prove that there are still considerable deficiencies at the level of national and European policies in this field and that the need to monitor and consolidate them is obvious."
"I think the result of the debate and resolution regarding the fingerprinting of Roma people in Italy should be based on two key conclusions."
"First of all, it is essential that the national measures regarding the Roma people be oriented toward social integration and the creation of a framework of rights and responsibilities for these citizens."
"Nevertheless, such rights and responsibilities should comply with the EU fundamental principles of non-discrimination, as well as respect for fundamental freedoms and human dignity."
"The rights of minors, regardless of their ethnical membership, should be ensured with priority."
"This approach has been used in Romania and should be expanded to the situation in the other Member States as well."
"Secondly, taking into consideration the cultural particularities of the Roma people, the solution for its integration should be found at European level by drafting a coherent and comprehensive strategy."
"In addition to guaranteeing the fundamental rights, this strategy should also promote access to education, especially to education for tolerance in the context of the 2008 Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"I voted against the resolution of the European Parliament asking Italy to stop the census of the Roma on the basis of ethnicity, because this seems premature and I regret the fact that Parliament did not vote in favour of the motion for postponement until September 2008 tabled by my political group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Let us be clear on this: I am of course in favour of the ban on fingerprinting the Roma population, including minors, and using the fingerprints collected, since this would clearly constitute an act of direct discrimination based on race and ethnic origin, prohibited by Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and would also represent an act of discrimination."
"Nevertheless, I was swayed by the arguments of the Vice-President of the European Commission, my friend Jacques Barrot, since he clearly said that the Commission was closely watching the situation with complete transparency to ensure that Community law was enforced."
"In all good conscience, I have decided that we should wait for the various responses expected from the Italian Government before taking political initiatives such as the resolution adopted, which could be open to misinterpretation by European citizens."
"I am voting in favour of this resolution although I hope that it is not exploited for party-political purposes."
"The Roma issue is neither a right-wing nor a left-wing issue but simply a serious and unsolved problem requiring urgent action, and that has been put off for too long."
"We are for a culture of integration and we therefore need to invest in practical efforts and commitments."
"The measure under discussion in our Government, despite Minister Maroni's ambiguous reassurances, should be reduced to the bare essentials: the problem with this measure is not identification in itself, but the fact that it aims to use an ethnic criterion and a highly discriminatory practice (fingerprinting), especially in relation to minors."
"We are not alone in highlighting these abuses: there have been loud protests from large parts of the Catholic Church, and both lay and Catholic voluntary associations and organisations."
"The national President of Unicef has also firmly rejected the substance of this decree."
"I hope that this vote, which in practical terms condemns Italy, teaches the Government a lesson: that it must abandon the mistaken path that it has taken."
"in writing. - British Conservative MEPs have voted against this resolution as the issue the text deals with is one which is wholly a matter for internal affairs of one Member State and thus has no bearing at an EU level."
"in writing. - Just substitute 'Jew' for 'Roma' and we know where this proposal is coming from and where, unless it is vigorously opposed, it will go."
"We view the increasing and unacceptable climate of racism and xenophobia in Europe with concern, in particular when this is spurred on by neoliberal policies that exacerbate rather than provide answers to the needs and problems that lead to increased insecurity and worse living conditions for workers and populations."
"The measures that were recently adopted in Italy, where on 21 May a 'state of emergency in relation to the nomad settlements in the regions of Campania, Lazio and Lombardy' was declared for a one-year period, are an example of these dangerous and unacceptable measures that promote discrimination, segregation and the 'criminalisation' of citizens and populations, violating their rights, freedoms and guarantees - their most basic human rights."
"This increases situations of poverty, exclusion and social disintegration and consequently gives rise to marginalisation and ghettoisation, illiteracy and incorporation into the informal economy, and encourages many citizens of Roma origin not to participate in society."
"On the contrary, and as is pointed out, the best way to protect the rights of the Roma is to guarantee access to education, housing and healthcare, employment and social security in the framework of inclusion and integration policies."
"in writing. - (SV) Discrimination against the Roma is a serious problem which must be countered in every Member State in Europe."
"Every European citizen has the same rights irrespective of nationality, ethnic origin, religion or sex."
"It is the foundation of the successes and development of the European Union and is a principle which we have a common duty to uphold."
"This raises demands for access to education and healthcare as well as the right to respect for integrity and personal dignity."
"The situation which characterises the treatment of the Roma in Italy today has to be seen within this perspective."
"The EU has a responsibility to ensure that the fundamental rights of people are upheld in every country."
"However, it also raises demands for people, regardless of origin, to be integrated into the society in which they live, with the requirements of equal treatment which that involves, formulated without discrimination, on equal terms for all citizens."
"This is important in the fight against people trafficking, prostitution and social exclusion."
"Neither adults nor children must be allowed to fall through the net of this responsibility."
"It is against this background that we did not feel able to support any of the resolutions which Parliament has debated today."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of this resolution and I welcome the fact that the European Parliament makes a stand against this discriminatory and illegal action from the point of view of the European human rights legislation."
"Nevertheless, I call attention to the fact that a mere resolution will not solve the basic problem, since this legislative act is of a non-binding nature."
"For this reason, I think we should request the European Commission to take action against Italy in order to make it give up its discriminatory policy against the people of Roma origin."
"The fingerprinting measure is not in compliance either with the European legislation or with any other instrument guaranteeing human rights in Europe."
"At the European Community level, there is Directive 380 of 28 April 2008, which provides for the obligation to fingerprint the citizens of third countries, as of the age of 6 years."
"Nevertheless, I emphasize the fact that it refers to third countries, which do not belong to the European Union area."
"Moreover, the Directive 2004/38/EC guarantees the free movement of any Member State citizens, consequently ethnicity could not represent the basis for a legislative measure under any circumstance."
"in writing. - Italy's actions fly in the face of every call from the European Parliament for a coherent EU policy on Roma integration."
"Roma are one of the main targets of racism and discrimination."
"The Italian Government is trying to condone and institutionalise such racism and discrimination."
"Italian authorities must refrain from fingerprinting Roma and I voted in favour of the resolution."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of postponement of the vote on this sensitive report, believing that it would be more appropriate to wait until all of the information requested by the Commission from the Italian Government was available to us."
"While the House voted to reject such a postponement, I abstained in the final vote, not wishing to support the resolution without all the facts being available to use and having some concerns about part of the text, while also wishing to acknowledge that any heavy-handed actions by the authorities targeting one specific group in society cannot be condoned."
"in writing. - The treatment of Roma people in Italy should be a wake up call to the fact that minorities in Europe are being treated in an inhuman, discriminatory and degrading manner by a populist right-wing government."
"Finger printing of children is plainly wrong."
"This echoes a time past and should have no place in modern-day Europe."
"I call on all governments to condemn the Italian Government and to act quickly to protect Roma children in Italy."
"in writing. - (RO) I believe the Italian Government's decision to fingerprint citizens of Roma origin and, in particular, children, seriously infringes the fundamental rights of the European citizens."
"Fingerprinting a child at an early age could mark him/her for life."
"The fingerprinting of children less than 14 years of age is done based on a form used in criminal investigations, which infringes the fundamental rights of the citizens."
"I did not agree with postponing the vote on the resolution because the situation is urgent and the fingerprinting of children must stop."
"One cannot start from the presumption of guilt of some children and the treatment of children of Roma origin, used today in Italy, is unacceptable."
"We request the Italian Government to stop the fingerprinting actions for minors of Roma origin in Italy."
"The Union should give an example as regards the respect for the fundamental rights and, for this reason, the Commission should investigate the situation in Italy and request the Italian Government to stop the fingerprinting of children of Roma origin immediately."
"This is why I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution to stop the fingerprinting of people of Roma origin and, especially, of the Roma children, in the larger framework of ""Creating a database with the fingerprints of people of Roma origin in Italy”."
"As coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I should like to give an explanation of vote on my own behalf and that of my group colleagues."
"All groups are united in the fight against racism and against every form of ethnic discrimination, and in promoting human rights."
"There is no question but that the PPE-DE Group shares the desire to see light shed on the events in Italy."
"In the resolution, we refer mainly to press reports and to documents and testimonies from a range of organisations and individuals."
"Most Members were unable to form an idea of the situation using their own resources."
"The Italian authorities have invited representatives of Parliament to travel to Italy to find out more, and have also offered to provide further information."
"The Commissioner responsible, Jacques Barrot, has promised to present an informative report by the end of July, and our group was keen to wait for this."
"Our aim was, and still is, to clarify the facts properly first of all."
"That is why we wanted to postpone voting on the resolution until the September part-session."
"Unfortunately, our motion was rejected, along with a series of amendments that had been tabled, which is why we voted as we did."
"The PPE-DE Group continues to hold the view that a thorough investigation would have been more worthwhile than this resolution, which was adopted in haste."
"Our opponents were aiming only to hit the headlines and did the people concerned a disservice in the process."
"in writing. - The decision on whether to attend the Olympic opening ceremony is one that I believe should be approached collectively."
"It is not one that is necessarily shared by all my Socialist colleagues."
"Nevertheless, on that basis I see no good reason to boycott the ceremony or the Games."
"Even the Dalai Lama supports that position."
"Equally the proposal to invite the Dalai Lama to the General Affairs Council is absurd to anyone who is not deliberately trying to undermine the EU-China relationship."
"As for discrimination against groups in China, such as trade unionists, there is rightly cause for concern, but criticism coming from those who want to stigmatise Italy's Roma community is a little rich."
"'Remove the plank from your own eye before the mote from your neighbour's.'"
"in writing. - (FR) I am delighted with the adoption of this joint resolution on the situation in China."
"It is important to continue putting pressure on China before the Olympic Games take place in less than a month."
"We cannot close our eyes to the serious human rights violations that exist, in contradiction with the pledges made by China itself."
"The European Parliament has a responsibility to remind China of the public promises it made."
"It is also important to mention minority rights, the rule of law and the still frequent use of the death penalty."
"Finally, I wish that some of the more stringent amendments against China had been adopted;"
"I am thinking particularly of petitions to release dissidents and human rights campaigners such as Hu Jia and his wife Zeng Jinyan, reference to the situation in Tibet, which is far from being resolved, and the disproportionate and non-transparent sentences given to demonstrators following the demonstrations this spring."
"in writing. - (PL) I abstained from the vote on the resolution on the situation in China after the earthquake and before the Olympic Games."
"I did so because Parliament rejected the amendments that raised questions concerning the observance of human rights in China."
"As a result the resolution has an overtone that differs from that intended by the initiators of this debate."
"Why did Parliament not pass this resolution before the recent EURO 2008 European Football Championships?"
"The reason is that there are no problems with human rights observance in Austria and Switzerland."
"Pointing out the problems in this area to China is not an anti-Chinese action, just an expectation that the minimum standards engendered by our civilisation will be maintained."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of amendment 19 because I strongly believe that inviting the Dalai Lama to a General Affairs Council meeting to present his assessment of the situation in Tibet, and explain to the 27 Foreign Affairs Ministers the middle-way approach and his concept of genuine autonomy that should be implemented for all Tibetans within China, is to be highly recommended."
"in writing. - (FI) In the resolution on the situation in China I voted for the amendment proposed by the Greens because the degree of incompatibility between the situation in China now, in the run-up to the Olympics, and the promises and public commitments they gave at the time to improve both human rights and the situation in Tibet is just as is stated in Amendment 15."
"I attach special importance to the demand set out in Amendment 16 that tangible results must be achieved by negotiation between the Dalai-Lama and Chinese representatives before the Olympics commence."
"The concern expressed in Amendments 11 and 12 about events in Lhasa also merit observation."
"The call made in Amendment 20 for the Union and its Member States to take measures with regard to China is most well-founded."
"I would not rule out a full boycott of the Olympics."
"President Pöttering's decision was sensible and humane."
"We cannot allow China, once and for all, in the name of the Olympic ideal and our values, to continue to use conjuring tricks to build an Olympic stage."
"in writing. - The way the Chinese dealt with the aftermath of the earthquake in Southwest China was an example of the progress the country has made in recent years."
"Nevertheless, there is still a need for further progress on human rights in the country."
"It is only through engaging both sides in constructive dialogue that tangible progress on this issue can be made."
"The Olympics was hailed as a prime opportunity to add weight to this dialogue and encourage improvements in human rights and freedoms."
"I would therefore stress that China must intensify its efforts to deliver on promises publicly made to the International Olympic Commission to improve human and democratic rights."
"I voted in favour of the resolution."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats abstained in the vote on the Brok report."
"We want to clarify our position on the future enlargement of the EU in this explanation of vote."
"We think that the Copenhagen criteria are the only requirements which can be imposed on candidate countries negotiating for EU membership."
"We are in favour of the continued enlargement of the EU and consider it to be one of the great issues for the future of the Union."
"We also consider that the negotiations with Turkey must continue and that the country must be assessed against the same objective criteria as other candidate countries."
"in writing. - (PL) Madam President, Mr Brok's report underscores the desire to improve our relationships with the East, and that is why I supported it."
"I think, though, that this report is not very expressive, and that it lacks the clear plan for the opening up of the European Union to the East that we were hoping for."
"We expected a better drafted document from the former Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"in writing. - (RO) Mr. President, appreciating the complexity and punctual usefulness of the Commission's 2007 enlargement strategy paper, we consider that, in the new context determined by the Irish people's vote, at least the internal dimension of the enlargement strategy should become the subject of more applied debates again."
"The Union's capacity to accomplish the objectives of its policies and achieve a functional regional cooperation, especially in the countries of South-Eastern Europe, depends on the manner in which the intra-Community relations shall settle."
"I would like to emphasize the fact that any negotiation formula introducing differentiated treatments for another Member State, no matter the reasons invoked, will initiate a ""chain of weaknesses” and I do not believe such an approach could bring benefits in the long term."
"The success of our future actions depends on the manner in which we will know to explain to the public opinion the direct impact and long-term advantages of enlargement."
"I could even say that we should look at the Irish vote from a constructive perspective: this vote is the proof of the fact that we have not always known to be open partners of the simple citizen, who is rather the subject of efficient political practices than the defender of ideas and visionary concepts."
"I voted in favour of the Brok report on the strategy for future enlargements of the EU in order to reaffirm my belief that no further enlargement will be possible without a new treaty allowing the Union to work with 27 Member States or more, accompanied by an adequate financial framework."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I understand from Mr Brok's report on enlargement that any new accession can succeed only if, and I quote, 'there is clear and long-lasting public support'."
"This sentence seems completely hypocritical, coming just days after the scornful reaction of the Eurocracy to the clear 'no' of the Irish to the Lisbon Treaty, which simply echoes the French and Dutch 'no' of 2005. It also follows the replacement, in the French Constitution, of the compulsory referendum on EU accession by a pseudo-referendum based on 'popular initiative', which in actual fact depends on the goodwill of the French Assembly and Senate."
"Admittedly, Mr Brok, in the knowledge that the vast majority of Europeans are opposed to Turkey joining the EU, does not even mention public consultation by referendum."
"To win the support he describes, he simply proposes good old propaganda for a public considered ignorant or even simple-minded."
"If Mr Brok and his European and national counterparts fear - or despise - the public so much, they should at least have the decency to stop seeking its approval."
"European democracy would certainly be all the stronger for it."
"in writing. - I welcome Mr Brok's report on the Commission's 2007 enlargement strategy paper."
"The EU must continue to be seen to uphold promises it has previously made on enlargement."
"Indeed, strict and fair conditionality must be applied to all candidates and potential candidates to whom we make these promises."
"I believe the report adequately deals with these issues and I voted in favour of Mr Brok's report."
"in writing. - (EL) The resolution is an outrageous distortion of the reality experienced by the peoples of the old and the new countries of the Union, presenting the deepening and enlargement of the Union as being to their advantage, when the exact opposite is true."
"The plans proposed for the new enlargement aim at greater exploitation and manipulation of the peoples of the accession countries, which are already in a dire situation, and a further escalation in the pillage of those countries by European capital."
"In particular, the process of enlargement to the Western Balkans is accompanied by a huge operation of subjugating and humiliating the peoples of those countries."
"A typical example is the insistence on full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the pseudo-court that was set up by the American and European imperialist bullies to try the victims of their wars and crimes in the area, and that was used to destroy the former President, Slobodan Milošević."
"The peoples are also particularly at risk from the fact that the enlargement process continues to rely on a change of borders and the creation of protectorates for the imperialists, such as the protectorate of Kosovo, which will lead to a new cycle of imperialist antagonisms and clashes, with the peoples of the area as the victims."
"We, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece, are therefore voting against the resolution, reaffirming our position against the imperialist EU and its enlargement."
"in writing. - British Conservatives have always been and remain strong supporters of EU enlargement, as it provides a larger single market and a looser and more flexible Europe of nation states."
"However, this report includes elements we are unable to support."
"We do not believe in Europe as a 'political integration project'."
"In addition, we disagree with the main aspects of Paragraph 19, which calls for 'an area based on common policies' in fields such as justice, security, migration and visa-free movement and education, which British Conservatives cannot support."
"Also, we are unhappy with Paragraph 6, which states: 'developing an area of freedom, security and justice, of fully maintaining and building on its acquis communautaire and of upholding fundamental rights and freedoms, as laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union'."
"Our concerns about these and other parts of the report in no sense diminish our support for further enlargement of the EU, should applicant states meet the Copenhagen criteria."
"For the reasons set out above, we have decided to abstain on this report."
"Mr President, it is a good thing that Europe is making its voice heard in this part of Africa which is once again at risk of becoming a theatre for virulent conflict, after the farce of a presidential campaign we witnessed a few days ago."
"The G8 has also taken a very clear stance, not through the introduction of sanctions, which would have damaged the civilian population in particular, but with 'financial measures' that relate especially to companies, banks and personalities of the regime in power since 1980."
"The situation that has come about is unacceptable, with elections taking place in inappropriate conditions and amid systematic violence."
"I also hope that our Community diplomacy will move to support the African Union's proposal asking for a government of national unity to overcome this difficult crisis."
"in writing. - (PL) Madam President, I supported today's resolution because I think that we must be tough on violence in Zimbabwe, increase sanctions and call for recognition of the Mugabe regime to be withdrawn."
"The campaign of violence aimed at the political opposition and financed by the state has ruled out the possibility of holding a free second round in the presidential elections."
"in writing. - (FR) Like people all over the world, Zimbabweans want peace, democracy and prosperity."
"Under Robert Mugabe, they have none of this."
"A former liberator of the country, he is now its torturer."
"Today, Parliament is sending out a clear message: it no longer wants Mugabe and his regime."
"The people of Zimbabwe have decided this."
"The EU must bring all of its weight to bear in order to help Zimbabweans and Africans find a solution to the crisis."
"The priority is to put an end to the violence."
"Only a dialogue open to all members of Zimbabwean society will allow a transitional regime to be established, with a clear mandate for the organisation of free and transparent elections monitored by the international community."
"However, Robert Mugabe will not come to the negotiating table unless forced to do so."
"This is why we must strengthen our arsenal of sanctions against the regime."
"Finally, we need to plan now for the reconstruction of a future Zimbabwe: I welcome the Commission's proposal to release EUR 250 million in emergency funding as soon as Zimbabwe has a legitimate and credible government."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a European Parliament resolution on the situation in Zimbabwe, condemning the Mugabe regime."
"The government's campaign of violence against the opposition, the successive violations of human rights and disregard for democratic principles are unacceptable."
"The civilised world must condemn, without hesitation, what is going on in Zimbabwe."
"The political persecution, gratuitous violence, hunger, suffering and the deaths of many citizens are Mugabe's recent 'work', which need to go down in the annals of history."
"The people of Zimbabwe deserve a better lot."
"I believe that the action of the international community is crucial to resolving the current humanitarian crisis."
"The European Union must set the example."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the resolution on Zimbabwe."
"What Robert Mugabe is doing is unacceptable."
"I do not call him President because what recently went on in Zimbabwe cannot be called an election."
"I agree with one of the Namibian politicians who said that, besides the traditional diseases that Africa has to grapple with - like malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS - the most dangerous disease today, the one that needs to be tackled with the greatest urgency, is Mugabeism."
"Mugabe has become an enemy of his own people."
"It is very frustrating when time turns a man who fought for freedom and independence into a harmful despot."
"I hope Africans will open their eyes and understand that people like Mugabe are bad for Africa as a whole."
"in writing. - (FI) Madam President, I voted for the resolution on the situation in Zimbabwe because on 27 July President Mugabe's reign of terror once again openly made a mockery of the views of the international community, justice and democracy."
"There can be no dispute that the presidential elections in Zimbabwe were illegitimate, and the violence, murders, arrests and harassment of the opposition within the country are a particularly savage aspect of the absence of justice."
"As the resolution states, Zimbabwe very much needs a mediation process which includes various parties from the international community and Africa."
"The parties to the dialogue must achieve sustainable outcomes for Zimbabwe and this will be possible only if the whole international community and its extensive democratic powers take part."
"The people of Zimbabwe have a deep-seated longing for democracy."
"The situation in Zimbabwe is a matter for the whole of the international community and the community of African states and it is absolutely imperative that we recognise Mugabe's tyranny."
"China and Libya do not unfortunately share the view of the international community on this matter."
"The EU must support and encourage those African states which are seeking to boycott Zimbabwe in relations with Africa."
"By contrast, South Africa's political and economic support for Mugabe's rule and the expulsion of Zimbabwean refugees from South Africa are contrary to our shared values."
"I also wished to lend my support to the idea set out in the resolution that this dispute may and should have negative consequences for relations between the EU and South Africa."
"in writing. - I voted for the resolution today and hope that Council will follow it up with strong concerted action."
"I also hope that the changing attitudes that we are seeing amongst African leaders will also mean that we do not have to suffer the humiliating sight of Mr. Mugabe attending international meetings on EU territory."
"Mugabe's current power has been gained through the blood and suffering of his people."
"Our Government's should not be compounding that by forcibly returning people to Zimbabwe."
"Not only can they find themselves in physical danger there but they can also add to the instability of the situation and pressure on diminishing resources."
"Giving these people a legal migration status and allowing them to work would be the one guaranteed positive measure our Governments can offer: it would also mean that, when return is possible, people are going back with active skills and potential financial resources which will help grass-roots development."
"Indeed, Governments should be adopting such a policy towards those who cannot return to other countries which are in conflict."
"The people of Zimbabwe need our support in every way possible."
"in writing. - The situation in Zimbabwe is cause for concern."
"I join my colleagues in condemning the Zanu-PF party's behaviour throughout the elections and would also stress that the elections of 27 June cannot be regarded as legitimate."
"Fresh elections should be organised that respect democratic norms."
"The suggestion of reaching an agreement on a transitional administration in the country is worth investigating as a way of getting out of the current democratic impasse Zimbabwe currently finds itself in."
"I voted in favour of the resolution."
"in writing. - I deplore the situation in Zimbabwe and call on all MEPs, the Commission, Council and all national governments to condemn Mugabe and seek a way through this crisis."
"I welcome the statement by the G8 where they refuse to accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the Zimbabwean people."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my German colleague Mr von Wogau on space and security."
"The time has come for a common approach to defend European interests in space."
"It is becoming increasingly obvious each day that we need space assets in order that the political and diplomatic activities of the European Union may be based on independent, reliable and complete information in support of its policies for conflict prevention, crisis management operations and global security (especially the monitoring of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of transportation), verification of respect for international treaties, monitoring of the transnational smuggling of light weapons and small arms, the protection of critical infrastructure and of the EU's borders, and civil protection in the event of natural and man-made disasters and crises."
"Galileo is, in this regard, a cornerstone of the EU's role in space."
"This approach should go hand in hand with European defence and with support for the European defence industry, particularly in the aerospace sector."
"in writing. - The European Union must develop its own space capabilities."
"We are against the weaponisation of space but do recognise that, while the US refuses to cooperate closely with the Union for the joint use of satellite facilities during times of peace and war, we have no alternative but to try to deploy our own system in Europe."
"The development of Europe's common foreign and security policy and Europe's security and defence capabilities requires a space dimension."
"Mr von Wogau - the Chairman of our Subcommittee on Security and Defence - has done Parliament and Europe a service with this report, which we should follow up subsequently."
"It would be difficult to be any clearer."
"In its own-initiative report on 'Space and security', the majority of the EP rejected our proposals that:"
"emphasised that the use of space must serve exclusively non-military purposes, rejecting any direct or indirect military use;"
"and underlined that Galileo is an exclusively non-military project;"
"At the same time, it approved, among other dangerous measures:"
"the necessity of Galileo for autonomous ESDP operations and for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP);"
"the development of a common concept for geospatial intelligence policy, creating conditions for involvement of the EUSC in the planning for each ESDP operation requiring space-based observation and space-based intelligence;"
"that the EU explore the possibility of a financial contribution to the EUSC from the EU budget in order to provide sufficient funds to meet the increasing needs of ESDP operations;"
"the possibility of funding future European satellite telecommunications systems supporting ESDP operation from the EU budget."
"In other words, the militarisation of the Galileo project and the increasing use of the Community budget for military ends."
"Hence our vote against."
"in writing. - (SV) I voted against the report because I believe that space should only be used for peaceful purposes."
"The report went much too far."
"in writing. - I generally welcome Mr Von Wogau's report on space security."
"I support the rapporteur's stipulation that space should not become weaponised."
"The development of voluntary instruments which could enhance space security is a positive step in ensuring a responsible space policy."
"The Community budgets from which the ESDP is funded are currently intergovernmental; consequently I feel it would be inappropriate to prejudge such spending in the report."
"These views are reflected in my vote."
"in writing. - (EL) The use of space is essential to the effectiveness of the EU's imperialist interventions."
"This is the conclusion of the report adopted by the European Parliament on space and the security of the EU."
"The report underlines the necessity of using space for 'EU Member States' deployments under UN, NATO and other similar organisations."
"It calls for rapid development of the EGNOS and Galileo programmes, full development of the EU Satellite Centre, and the coordination, through the European Space Agency, of the satellite communication systems of the EU Member States, for the purposes of espionage and surveillance, in order to provide 'independent, reliable and complete information in support of its policies for conflict prevention policies, crisis management operations ...'"
"The EU budget is already allocating an astronomical EUR 5.25 billion for these purposes, for the period 2007-2013 alone."
"This fact, as well as the decision to speed up the Galileo programme, shows that the EU intends to integrate the use of space into the strategic resources and capabilities for promoting the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the European Security and Defence Policy - in other words, the mechanism for the EU's imperialist interventions around the world."
"In the light of all this, the report's appeal for 'non-militarisation' of space - typical proof of the outrageous duplicity of imperialist political mouthpieces - is the utmost hypocrisy."
"in writing. - The European Parliamentary Labour Party welcomes this Parliamentary report, and in particular we support the development of an EU Code of Conduct for activities in space, along with the development of voluntary instruments which could enhance space security."
"We are, however, concerned not to prejudge decisions about the future EU budget; ESDP activities are funded from the community budgets, which are currently inter-governmental."
"For this reason we voted against two amendments which suggested this in relation to space-related ESDP activities."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Presentation of the programme of the French Presidency (debate)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to address your Assembly at such a critical moment for Europe."
"I am well aware that we all bear a heavy responsibility."
"Of course, as President-in-Office of the Council, I have a great responsibility, but the responsibility of all pro-Europeans is the same."
"How do we get Europe out of the crisis in which it finds itself?"
"How do we prevent immobility?"
"How do we overcome our disagreements and use them to serve the same European ideal?"
"Here we stand at the heart of European democracy."
"Each one of you, having the honour of sitting in this Parliament, has had to win the support of your compatriots."
"There are men and women of the left, of the centre, of the right; there are elected representatives from 27 countries."
"However, today we must turn our differences into a strength for an ailing European Union."
"We must make these differences an opportunity to reassure European citizens, who are worried."
"We must keep democracy alive, which means that we must engage in debate and at the same time create an image of a Europe that rejects immobility."
"Everyone must be on board in the European family, with its 27 Member States; nobody must be left behind."
"We are just a few months away from an important date for the European Parliament."
"It is reasonable for everyone to be conscious of this."
"At the same time, we must give the impression this morning of a Europe that is working for everyone."
"I have seen easier situations than the one in which Europe now finds itself."
"If I may speak freely, conscious that, as President-in-Office of the Council, I must speak on everyone's behalf, I have to take account of everyone's sensibilities and at the same time come up with the right answers."
"First observation: we have an institutional problem."
"Heads of State or Government have tried to find a compromise with the Lisbon Treaty."
"No one said that the Lisbon Treaty was going to solve all of our problems, but it was and remains the expression of a compromise acceptable to everyone."
"I myself, as President of the French Republic, had to face up to my responsibilities."
"France voted 'no' in 2005 and this caused a problem for France."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the issues that we have to address are very difficult and complex; let us try to give everyone the idea that we are working on this with no ulterior motives and no preconceptions."
"That is what is expected of us."
"(Applause)"
"Before the elections, I offered the French people parliamentary ratification of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Before the elections, I said that I would not hold a referendum in France."
"I said this to the people of France in a democratic spirit; it was a choice I made three days before I was elected, which could have been highly significant."
"I do not regret that choice."
"I truly believe that institutional issues, the way in which we do things in Europe, are something for members of parliament rather than for referendums."
"It is a political choice that I am making (applause) and it is a political choice that I made in my own country before the elections."
"Therefore, it is perfectly democratic."
"We now have the problem of the Irish 'no' vote."
"It is certainly not for a Frenchman to pass judgment on this outcome considering the earlier Dutch and French 'no' votes."
"Therefore, on 21 July, for the first time as President-in-Office of the Council, I will go to Ireland to listen, engage in dialogue and try to find solutions."
"The French Presidency will propose a method and, I hope, a solution in agreement with the Irish Government, either in October or December."
"The problem is this: we must avoid both rushing our Irish friends and yet at the same time establish under what conditions and with what treaty we are going to organise the 2009 European elections."
"We therefore have a bit of time, but not that much."
"We owe it to our fellow citizens to know on what basis we are going to organise the European elections."
"The basis will be either the Lisbon Treaty or the Nice Treaty."
"There will not be a new institutional conference."
"There will not be a new treaty."
"It is either Lisbon or Nice."
"May I add, just to be perfectly clear - it is my opinion, but that does not make it the truth - that I am one of those who have always supported European enlargement."
"The 2004 enlargement was a success."
"The family is back together; we should not regret that."
"However, I am one of those who have always wished that Europe had been wise enough to create new institutions before enlargement."
"That was a mistake and we are paying for it today."
"It would have been braver to establish institutions before enlargement."
"I want to be perfectly clear on this. Of course I do not regret enlargement."
"The family must stay together."
"However, I am adamant, President Pöttering, that we must not make the same mistakes again."
"If we stick with Nice, it is the Europe of 27."
"If we want enlargement - and personally I do - we need new institutions before enlarging."
"Who would have thought that Europe, with its 27 Member States, would be incapable of establishing its own institutions and that it would have no other priority than to keep on enlarging?"
"Things have to be clear: if we want enlargement - and we do want enlargement - then we need new institutions."
"(Applause)"
"Let me add - and I am saying this to Mr Schulz - that I am in favour of bringing in the Balkans, that our Croatian friends, like our Serbian friends, are unquestionably European."
"However, the most pro-enlargement countries cannot say, 'we do not want Lisbon', yet at the same time, 'we want enlargement'."
"It is Lisbon and enlargement."
"It is not blackmail, because in Europe, we do not do blackmail."
"It is a matter of consistency, honesty and logic."
"When it comes to Croatia, therefore, we must continue the negotiations, but everyone must shoulder their responsibilities."
"If Europe is to grow, and it must, then it must do so with new institutions."
"Another point: here and there in European debates I come across people saying, 'well look, it does not matter if we have a multi-speed Europe.'"
"Perhaps one day we will unfortunately have to have a multi-speed Europe, but that can only be a last resort. Europe has paid dearly for being divided by a wall of shame."
"Europe has paid dearly for the dictatorship imposed on 80 million Europeans."
"Let us think hard before we leave anyone behind."
"When we were negotiating the Lisbon Treaty in Brussels, France fought to ensure that Poland could take its place in the Lisbon Treaty."
"How can we tell 38 million Poles that it is much easier to shake off the yoke of the dictatorship that they were under, and from which they freed themselves, thanks to high-calibre people such as Lech Walesa and Jean-Paul II, than to remain in a free Europe?"
"There are 27 members in this family."
"Nobody should be left behind."
"We must bring everybody in the European family on board; that, at least, is what the French Presidency will work towards."
"(Applause)"
"Regarding other issues, and I believe that we can reach a consensus on them, nothing would be worse than for Europe to give the impression of being immobile because it is going through yet another an institutional drama."
"That would be an awful trap for us to fall into."
"We reject institutions that condemn us to immobility, but at the same time, Europeans are impatient because they think we are too immobile."
"Notwithstanding the institutional problem, perhaps even because of the institutional problem, Europe has a duty to act, and to act now."
"This is the message that the French Presidency would like us all to send to Europeans."
"We are in the process of resolving the institutional problems, but we are not condemned to inaction."
"What, then, are our priorities?"
"The first is to show Europeans that Europe can protect them."
"Now I would like to say something about this word 'protection'."
"Since ancient times, whenever people have elected a government, it was so that this government would protect them."
"Mr President, Europe must offer protection without protectionism."
"Protectionism gets us nowhere."
"Seeing European citizens today think that Europe, which was designed to protect them, is a source of concern rather than protection, is a real step backwards."
"Therefore, it is up to us to show how Europe is going to protect them on concrete issues."
"The first is the energy and climate package."
"If there is one area in which our nations can do nothing if they act alone, it is in maintaining the ecological balance of our planet."
"When it comes to pollution, CO2 and the ozone layer, the borders between our countries are irrelevant."
"The stakes are high: since the meeting of IPCC experts, we have realised that we are the last generation that can prevent disaster."
"The last generation!"
"If we do not do anything now, future generations may be able to limit the damage, but they will not be able to stop it."
"Every country in the world says: 'I am willing to do something provided that the others start first.'"
"With this type of reasoning, our grandchildren's grandchildren will never see any decisions made."
"If we Europeans wait for others to do something before we act, we could be waiting a long time."
"We created Europe to take our model of civilization to the world and to defend our values."
"Among those values is the certainty that the world is doomed if we do not take a decision right away."
"Europe must set an example."
"Europe must lead by example."
"We have a goal: the 2009 conference."
"This conference must manage and organise the post-Kyoto phase."
"Europe must come to it united, having decided to adopt the energy and climate package."
"If we do not, we will not have any leverage to get the Chinese, Indians, emerging countries and Americans to make the efforts that we have agreed on."
"Therefore, it is essential that, under the French Presidency, we adopt the energy and climate package submitted by the Commission."
"(Applause)"
"It is a demanding package, it is a difficult package, but I would like to appeal to everyone's sense of responsibility."
"If every country starts wanting to renegotiate its own particular bugbear, the things it has a problem with, then, ladies and gentlemen, we will never reach an agreement."
"This is why the French Presidency is asking the European Parliament to rally behind it so that we can get the energy and climate package adopted within the next six months."
"That is a priority."
"It is not a right-wing or a left-wing priority, it is simply common sense."
"If we go into negotiations Member State by Member State, we have no chance of succeeding."
"Now, of course, there are points that need to be clarified or adapted."
"I am thinking in particular of a very difficult matter: namely the problems for our firms, on which we are rightly going to impose rules to maintain the balance of the planet."
"Should we, in Europe, impose essential rules on our firms and, at the same time, continue to import products from countries that do not abide by any of the rules that we impose on our businesses?"
"That is not a matter of protectionism; it is a matter of fairness, justice and refusing to be naive."
"There is the problem of deciding on a border mechanism."
"Should there be free quotas or adjustment mechanisms?"
"I do not know, but, in any case, we have to discuss it."
"(Applause)"
"Second question: I understand that, for some countries - I am thinking particularly of those that joined us in 2004, which largely rely on fossil fuels for their energy - the efforts demanded of them are considerable."
"These countries are telling us, 'we have had growth for 10 years; please do not take that away from us.'"
"No doubt there is a way to get everyone on board and, with the President of the Commission, we have to work on it so that everyone realises that they will not be doomed to recession, misery, poverty and unemployment."
"This energy and climate package is an absolute priority for us."
"The world cannot wait; Europe has to lead the way."
"Second point: of the 27 countries, 24 are now in the Schengen Area; in other words, 24 countries out of 27."
"23, you say?"
"OK, 23 then, but that is still not bad."
"This does not include countries that are not members of the European Union but - and this is why we often have debates - are part of the Schengen Area."
"So what does this mean?"
"It means that we have decided on complete freedom of movement between the Schengen Area countries."
"I would like to say to the leaders of the political groups and to members of parliament that we in France, with Bernard Kouchner and Jean-Pierre Jouyet, have taken a decision that was not easy to take."
"Since 1 July, there have no longer been any barriers preventing access to the French labour market, because I have announced that I will abolish all of the restrictions negotiated by my predecessors."
"Any worker from any EU country can come and work in France."
"(Applause)"
"It was not that simple; it was not that easy."
"In any case, and French MEPs will correct me if I am wrong, I was told that it would be a disaster if I announced this decision."
"As usual, we made the decision, and no disaster materialised."
"I was not happy about the dispute over the infamous 'Polish plumber', which did not give my country or indeed Europe a very good name."
"That is not why we all built the European Union."
"(Applause)"
"Nevertheless, now that we no longer have any borders between us, is it fair, is it reasonable for each of us to go on deciding our own immigration policy, taking no notice of the others' constraints?"
"The European Pact on Immigration and Asylum is an essential document for the French Presidency, for two reasons."
"The first of these - and may I turn to the left of the Chamber first - is that if all of us, if all European countries have a European immigration policy, we remove immigration from national debates where extremists use poverty and fear to serve values that are not ours."
"The only way to have a responsible debate on immigration is to make it a European policy."
"No more partisan ulterior motives compelling countries with different sensitivities to work together."
"What Brice Hortefeux suggested, which was approved by all ministers and should be discussed by the Permanent Representatives Committee and by the European Council, seems to me a priority."
"It will show that Europe does not want to be a fortress, that Europe is not refusing to take people in, that Europe needs migrant workers, but that Europe cannot take in everyone who would like to come to Europe."
"Let me add that, when it comes to political asylum, it is not logical for one individual to be able to submit 27 applications to 27 democratic countries and not get the same answers every time to the same problem."
"Let me add that, for development with Africa, we will be stronger if we work together; this is the second priority of the French Presidency."
"Third priority: we want to further a concept often talked about in Europe, but which is making slow progress, and that is European defence."
"I am well aware that there is a lot of disagreement surrounding this issue, but let me tell you what I believe."
"How do you think Europe can become a political power and make itself heard if it cannot defend itself and deploy resources in support of its policy?"
"Take the example of Kosovo, which to my mind is a European Union success story."
"This is a European problem, which has to be settled by Europeans."
"How can Europeans continue to do that if they do not acquire the military and human resources to enforce the decisions that we have taken together?"
"How do you think that Europe can become the most prosperous economic area in the world if it is unable to defend itself?"
"Yes, we have NATO."
"It would not occur to anyone, least of all me, to dispute the usefulness of NATO."
"It is not a matter of choosing between a European defence policy or NATO, but of having NATO - the alliance with the Americans - and an autonomous European security policy."
"It is both of these together, not one instead of the other."
"Let me add that we cannot go on having Europe ensuring its security based on the contribution of just four or five countries, with the others relying on the efforts of these four or five countries."
"The Member States cannot keep on building their own aircraft separately, having armaments industries that compete with each other to the point of ruin and ultimately are weakened, simply because they are not strong enough to have a European defence policy."
"Fourth priority: the extremely difficult issue of the common agricultural policy."
"I am coming now to my conclusion, which is linked with this."
"It is precisely because it is difficult that we need to talk about it."
"I am perfectly aware that among us we have agricultural States that fiercely defend the work of their farmers and, at the same time, States that think that this policy costs too much."
"Ladies and gentlemen, may I appeal to your common sense."
"In 2050 the world will have 9 billion inhabitants."
"Already, there 800 million people who are dying of starvation."
"A child starves to death every 30 seconds."
"Is it reasonable to ask Europe to reduce its agricultural production at a time when the world has such great need of foodstuffs?"
"I do not think that this is reasonable."
"It is not about French agriculture; it is about common sense."
"(Applause)"
"Let me add a second point: regardless of whether your country is an agricultural one, food security concerns everyone."
"Is it reasonable to impose, rightly, traceability and safety rules on our breeders and farmers and go on importing meat into Europe which comes from other countries that do not abide by any of the rules that we are imposing on our farmers?"
"(Applause)"
"Third point: agricultural prices have never been so high."
"It is precisely the right time to talk about prices, to talk about subsidies and to talk about Community preference."
"I also think that between the common agricultural policy's health check and financial arbitration, we might be able to agree on certain concepts such as food sufficiency and food security for Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is a host of other topics: the social dimension, for example, is a huge issue."
"May I make one point."
"Sometimes I see a certain contradiction: a single-minded view sometimes exists that Europe should not meddle with everything and that Europe should intervene only in areas that concern it."
"However, the same people who accuse Europe of poking its nose into everything are the first to speak up when we do not talk about the social dimension."
"Until now, the Member States have always wanted social policy to be first and foremost a national competence, because pensions and healthcare are primarily national issues."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there are a number of social directives that President Barroso did well to put on the agenda."
"I am thinking of those on works councils, temporary work and a number of basic rules which have to be imposed on everyone in Europe."
"The French Presidency will make this a priority."
"Other subjects too should be put on the French Presidency's agenda, even though they are not within Europe's remit."
"Let me take an example of something which affects us all: Alzheimer's disease."
"(Off-mike comment from Mr Cohn-Bendit: 'not yet')."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, it would never have occurred to me that someone so young as you should already be affected by a disease which, although it does not affect you, affects millions of Europeans."
"These millions of Europeans are just as important to me as your health."
"(Applause)"
"Of course, subsidiarity means that this is not a European competence."
"Nevertheless, I would like the French Presidency to organise a meeting of all specialists from all European countries so that we can share best practice, so that our researchers can pool their skills to find out more about this disease and so that together we can find a solution."
"Just imagine what Europeans would say about Europe then: it is a way of curing these awful diseases."
"What I said about Alzheimer's could apply to cancer, which breaks families apart."
"There is no reason for everyone to work on their own on finding solutions to cancer when together we will have more resources and be stronger."
"(Applause)"
"Finally, with regard to culture and sport, let me say that it is a big mistake not to talk about the issues that affect the day-to-day lives of Europeans."
"There is a European cultural exception."
"We must make culture a part of everyday debate in Europe."
"The world does not have to bow down to one language and one culture."
"We must clearly address the question of VAT on videos and CDs, like that of VAT on books, which you have settled."
"On sport, which transcends political divides, let me just say that I would like there to be a sporting exception in Europe, just as there is a cultural exception."
"I am in favour of the freedom of movement of individuals and goods, but I do not accept the idea that we should make our football clubs pay, undermining the investment that many clubs make in teenage boys, who need to stay with the club for training purposes."
"A sporting exception, which would mean that sport is not beholden to the market economy, should have the support of all MEPs."
"(Applause)"
"To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I would like to finish - apologies for having been too long, no doubt - with a final observation."
"I know where I am going to make this observation: where the heart of European democracy beats."
"Europe has suffered a great deal."
"It has suffered first of all from the cowardice of some of us, who were very happy to let Europe pay for responsibilities which were really those of political leaders, unwilling to make in public the choices that they refused to defend in Brussels."
"(Applause)"
"That is cowardice."
"I say this to the President of the European Parliament and to the President of the Commission: the Presidency will work hand in hand with you."
"If any Member State does not agree, let it speak up."
"As I said to the Polish President, he himself negotiated the Lisbon Treaty, he gave his word, and one's word has to be honoured."
"It is not a question of politics, but a question of morals."
"(Applause)"
"However, Europe has suffered from something else too. Europe has suffered from a lack of debate."
"I would like to end with this because it is very important to me."
"Our institutions are independent, but independence does not mean indifference."
"If we, the political leaders, do not have the courage to debate, who will?"
"To debate what?"
"What is the right economic strategy?"
"What is the right monetary strategy?"
"What is the right exchange rate strategy?"
"What is the right interest rate strategy?"
"Of course everyone is entitled to their own beliefs, and I say this to our German friends in particular."
"However, no one has the right to prevent a debate, a constructive debate."
"Of course everyone wants an agreement, such as the trade agreement which is in the process of being negotiated."
"However, no one must be afraid of saying that Europe must not be naive."
"We have to discuss the advantages of free trade, but we must also tell emerging countries that there are no grounds for them to demand the same rights without taking on the same obligations."
"We must not be afraid to hold a European debate."
"We must engage in a dignified European debate, but we must not be afraid to defend our beliefs."
"We are not questioning the ECB's independence when we ask whether it is reasonable to raise interest rates to 4.25% when US interest rates are at 2%. We are having a debate."
"A peaceful debate, where no one has a monopoly on the truth."
"I certainly do not, nor do the experts, who have to demonstrate the effectiveness of their decisions."
"It is in this spirit, ladies and gentlemen, that I intend, together with French ministers, to shoulder this responsibility."
"I know that it is difficult."
"I know that, when you are President-in-Office of the Council, you are not defending the interests of your country, but the interests of the Union."
"I know, Mr President, Presidents, that we have to work as a team in the interests of the Europe of 27, and I hope that in six months' time everyone will be able to say: 'Europe has made progress thanks to your participation and support.'"
"(Loud applause)"
"Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, thank you for your speech."
"We wish you continued courage, determination and especially success throughout your Presidency - as, when you are successful, the European Union is successful and, with it, the European Parliament."
"You can be assured that the European Parliament is at your side when you make your resolute contribution to taking the European Union forward into a good future."
"The European Parliament will support you in this task."
"I should also like to welcome the ministers with you today: Bernard Kouchner, Brice Hortefeux, a former fellow Member, and especially your Minister of State for European Affairs, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, who is almost always here in Parliament."
"I welcome you all most warmly to the European Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to be here with you today in the European Parliament for the presentation of the six-month French Presidency of the Council of the European Union."
"I think that this will be a presidency full of drive and determination and rich in concrete results that we will all work towards."
"You wanted France to come back to Europe, President-in-Office, and this is unquestionably excellent news for us all."
"European citizens and the European Parliament assembled here today expect a great many things from the French Presidency."
"As I said during our meeting in Paris on 1 July, the Commission will stand by the French Presidency, offering its full support to ensure the success of the European Union during these six months."
"There will be no shortage of challenges."
"Globalisation is here to stay and international competition is becoming increasingly tough."
"The world faces new challenges such as the scarcity of fossil fuels and climate change."
"We must act now to find common solutions to these challenges."
"All of these factors mean that Europe needs to reform its economies to become more competitive, modernise its social models and invest in education, research and innovation."
"Europe has many aces up its sleeve, particularly as one of the world's leading trading powers."
"However, it must have the courage to adapt."
"If we want to offer protection, we must adapt."
"That is the key."
"There is no point in denying that Europe is going through a difficult period: the Irish 'no' vote and the global economic climate, soaring oil and commodity prices, the sharp rise in food prices and inflationary pressures, which are the greatest enemy of purchasing power."
"Inflation is also the greatest enemy of social justice as, when there is very strong inflation, those who suffer most are those on low wages or living on a pension."
"All of these factors are casting a shadow over our economies and forcing our politicians, at both European and national level, to make difficult choices."
"We must confront these realities head on and apply ourselves to them with realism and determination."
"We have just come back from the G8 summit in Japan, where I could clearly see that the influence enjoyed by the European Union, as well as the expectations and respect that it engenders around the world, are in marked contrast with the gloom that is often expressed within the EU."
"I can tell you now that, now more than ever, the European Union is seen outside Europe as a positive and decisive player, a player with enormous influence on the world stage."
"Let us take two concrete subjects that were at the centre of the G8 summit: climate change and development - two issues on which Europe has taken the initiative at global level."
"The United States has now joined us in the fight against climate change by largely subscribing to our views."
"Last year in Heiligendamm, I remember that we had great difficulty - President Sarkozy was there - in convincing the Americans and the Russians to accept the principle of mandatory targets for 2050."
"Now we have achieved this."
"It was possible thanks to our role as European leader;"
"I am proud of this as President of a European institution."
"It is a success that we yet again owe to European unity."
"The second example is development, and specifically soaring food prices, which threaten all of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)."
"We were also able to act as a catalyst in this area thanks to the conclusions of last month's European Council, which, and I quote, welcomed 'the Commission's intention to come forward with a proposal for a new fund to support agriculture in developing countries.'"
"The European Commission will adopt this proposal next week."
"I am counting on the full support of both arms of the budgetary authority so that Europe can swiftly provide the necessary aid to farmers, particularly those in Africa, in close cooperation with the competent multilateral organisations."
"This support is essential to guarantee 'the green revolution' that Africa needs for its stability and prosperity, which, as you all know, is also in Europe's direct interests."
"As the European Council requested, our proposal will remain within the limits of the current financial perspective."
"Our approach consists of allocating the savings that the rise in international prices allows Europe to generate as part of its agricultural support policy to those who are hit hardest by this increase."
"There are emergency and disaster situations all around the world."
"If you could have heard what the President of the World Bank said, if you could have heard some of the leaders of African countries and other countries represented in enlarged meetings talk about the hunger and starvation that now represent a real threat to so many people in the world, you would understand to what extent European aid is necessary and indispensable."
"(Applause)"
"This is why I believe that, yet again, we can set a good example of solidarity between European and African farmers, illustrating the fact that the common agricultural policy (CAP) and development policy can and must work in tandem, because, as President Sarkozy has just said, food security is a global issue and we need to tackle it together."
"Not alone, but together."
"Therefore, it is true that there are concerns, but it is also true that, more than ever before, the European Union has a central role in resolving them."
"Rather than wallow in what I sometimes call 'crisisophilia' - there is even talk of the phenomenon of declinism in Europe - let us emphasise the value of the concrete and positive action of the EU."
"In any case, this is the best way of resolving the international issues raised by Ireland's non-ratification of the Lisbon Treaty."
"We must address this because the Lisbon Treaty could make us work more effectively, more democratically, although we must not use it as an excuse for failing to respond immediately to the needs of our citizens."
"European citizens are looking to us for answers."
"The best response we can give them is to talk to them frankly and show that we have political courage."
"The French Presidency has both qualities in abundance."
"In a Europe on trial, we must provide evidence that Europe works."
"We must focus on policies that bring Europe closer to its citizens and change their daily lives."
"More than ever before, we are plotting a course for a Europe based on results."
"Personally, I am confident."
"The priorities of your Presidency will allow Europe to meet the major challenges that it faces, while preparing for the issues of the future."
"I welcome the priority given by the French Presidency to the introduction of an integrated energy and climate change policy."
"As you said, President-in-Office, this is the top priority of your Presidency, and we know how determined you are to finalise this strategic agreement by the end of the year, which would put the EU in a good position to embark on the Copenhagen negotiations in a year's time."
"The Commission will lend its full support so that we can reach an ambitious and balanced agreement with the European Parliament and the Member States."
"I have made this a priority for my institution, and I would like to thank the President-in-Office once again for his tireless support for the energy and climate package unveiled by the European Commission."
"We must also move towards a policy of controlled immigration in Europe."
"We must first address immigration, which an ageing Europe needs, in certain key economic sectors, and which must be accompanied by proper integration so that we can be proud in our humanist Europe of the integration that we offer to those who genuinely want to come here to work."
"The adoption of the 'blue card' under the French Presidency would be an important step in this direction."
"However, we also need to tackle illegal immigration and the exploitation that often arises from this, particularly by furthering the proposal to penalise those who employ illegal workers."
"It is here that we must effectively make the most effort; we must not threaten the poor workers who only want to work in Europe, but penalise those who want to exploit them."
"This practice is a disgrace to Europe."
"Let there be no mistake: we must be realistic in addressing the issue of immigration."
"I am firmly convinced, ladies and gentlemen, that our inability to address this issue seriously and responsibly is one of the greatest threats to Europe."
"We will not solve the immigration issue by being permissive on all fronts."
"This would be the best excuse for extremist forces, for xenophobic forces."
"We need to be tough on illegal immigration, and at the same time show that we are generous and united in the integration of migrant communities who want to contribute to Europe's growth and development."
"I believe that we need to be clear on this; we need to be tough on crime while continuing to show respect for human rights, which are the trademark of European civilisation and our plans for European integration."
"Naturally these are sensitive issues, which are easy prey for polemic and misunderstanding."
"This is why the Commission wanted to put forward a balanced proposal and why it has outlined 10 key principles so that we can go forward together."
"I was delighted to see the French Presidency and the French justice and interior ministers endorse this integrated approach during their informal meeting in Cannes this week."
"I am keen to point out, ladies and gentlemen, that in Europe, in the Schengen Area, where freedom of movement is a reality, it is absurd to continue with 27 different immigration policies."
"What we need is a European immigration policy."
"Also in the pipeline is our Social Agenda."
"There can be no dynamic, competitive economic model without genuine social investment to prevent the risks of poverty, exclusion and marginalisation."
"France has made the new Social Agenda unveiled by the European Commission a few days ago one of its priorities."
"I welcome this."
"To prepare Europeans for the future, we must offer them opportunities, access to quality services, education, healthcare and continuing solidarity."
"Nobody in Europe must be left by the wayside."
"Europe is all about opportunity and solidarity."
"Ladies and gentlemen, many other projects will be launched over the coming six months."
"I cannot describe them all here, but if I can briefly outline two, I should like to commend the projects for European defence and the Union for the Mediterranean, which will be unveiled next Sunday in Paris."
"I see these as two opportunities for Europe to affirm its role in the world."
"Here too, it is up to us to translate this ambition into concrete action."
"I wish the French Presidency of the Council every success, guaranteeing the full support of the Commission throughout the next six months, which promise to be exciting."
"The first duty for politicians is to face up to challenges and redouble efforts to meet them successfully."
"We can do a great deal together."
"I would like to pay tribute here to the efforts made over the past few months by French Government at the highest level to work closely with the European institutions."
"The institutions, the Presidency and the Member States must all work hand in hand."
"This is the key to the joint success that we owe the citizens of Europe, and I would like to pay tribute to the commitment expressed here again today by the President-in-Office so that together, the Council, Parliament and the Commission can find concrete solutions to the concrete problems that our citizens have to face each day."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, France has decided that its Presidency will be synonymous with political commitment."
"We need political commitment to overcome the difficulties faced by European integration."
"The most entrenched of these is without doubt the Irish 'no' vote, discussed here this morning."
"We must engage our citizens in Europe."
"There are many reasons why they have doubts, including fears linked to globalisation, rising prices and changes in traditional family and social values."
"If we cannot convince everyone that major issues such as security, climate change, energy and migration can be negotiated effectively only at European level - and with regard to the world's major regions, Europe must also be strong enough to convince the United States, India, China, and Brazil - we cannot envisage a peaceful future."
"The French Presidency will also need political commitment to convince its partners that the Lisbon Treaty will help us decide more effectively and democratically on all of these common issues."
"Those members of my group who belong to the European People's Party would like all Member States who have not yet done so to ratify the Treaty during the French Presidency."
"After a period of reflection and with all due respect, we look forward, as we did with France and the Netherlands, to Ireland offering its 26 partners a solution to the impasse."
"We ask each Member State to refrain from any one-upmanship and to act responsibly."
"Our group would like to see an end to this institutional debate and we are confident that the French Presidency will work towards achieving this goal."
"Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, while we are trying to equip ourselves with a better decision-making tool, our problems are building up. This is consuming energy that could be better spent on job creation, defending our interests and promoting our social model and Europe in general."
"As I said, we will certainly need political commitment."
"We should also make sure that we have the commitment to address the priorities that the President-in-Office of the Council has just unveiled."
"We must act urgently to tackle the issues of climate change, energy, migration, food security and defence."
"On climate change and energy, the alternative is clear: either our Member States are convinced that they must progress and set an example ahead of the Copenhagen Summit, and if so, we must make clear decisions before December to ensure reciprocity from our international partners, or they have decided that, despite worsening climatic conditions and our energy dependence, there is no need to take urgent action."
"I hardly need tell you which way my political group leans."
"On migration, too, we want an end to this hypocrisy."
"While a number of countries around the world have already adopted an immigration policy with fairly satisfactory results, most of our countries have delayed these choices."
"It is time for a debate and a decision on the subject, which must be positive, humane and responsible."
"The draft European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, which will be debated in October, is a step in the right direction, and I congratulate the EU ministers on their response this week to the draft prepared by Brice Hortefeux."
"You have our support, Mr Hortefeux."
"Finally, I would like to mention two topics that are very close to my heart and are vital for the future and for our independence: food security and defence."
"I would like us to think of the most disadvantaged people, both around the world and in our own countries, for whom rising food prices are a real problem."
"I would like Europe and the French Presidency to make an effort to help them through these difficult times."
"In terms of defence, I would just like to ask one question: how can Europe be credible without defence worthy of the name?"
"We need defence to guarantee peace in Europe and to help the world's most disadvantaged people."
"Our group supports the commitment of the French Presidency to lead the way by making bold proposals to its partners in these two strategic areas."
"Ladies and gentlemen, European integration is an eminently political affair."
"I am in no doubt that, if we are brave enough to make clear political choices, our citizens will rediscover a liking for Europe."
"I have every confidence that the new Presidency will encourage us in this and we have everything to gain in winning the trust of our citizens ahead of the 2009 European elections."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are aspects of your views that we share, Mr Sarkozy, and I should first like to go into some of these in more detail."
"I am delighted that you have returned from Japan safe and sound."
"We have now heard again about the next series of commitments on climate change and it is time we delivered on these."
"You are right that the climate package is a priority: it is one that our group shares with you."
"You are right, too, when you say that individual states cannot achieve this on their own - not even the Germans and the French, by the way, by reaching agreements on their own in Straubing."
"There are 25 other countries that are part of this and, above all, it is the European Parliament that makes the final decision."
"We shall do it with you, cooperatively, but do not take any initiatives on the side - not even with Angela Merkel, however good an idea that may seem to be."
"Since you mention sport, I had a look at the French newspapers this morning, wondering what they would write today about Mr Sarkozy's visit to the European Parliament."
"Nothing!"
"They write a lot about the Tour de France, and it is a German who is wearing the yellow jersey there at the moment."
"(Heckling)"
"I listened closely to you, Mr President-in-Office, as you made your other points, about climate change and particularly about the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Indeed, if we want to deliver, we need instruments, and that puts us in a dilemma."
"The citizens want us to be more effective, more transparent, more democratic, and they want the national parliaments to be more democratic and have more influence."
"That is all correct but, every time we want to deliver, the instrument we need - a revised treaty - is snatched from our hands."
"You are right: this means that we need a new approach, a fresh start."
"We need to try to bring this Treaty into force."
"I think it is great that you are going to Ireland and working constructively with the Irish people."
"If I may give you a personal tip, leave Bernard Kouchner behind in Paris this time."
"I had the impression that his previous contributions did not exactly help us to convince the Irish."
"(Applause, heckling)"
"However, I am speaking about a matter on which we hold completely the opposite view to you."
"You spoke of four priorities for your Presidency, and I was waiting to see if there was a fifth."
"You then mentioned several other things you said were important - not priorities, just other things."
"These 'other things' included a social Europe, which you said was a matter for the nation-states."
"I believe that is a serious error."
"(Applause)"
"I want to tell you that we expect a different approach from the French Presidency."
"A social Europe does not mean that we want to establish a social security office in Europe or that we want to bring in family allowance in Europe."
"A social Europe is about something else: for a long time, people have believed - and rightly so - that Europe can make economic progress possible."
"We have spent 50 years working to ensure that economic progress in Europe leads to more growth and more jobs, and always to a guarantee of more social security."
"More and more people are now feeling that quite the opposite is true - that Europe's economic progress is benefiting a few large conglomerates, certain insurance companies, hedge funds and large enterprises, but not the people."
"It is the task of the European Union to restore to them the feeling that growth in Europe, the economic progress of this continent, does not serve the banks and the large conglomerates but each individual citizen."
"Furthermore, if the nation-states have to guarantee this, then you as President-in-Office of the European Council are obliged to tell your fellow Heads of State or Government that they must make sure that social justice, rather than free-market radicalism, takes centre stage in their nation-states."
"(Applause)"
"I should like to add that we have a European Court of Justice that delivers verdicts every day, and its verdicts can change the degree of social welfare in the individual Member States even though the Member States do not have any instruments with which to resist."
"This is why we need a social Europe, Mr President-in-Office, and this is why I expect you to change your mind on this issue by December."
"Otherwise, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will not be able to support you."
"Mr President-in-Office, fears about social exclusion lead to dangerous developments, and one dangerous development is that governments that are on the defensive believe that they can take people's minds off this fear of social exclusion by hounding minorities."
"We are currently seeing this in one European Union Member State."
"I do not know what percentage of the Italian population is made up of Roma children, but I do know that when a government goes and says 'they will be registered as by a police records department; they must have their fingerprints taken', supposedly in order to provide them with social protection, that is a grave offence against Europe's fundamental rights."
"Your country, France, gave the European community of nations its first charter of fundamental rights."
"The first declaration of human rights came from your country."
"As President of that republic, you are part of the tradition of your country."
"I ask you, in your role as President-in-Office of the European Council, to influence Silvio Berlusconi's government, and tell it that Europe is a community founded upon the rule of law, not a union of caprice."
"(Loud applause)"
"The European Union faces many major challenges but, if we do not guarantee social welfare in Europe, people will turn away from this Europe and, when they turn away, the Treaty of Lisbon will not be of any use; the whole project will fail."
"We need courage, therefore."
"I know that you are a courageous man."
"We support your priorities; now support ours - a social Europe and climate change, institutional reform and human rights."
"Then your Presidency will be successful."
"(Applause from the left)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would put it to the President-in-Office that the Irish vote against the Treaty has made his impressively prepared presidency more problematic."
"It has also made the case for a practical, problem-solving Europe stronger than ever."
"The energy and climate packages become more urgent every day."
"Capping VAT is a short-term sop: Europe should be cutting its dependence on oil and gas."
"We need much more investment in renewable energy: small-scale and localised to bring household bills down, and large-scale, such as using the Union for the Mediterranean to invest in high-voltage solar thermal power production in North Africa."
"On Tuesday the G8, which is the source of nearly two thirds of the world's CO2, approved an emissions-reduction target of 50%."
"But the emerging economies are right to say that the target should be higher - perhaps 80% - with interim targets."
"To stabilise food prices we need good ideas, such as the recent CAP reforms of Commissioner Fischer Boel, not protectionism, however disguised."
"The truth is that people care more about the petrol price and the bread bill than about the grand aims of our Union."
"Today nobody should say 'Qu'ils mangent de la brioche' ('Let them eat cake')."
"The President-in-Office is right to put the focus on migration."
"But migration will be manageable only when we manage the despair that leads so many to risk so much to come here."
"There should be routes for legal migration, a crackdown on people-smuggling, and reform of our farm policy to kick-start growth in the countries of origin."
"It may be optimistic to ask a French presidency to liberalise markets."
"But to bring security within our borders we must bring hope beyond them."
"There is another way in which the French presidency can break new ground."
"France gave us the Rights of Man. Now France must lead in their defence."
"At home, by pressing ahead with the anti-discrimination directive. Abroad: by anchoring peace in the Balkans in a European Union future; by using the Union for the Mediterranean to improve human rights in North Africa; and by uniting in our dealings with Russia and condemning China's crackdown on dissent."
"(FR) President-in-Office, do not go to Beijing."
"Play a team game."
"(Applause)"
"It was Voltaire who told us: 'Mortals are equal; it is not birth, but virtue alone that makes the difference.'"
"And by taking a lead, Europe can demonstrate its virtue and demand that the dignity of every man and woman be recognised."
"President-in-Office, to succeed, you will need to build consensus."
"You will need Parliament, Council and Commission to work together to a common agenda set by 27 Member States and this House."
"If we are to argue, it must be about that agenda, not its messengers."
"You have plunged into a polemic with the President of the ECB and with two Commissioners, but they represent our Union and the policies we have agreed."
"It is not the European way to divide and rule."
"We must stand on our principles but work together to achieve our common goals."
"(FR) Mr President, I know I am coming to the end, but please give me 'soixante petites secondes pour ma dernière minute' with Carla Bruni's husband."
"(Laughter)"
"President-in-Office, if you stand on your principles and let us work together to achieve common goals, if you do that, Liberals and Democrats will work with you."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to bring citizens closer to Europe there is a need, as I said in the European Convention for the new treaty, to give Europe a soul, that respects the various languages and identities, reaffirming common roots and values, and you have tried to express that soul in your speech today, President-in-Office."
"As Strasbourg is symbolic of renewed peace, so today the European flag flies alongside the national flags, and should be a visible representation of the symbol of all citizens united by a common project for defence, security, cultural and economic growth, and the transparency of the Central Bank: perhaps that is still missing from the new Treaty."
"Politics needs to give young people definite goals."
"There can be no economic future without respect for the environment and there can be no respect for rights without recognition of the associated duties. We hope that the French Presidency includes in its objectives the European Charter of Duties."
"Democracy and freedom are based on the application of rules."
"The internet cannot be a tool of terrorism, child traffickers and incitements to violence."
"We need to harmonise our countries' laws, from immigration to the protection of minors, from energy to compatible progress."
"A new Europe for a new relationship with Africa."
"Not just green certificates or trade but mutual growth, jointly sharing the Euro-Mediterranean project; we must think of the pockets of terrorism in Mogadishu and the violence in Zimbabwe that are preventing the development of democracy."
"There is too much hesitation within the EU: we are asking the Council to approve 'made in' so that international trade can have clear rules."
"The fight against counterfeiting and illegality is an economic problem but it also affects our citizens' health, and small and medium-sized enterprises are a cultural value that should be defended."
"We offer the French Presidency our staunch support so that hopes may become reality shared by the citizens and so that, possibly, by supporting the development of scientific advances to combat rare diseases, we can also combat our intelligent friend Mr Schulz's endemic antipathy towards Prime Minister Berlusconi."
"Mr President, your European voluntarism, your ambition for Europe is a challenge that we share in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"I would even say, to paraphrase a song that you know, 'it is a drug we are all hooked on.'"
"However, there is one thing that I would like to say."
"If we are ambitious enough to say that we must accept the climate package as it is one minute and that we will bow down before the German car industry lobby the next, then we have lost, because everyone will come and say: 'do not forget about us'."
"This is the problem."
"We cannot complain about petrol being too expensive, yet at the same time allow the car industry to build gas-guzzling vehicles."
"We have had the technology to build energy-efficient cars for 15 years now, but because there are no rules forcing manufacturers to do this, consumers are now paying for petrol at the price it is."
"This is the truth of the matter; this is how things are."
"(Applause from the centre and left)"
"You mention the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum."
"Let us have a European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, then."
"Initiate a dialogue: for legal emigration, let the European Parliament take part under the codecision procedure so that we have a genuine political debate, a genuine democratic debate."
"I am fed up, Mr Daul, because whenever we talk about emigration, after 15 seconds we start talking about illegal immigration, the threat of immigration."
"First of all, if Europe is what it is today, it is thanks to the men and women who have built it with us. That is the truth."
"(Applause from the centre and left)"
"Please, I am no angel, but we have built a house with no doors."
"People are coming in through the windows."
"I say to you: 'Let us throw open the doors so that people can come into Europe, and then we will decide what to do about those who come in illegally.'"
"You say to us: 'We need skilled workers', yet at the same time, Europe sends home tens of thousands of students each year who have come here to study."
"Let them stay here; if they have studied here, they are not illegal immigrants."
"Now turning to the points on which you said that the social dimension is not within Europe's remit."
"President-in-Office, you will not protect Europeans if we do not work together to combat social and fiscal dumping."
"We need Europeans to face up to this problem."
"We need to put a stop to it, and we stand by you on this."
"We need to have a discussion with the Central Bank?"
"Let us have a discussion, then."
"We need to have a discussion with the Irish?"
"Let us have one."
"We must stop saying that the social dimension is not part of the European remit."
"This cannot continue."
"(Applause from the centre and left)"
"I now wish to turn to the issues on which we are deeply divided."
"You are going to China to attend the opening of the Olympic Games with the Chinese President."
"I hope you enjoy it!"
"Personally, I will be thinking of all the prisoners rotting in Chinese prisons."
"I will be thinking of all those who have been arrested."
"I will be thinking of all those who are being mistreated in Tibet."
"You had a golden opportunity to defend the European values of democracy and liberty by saying, 'I will not attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, this masquerade of the Chinese Communist Party.'"
"This is what we want to hear."
"(Applause from the centre and left)"
"I can tell you that when you come to write your memoirs, you will regret what you have done."
"You will regret it because the people who locked up these innocent citizens will be saying to them, 'You see, we can do what we want: the Western world only wants our markets.'"
"Mr President, it is a disgrace, it is pathetic, to go to the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games."
"(Applause from the centre and left)"
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I would like to focus my speech on the twofold nature of this French Presidency, namely its unquestionable strong point and its all-too-obvious weak point."
"Its strong point, in relation to the usual tenors of the Union, is that it does not say that Europe is doing well and that it should continue along these lines when increasing numbers of Europeans think that it is doing badly and that things should change."
"So far so good."
"But what then?"
"This is where the problem lies."
"What conclusions do you draw, Mr President, from this apparent lucidity about the crisis of legitimacy that the Union is experiencing today, in particular its economic model and its operating mode?"
"You say that you want to understand and that you respect the concerns that Europeans have about the Union, but you put pressure on the Irish people to go back on their decision, when they were only voicing, like the French and the Dutch, what millions of other Europeans are thinking."
"You criticise, rightly, the way the European Central Bank has been managing the euro from its ivory tower, but you never recommend re-examining the statutes which grant it all those powers and even assign it this task!"
"You state, on the subject of immigration, that you want to 'serve our values', but you supported the shameful directive, condemned by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, by all human rights organisations and by European churches, precisely because it violates essential human values."
"You ignore the social question - which, you say, should remain the sole responsibility of Member States - but you say nothing about the European Court of Justice, which delivers ruling upon ruling placing the different social models within the Union in competition with each other and basing itself on Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty."
"You say that you did not like the image of the 'Polish plumber'."
"Neither did I. This was an expression coined by the populist right and made popular on television screens by Mr Bolkestein."
"I say 'Welcome to workers from all countries' on an equal footing in all fields."
"(Applause from the left)"
"This is precisely what current European law refuses."
"President-in-Office, may I remind you that, according to the Commission, in Lower Saxony, for the same work on the same construction site, a worker from another Member State can be paid half the minimum wage applicable to a German worker."
"This is what we do not want."
"Do you know what a man who cannot be accused of populism, namely John Monks, Secretary-General for the European Trade Union Confederation, thinks?"
"He considers these decisions 'considerably problematic' because, he says, they decree 'the primacy of economic freedoms over fundamental rights and the respect of labour law.'"
"What is your answer to that?"
"You claim that you want to build a 'Europe which protects', but we do not hear you criticising all those structural measures which make the existence of Europeans precarious: the obligation to open public utility undertakings to competition; the pressures of the Stability Pact on wages and social spending and the number of 'guidelines' prepared by the Commission and adopted by the Council, which you apply in your own country with zeal."
"I could mention Guideline No 2: the reform of pension, social security and health care schemes."
"Guideline No 5: labour market flexibility."
"Guideline No 13: the removal of regulatory, commercial and other obstacles which hinder competition unduly."
"And I have not mentioned all of them."
"The reversal of France's - and Italy's - position has just enabled the Council to go beyond the obligations that it set itself by agreeing on a draft Directive permitting a 65-hour week."
"This consecrates Dickens as the new father of Europe!"
"One last word, Mr President: this weekend, in front of your European guests - the President of Parliament, the President of the Commission and in front of 2 000 French right-wing business executives - you concluded your speech with words which were interpreted by the trade union movement in its entirety as an incitement - and a very unwise one - by stating that now, when there is a strike, the French people no longer even notice."
"The day after this lofty event, your Minister for Education explained that this was 'a way of reassuring our European partners in the presence of the most eminent among them.'"
"Well then, if you must insult the trade unions to reassure European leaders, it is definitely time for change in Europe."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Mr President of the Republic of France, in their daily lives the people of Europe unfortunately have to cope with the disastrous effects of the policies of the European authorities in Brussels and Frankfurt."
"The people of Europe are seeing more and more every day that all of their powers are trickling through their fingers, that their freedoms are being taken away, whether it be purchasing power, an expensive euro, GMOs, tax, fisheries, a lack of trade protection, immigration, or even football, which you yourself mentioned a few moments ago."
"Everything is trickling through their fingers, and I would say, Mr President of the Republic, President of the European Union, that everything is trickling through your fingers."
"You say so yourself, you point it out as a criticism."
"Well it is high time to act and to bring your actions in line with your words."
"A moment ago you criticised the lack of Community preference, and you are right."
"However, let me remind you that it was removed by the Marrakesh Agreement, which you approved, and it is not in the Lisbon Treaty, which you drew up."
"You deplore the irresponsibility of the Central Bank, and you ask for a debate to be started."
"As for us, we want decisions."
"Perhaps I can remind you here that this independence of the Central Bank, this irresponsibility that we see at work every day, was organised and formalised by the Maastricht Treaty."
"You regret having obtained the agreement of Brussels for a drop in oil taxation, but that is simply a consequence of the Treaties of Nice and Amsterdam, which you ratified through the parliamentary route."
"In short, you complain today and every day about the effects of what you encourage every day, in other words stripping away the powers of the State for the benefit of post-democratic forums, made up of officials, bankers and judges."
"Your Presidency of the European Union is a historic opportunity to get Europe moving in the right direction again, a Europe rooted in the freedom of nations that respects democracy."
"This is why we are asking you to honour the vote of the Irish people and to pronounce the Lisbon Treaty dead."
"It is not the European people who have to reconcile with Brussels, it is Brussels that has to reconcile with the European people!"
"(Applause from the speaker's group)"
"(FR) Mr President, here you are invested for six months in the rotating and brief role of President of the European Union."
"Unlike the majority of the French electorate, you have shown yourself to be zealously pro-European, even going as far as presenting once again, in the barely different form of the Lisbon Treaty, the Constitution which, along with the Dutch, the French people rejected in 2005."
"Alas, your plans have hit a snag in the form of the will of the Irish people."
"The Lisbon Treaty is therefore void, despite all the schemes that it would seek to impose on the European people, the will of the ruling euro-globalist camarilla."
"As a young member of parliament, in 1957 I voted against the Treaty of Rome, the first stage of a process which, according its promoters, Monnet and Coudenhove-Kalergi among others, was to lead to the United States of Europe: this Tower of Babel that can only be built on the ruins of the nations, and first of all of my homeland, France."
"Since then I have been resolutely opposed to it."
"We are told that globalisation is bringing about fundamental changes everywhere, that we must submit to."
"In reality, however, all over the world the nations are gaining strength, supported by fervent patriotism, apart from in just one area - Europe - where nations and homelands are sacrificed, dismantled and demoralised for the benefit of a project that has no strength and no identity, while waves of foreign immigrants gradually invade it and the opening up of our economic borders leaves it open to furious competition from the rest of the world."
"None of the promises made to the European people in order for them to accept the loss of their independence, their sovereignty, their identity and their culture have been kept: neither growth, nor full employment, nor prosperity, nor security, and the predominant feeling is of anxiety as we stand on the brink of a looming systemic crisis: energy, food and financial crises."
"In the meantime it is true that the media circus will continue."
"Yesterday, the European football championship, the tennis at Roland Garros, tomorrow the Olympic Games in Beijing, and today, the miraculous saga of an icon, Ingrid, who laughs, cries, prays and comes and goes on your brotherly arm!"
"In your desire to be the liberator, you got involved in the negotiations with the FARC terrorists, but it was not you or Mr Chavez who freed the Colombian Senator Mrs Betancourt."
"It was President Uribe who persistently, against the general movement of global progressivism, won a decisive victory over criminal terrorism."
"You made repeated futile attempts and you even went as far as inviting the repentant communist FARC terrorists to come and receive asylum in France; but to protect them from whom?"
"From President Uribe, the democrat?"
"As you have gone this far, why not the Taliban, Hezbollah or the Tamil Tigers?"
"You are like the amphisbaena that was so dear to Césaire."
"Have no doubt, Mr President, all your talents in orchestrating the media will not be sufficient to ward off the imminent dangers that you will have to face before the end of the year."
"Our Europe is a vessel that is going off course, battered by the wind and waves, the only region in the world that has deliberately dismantled its political and moral structures, that has no borders and is gradually being invaded by mass immigration that is only just beginning!"
"Economically ruined by ultraliberalism, socially impoverished, demographically weakened, with no spirit and no defence force, it is doomed at best to be a U.S. protectorate, and at worst to the servitude of dhimmitude."
"It is high time to abandon the fatal illusion of federalism and build a Europe of the nations, united by more tangible alliances that will undoubtedly be more modest, but more effective."
"The dual failures of the Constitution and the Treaty should serve as a warning."
"The people of Europe do not want anything to do with these plans and will not allow them to be imposed on them because they do not want to die."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your speeches."
"I would first like to thank Mr Daul, Chairman of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for his support and that of his group, which will be invaluable to the French Presidency."
"I agree with your analyses and am sure you will understand that I will not go back over each of the points, even though your commitment regarding a defence policy is entirely necessary."
"Mr Schulz, allow me to say that I appreciated the sense of responsibility in your speech."
"As with Mr Daul, we met and had discussions, and there are no secrets."
"Democracy should not be a shadow theatre."
"It should enable us to compare our ideas and try to reach a compromise."
"You can be sure that, as in the case of Mr Daul, the French Presidency appreciates the support of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and your support on matters of consensus."
"Moreover, I do not see why I would say that this support is of less use to me because it comes from the Chairman of the Socialist Group, or why you would seek out conflicts with the Presidency under the pretext that I am not of the same political persuasion as you."
"Allow me to say that regarding the energy and climate package, I am perfectly aware, and I also say this to Mr Daul, that it is Parliament that will have the last word; but better than that, it is not just a question of having the last word."
"It is the mobilisation of Parliament that will put pressure on the Member States that do not have the same ambitions as Parliament, the Commission and the Presidency."
"I would not say, Mr Schulz, that you will have the last word."
"I am saying that your commitment is absolutely critical."
"I would also like to say to Mr Cohn-Bendit that it is not about getting down on bended knee in front of anyone, especially not the car industry, be it French, Italian or German."
"Why just target the German industry?"
"In this case, the President-in-Office of the Council has to take into account the legitimate interests of each of the Member States."
"What we have to do is resist the industrial lobby while allowing it to have fair conditions, and clearly explaining that the fact that we are defending the energy and climate package does not mean that we are naive."
"In other words, Mr Cohn-Bendit, as we want to achieve planetary balance, I would not like us to be accused of promoting relocations."
"It is not about respecting the environment and accepting relocations; it is about respecting the environment and rejecting relocations."
"Any other way of thinking is suicidal."
"If you ask the Member States to choose between the environment and growth, you will place us all at an impasse."
"Sustainable development and respect for the environment are factors in economic growth."
"This is why, Mr Cohn-Bendit, you will not resent my preferring Mr Schulz's or Mr Daul's analysis to yours, just this once."
"Now, Mr Schulz, let us come to what you identified as a point of disagreement."
"Allow me to say that I do not think so."
"I would also like to say to you that Europe is not responsible for the fact that our German friends have not managed to reach an agreement on a minimum wage, but rather it is the German political debate that has caused you to reject a minimum wage."
"Do not saddle Europe with the responsibility for a social failing that is down to national political debate!"
"In this case, as President-in-Office of the Council, it is not for me to pass judgment."
"I would quite simply say, 'Do not ask us, Mr Schulz, to resolve problems that you Germans have not been able to resolve between you.'"
"I would like to add that in France, in terms of social matters, we attach a great deal of importance to the minimum wage."
"What would social harmonisation mean?"
"You Germans have rejected a minimum wage."
"We French want to keep our minimum wage."
"Social harmonisation would therefore mean that we would have to reject our minimum wage because the Germans do not have one."
"I reject this social regression, including in the name of my European ideal."
"Thank you, Mr Schulz, for allowing me to clarify my social commitments."
"I would like to add, however, Mr Schulz, that you are entirely right about raising the moral standards of financial capitalism, the rules that apply to credit rating agencies and the entirely reprehensible conduct of some of our financial establishments, and I would like to say something else: in all of our countries there have been directors of large banks who liked to lecture politicians about the rigour with which affairs of state should be conducted."
"Having seen what has happened in a number of large private banks, I would say that those who gave lectures were very poorly placed to give them, and that they should now prepare themselves to receive them."
"I would like to add, Mr Schulz - I say this under the watchful eye of Mr Watson - that I am against protectionism."
"I am in favour of freedom, but we can no longer continue in a world in which there are no rules, in which credit rating agencies do whatever they like, in which a number of financial establishments want to make billions of euros in a few seconds by speculating on the trading floors."
"The Europe that we want, and, Mr Schulz, the French Presidency will make proposals on this subject, proposals for regulations to raise the moral standards of financial capitalism, because we can see now that the reasons that global growth has halted for a year is because of the sub-prime crisis and the crisis of confidence in the financial institutions, which have done whatever they like, whenever they like, lending money to anyone under any conditions."
"If Europe has any sense, it needs to restore some order to what has become the law of anything goes."
"I would like to say to Mr Schulz that I entirely agree with him."
"Regarding the European immigration pact, I would like to say to Mr Schulz and Mr Cohn-Bendit that the French Presidency will involve the European Parliament."
"This is the best way to avoid excesses."
"You talked about the excesses, Mr Schulz, that are the practice in one country - it is not my place to mention it - but if we all agree on a minimum corpus for the cost, those excesses that you pointed out will no longer take place, and, Mr Cohn-Bendit, I am sure that Mr Daul would agree, why would the European Parliament not be involved in this?"
"I am not sure that it would be institutionally possible."
"(Off-microphone intervention from Mr Cohn-Bendit)"
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, I am aware of your generosity."
"In general you are always ready to give advice, especially to me."
"Even if I suffered from such modesty as yours, I would not need this advice."
"I knew that unanimity was required, but irrespective of that there is no need for unanimity in order for me to say to the European Parliament that the question of immigration is sufficiently important for it to be discussed politically, for you to be involved in it, even before there is a Lisbon Treaty or any modification of it."
"It is a political commitment that I am making and I will come with Bernard Kouchner and Brice Hortefeux to present the pact to you, to discuss it with you."
"We will consider with the President of Parliament and perhaps the Conference of Presidents the conditions under which you would like us to put this in place."
"Mr Watson, difficulties provide an opportunity."
"Obviously, when one chooses to be the President of a country and has the responsibility of the Presidency of the Union for six months, if one does not like problems or difficulties it is better not to be European and not to be involved in politics."
"Personally I think that these difficulties are an opportunity."
"Can you see why?"
"It is because they are an opportunity for us to move beyond our national selfishness and our partisan prejudices."
"Allow me to say that, if everything were going well, my appearance before the European Parliament would not necessarily have gone better, because a year from the elections, when you have the wind behind you and everything is going well, everyone is thinking of their partisan or national interests."
"As I believe that here, in the main, the vast majority of MEPs are Europeans, they are aware of the gravity of the situation."
"Everyone has to make an effort."
"I am not sure whether, Mr Schulz and Mr Cohn-Bendit, you would have been as open towards the French Presidency if things had been easier."
"Personally I think that these difficulties can be an opportunity."
"There is one point, Mr Watson, on which I clearly made an error."
"I should have talked at more length about the European energy policy."
"There are a number of you here who wear particular T-shirts because you are against a type of power."
"I respect you."
"Others have made other choices."
"However, there is a point that could unite all of us, which is that we need a European energy policy, with transparency on stocks and pooling of resources on solar power, photovoltaic power, biomass power and hydraulic power."
"Forgive me for not having said it during my initial speech, but defining an energy policy - notwithstanding our differences on nuclear power, notwithstanding those differences - will be a priority for the French Presidency."
"I do not think that President Barroso will mind me saying this, as it is also his priority."
"This is something on which we cannot waste any time."
"I would also like to say to Mr Watson that I am not protectionist."
"I never have been and I never will be."
"However, the Liberals also need to think about something: we are opening up our borders and we have benefited from it."
"However, at the same time the others cannot ask us to do here what they do not agree to us doing there."
"China, India, Brazil, Mexico - the big emerging countries - cannot say, 'Open up your borders, reduce your subsidies, but here we will do what we want.'"
"That is not free trade, and that is not a service to give them."
"Just as loving your country is not nationalism, wanting reciprocity and protection is not protectionism."
"It is possible to be in favour of free trade and to want to establish a balance in that free trade."
"Mr Watson, we will have more to discuss."
"Some place an emphasis on protection, others on freedom."
"Perhaps we can meet halfway."
"Finally, allow me to congratulate you, Mr Watson."
"I think that in terms of songs we have the same taste."
"(Laughter)"
"I will pass on your appreciation to the person concerned, and I am sure that she will sign her latest CD for you, Mr Watson."
"No hard feelings."
"(Laughter)"
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, I have already answered many of your questions."
"I would like to discuss two subjects."
"The first one is the issue of students, which is an extremely important matter."
"Of course Europe needs to open up to training the elites of the whole world."
"I have even thought for some time that opening up to training the elites of the whole world means welcoming them into our universities and, at the same time, giving them the opportunity of initial professional experience."
"I am particularly thinking about doctors."
"However, Mr Cohn-Bendit, we need to be careful not to plunder the elites of the developing world."
"In France there are, and you should think about this, more Beninese doctors practising than there are in Benin itself."
"I think that Benin needs its elites."
"It is not refusing immigration to refuse to plunder the elites of the developing world."
"We will not exhaust this debate in a few minutes."
"I am grateful to you for the way in which you mentioned it, but you must understand that it deserves an in-depth debate and not caricatures."
"It is not a case of generous people on the one hand and heartless people on the other."
"There are statesmen and women who are going to try to find the best solution."
"If you will permit me, I would like to say one thing about the issue of China, which is an extremely serious and extremely difficult issue."
"I would like to say, Mr Cohn-Bendit, that like everyone here, I heard the emotion in your voice, which is a credit to you, and I would like to say that I share your feelings."
"I would also like to say to Mr Watson, who asked me to be a team player, that this is exactly what I have done, because as President-in-Office of the Council, I spoke to all the Member States to find out what they thought and whether any of them were opposed to my taking part - I will speak in a moment about the substance; I am speaking first about the form."
"I would like to say that I received agreement from all the Member States to attend the Olympic opening ceremony."
"As you know it is a difficult subject, which I think we need to tackle very carefully, as we cannot afford to get it wrong."
"However, Mr Watson told me to be 'a team player'."
"I want you to know that I discussed this with all the Member States."
"None of them were opposed to my taking part, and currently thirteen of them will be represented at the opening ceremony."
"This is not a reason, Mr Watson, it is simply a response to the issue of being a team player."
"Now, if you will, let us get to the heart of the matter."
"I understand those who say that Europeans should not attend the Olympic opening ceremony in Beijing."
"Everyone has the right to have a view on the best way of defending human rights, and I have to respect those who say that we should boycott the ceremony."
"However, my personal opinion is - and I think that this opinion should be respected, because it is respectable - that it is not by humiliating China that we will make progress on the issue of human rights, but through a frank and direct dialogue."
"I would even like to say this: I do not think that we can boycott a quarter of humanity."
"I do not think this is an intelligent or responsible choice for someone who has the responsibility of being the President-in-Office of the Council to say to a quarter of humanity, 'We will not come; we are humiliating you in the eyes of the whole world.'"
"I want to go there and I want to talk."
"Regarding the core issue of defending human rights, we are in agreement."
"Regarding the way in which to defend those human rights, acknowledge that there can be a debate and that the debate will not end with the issue of the Olympic Games."
"I therefore want to go there, talk about human rights and defend them."
"I am even going to go further than that, Mr Cohn-Bendit."
"There are things that I will not say to China, because China should be respected; but there are things that China should not say to the European countries, particularly not to France, because France and the European countries should be respected just as China should be."
"It is not up to China to fix my schedule and appointments."
"In the same way, it is not up to me to fix the schedule and meetings of the Chinese President."
"I will therefore defend the issue of human rights, and, at the same time, as a head of state, I have to consider something."
"We always talk about agreements."
"I would like to challenge this, as for a democratically elected head of state it is not illegitimate to defend the economic interests and jobs of his fellow citizens."
"I want to talk about something else."
"China is a permanent member of the Security Council."
"We need China in order to put an end to the scandal in Darfur, because China is influential in Sudan."
"We need China in order to isolate Iran, so that neither Iran nor anyone that dares to say that they are going to wipe Israel off the map has access to a nuclear bomb."
"How can we say to China, 'Help us to establish peace in the world, to ensure stability in the world', and at the same time boycott the country at a time when it is hosting a fundamental event for 1.3 billion inhabitants?"
"That would not be reasonable, it would not be responsible and it would not be worthy of a self-respecting statesman."
"(Applause)"
"Having expressed my respect for the opinions and feelings of Mr Cohn-Bendit, and of everyone in this House who thinks the same way, I would finally like to add this: respect those who, like us, think as I do."
"Before going, I questioned Mr Watson and Mr Schulz, the Chairman of the Socialist Group, and I think that I can say on his behalf that he is entirely in agreement with the need not to boycott China."
"He is a socialist, I am not."
"I questioned Mr Daul, who is entirely in agreement with this."
"I would like to say one last thing."
"Look at what China did in terms of being pragmatic regarding the issue of Hong Kong."
"Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that it was a very difficult matter."
"Fifteen years ago, there were demonstrations in Hong Kong."
"China was able to be pragmatic in resolving the issue of Hong Kong."
"Look at Macao."
"China has been able, through dialogue, to resolve the issue of Macao."
"I am even going to go further."
"Look at the issue of Taiwan today, where the progress made by President Hu Jintao on Taiwan is remarkable."
"Five years ago, everyone thought it inevitable that there would be a confrontation between Taiwan and China, which is not the case."
"Will we move China forward through frank, courageous, direct dialogue, or through humiliation?"
"I have chosen dialogue, frankness and courage."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, just one minute, out of courtesy to Mr Wurtz."
"First of all, I would like to say to him that he can be reassured that I am not insulting the unions, but I thank him for pointing out that France can be changed, as is currently happening, without paralysing it."
"It is an insult to the unions to think that their only use is to paralyse."
"The unions have a role of social democracy, just as political leaders do."
"No more and no less."
"However, what I meant to say is that no one has the right to take users hostage."
"I am sure that a man as courteous as you, Mr Wurtz, who has never blocked anything, can understand what I am saying."
"For the rest, Mr Wurtz, we do not agree, but that does not prevent me from greatly appreciating the way in which you express your disagreement."
"Mr de Villiers, I would like to say that I understand your discourse even more given that you indisputably represent a significant political tendency in our country, but also in Europe."
"I will even say better than this, Mr de Villiers."
"Personally I do not take your discourse as a discourse against Europe but as a call to build Europe in a different way."
"Mr de Villiers, I do not want to pit the 'yes' camp against the 'no' camp."
"I simply want to try to integrate everyone into a different Europe, based around democracy, peace and growth."
"I noted your reservations, I am aware of them and I will try to respond to them, not with words but with facts."
"As for you, Mr Le Pen, as I was listening to you I was saying to myself that for years France had the great misfortune of having the most powerful extreme right wing in Europe."
"Listening to you, Mr Le Pen, I am very glad that this has come to an end."
"(Loud applause)"
"Mr President, I welcome the President-in-Office of the Council."
"Firstly, may I thank you, Sir, on behalf of the British Conservative delegation for your hospitality last week and say how much we look forward to working with you to ensure a successful presidency."
"We are confident of your energy and your commitment and, having read a very good book recently, we are confident of your vision."
"I refer, of course, to your own book Témoignage."
"For those colleagues who have not yet had the benefit of reading this remarkable work, may I suggest that you do so and, in particular, I recommend that you open the book on page 146."
"There you describe the follies of the 35-hour week and you describe the benefits: to use the UMP slogan, 'travailler plus pour gagner plus'."
"You go on to say: 'Rather than the uniform and rigid policy of the 35 hours and the guillotine of retirement at 60, I think our fellow citizens expect a policy of free choice which permits those that wish to earn more to work more and for everyone to regulate their own working hours according to their lifestyle.'"
"President-in-Office, you have got it in one!"
"That is the true social Europe."
"It is not for governments to force people to work more or compel them to work less, but it is for governments to enable people to work more if people choose to work more."
"Your party is about freedom; your party is about choice, and that is what the British Conservative Party is about as well."
"So, if these principles guide your presidency, we shall be alongside you all the way."
"When the Working Time Directive is revised, we shall be on the side of freedom and choice; when the Temporary Workers Directive is reviewed, we shall, again, be on the side of freedom and choice."
"Finally, President-in-Office, let me say that our parties should not just be about enabling free choice; they are also about respecting the people's choice once the people have freely chosen."
"Therefore, I urge you to respect the choice of the people of Ireland in their recent referendum."
"I urge you to regard their decision not as a problem to be addressed but as an opportunity to be grasped - an opportunity for Europe to reconnect with its people."
"This will, of course, take much work with you and your colleagues on the Council."
"But as you yourself have said: travailler plus pour gagner plus."
"(FR) Mr President, I am a French and European socialist."
"This means that in Paris, I am not one of your supporters, but in Strasbourg, I am not entirely one of your opponents, especially when I see you surrounded by two social democrats."
"Even if my President is in the wrong in my country, he is still my President."
"I therefore wish the French Presidency, and therefore the European Presidency, success."
"Since the start I have relaxed while observing you, because I understand your desire to be in the French Parliament."
"What I am seeing is a head of state, certainly, but also a somewhat frank Prime Minister."
"Regarding the social chapter and your priorities, I think that a distinction needs to be made."
"There are indeed matters that need to remain national."
"I am thinking about pensions."
"However, for everything that affects employment, such as a single market, a single currency and free movement, we need to aim at harmonising towards the best that we have."
"A distinction therefore needs to be made."
"I would like to add that, in this chapter, I would have liked you to put considerable effort into establishing a framework directive for public services."
"You did it for restaurateurs, and it needs to be done for public services."
"Finally, I do not think that the European crisis is only social and democratic."
"I think that it is also an identity crisis."
"From the point when peace was obtained, freedom won and democracy established, the world as it is has made it difficult for many of our citizens to see and understand the meaning of the history of the Union."
"That is why matters such as culture, education, the mobility of artists, young people, students and twinning, all of those things are fundamental, because European consciousness can no longer be taken for granted."
"It will build itself up, and I think that these subjects need to pervade the French Presidency."
"Finally, obviously we are going to judge you on six months."
"For a French person that is fine, because in France that is a long time, as you know."
"So in December we will have the results."
"What is certain is that the Treaty will definitely not have been ratified."
"You wanted a simplified treaty, and you have a complicated situation, so get yourself out of it!"
"I would like to conclude with a phrase that I have borrowed from a Polish writer, which says this Mr President, if you will allow me, 'Being French means taking into consideration something other than France.'"
"That is the reputation we have, and perhaps you have too a little bit, Mr President."
"Mr President, I would like to sincerely apologise to Cristiana Muscardini because I got so carried away by my enthusiasm that Mr Poignant so kindly highlighted that I forgot to respond to you and say how much we will need your group."
"I am aware of who is part of it, and I know that you are among those who love Europe, and that there are MEPs who equally love their nations."
"Mrs Muscardini, you can be sure that I will take your remarks fully into consideration, and that during the next six months I will try, along with the European institutions, to build a Europe that responds to your concerns."
"So, you are the one who has shown - proving Mr Poignant right - that I am forgetful of how overrated my reputation is."
"(FR) Mr President, a few weeks ago Ireland said 'no', and I think that, as we all know, this illustrates the increasing split between European citizens."
"This 'no' should obviously not be underestimated, and I think that, on the contrary, it should force all political leaders to take into account the expectations and concerns of the people and try to provide answers to them, whatever treaty is in force."
"It is not the case that if we had the Lisbon Treaty tomorrow everything would disappear with a wave of a magic wand."
"The French Presidency has chosen to focus on four areas, which is obviously very helpful, especially regarding climate change."
"However, during this time of deep crisis, a financial and food crisis, an explosion in the price of raw materials, and increasingly scarce and increasingly expensive oil, I think that what the people are expecting is not only a matter of issues, but also a matter of vision; what the people are expecting is a matter of prospects."
"Right now I would like to suggest three avenues for reflection."
"The first concerns the fundamental, essential issue of our identity."
"I believe, I have a deep conviction, that there is a European model, that there is a European blueprint for society."
"This European model is economic, sustainable and also social."
"This European model, for example, seeks to combat the growing inequalities."
"There is, therefore, a European model, and we should be proud of it, we should assert it, carry it, take it up, defend it and protect it."
"That is the first avenue."
"Then there is a second avenue for reflection."
"I think that we need a new vision for the organisation of the world."
"In saying that, I am thinking particularly of Africa."
"I am thinking of the issue of agricultural products; I think we should stop subsidising exports of our agricultural products and instead work towards Africa being self-sufficient in terms of food and energy."
"This is the new revolution that we need in order to have a fairer world in the future."
"(Applause)"
"Finally, I believe, and we should never stop reminding ourselves of this, that there are European values that we should never renounce: they are called democracy and human rights, and they are valid for us in Europe, and will be valid in the future of the Union for the Mediterranean, where it will not be about doing business above all while neglecting human rights."
"The issue of human rights is essential for the coming decades; it is the deep-seated identity of Europe and deserves to be defended."
"Mr President, these are some of the questions that I feel are before us; they concern fundamental matters, in other words, the vision and the deeper meaning that we must and want to give to Europe."
"These questions are not only a matter of politics, but also a matter of conscience."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome President Sarkozy again to Strasbourg and to congratulate him on engaging with Parliament, for being real with regard to ideas, even though he knew there would not be general agreement across the House with regard to those ideas."
"For too long we have been hoisted with the petard of failed ideologies of the past, the failure to look to the new frontiers which come before us and to meet those challenges head on."
"We have played safe by falling back into the comfort zone of either past imperialistic ideals or post-fascist commands or even, dare I say it, new 20th-century thinking with regard to human life and human rights."
"Because the complexity of the world today is very different and far more varied than what can be offered by any one single ideology or any one single plan."
"And rightly you mention the importance of engaging with other governments around the world: with China to solve the problem of Chad and of Sudan, ensuring that the problems with regard to Africa and the developing world are met head on."
"We are already commemorating today the lives of seven peacekeepers in Sudan who have lost their lives under a United Nations mandate, simply because of a failure of governments to intervene properly and put pressure on the authorities in Chad and in Sudan to protect the lives of refugees and asylum seekers."
"It is all very well to speak woolly words here in Parliament about the importance of immigration and allowing the free movement of people."
"It is better if we allow people to stay at home."
"I come from Ireland, a nation that had to export 12 million of its people over a hundred years."
"None of them wanted to leave Ireland."
"They were forced to leave Ireland."
"If we give people the opportunity to remain in their own countries, give them support through the mechanisms of the policies that we set up, whether in trade or other areas, then we can do it."
"Finally, Mr President-in-Office, you spoke earlier about how you felt the legitimacy of your position in bringing the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty before the parliament was the only way to do it."
"I agree with you."
"That is right for France."
"But equally legitimate is the right to have a referendum and that should always be protected."
"It is not an either/or."
"There are problems and difficulties with regard to the result in Ireland, but that is not just a problem with regard to Ireland's relationship with Europe."
"It is reflective of a deeper malaise for the people and Europe."
"(FR) Mr President, right now I would like to ask you about the position of the French Presidency regarding linguistic diversity."
"Diversity is a founding principle of Europe."
"All the languages in the world are part of humanity's heritage, and it is the duty of public institutions to take action to protect them."
"(ES) Mr President, the Council conclusions of 22 May on multilingualism invited the Commission to draw up a detailed framework on this subject, which it has announced that it will do by the autumn."
"What will the position and actions of the French Presidency be regarding the multilingualism policy?"
"What is the Presidency's position going to be and what role does it intend to give to the non official EU languages, which are also called 'regional' and 'minority' languages?"
"Because, Mr President, as we await the vote in the French Senate next week, France is currently a very bad example to all those of us who believe that linguistic diversity is a common heritage of all Europeans."
"(The speaker continued his speech in Basque)"
"Mr President, I should like to reply to Mr Sarkozy."
"You are a very good orator, Mr Sarkozy, but I am not so sure that you are that good a listener."
"This presidency programme that you have unveiled this morning shows that you want a European Union that controls literally every single aspect of our lives, everything from a common immigration policy through to how we run our hospitals and our football clubs."
"I also took it from your comments that you want us to be very isolated from the rest of the world, that if people do not have the same standards as us we are not going to trade with them."
"But worst of all, it is the sheer arrogance of saying that you know best when it comes to the European project."
"You are showing contempt, not just for the Irish people, but for the very concept of democracy which you say you are a champion of."
"You said the Polish President must keep his word, that he must ratify the Treaty because that was his agreement."
"Well, the Irish people have spoken."
"Will you respect the Irish vote?"
"Will you keep your side of that bargain which says this Treaty is dead?"
"I do not think that you get it, do you?"
"The peoples of Europe do not want deeper political integration."
"That is why in France they said 'no', and in Holland they said 'no', and in Ireland they said 'no', and if we had a vote in Britain an overwhelming majority of us would have said 'no'."
"What price democracy, Mr Sarkozy?"
"You are going to Dublin on 21 July."
"Please do not try to do with them as you did in France and try to bypass a second referendum, try to get them to change the rules and to ratify this Treaty through the back door."
"That would be showing utter contempt for democracy."
"Please do not do it."
"(FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, in order to meet our expectations and those of our fellow citizens, the Council that you preside over and Parliament must demonstrate a clear, understandable and concrete political will."
"Your presence at the head of the Council is already a guarantee of determination."
"In this respect, we have all seen, here in Strasbourg and in Brussels, the quality of preparation for this six-month Presidency, and the extent to which the members of the French Government make themselves available."
"The priorities that you have just set out are the right ones to respond to the concerns of EU citizens."
"In the same way, the other challenges that you raised, including the economic governance of the euro area in response to the explosion of global prices of raw materials and hydrocarbons, or the creation of an area of stability and prosperity in the Mediterranean Basin, are entirely representative of your commitment to a European Union that is more reactive to problems and more attentive to its population."
"In response to public opinion, where there are doubts and people sometimes give in to the temptation to withdraw to national level in order to solve problems, it is more important than ever to point out that our continent has a considerable number of assets and is still one of the rare areas of stability in a world that is increasingly unpredictable."
"The European Union should seek to demonstrate that it does not undergo globalisation without protecting its people, and I welcome your commitment to proving that."
"Finally, as the Union is going through a significant crisis of confidence, we sincerely want the French Presidency to bring an end to the more than fifteen years of efforts to reform the functioning of the enlarged Europe."
"We need the Lisbon Treaty to come into force as soon as possible, which you have strongly affirmed."
"We all have confidence in you to negotiate with our Irish friends and to convince the few Member States that are still hesitating to ratify it and to do so once and for all."
"Mr President, you said last weekend that you were not ready to put your European flag back in your pocket, and indeed we have seen that you have raised it under the Arc de Triomphe next to the French flag."
"We interpret this symbolic gesture as proof of your determination to act in the service of the Community, and we thank you, Mr President."
"Mr President, may I just address the President-in-Office and say that I am Rasmussen I, not to be confused with Rasmussen II, but I want to assure you of one thing."
"You talk wisely about the new Lisbon Treaty, and I say to Mr Farage that he has forgotten the Danish case."
"We voted 'no' to Maastricht but we voted 'yes' to the Edinburgh agreement and we would never ever dream of saying that because we voted 'no' in the first instance we will block the rest of Europe."
"We would never say that."
"Mr Farage is wrong: this is not democracy."
"I want just to assure you, Mr President-in-Office, and assure France, that we found the solution for Denmark and we will find a solution for the Irish people."
"My second point is this: I have an appeal to you on behalf of the European Social Democratic Party and all my colleagues and leaders and political family."
"My priority - and I hope it will be yours, I know it is yours - is about jobs, is about growth, is about sustainability."
"You said - and I was so happy to hear you say it - 'We need better regulation of the financial markets'."
"I could not agree with you more."
"We are just working right now in this very Parliament on getting a report through and I hope - and I appeal to my colleagues in the PPE-DE and ALDE Groups - that we can deliver to the French presidency a wise report on better regulation."
"I am talking about transparency."
"I am talking about better regulation on fairness, bonuses and stock options and all the rest you talked so wisely about."
"I am talking about accountability, responsibility, to ensure that the financial market is a long-term patient financing power to our long-term investment needs for more jobs and better jobs."
"Connected to that is another idea for you."
"You are right in saying that we are losing growth right now, we are losing jobs right now, especially in the UK, in Spain but also in France."
"Why do we not take a new initiative for growth, a new coordinated investment action?"
"Imagine the following scenario: if we invest just one per cent more together in education, in structure, in all relevant issues, within the next four years we will get at least 10 million jobs in addition to what we now have."
"Imagine what we could do together."
"You said that sport is more than the market economy."
"I would add: I agree, and that goes for the whole of Europe."
"Europe is more than the market economy."
"It is about jobs and people."
"Let us care about them."
"I wish the French presidency every success."
"(FR) Mr President, you said 'France cannot pass judgment on the Irish ""no”'."
"(DE) I agree."
"The Irish 'no' must be respected."
"The Irish people are fully within their rights to vote as they have done."
"However, all the other countries in Europe also have the right to proceed along the road to a more democratic, more transparent Europe that is more capable of taking action."
"The Treaty of Lisbon is a step in this direction."
"Therefore I welcome the fact that ratification is being continued."
"However, I also think - and here I do not share your view, I disagree - that it would be good to speak openly about the fact that a multi-speed Europe already exists."
"Think of the euro, the Schengen Agreement, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and many other areas."
"The sensitivities and wishes of the Member States of the EU are reflected in their choice of different speeds for things that they undertake together."
"A multi-speed Europe makes it possible for countries that want to do more together to do so, for it is important that we maintain the voluntary principle in Europe."
"It is important that the countries who want to do something together do so voluntarily and that all countries have the option of joining in at any time. No country should be forced into a greater degree of solidarity."
"A multi-speed Europe also makes it easier to continue accession negotiations."
"I believe it is wrong for Croatia and Turkey to be punished because the majority of Irish people voted no."
"Mr President-in-Office, you are quite rightly proud that your country is the home of human rights."
"Human rights are timeless; they are universal."
"The Olympic Games are a sporting event, not a political event."
"Therefore, I believe it is wrong for you to want to go to China for the opening ceremony, and I am glad that the President of the European Parliament, Mr Pöttering, will not be going to China."
"Mr President-in-Office, let me say in closing that you found on your seat a greeting from many of my female fellow Members - a rose and a letter."
"The letter asks you to play your part in getting more women to the top of the European Union."
"Women are pinning their hopes on you as a 'ladies' man'."
"Please allow me to add one more request: as a democratically elected representative, I hope that you will support us in ensuring that this European Parliament is able to take an independent decision about where it is based."
"(PL) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, first of all I would like to offer you my sincere congratulations on taking over the Presidency of the European Union."
"This will not be an easy presidency."
"It coincides with a difficult period, but of course I wish you success."
"Ireland has rejected the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We cannot rule out the possibility that Ireland will change its mind in the future, but it is definitely not acceptable to try to influence the Irish decision by means of threats, just as the French and the Dutch were not threatened when they rejected the Treaty three years ago and set today's problems in motion."
"EU countries must not be divided into better and worse."
"I therefore thank you for saying today that none of the 27 Member States can be excluded from the European family, as the lady who spoke before me, Mrs Koch-Mehrin, might perhaps have liked to do."
"Mr President, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for the recent opening-up of the job market in France to Poles, among others."
"We had waited some time for this to happen - a lot longer than in other countries, but better late than never."
"One thing I missed hearing in today's speech was any reference to our largest European neighbour, Ukraine."
"I nevertheless hope that the summit planned for 9 September 2008 in Evian will bring us significantly closer to the signing of an association agreement with Ukraine."
"After all, just now a clear signal from us is of particular importance to our friends in Ukraine, especially at a time when there are further threats from Russia."
"Finally, on behalf of the millions of Europeans who are currently afflicted by ever-increasing costs, I would like to thank you, Mr President, for your efforts towards bringing down VAT on fuel."
"I would like to hope that during the French Presidency you will succeed in winning other leaders over to this idea, including the Prime Minister of my own country, Poland."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to pay an explicit compliment to the President-in-Office of the Council."
"This is the 29th Presidency of the Council that I have experienced, and I must say without reservation that I have never seen such a convincing presentation of a programme and a European idea as this, and I say that in all honesty."
"(Applause)"
"There has been only one other time that a President-in-Office of the Council was received even more warmly, but that was only at the opening."
"By the end, he had delivered nothing on the agenda."
"That was the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair."
"We are sure, President Sarkozy, that you will finish your Council Presidency in six months' time with good results."
"The way you have explained everything today - the way you have dealt with points put by our Members, the fact that you have familiarised yourself with the dossiers, and that you are not presenting a 'wish list' but a series of priorities backed up by good reasoning - all this gives me hope that you are indeed capable of carrying out your ambitious programme."
"If it is a matter of working with you to bring the climate package to completion, you can count on the support of this Parliament."
"However, I fear it is more likely that there will be further problems within the Council, problems with the responsibility of the Council and of the individual Member States: that the quotas envisaged will not be accepted there."
"We also agree with you that nuclear energy needs to be represented in this climate package."
"Here in this Parliament there is a clear majority in favour of the civil use of nuclear energy."
"Do not let those T-shirts confuse you."
"When it comes to Germany and France wanting to take over the leadership of the European Union together in matters of content - not for major declarations of a global political nature - then we are on your side."
"I must tell you that Mrs Koch-Mehrin was obviously not listening when you explained the reasons behind your position on China."
"That was a foreign affairs tutorial for this Parliament, and I can only encourage you to remain as consistent and undeviating as you have been in these matters."
"(FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, 10 nations produce 60% of the global carbon dioxide emissions."
"These 10 countries include only one European country - Germany."
"The 27 EU Member States represent only 14% of global emissions."
"The United States, 17%; Brazil, Russia, India and China have cumulative emissions that exceed one third of the global carbon dioxide emissions."
"All of this proves that European initiatives to combat climate change will continue to be in vain without comparable efforts from the Americans, the Chinese and the other industrialised nations."
"While awaiting such an agreement, Europe must fight against carbon leakage."
"Currently no large industrial group is making investments in Europe."
"ArcelorMittal is closing in France but investing in Brazil, Russia, Turkey, India and China."
"ThyssenKrupp is investing in Brazil; the Austrian Vöest Group is investing in India."
"In North Africa 10 factories are currently being built to produce floating glass for the European market."
"In the absence of a specific commitment from the other industrial States, Europe must show its determination to defend its industrial fabric, its industrial know-how."
"Imposing sacrifices on European citizens will not serve any purpose if the rest of the world does not follow suit."
"(Applause)"
"(FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, like the President of the European Parliament, like many other fellow Members, I am a child of the ruins of the Second World War, and I very much appreciate the dedication that you therefore put in your speech, which flouts scepticism."
"I see scepticism as something that belongs to the spirit of Munich, and it is the acid that dissolves the European will."
"That is why I very much appreciated the energy that you put into a speech which, as Mrs Lulling just said on television, for example, we found clear, precise, and, I can say without the least affectation, convincing."
"The second thing that I would like to say, Mr President, is that of course you are right and this has to be said here."
"The fears in Europe and the threats to it were certainly largely during its construction in the 1950s, but while the nature of these fears has changed, there are obviously still a great number of them today."
"That is why there needs to be an absolutely determined response."
"I am very happy with the priorities: I will say that frankly, because they are real, and in particular the immigration policy which will be conducted by your Minister, Mr Hortefeux, our former fellow Member."
"Two years ago I had the honour of representing the European Parliament at the Euro-African Conference in Rabat."
"For the first time it brought together the countries that had the same responsibilities, whether as countries of origin, transit, or reception of immigrants, and, as Mr Watson said a moment ago, I think that it is very important, especially - and why not? - through the structure of the Union for the Mediterranean, to have a generous policy of proximity and surveillance."
"Finally, one last thing, Mr President, do not forget that the reason that Europe has a unique influence throughout the world is because it is a cradle of culture; because it is culture that cements our differences; because culture is the platform for our political systems, and that is why we are viewed in a completely different way."
"Your energy will probably also be needed if there is to be determination in this field of culture too."
"(CS) Mr President, I should first of all like to show my appreciation for the fact that France has opened up its labour market to new Member States from 1 July and thus removed one of the last barriers between the old and new Member States."
"I only hope that Mrs Merkel will follow this example."
"France, the Czech Republic and Sweden have together prepared an 18-month presidency programme and I am pleased that this prioritises the issue of energy, which is absolutely key, and also the issue of reforming the common agricultural policy, because this relates to the financial framework after 2013 and thus to what money is going to be available to us in the future."
"I appreciate the fact that France wants to resolve these current issues and problems, because this is what worries and interests people."
"On institutional matters, I am speaking not as a member of the PPE, but as a member of the DE, so it is probably no surprise that we shall not be in complete agreement here."
"I believe that we cannot stand before the Lisbon Treaty like a rabbit caught in headlights."
"It is not the end of the world and we do not wish to create an atmosphere of crisis, so the situation must be resolved calmly, without any political pressure, without any legal tricks and in accordance with our own rules."
"These rules state that no treaty can enter into force without unanimous agreement and we do not have such agreement at present."
"I do not believe that it is impossible to expand further without the Lisbon Treaty."
"I believe that Croatia at least can be accepted into the European Union without the Lisbon Treaty."
"Similarly I do not believe that we have to make a choice between Nice or Lisbon."
"We certainly have several options and we must be able to look at them soberly and without hysteria and to resolve the situation."
"In any case, Mr President, I wish you great success in your leadership of the European Union."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have followed the Union for the Mediterranean initiative, on which next Sunday's summit in Paris will focus and we hope that the initiative is successful."
"I would like to clarify a few things, however."
"This initiative aims to reinforce the multilateral Euro-Mediterranean dimension."
"I believe this is right and that we should go in this direction."
"I think that if there is a policy that needs a critical appraisal, however, it is the neighbourhood with the southern countries, because the neighbourhood policy actually brings countries into competition with one another that are very divided."
"So we need to work on integration between these countries and between them and Europe, and channel resources into that as well."
"I will tell you this openly, President-in-Office of the Council, that we really did not appreciate - and I am saying this to President Barroso as well - your stopping funding for the Audiovisuel Méditerranée programme, which was the only cultural co-production instrument."
"You have said that there is a European cultural exception but I would add, Mr President, that there is a Euro-Mediterranean cultural exception."
"If you consider the world's top twenty intellectuals, in the top ten you will find many from the Muslim culture and a great many Euro-Mediterranean ones."
"So let us help one another to put in place effective policies to change the lives of many people in these countries, especially young people and women, who place hope in Europe."
"We do not need good students: we need to change the reality of this relationship and Parliament is very ready to cooperate with your Presidency if you intend to move in that direction."
"(ES) Mr President, the priorities of the French EU Presidency are realistic priorities that in my opinion are sufficiently capable of responding to what Mr Durão Barroso, the President of the Commission, was saying, to the criticisms that Europe is impotent and incapable of responding to the daily concerns of our citizens: the constitutional problem, food and energy prices, the Europe of defence, and immigration."
"Today, the death of an immigrant in a refrigerated lorry in the Channel Tunnel, or thrown overboard from a patera boat heading for the Canaries - as happened just a few hours ago - is one of the greatest contemporary tragedies."
"It is a serious and urgent problem and the European Union needs to come up with an adequate response."
"The Chairman of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Daul, spoke of the need to mobilise political will and I think that this Presidency has absolutely no shortage of political will."
"However, Mr President, political will is necessary, but not sufficient: circumstances also count, and even if they are passing, short-term or temporary, while they exist they affect us and place limitations on us, and I welcome the fact that President Sarkozy said that we need to convert circumstances into opportunities."
"I regret the fact that Mr Schulz is not here with us now, because when he talked about sport it brought to mind a particular circumstance."
"I would like the yellow jersey to be Spanish once again, as was the case in the first stage of the Tour de France."
"You are right, though, President-in-Office, that there does need to be a European dimension to sport, and several MEPs have asked me to pass a request on to you to consider whether it would be appropriate for the French sportsmen and women who are going to take part in the Olympic Games, which we have discussed here today, to wear an EU emblem next to the national flag, so that other Member States can voluntarily join in such an initiative."
"President-in-Office, we hope that the French Presidency will be capable of joining forces and forging consensuses so that, as you proposed, the European Union can move forward decisively under your Presidency."
"(FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, you wanted to place your Presidency under the aegis of the Europe that protects, and I think that there is indeed a very high expectation among European citizens."
"However, this is why there is a contradiction here - and you understood the key message from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament - with the fact that the social dimension of European integration has not been given the status of one of the four main priorities of your Presidency."
"Indeed, as we have seen in recent referendums, people are questioned regarding the institutions and the treaties, but in fact they respond on the basis of the progress of European integration, and finally on Europe's policies."
"I think that the imbalance that has been created in recent years between the progress of economic integration - which has been pursued and this is a good thing - and the stagnation of the social dimension, is also behind this disenchantment among the people of the Union, this disaffection towards the European institutions."
"This is why the problem is not saying that Europe should get involved with all social matters, but rather that as soon as there is a single market, including a single employment market, there need to be common rules for combating disparities, which otherwise lead to social dumping, and to ensure that convergence elements are focused upwards, towards the best, rather than dragging social situations downwards."
"The Commission has just published a social agenda, but if the Council does not commit to some concrete issues - you talked about a concrete Europe - to strengthen the powers of the European works committees, to protect temporary workers, to improve the Directive on the posting of workers so that - and this needs to be added - there is a Directive on the protection of public services and social services in the general interest, then there will not be a response to this need for protection."
"One of your priorities is the Europe of immigration, but the Europe of immigration cannot be reduced to a Europe of expulsions."
"This is why we need to add to this a pact for integration, which we talked about with Mr Hortefeux - and a pact for development."
"You have just come from the G8;"
"Europe and some of the Member States, including France, were accused of not fulfilling their commitments in terms of public aid for development."
"Ensure that during your Presidency this commitment of moving towards 0.7% of GDP is fulfilled, which will be more effective than the disgraceful 'return directive' in contributing towards managing international immigration more effectively."
"(PL) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I agree with the President-in-Office."
"This is a difficult moment for Europe."
"Each of us feels this personally, including me."
"When I was responsible for the negotiations on my country's accession to the European Union, I did everything I could to make sure that future European cooperation turned out well."
"I would also like to emphasise that today, happily, there is no problem with Polish support for the EU and for the Treaty."
"A considerable majority in the Polish Parliament voted in favour of the Treaty, and almost 80% of Poles are in favour of EU membership."
"I support the assessment by the President-in-Office."
"We must act for and on behalf of our citizens."
"The priority for us politicians is an energy and climate package, but we must do all we can to ensure that its implementation does not hit Europeans with high prices and loss of competitiveness for our economy."
"This package needs to be adopted pretty quickly, but it would be a bad thing if speed came first and deliberation second."
"Our package should be the proof of our leadership in the battle against global warming."
"I agree that we need this, first in Poznań and later in Copenhagen; but this package will not serve as an example to anyone."
"No-one will follow it if the European economy loses out in its implementation."
"I am therefore glad that you see these hazards, President-in-Office, and that you believe that the principles of emissions trading - because that is mainly what this is about - will be restructured in good faith."
"We do have experience."
"The REACH Regulation was amended significantly in Parliament with the involvement of the Council and the Commission, to the benefit of all."
"We can go down that same route."
"President-in-Office, may I congratulate you on taking up the reins in Europe."
"I wish you success in the two most important matters for the next six months: the Treaty, and the energy and climate package."
"(FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, you will have to take the bull of doubt regarding Lisbon by the horns;"
"France already has a great deal of experience in the art of sometimes moving European integration forwards and sometimes moving it backwards."
"I ask you to find a solution for the Irish, while respecting the will of the overwhelming majority of Europeans, which also counts."
"I would also like to say that, from a social point of view, in the Lisbon Treaty there is the Charter of Fundamental Rights, there is the European social model."
"So for example, more than a million signatures have already been collected from disabled Europeans, who represent one in four households and are in favour of the Treaty because it eliminates secular discrimination."
"You therefore have support behind you to move forward and to integrate the social model."
"Regarding immigration, you addressed the left, but you will also recognise that left-wing governments have had ideas that have enabled you to prepare a less closed and more progressive package, which I think Parliament can improve further, but we need to work relentlessly on this issue."
"Also, Mr President - and this is directly connected with immigration - you talked about the CAP, but you did not mention Doha; it is nevertheless important for the united Europe to be able to find a solution and respond to the Millennium Goals, because it is all the same package; it is about exploiting our economic capacity in order to move all of humanity forwards."
"(IT) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as Head of the Italian delegation of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I am pleased that you have taken over the helm of Europe and I am pleased at what you have said."
"You radiate enthusiasm and pride."
"You believe in and make people believe in an institution, Europe, which has many problems and really needs wise, enlightened and aware leaders, which is what you have shown yourself to be."
"Italy has always enjoyed strong cultural and social ties with France: two countries that have made major sacrifices to found and build Europe, which all its members now have the duty to develop."
"Anyone working in this institution knows how many difficulties may be encountered in moving forward with the process of development and integration, because this process has to be built between people of differing histories, cultures, social status and traditions."
"The politically opportunistic positions expressed just now by Mr Schulz about the present highly popular Italian Government certainly do not help."
"However, it is a process that must be moved forward despite the disappointments that it sometimes involves."
"The Lisbon Treaty, an excellent treaty, is on the back burner and it will require a lot of goodwill to bring it back, if we are avoid marginalising those who have not understood it."
"However, I do agree with what you said: before any further enlargement, we need to define new rules but without leaving Ireland out on a limb."
"The wave of immigration into Europe, especially into certain Member States, and mainly my own country and those in the Mediterranean area, must be regulated and viewed as a common problem rather than a reason to make distinctions or actually exploit the situation by penalising countries that are already making so many sacrifices."
"The people of our countries must be safeguarded and integration must be built on a reasonable basis."
"President-in-Office, the Italian Government and people are watching your mandate attentively and trustingly, in the certainty that the history and social standing that you represent today will inject hope and development into Europe."
"(HU) Three things - as the only speaker from the eastern side of the Berlin Wall."
"I am disappointed that equal opportunities were left out of the President's speech."
"Fortunately, President-in-Office, we women from the seven political parties have accurately described what we want in a letter: it's the flower, it's our flower for you, dear President."
"Firstly, I welcome the efforts of the French Presidency at European level in the interests of social equality between genders, but at the same time it seems contradictory that the local institutions dealing with equal opportunities are being closed down."
"Is policy other than what France is applying recommended at European level?"
"Two: the President has informed French citizens that 350 000 childcare places will be created over the next 5 years."
"This is an important measure, since it provides an equal opportunity for men and women in the labour market and an opportunity for them to combine their working and family lives."
"Good quality, affordability and accessibility for everyone are essential for this, since it is an instrument for equal opportunities and integration."
"On the subject of family life, does he feel that women will be capable of combing their working and family activities if they work 65 hours a week?"
"Women are more defenceless in the workplace and are generally not members of professional organisations."
"Yes, we need a common European immigration policy, but it must discuss the rights and obligations of citizens and immigrants."
"Migration policy must be supplemented with the integration policy of the reception nationality. Thank you very much."
"(EL) Mr President, I would like to address the President-in-Office of the Council to say: I was looking forward to your speech today with particular interest."
"Your position today has convinced me that you will make waves during the six months of your Presidency."
"The whole world is faced with one of the gravest economic crises in recent decades, but Europe is also facing its own crises."
"It is obvious that today the Europe of 27 cannot operate according to the rules of the Europe of 15."
"This is the institutional crisis that Europe is going through."
"It is also obvious that today some Member States do not want political unification for Europe, and do not want our predecessors' vision to be realised."
"This is a crisis of identity."
"The institutional crisis will be solved, but how can the identity crisis be solved?"
"I am afraid there is only one solution: the Member States that want political harmonisation should advance, and the Member States that see Europe only as an economic union should stay behind."
"Indeed, I am afraid that if we do not go ahead with this solution, Europe will at some point cease to be a player on the international chessboard."
"Crises can lead to great leaps forward, but only if the necessary courage is there."
"I believe you have both vision and courage."
"Be courageous!"
"(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your basic orientation has my full support."
"I believe you are the right President-in-Office at an extremely sensitive time, with the necessary sensitivity to people's concerns and the determination to lead and reconcile."
"When you were answering the questions, you did not pass the buck, and you called a spade a spade."
"You do not run away, but face up to things."
"I should particularly like to emphasise your strong commitment to parliamentary democracy."
"This commitment is particularly important in these times because, in several Member States - including my home country, Austria - we have been experiencing the playing off of direct democracy against parliamentary democracy and thus the incapacitation in European matters of parliaments in parliamentary democracies."
"Let us stand together for parliamentary democracy and against its incapacitation."
"(Applause)"
"It is also important to me that you have directly addressed the cowardice or, it could be said, the double standards, of many governments and members of governments in relation to their shared European responsibilities, as these double standards are one of the main causes of the lack of trust and mutual finger-pointing to which we must put a stop."
"We do not require everyone to be bolder, but we do require everyone to be honest and principled."
"I should like to touch on three more issues."
"The first is your position on the Treaty."
"You are not like a rabbit caught in the headlights, you are not waiting for Ireland, but are continuing the ratification process whilst approaching Ireland."
"I firmly believe that we shall come to an arrangement with Ireland only after all the other 26 Member States have ratified the Treaty."
"However, we must not leave Croatia out on its own."
"I welcome your commitment to opening all the chapters by the end of the year."
"We also need a timetable for Macedonia."
"I would ask the Council to also take a decision on the Small Business Act at its December Summit, as the main competences lie with the Member States."
"We need legal binding and not just another public political statement."
"(PL) Mr President, I have some good news from Poland."
"Today, Mr President, a debate is being held in the Polish Parliament that will culminate in a resolution urging the Polish President to fulfil his constitutional duty and sign the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This is the will of the Polish people, 80% of whom support the European Union and are very happy to be a member."
"Show me another state in which support for the EU is so high."
"This is a signal that Poland will discharge its obligations with regard to the Treaty."
"On another subject: I have a request for you, Mr President."
"Could you see your way to putting the situation of children in the European Union on the agenda and appointing an ombudsman, an attorney for children's affairs, on the model of the European Human Rights Ombudsman?"
"We would like the Council to come to an agreement and accept this institution that Europe is so in need of."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if I were to summarise this morning's debate, I would say that it is good that France holds the Presidency at this time, and good that you, President Sarkozy, occupy the position of President-in-Office of the Council."
"This has been a good day for Europe and for this Parliament, as for the first time in a long time we again have before us somebody who speaks for Europe with passion, not just with good arguments."
"Perhaps that is just what we need to win over the Irish and to win back our citizens: passion and good judgement, and good judgement includes Europe confining itself to certain limits."
"I should like to give you the 'secret of success': we need not only the Treaty in Ireland, but also a new culture of subsidiarity."
"We need boundaries for Europe in relation to the rest of the world, but we also need boundaries within Europe."
"A new culture of subsidiarity will bring renewed approval to Europe;"
"I am in total agreement with President Barroso on that."
"Good luck, President Sarkozy."
"Mr President, I welcome President Sarkozy to the European Parliament."
"I certainly appreciated his considered and well-argued contribution."
"As an Irish member I will also welcome him when he visits Ireland as President of the EU, as a President who is taking practical steps to improve the lives of citizens."
"That was clear from his priorities."
"I also appreciate his comments on food security and about finding a balance when imposing regulations and restrictions on our own businesses and farmers."
"As he said himself, protecting without protectionism."
"I could hear in his presentation and in his voice his commitment to Europe."
"I and very many Irish people share that commitment."
"He spoke about overcoming our difficulties. That will take time and a willingness to compromise on all sides."
"There can be no deadlines."
"As somebody who canvassed for a 'yes' vote, I know he will agree with me when I say that an Irish 'no' is just as legitimate as a French, Dutch or Danish 'no'."
"It must be given the same respect, then we can move forward."
"We can make progress."
"I look forward to that, and I wish him well in his presidency."
"(FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, the French Presidency has just set out its objectives, and I wish it success."
"The ultimate objective that is before you is to strengthen the European Union and its power to act."
"With this in mind, the non-ratification of the Lisbon Treaty would be a missed opportunity."
"Europe needs France, especially at this difficult time; it needs the France that was converted, with you, President Sarkozy, after the French referendum."
"It is not Poland, unfortunately, that is taking Europe forward today, but one day it will be, and I believe it will be soon."
"I hope for you that the French Presidency, with its policies of European integration, of desired immigration, of enlargement to the Balkans, and not necessarily to Turkey, will give Europeans back their confidence in and their taste for Europe."
"Mr President, it took Ireland 700 years to get the British out of the Republic of Ireland and I have to sit here time and again listening to people we threw out telling us what we should be doing in Ireland."
"I think it is a little bit too much."
"Please let a decision in the Republic of Ireland be made by the people of the Republic of Ireland."
"Secondly, I should like to say to the President of the French Republic: if you want to change the people of Ireland's opinion, bring Mr Le Pen with you."
"I was director of elections for Fine Gael, which is part of the European People's Party, for four European referendums: the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty, the Amsterdam Treaty and the Lisbon Treaty, and I want to say to you that the Lisbon Treaty was lost for a variety of reasons."
"People did not understand it; the Government has been in power since 1994; politicians are appearing at tribunals of enquiry; the main government and opposition parties - the political establishment - wanted it passed."
"There were fears concerning defence and conscription, abortion and euthanasia - accompanied by syringes circulated by Members of this House - taxation, jobs, immigration."
"Much of this was led by the extremes on the right and on the left."
"I would just say this to the President-in-Office. Please prepare for your visit to Ireland."
"If it is important that you help change the situation in Ireland, please come prepared and come prepared to listen."
"You will be very welcome, but it is complex and it will take some time to resolve what is a difficult situation."
"(FR) Mr President, Europeans are placing a great deal of hope in the French Presidency, and this hope needs to be well managed."
"The Presidency needs to avoid fuelling both unrealistic dreams and unreasonable fears, including in the neighbouring and candidate countries."
"With regard to the Lisbon Treaty, there is not enough diplomatic encouragement for ratification."
"The Presidency needs to help to draw up an exit or safeguarding strategy in case things go wrong."
"In order to avoid the worst, we need to show from the outset that we are prepared to face the worst."
"I would like to conclude with a few words on the dangerous phenomenon of the re-nationalisation of Europe."
"National-populism is the most alarming expression of this phenomenon, and is also behind the propaganda in favour of the Irish 'no', the racist xenophobia in Italy, but also the rhetoric on the national nature of social policies."
"Either Europe will be social or it will collapse."
"I hope that the French Presidency will be sensitive to this side of things."
"I am sorry, but I cannot take any more speakers."
"We have already gone well over time."
"I am very grateful to President Sarkozy and of course also to President Barroso for giving us their time today."
"Therefore I should like to finish by giving the floor first to President Barroso and then to President Sarkozy."
"Mr President, I will start by very briefly echoing the congratulations expressed by the vast majority of MEPs who have taken the floor: congratulations on the conviction, enthusiasm, energy and political will that President Sarkozy has expressed here today, which I am sure he and his ministers and colleagues will demonstrate throughout the French Presidency."
"I would like to say that this is not at all a surprise to me."
"I was entirely convinced that it was very good news that France was to take on the responsibility of the Presidency of the Council during this particularly difficult period."
"Of course, President Sarkozy and all of us would have preferred the horizon to be clearer from an institutional point of view, but I think that it is precisely during these difficult times that we can see the political capacity and measure the full importance of a strong political will."
"I am in favour of this democratic political debate."
"I have said many times that we need to acknowledge politically the differences and multiple points of view that exist, for example here in Parliament."
"We need to know how to express these differences because Europe is different from a national political system."
"In our democratic national systems, each time that there is a political discussion, even sometimes one that is very polarised, we do not call into question the very legitimacy of the State, while very often in Europe when those of us who are for Europe strongly express these objections, we have to confront those who are against Europe and who explore all sorts of populisms in order to damage our institutions and compromise this great project of peace and solidarity that is the European project."
"(Applause)"
"This is why we really need to be able to express all these points of view, but while strengthening the pro-Europe camp during this particularly difficult time."
"Let us be clear, we have the European elections in June 2009."
"If the different European political forces and European institutions do not work hand in hand with a constructive position, we will be giving arguments to those who, at the extremes, want to exploit populism, xenophobia and nationalism by establishing a connection between nationalism and homeland, which is an error."
"Moreover, I often quote a great French author, who said that 'Patriotism is love for one's own people; nationalism is hatred of others.'"
"We can love our homeland and, at the same time, defend our European project with conviction, as President Sarkozy said just now."
"I therefore hope that the debate that takes place over the next six months will strengthen the European institutions as well as our project for the Europe of the future."
"I am keen to answer a specific question."
"It is the only specific question that I was asked, and I will of course leave the rest to President Sarkozy, who is in a much better position than me to deal with them."
"This specific question was from Mrs Napolitano regarding the Euromed cultural programme."
"I am keen to inform you that the current programme, the Euromed cultural programme, still has an allocation of EUR 15 million for this year."
"For 2009-2010 it is true that nothing has been decided yet, but there is a great deal of pressure on external expenditure, and in these cases, what happens, quite frankly, is that the third countries concerned tend to prioritise bilateral cooperation to the detriment of regional budgets."
"It is therefore an issue that should be discussed with the Euromed countries."
"Indeed, one of the interesting aspects of France's initiative aimed at creating a Union for the Mediterranean - which, for that matter, I supported from the very start - is that it brings a stronger element of regional cooperation."
"Sometimes I am asked what the Union for the Mediterranean adds to the Barcelona process."
"It is, of course, an element of greater political appropriation, and is also political upgrading, in particular thanks to the biennial summit; but it is also the dimension brought by specific regional projects and, now I also hope, by very specific projects to which we will be able to add a stronger private sector dimension, as we still need more resources."
"So this is the specific area in which we are working and, to conclude, I would just like to say: 'Good luck France, and good luck my dear friend President Sarkozy!'."
"(Applause)"
"I would like to thank President Barroso and Vice-President Jacques Barrot for being here for 3 hours without interruption."
"Mr President, I would first like to say that I think it is natural, when one has the honour of being the President-in-Office of the Council, to be before Parliament for as many hours as Parliament wishes, not only on the first day of the Presidency, but rather I will say to you, President of the European Parliament, as well as to each of the group chairmen and to the Conference of Presidents, if you want me to come at particular times during the Presidency, I am at Parliament's disposal."
"You have to play the game of the European institutions."
"The European Parliament is at the heart of parliamentary democracy."
"It is not a question of availability; it is a question of priority."
"The Presidency needs the European Parliament and is therefore at its disposal."
"(Applause)"
"If the speakers will excuse me, I would like to say a few words to each of them."
"First of all I would like to say to Mr Bushill-Matthews that I am among those who think that Europe needs the United Kingdom."
"I have never been one of those Europeans or French people who thought that we should be wary of our British friends."
"The United Kingdom can bring much more than it believes it can to Europe."
"The United Kingdom is the gateway to the Anglo-Saxon world, it represents the leading world language and it is economically dynamic, as has been shown in recent years."
"I would like to say to our British Conservative friends, 'believe that Europe needs you, that you have a place there, and that if the British have one foot in and one foot out, Europe will be weakened'."
"The United Kingdom is a great nation."
"It has nothing to fear from Europe, and Europe has a great deal to expect from the United Kingdom."
"To Mr Poignant, who saw deep inside me and therefore understood that I loved politics and that Parliament was a little like my garden, I would like to say that yes, Parliament is the place for democracy, and I do not respect or understand those political leaders who would not be happy to express and defend their ideas in the cradle of parliamentary democracy."
"I hope that in your remark there was an element of regret, rather than an excessive view of the harmonisation of the employment market."
"The same also applies to Mr Désir; I am entirely with you, I am against complete harmonisation because the people would reject it."
"However, having minimum rules in the context of an employment market, in the context of a single economic market, is perfectly natural."
"Let us all be aware of the difficulties."
"Take Austria, for example, which is led by a socialist Prime Minister and Government; they will tell you that the retirement age is 65, and that the contribution period is 45 years."
"You are aware of how many difficulties I encountered in bringing the contribution period to 40 years, and I did not immediately gain the support of the French Socialist Party."
"So explain to me how it is, when I encountered so many difficulties in securing a 40-year contribution period in France, I only need to be President of Europe for six months to preferably achieve between the 45 years of contributions in Austria and the 40 years in France."
"How can that be done?"
"It is a long way from the dream to the reality, but this is perhaps the difference between the French Socialist Party and the European Socialist Party."
"At times I even feel closer to the European Socialist Party than to the French Socialist Party; I confess my fault and of course apologise for it."
"(Off-microphone intervention from Mr Schulz)"
"It does not work that way."
"It is not up to you to decide who speaks."
"Speaking time cannot be split between the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the President-in-Office of the Council."
"President Sarkozy, are you willing to allow a question from Mr Schulz?"
"If so, I shall give him the floor."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, yes, provided that I do not get caught in the crossfire of an all-German debate."
"(DE) Thank you very much, Mr President, you are most kind."
"President Sarkozy, it is nice that you want to draw closer to socialism in this way."
"Having strongly supported the positions of the German Social Democrats in your speech just now and thus distanced yourself from Chancellor Merkel, I propose that you proceed as follows. If you feel so comfortable within the European social democratic fold, come first to German social democracy and we shall take you gradually closer to French social democracy and, by the end, you will be a really good comrade."
"Mr Schulz, this has less to do with kindness and more to do with observing proper procedure - something we in Europe wish to do, after all."
"Mr President, you will notice that I already have a socialist on my right, but there is a space for a socialist on my left."
"(Applause)"
"As you know, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think that we are wasting time because I think that democracy at European level can be free of the violence that it sometimes has at national level."
"The European level enables everyone to step back a little from the electoral routine, which is brutal, often unfair and always difficult."
"Finally, the fact that in a forum such as yours we can talk while smiling and respecting each other is perhaps also something that will encourage people to warm to the European ideal and make it their own."
"In any case I do not see this as wasted time, and I would like Mr Poignant and Mr Schulz to be certain of this."
"Mrs De Sarnez is quite right."
"We need to change our development policy, making food agriculture a priority."
"It is entirely essential; the African countries need to have the resources to become self-sufficient in terms of food, and undoubtedly part of the money that we have dedicated to developing large infrastructures needs to be invested in agricultural micro-projects."
"This is a point on which I fully share your opinion."
"You also called on me to defend a vision of Europe."
"I share this ambition."
"I hope that you will be generous enough to advise me on the content of that vision."
"You are perfectly aware that, again, between the somewhat disembodied big ideal and all of the technical issues of daily life, the problem for each of us is having to constantly decide on what to do about the big ideas that sometimes go far beyond the day-to-day difficulties experienced by our citizens, and what to do about resolving the technical issues that affect their daily lives."
"It is not that simple, but I will try my hand at it in any case."
"To answer you, Mr Crowley, yes we do need development in order to avoid illegal immigration."
"Moreover, everyone is aware that the best response to the immigration issue is development."
"There are 475 million young Africans who are under the age of 17, and there are 12 km of the Strait of Gibraltar between Europe and Africa."
"Africa's disasters will be Europe's disasters, and there are no barriers or borders that can resist that."
"We therefore do indeed need a development policy."
"Again it is very difficult to decide between multilateralism and bilateralism."
"This is a significant subject and I intend to devote a great deal of attention to it."
"Mr Irujo talked about linguistic diversity."
"I am entirely in agreement, including - and I understand that you do not like the expression 'regional language' - with regard to official languages."
"I am among those, you see, who think that we would be helping all the pro-autonomy or independence movements by giving them the monopoly on defending regional languages, and this would be a very serious error."
"I am talking about Corsica, in the French Republic, where there are people who are Corsican, who love Corsica, and who speak Corsican in their villages; but that is no threat to national unity."
"Therefore, linguistic diversity is, in my eyes, just as important as cultural diversity, and in any case there will be no cultural diversity if there is only one language."
"Mr Farage, I very much liked your speech, but I am going to say one thing to you: the British were quite happy for me to close Sangatte, because it was in fact me who closed Sangatte, and it was you who asked me to."
"Even if you are a British person who loves his country, you cannot resolve all its immigration problems, and I have to tell you that France does not intend to be the United Kingdom's border guard."
"Allow me to say that it is all very well to say, 'in my country I do not want identity cards and I do not want a common immigration policy', but this does not stop you from being quite happy for foreigners whose papers are not in order to be stopped in France so that you do not have them in the United Kingdom."
"Just like France, the United Kingdom cannot manage alone."
"I would like to add, Mr Farage, that I respect the Polish, but you were not in my office negotiating the Lisbon Treaty with a number of colleagues."
"We were in Brussels, and who was in my office?"
"Not Prime Minister Tusk, because the Prime Minister at that time was Mr Kaczynski's brother."
"There was President Kaczynski and I will say one thing: he is a man that I trust and he is a man that I respect."
"However, in Europe, when you sign something, if you start by not respecting it, there is no more Europe, there is nothing at all, there are no negotiations."
"When one of us commits his country, in Brussels, he must make a commitment at home as well."
"I said that, nothing more, nothing less."
"(Applause)"
"This is completely respectful of the Polish: Mr Farage, I think that I defended Poland."
"President Barroso will be able to say this better than anyone."
"We need Poland, but we also need to have respect for a man's word when it is given."
"Mrs Sudre, thank you for your support."
"I entirely agree with your analysis and sincerely thank you for it."
"Mr Rasmussen, who I understood was Rasmussen I, and I am just about clear who Rasmussen II is, I would like to say that Denmark is a good example of a country that has been able to move forward, and that enables me to respond to all the speakers on the Irish issue."
"Of course we should not force the hands of the Irish and we need to respect them, but we need to have the courage to say to our Irish friends: 'You also need to respect the other countries that have ratified the Treaty."
"We are not lecturing you, but consider that others also have an opinion to offer and that at some point we will have to find a common path."
"Europe does not want to continue without you, but Europe cannot come to a halt just because of you.'"
"I say this with all the respect I have for a country that has voted 'no'."
"We, the French, have caused you considerable problems and difficulties, but at some point we need to get out of this situation in which everyone is watching each other and waiting for someone else to take the initiative."
"The French Presidency, along with the Presidency of the Commission and the Presidency of the European Parliament need to take the initiative."
"After that, some will say yes and some will say no."
"Personally, I think that there is a solution, but it is certainly not in maintaining the status quo or in saying 'we will wait and let time do the work'."
"Personally I think that time works against us, that Europe has been waiting for years and that there is no point in it waiting any longer."
"We will find a solution;"
"I am convinced, just as the Danish found one."
"Mrs Mehrin, I was very touched by your assessment of me as a 'ladies' man'."
"I will leave the content with you;"
"I honestly do not know exactly what it means and I will be careful not to go down that road as I would not like you to misunderstand me."
"I know that the multi-speed Europe does exist."
"We are not all in the euro, and we are not all in Schengen."
"However, ultimately, before we build a multi-speed institutional Europe, I would like us to try to do it all together."
"Do not criticise the Presidency for having the ambition to take everyone along because, if before we have even started, Madam, we say, 'In any case, it does not matter, let us leave it', then one day we are negotiating a social exception for the British, the next we are negotiating an institutional exception for the Irish, and the next we will be negotiating an exception for the Polish."
"At that point I fear that we will get to a situation in which all the countries will, quite rightly, ask for an exception, and where will the European Union be then?"
"Where will the project be that the founding fathers baptised?"
"This is what I am saying."
"Perhaps we will have to get to that point, but I would like us to get there after we have tried to take the whole family along together."
"I would also like to say to those who are concerned about Croatia that I am of course in favour of us continuing the negotiations, and I think that it would be a serious mistake to close Europe's door to the Balkans, because the Balkans need the peace and democracy that the Union can bring them, but I will not go back to the Lisbon debate."
"I would like to say to Mr Bielan that I do not wish to threaten Ireland; besides, I would not be able to do so and it would not even occur to me to do so."
"I will go there and listen but, at the same time, everyone needs to understand that in the polls 80% of the people say that they are pro-Europe; we can nevertheless work with them without threatening them."
"VAT on fuel is a French proposal;"
"I do not want to impose it on anyone."
"I would simply like to draw your attention to the fact that I am convinced that the price of oil is going to continue to rise."
"We need to have the courage to say this to our fellow citizens."
"There is 3% less oil production each year due to stocks being exhausted, and 2 to 3% more oil consumption, due to the growth of emerging countries."
"My thought is simply that VAT is a tax that is proportional to price."
"If tomorrow oil is 175 dollars per barrel, will we be able to continue, without saying anything, to collect 20% tax on rocketing oil prices?"
"This is the question that I want to ask."
"Along with the Presidency of the Commission, we will report on this in October."
"I will try to push it in the direction of my convictions, and we will see what the result is."
"Regarding Ukraine, there will be a summit, and we will move things forward."
"We need to encourage Ukraine along the road to democracy and we need to bring it closer to the European Union."
"Ukraine is not insignificant, it has 42 million inhabitants."
"This is not a small decision."
"For now we are at the point of association, but anyone who walks through the streets of Kiev can see that it is a European capital."
"Mr Langen, I would like to thank you for your compliments, which really touched me."
"I rather liked the reference to Tony Blair."
"I do not know if this is the reason that you made the reference, but I think that Tony Blair is one of the statesmen who have done a great deal for Europe, and a great deal for his country, and frankly I do not know if he would mind me saying this, but in many areas I find that he has restored credit and strength to the British political debate and to the European political debate."
"I think that in Europe, we need leaders and that in his time Tony Blair was indisputably one of those leaders."
"This is going to mark me out as being more towards the left, even though I have observed that compliments are not always forthcoming for Mr Blair from that side of the political spectrum."
"Yes, Mr Goebbels, others do need to make an effort, and this is entirely the issue that will be raised in the negotiations on climate change, but Europe needs to set an example."
"I am not naïve in saying that."
"I think that we have more credibility when we practise what we preach."
"Some might say that it is better to wait."
"Personally I think that we need to take the risk of acting."
"Fundamentally, Mr Goebbels, my political philosophy is that nothing is worse than inaction."
"The worst risk is to take no risks."
"Mr Cavada, you are quite right, we need to respond to these fears."
"Thank you for your support."
"Regarding the Union for the Mediterranean, I would like to say that in my mind, following on from President Barroso, there is no criticism of the Barcelona Process."
"I would nevertheless like to say one thing."
"Barcelona was a very good idea, but there was one problem at the Barcelona Summit."
"As far as I remember, there was just one Arab head of state, Prime Minister Abu Mazen."
"How do you think we can create a Union for the Mediterranean, bringing the northern and southern shores closer together, if the southern shore does not come?"
"At the Paris Summit, I believe, although Bernard Kouchner may correct me later, that all of the Arab heads of state will be present."
"This may be a minor difference, but to me it is fundamental."
"I would also like to say to Mr Zahradil that it is not a question of creating a crisis regarding Lisbon, but we should also not act as if nothing is happening."
"We should not dramatise, but at the same time it is nevertheless worrying that the last three referendums in the European Union ended in a no vote, which was certainly for other reasons, but the fact remains that at the very least it is not a particularly encouraging sign."
"I will not respond to Mrs Napoletano as President Barroso gave you a good answer."
"Mr Sánchez-Neyra, yes there does need to be a European dimension to sport and I think that it could only be beneficial if the statistics for the Olympic Games were counted nation by nation, but if there were a specific column for European medals."
"This would be a way of showing that we also exist in the Europe of sport."
"Mr Désir, I answered you regarding standards in the labour market."
"Regarding social policy, we have a famous debate."
"The 35-hour week is not enough to win the elections, or to have a genuine social policy."
"I would like to add that the reason why I took so much trouble in overcoming the automatic, rigid code of the 35-hour week in France was precisely in the name of European harmonisation, because no other country had followed you along that path."
"None."
"Not a single one."
"Including the European socialist governments."
"Therefore, you see, I am quite happy for us to call for social harmonisation, but I would like to say to our French socialist friends that social harmonisation involves not advocating ideas in France that no one else is advocating in Europe, because that is an exception and our country is suffering as a result."
"I would like to thank Mr Buzek for Poland's European commitment."
"I have never ever doubted Poland's European commitment."
"Poland is one of the six most populated countries in Europe, and this is precisely why I say to President Kaczynski that we need his signature, because Poland is not just any European country."
"It is extremely important, it is a symbol, and naturally we need to reduce the institutional crisis solely to the issue of Ireland."
"Mr Barón Crespo, Doha, yes I said it to President Barroso, I said it to Gordon Brown, but in short, Doha, but not at any price."
"I would like to defend two ideas that are close to my heart."
"First of all, I am told that if there is no agreement, there will be no growth."
"Excuse me, but there has not been an agreement for seven years, and for six years the world has undergone unprecedented growth."
"The WTO agreement is preferable to having no agreement, but it should not be said that without an agreement there can be no growth."
"For six years we have had growth."
"Secondly, what President Barroso, the Canadian Prime Minister and even Angela Merkel are currently saying is that it is not good enough."
"Brazil is not making any effort regarding lowering tariff barriers in the industry; there is no effort on services."
"Also, what can be said about the closure of the Chinese market?"
"There is no French exception from this point of view."
"Firstly, as President-in-Office of the Council, I must loyally defend the Union's position."
"However, in terms of the Union's position, I have not heard anyone, even the British Government, saying that the agreement should be signed at the current stage of the negotiations."
"We are therefore unanimous in Europe, even if it is not for the same reasons, in saying that as things stand, it is not good enough; that Europe has made all the effort and it cannot continue to make efforts if the other big regions of the world are not committed to moving forward."
"From this point of view, I think that we are all in agreement."
"I would like to say to Mr Zappalà that I thank him for his support for the European immigration policy, and to Mrs Gurmai that I think that equality between men and women is very important, but I do not know whether her remark was addressed to me as well."
"In any case, the fact that she is Hungarian is already an undeniable asset."
"I would like to say to Mr Varvitsiotis that I am perfectly aware that there is a European identity crisis, and perhaps also that the European Parliament could help all the institutions with this issue."
"Why not imagine that there is a real debate, President Pöttering, on what European identity is?"
"This subject of European identity is a subject for European parliamentary debate, rather than a matter for a head of state or government."
"Perhaps the European Parliament could even organise debates on this subject, and in that case we will come and give our opinion."
"Personally I think it is more the role of Parliament to define European identity rather than the role of governments, who naturally deal with daily administration in each of their countries."
"If there is indeed a place where European identity should be defined, I think, and I hope that President Barroso will agree, it is not in the European Council, or the Commission, but first of all in the European Parliament."
"I would like to respond to Mr Karas, who said that I need to demonstrate diplomacy."
"Yes, understood, I will try to be diplomatic."
"I hope that on his part he was not questioning whether my temperament would prevent me from being diplomatic."
"It is not simply a question of being weak yet clever, or being dynamic yet clumsy."
"Perhaps it is even possible to be both dynamic and skilful but, in any event, thank you for giving me the opportunity to demonstrate this."
"(Loud applause)"
"Many thanks, President Sarkozy."
"I have been a Member of the European Parliament for 29 years, and I cannot remember a time when a President-in-Office of the Council spent three-and-a-half hours in discussion with us and responded to every speech."
"We look forward to your next visit."
"That concludes this item."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (RO) I believe that France has taken over the European Union Presidency at a crucial moment, when Europe is in search of adequate answers to the numerous challenges of a strategic nature."
"France has the task of ensuring the continuity of the Lisbon Treaty ratification process, of focusing on the energy field and of consolidating the European Union's security and defence policy."
"I express my support for these priorities of the French presidency and I hope their implementation will be a success."
"As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Rapporteur on the Black Sea cooperation, I would like to focus on an important aspect to be promoted in the EU foreign policy."
"I welcome the initiative of France to consolidate the European Neighbourhood Policy, but I insist on the fact that its Eastern dimension should receive the same attention and involvement as the Mediterranean dimension."
"This objective should apply both to bilateral relations, in the context of negotiations on the EU future contractual relations, and to multilateral relations, within the Black Sea Synergy."
"Finally, France will take over the EU presidency during the Year of Intercultural Dialogue and it should successfully continue the actions in this field."
"I would first of all like to welcome the European commitment of the President-in-Office of the Council, Nicolas Sarkozy, and his vision concerning the current challenges facing the Union."
"I support the political statement that new institutions based on the Lisbon Treaty are essential, and without them it would be irresponsible to envisage further accessions."
"The Europe of results must take into account the expectations of citizens and show itself to be a solution, not a problem."
"I support the idea of having a mechanism at the borders that will enable fair and non-distorted competition, taking into account the impact of the environmental measures associated with the issues of energy and climate."
"The priority of a European legal immigration policy is also a human, economic and social necessity."
"I would like to congratulate Brice Hortefeux on his excellent work on the European immigration pact."
"Regarding European defence, the President's bold positions will enable us to move forward on this difficult issue, particularly by involving soldiers from all the populations, and supporting the emergence of a European arms industry."
"The President is right to defend the CAP, which has never been more necessary."
"Finally, I would like to stress the need for better political dialogue with the ECB, in order to have European economic governance that is in line with current global demands."
"Thank you, Mr President. I would like to offer President Sarkozy my best wishes for his work as he takes charge of the Council's fate for six months."
"Unfortunately clouds are gathering over the EU's future: the paradoxical Irish vote (Ireland having become the 'Celtic Tiger' that we know thanks to EU funds), the government crisis in Austria, the statements of the Polish President, are all worrying signs."
"We must find the strength and skill to relaunch a European path that must revive the enthusiasm and emotion of citizens, who still perceive the EU as something distant and rather abstruse."
"I also take this opportunity to offer a provocation to the President-in-Office: to bring citizens closer to the EU, concrete signals must be sent out."
"It would be excellent if the French President could start a serious debate on sorting out the issue of Parliament's two seats: let us concentrate all activities in Brussels and avoid the monthly move to Strasbourg (where the site could be used for other purposes, such as the centre of technological excellence): this 'trip' actually represents a huge and unjustified waste of financial and energy resources."
"The French Presidency has set the right priorities, for example the climate, immigration and defence, but I should like to focus on one aspect that receives less attention but is nevertheless extremely important for our young people and the whole sports sector in Europe."
"The French Presidency supports the 'six-plus-five' rule in sport: a restriction on the number of foreign players."
"The objectives are good: obliging clubs to invest more in their own youth training and thus also going some way towards restoring the competitive balance."
"This Parliament agrees with this one hundred per cent."
"Hence our support for the 'home-grown' rule, which - albeit more modestly - has the same objectives in mind."
"The question is whether the six-plus-five rule is feasible at European level."
"It conflicts with the free movement of workers and can only be applied if a derogation is made from the EU Treaty, and we are a long way from this course of action."
"It is doubtful whether the Court of Justice would ever accept such a thing, even in the light of the new article on sport in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We in Parliament want to join in the search for a solution that benefits European football."
"We are simply calling for a solid solution, one that does not plunge football into chaos."
"Nobody needs a Bosman Mark 2."
"President Sarkozy spent roughly a third of his speech defending the Lisbon Treaty and on continuing pressurisation and blackmail of Ireland, forgetting what the very rules of the European Union say on the entry into force of a new Treaty - ratification by all Member States."
"Well, if a majority of the Irish people rejected it then the Treaty is dead in the water."
"Ratifications should not continue."
"Insisting on ratification of the Treaty is an anti-democratic attitude."
"Another priority is deepening immigration policy, where the return directive, otherwise known as the shameful directive, stands out due to its disregard of fundamental human rights and its treatment of illegal immigrants as criminals and not as people who have fled hunger in their countries, looking for a better future for themselves and their families."
"The social area was totally overlooked."
"He is aware of the opposition that exists to the proposal to amend the working time directive and the proposals that the Council approved and sent to the European Parliament, aimed at weakening labour rights, opening the door to a longer average working week of up to 60 or 65 hours, deregulation of employment and lower wages."
"in writing. - (PL) I would like to express the hope that the six months of the French Presidency will be marked by fruitful, effective work for the good of all citizens of a united Europe."
"I should like at this juncture to stress the considerable significance of agriculture for the European Community."
"In Poland, for example, in 2005 over 17% of employed people were working in agriculture."
"The agricultural issue is of indirect importance to Member States - here I am chiefly thinking of the problem of food security in the context of rising food product prices on the world markets."
"I hope that the French Presidency will bring a solution to several disputed questions relating to the European agricultural model."
"Europe does not have such a good climate or agrarian conditions to be able to give up support for its farmers altogether."
"The cost of producing meat, milk or cereals will always be higher on our continent than in South America, the United States or Australia."
"We need to bear in mind that these countries too support their farmers."
"My view is that higher agricultural product prices are creating a development opportunity for European agriculture."
"There is a danger, though, that the additional income will be intercepted by intermediate agencies; in other words, a rise in food prices causes a disproportionate rise in the cost of the agricultural production method."
"The result is that the surplus income is absorbed by intermediate agencies."
"Agriculture continues to be an important economic sector."
"The conditions under which it currently functions have changed, but the main priorities - ensuring a decent level of income for farmers and food security - are still there."
"After Sarkozy pulled the wool over his people's eyes, stating that he would respect the will expressed in the referendum carried out in 2005 - which rejected the 'European Constitution'-, at the same time as pushing ahead with the 'mini-Treaty', which basically rehashed the content of the rejected Treaty, presenting it in another form and avoiding a further referendum, he now finds himself in charge of the process kick-started by Angela Merkel, that is to say, to attempt once more to impose the federalist, neoliberal, militarist Treaty that has already been rejected three times."
"Given the deepening crisis of capitalism, big business and the EU's major powers, especially France and Germany, are showing the 'way out' by forging ahead with federalist, neoliberal and militarist policies and this draft Treaty, seeking to consolidate the foundations of a 'super-State' to reinforce imperialist intervention mechanisms working in close collaboration with the USA and NATO."
"To do so, pressure and blackmail are being piled on (enlargement, the two-speed EU, etc.)."
"Deaf, dumb and blind to the will expressed by the Irish people, the EU is conspiring for the latter to hold another referendum in 2009 even before the EP elections."
"in writing. - (HU) One of the most important tasks of the French Presidency will be coordinating the climate change obligations of the Member States."
"It is very important that we reduce the emission of greenhouse gases at Union level."
"This can happen if we take the Kyoto Protocol seriously, and reduce emissions continuously and significantly in comparison with the 1990 base year, in accordance with its provisions."
"It would certainly be scandalous if the Member States that did not reduce but rather increased their emissions between 1990 and 2005 now received a reward from the European Union and continued to keep the advantage they have that is contradictory to the Kyoto Protocol."
"It would be even more outrageous if the Member States that take the Kyoto Protocol seriously and reduce their emissions honestly - including Hungary - were punished with more restrictions."
"I hope that the French Presidency will never accept such mockery of the Kyoto Protocol and negative discrimination against the new Member States, including my homeland."
"in writing. - (PL) I would like to thank the French President for a speech that raises many of the EU's fundamental problems."
"It is true that we must consider how to get Europe out of its crisis."
"It is little consolation that virtually the whole world finds itself in a situation that is close to critical."
"This has a significant economic and social dimension."
"I am talking about the threat of hunger in many regions of the world, since food prices are rising steeply, about energy security and also about the status of the environment."
"The world's financial system is becoming increasingly unstable."
"Why am I placing emphasis on this?"
"Because it is not for us to be self-righteous."
"The almost 500 million citizens of the EU currently constitute less than 8% of the world's population, and in 40 years' time this proportion will be barely at the election threshold - 5%."
"Our European view must therefore not overlook values of a higher order linked to the maintenance of Euro-Atlantic civilisation."
"This also has an ethical dimension."
"In each country of the EU, then, we need due care for the family, which, while being a tiny community, is at the same time the cornerstone of the whole European Community."
"We should not let this slip from our view."
"If we do, we shall lose touch, as we are doing now, by abusing the word 'marriage' in applying it to unions that are not marriage."
"It is true that we need new legal frameworks, but they must be ones that people can understand."
"EU citizens are the subject of actions taken by Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"We are merely carrying out a service."
"It is precisely in this light that we view the case of Ireland."
"in writing. - (PL) As generally anticipated, one of the priorities of the French Presidency has become the issue of ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Unexpectedly for most observers, though, the principal character at the start of the French Presidency is Poland or, to be precise, not so much Poland as the Polish President, Lech Kaczyński."
"I do not understand the arguments deployed by the President of Poland in declining to sign the ratification documents for the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The Treaty was ratified by the Sejm and by the Senate."
"Nothing has happened to delay the appending of the President's signature."
"The Treaty has not, for example, been referred to the Constitutional Tribunal."
"This looks like disrespect for Parliament and violation of an agreement with the Prime Minister, Donald Tusk."
"I agree with the President-in-Office that this matter is not by nature political, but ethical."
"Poland negotiated the Treaty, signed it, and under international law is obliged to go through with the ratification process."
"I also very much hope that the situation regarding ratification of the Treaty will change soon and that attitudes will be significantly better by the end of the French Presidency than they are at present."
"in writing. - (FI) Mr President, I respect the clear wish of the President-in-Office of the Council Nicholas Sarkozy to adopt an ambitious attitude towards the EU energy and climate package and to achieve a Convention in that regard during the French Presidency."
"I hope this says above all that the challenges of climate change are at last at the heart of policy."
"I would, however, like to remind the President-in-Office of the Council of the seriousness of the task - emissions trading is a very significant market tool and affects so many people that we cannot afford to aspire to the kind of political timetable which goes on at the expense of the environment and sustainable development. Otherwise France may end up with egg on its face, something of which it could not be proud."
"Last month I held a seminar at which environmental organisations, research bodies and bodies affected by emissions trading were able to express their views on its economic effects."
"The message I received was clear: the Commission proposal will result in much higher costs without providing comparable environmental benefit."
"I refer to the worrying McKinsey analysis of the matter."
"Emissions trading must be improved."
"The situation is serious."
"We will not be able to use European industry, which has been dealing with its own affairs well, as a guinea pig again unless the system is operated in a slip-shod fashion."
"It is better to fail to accomplish than to accomplish failure."
"I believe that we can deliver a good result in time, but some vital adjustments are required."
"Carbon emissions will not be prevented by pious hopes and promises, unless they become part of the directive itself."
"We should remain firm on reducing the obligation but the procedure is very much open to discussion."
"In Parliament we have presented a broad front to the way the Commission has approached the alternatives under consideration."
"I would ask that you become acquainted with it, President-in-Office."
"in writing. - (RO) Mr. President, you have presented an extremely ambitious programme, which I hope will be successfully completed."
"The pact on immigration is a necessary priority in order to diminish illegal immigration and build a common policy on legal immigration."
"Nevertheless, I would like to emphasize an aspect you should take into consideration before starting the planned actions: the pact should comprise a series of actions taking into account the restrictions on the European labour market, imposed on workers from certain new Member States."
"It is not normal for the economic migration from third countries to outmatch the free movement between countries inside the Union."
"There are Member States that have transitory provisions in force, regulating access to the labour market for EU workers."
"Once the legal immigration policy is enforced, there is a risk of disadvantaging European citizens as compared to third country citizens."
"In this respect, I would like to congratulate France, which has taken the first step in this direction on 1 July, when it opened its labour market for the citizens of the countries acceding in 2004."
"I hope Romania and Bulgaria shall receive the same treatment as soon as possible and I encourage the other Member States to follow the example of France."
"in writing. - France has taken upon itself the mission to lead the European agenda for six months in a difficult context created after Ireland rejected the Lisbon Treaty."
"The programme of the French presidency of the EU is ambitious, but it should also be aware of the expectations of the population."
"The latest Eurobarometer poll shows that only 52% of EU citizens consider membership to be a good thing for their country."
"There is need of a strategy to make European citizens aware that the common interests are much more important from an economic and political view than the things that differentiate us."
"Obviously, the priority of the French presidency is the identification of the method of absorption of the Irish flaw as the European process must go on given that the Treaty of Nice blocks enlargement."
"As regards the second priority of the French presidency of the EU - the common agricultural policy and its preparation for future challenges - mention should be made that the maintaining of a single-payment system is applicable in Romania as of 2013."
"A beneficiary of the CAP as well, Romania will receive this year EUR 735 million in European direct aid for Romanian farmers."
"I will limit myself to two points:"
"It is absolutely impossible to apply for asylum in 27 countries."
"We have the Dublin II regulation, which settles the issue of the responsibility of host countries."
"However, it is true that there are still differences between Member States regarding recognising international protection, and that is a real problem."
"The second point that I want to cover is the basic problem of humanity in this world."
"How can we live all together in a globalised world?"
"We need to tackle the underlying causes that drive some desperate people to leave their countries and, in my view, the European Immigration Pact does not achieve the right balance between combating traffickers, promoting legal immigration and establishing ambitious co-development policies."
"in writing. - (ET) This year is an opportunity for the European Union to look in the mirror and see whether the decisions we made last year have borne fruit."
"Last year saw the beginning of the environment and energy action plan to reduce greenhouse gases and combat climate warming."
"We have discussed a common immigration policy for Europe and a short time ago heard testimony on the huge growth in illegal migration."
"We have also tackled issues of protection: joint European forces have been carrying out military operations in the wider world and since 2004 we have created EU battle groups and emergency response units."
"The new Presidency in the person of President Nicolas Sarkozy has brought freshness and promise to European policy, has given us the idea of a mini-agreement, and has taken a new approach to the new Member States."
"There are many examples of this."
"Through his own drive and initiative he will certainly be able to launch or speed up many challenging projects."
"Because of this I wish to stress that the country holding the Presidency does not drive European affairs separately, although it does have the right to propose certain items for the order of business."
"The fact that the Presidency is not responsible for decisions taken at the European Council table is a fundamental matter for it, and one on which it should focus its Presidency, rather than a party festooned with empty promises."
"Above all I hope very much that the French Presidency is able to inspire hope in Europeans for specific projects."
"in writing. - Mr President-in-Office of the Council, at the last European Summit in Brussels the creation of the Mediterranean Union was discussed - a significant initiative for the whole Mediterranean region and a priority of the French Presidency."
"But I truly hope that, when emphasising the Mediterranean Union during this Presidency, the Baltic Sea Region and the Baltic Sea Strategy will not be neglected."
"The Baltic Sea has become basically a European Union lake, with eight Member States surrounding it since 2004."
"The Baltic Sea Strategy covers the areas of environment, economics, culture and education and security, providing a sustainable plan for the development of this region."
"It would give me great pleasure if the French Presidency took time to attend to the issues concerning the Baltic Sea, and the prioritisation of the Mediterranean did not mean grabbing the blanket from the Baltic Sea region."
"Bearing in mind the near future Presidency of Sweden, it would be reasonable to start addressing the Baltic Sea Strategy to ensure greater coherence between Presidencies."
"in writing. - (RO) In the next six months, the French presidency shall have a great responsibility for the future of the European Union."
"The Union needs the Lisbon Treaty."
"The existent institutional framework, with the requirement of unanimity for certain decisions, is a heavy one."
"Moreover, the Lisbon Treaty increases the degree of democratization, increasing the power of national parliaments and introducing the codecision procedure for most of the fields."
"The French presidency should also support the common agricultural policy enabling European farmers to produce more."
"Together with all Member States, the French presidency should find solutions to the Union's impasse following the Irish referendum."
"The French presidency announced its priorities for the next period: climate change, immigration, the common agricultural policy, the Union's defence and security."
"Next autumn, in Copenhagen, the Union shall participate in the conclusion of an international post-Kyoto agreement."
"The Union should give an example of action in the fight against climate change and, for this reason, the adoption of the energy and climate change package should be one of the main objectives for the French presidency."
"in writing. - Nobody is able to explain the reasons for the outcome of the referendum in Ireland."
"A norm becomes a law based on universal approval of the people."
"Its sense should correspond to the conviction about the unity of all."
"Your fellow countryman, a thinker resting in the Pantheon, Rousseau, wrote that 'any law that the people have not ratified in person is void, it is not a law at all'."
"That is why the people should control the governments which pose a danger of usurpation of their rights."
"But how are the people supposed to take control by means of an instrument they do not understand, the structure of which is as complicated and unclear as the recent treaty?"
"I have no doubt that you wish to appear - to paraphrase Dominique de Villepin - in this 'temple' of the European Parliament - as a 'guardian of an ideal and a guardian of a conscience'."
"I count, however, that you will be more interested in conveying the information about the platforms of shared realisation of European interests to the public opinions, which, in turn, may allow the media to restrain from your private life in order to focus on your political one."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Quorum"
"I am pleased to see that the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is here, because we have a delicate problem to solve."
"My dear Jo, if you will return to your seat. I will explain the problem that we have, ladies and gentlemen."
"Rule 149 states that we can establish whether a quorum is present."
"As you know there are always large numbers in Parliament to debate its agenda and adopt the minutes, so in that case no quorum is required."
"However, Rule 149(3) states that if there is a prior request from at least forty Members, we can establish whether or not the quorum is present."
"I have received a written request from forty Members who want us to verify whether or not the quorum is present. Therefore, obviously..."
"Mr Posselt, please allow me to explain the facts. Obviously I consider that there is indeed a prior request that has been clearly made."
"The problem is as follows: after that the Rules of Procedure are much vaguer."
"It does not say anywhere that the forty Members have to be present in the Chamber in order to submit this request for the quorum to be established, but it is also not excluded."
"I therefore have discretion."
"On previous occasions, which we have checked, the President of the sitting has always considered that the forty Members had to be in the Chamber in order to give some substance to Rule 149(4), which states that when the quorum is counted, the forty should be counted."
"That implies that the forty have to be present."
"However, I have discretion, and there is also the way in which the request is worded: it concerns the vote on urgencies, which is all the urgencies; not just one of them but all of them."
"If we consider that the quorum request is admissible and the quorum is not present, all the urgencies will be dropped, and as you know they cannot be deferred."
"This means that we will not vote on Kashmir, the death penalty or Bangladesh."
"If we do not vote on them, we will not defer them to the next sitting."
"Parliament will not decide on these issues that are said to be urgent."
"Before giving my opinion, I would therefore particularly like to have the opinion of the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"Mr Leinen, in your view, should I consider that the forty petitioners should be present in the Chamber as Rule 149(4) implies, or can I consider that a prior written request alone is sufficient, as Rule 149(3) implies?"
"I shall listen closely to your reply."
"Mr President, I have just looked it up, and it is true that Rule 149(3) states that, provided 40 of them do so together, Members may request that it be established whether or not the quorum is present."
"The quorum shall exist if one third of Parliament's Members are present in the Chamber."
"The President responds to such a request by establishing whether or not the quorum exists."
"Then comes paragraph 4, which you mentioned, which states that 'Members who have asked for the quorum to be established shall be counted as being present [...], even if they are no longer in the Chamber.'"
"We are presently in a sitting that has resumed and, in my view, Members who were present and said they wanted the quorum established should be counted as present even if they are not here in plenary this afternoon."
"That is how I understand paragraph 4."
"I hear that you have received a request from 40 Members of this House for you to establish this afternoon whether the quorum is present or not."
"You can look around - one third of 785 is a little over 200, and there are about 30 of us here."
"Try as we might, we are unlikely to reach 200 this afternoon unless everybody turns up."
"Mr President, we can discuss the matter but, if you determine that the number of Members present does not reach one third, then we cannot vote."
"That is what the Rules of Procedure say."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Leinen, I am a veteran of these topical and urgent debates."
"They used to be held on Fridays, then they moved to Thursday afternoons."
"All the groups regularly used to try the trick of making a request like this if there was some urgent matter that did not suit them, like the topic of Kashmir in this case."
"That is why the Rules of Procedure were amended and the stipulation introduced that 40 Members - it may not be formulated very clearly, but that was the intention of the reform - have to be in the Chamber and contest the quorum."
"It was introduced because we were aware of the problem and, since then, there has never been the required number of Members present in the Chamber to request that the quorum be established, so it was always deemed to exist."
"I think it is important legally to consider the intention of this rule."
"I am sure it can be looked up in the committee and plenary Minutes."
"The intention of the reform was to link the question of the quorum with a number of Members present that was high enough to prevent it becoming a frequent parlour game, for that would almost have ruined these debates."
"It was with the purpose of saving them that we introduced this quorum of 40 back then."
"However, if we now make that 40 signatures, then the reform no longer makes sense."
"(FR) Mr President, you asked for the opinion of our colleague Mr Leinen first, in order to find out our feelings on this."
"As my colleague has already said, it is true that this manoeuvre appears to be a little dilatory; in other words forty of our colleagues who, for reasons that are their concern, have not been able to attend this sitting, are trying to use measures and procedures in order to prevent an urgent debate taking place here this afternoon."
"I really think that perhaps, rather than scrupulously applying the rules, we should look at the spirit of the Rules of Procedure."
"The spirit of the Rules of Procedure is really to ensure that the people who are tabling this quorum request are at least present so that they themselves can establish that there is no quorum."
"Otherwise, I find that the request is either a political manoeuvre or it is tactical, but it is dilatory."
"I would not wish, by strictly applying the law, for us to end up in the position where the urgent debates regularly organised on a Thursday afternoon, which are important, ended up being 'avoided', which would not enhance Parliament's work."
"Mr President, I think the previous speakers have made valid points."
"I thought I understood Mr Leinen in reading out the Rules - and he will correct me if I am wrong - to imply that the Members should at least be here at the beginning of the sitting, even if they then leave."
"Any other interpretation surely would be entirely self-serving, because people who are absent can put in a demand to say that there is no quorum, but they have helped to ensure that there is no quorum!"
"I cannot see how it could possibly be right to conclude that they can be entirely absent and say that the rest of us do not form a quorum."
"The other fact is, frankly, habit on Thursday afternoons."
"We know there is never a quorum for the urgencies and, if is suddenly to be invoked now, that may be a problem with the Rules that we will have to sort out."
"If you are going to torpedo this afternoon's urgencies, you could torpedo every Thursday afternoon's urgencies."
"My basic point is: how could it be possible to interpret the Rules to say that 40 absent people can say to the rest of us that we do not form a quorum and ensure that we do not make a quorum?"
"(PT) Mr President, it is not the first time that we have seen such a tactic and I would like to draw the attention of my fellow Members and of the Bureau to the following: all the world's parliaments have two things, rules and regulations but also parliamentary conventions, the established practice."
"This happens in all the world's parliaments, and this is customary practice for our Thursdays, as used to be the case with Friday mornings."
"We are all aware of this."
"The tactic we are witnessing is obviously an unfair one and I believe that a demand by Members who are not present in the room cannot be considered."
"Furthermore, I should like to call on those Members who are more expert at preparing amendments to the Rules, namely Mr Leinen, and Mr Corbett as well, to prepare an amendment to this rule, stipulating the following: if there is a request for a quorum count and if the person who made the request is not present in the Chamber at the time the count is carried out, they will lose their per diem for that day, and all those who are not in the Chamber, if there is no quorum the count establishes that, shall lose half their per diem for that day, so that we can put paid to this type of tactic once and for all."
"It is an unfair attack on the way Parliament operates, and especially the way proceedings are conducted in Strasburg."
"(PL) Mr President, I am not a lawyer, but it seems to me that decency dictates behaviour that differs from that exemplified by the applicants."
"That is one issue."
"Now a second: if someone is absent, there are no grounds for doubting whether or not there is a quorum."
"Thirdly, this approach to human rights matters, which are of particular importance to us, along with absence and attempts to break off proceedings, seems to me distinctly reprehensible."
"It seems to me that the spirit of the law is more important than its letter."
"(FI) Mr President, the matter at issue should be dealt with in accordance with the Rules of Procedure of Parliament and in my opinion Mr Leinen does not have the authority to interpret the Rules of Procedure because it is not his place to act alone as their interpreter."
"In my opinion, Mr President, it is your place to take responsibility for how we should proceed on the matter in question and afterwards the course you take should be examined by the Legal Office and the Presidents, otherwise this matter will become no clearer."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I think Mr Leinen said that you should have been satisfied that the 40 Members were counted at the beginning - i.e. earlier on today."
"This has not happened."
"Did the President count the 40 Members who submitted this earlier on today?"
"Obviously he did not."
"So, Mr Leinen's point that this satisfies paragraph 4 does not apply in this case."
"(PL) Mr President, this is undoubtedly a procedure that should not have to take place, but we too are rational people."
"We can see, we have eyes, and I wish to say in all honesty that there is no quorum."
"We can all see that."
"We must not kid ourselves."
"We cannot come up with interpretations that are in breach of the Rules and the law."
"On the other hand, this is such an important matter that we cannot neglect it."
"I am therefore making a specific application for this debate to be held, but to make amendments to the Rules, and not to make interpretations that are out of kilter with the idea of the Rules."
"If we break the Rules and the Constitution, this means that we ourselves are doing something that is not good for democracy and we ourselves are violating it."
"Mr President, actually the quorum issue does not relate to this debate."
"The debate can take place."
"The quorum issue concerns voting."
"I am surprised we are actually discussing this issue now because the quorum is really needed for the vote."
"I agree with all my colleagues that these urgencies are very important issues. However, we have hardly any people here."
"Last time 58 out of 785 Members voted in this House."
"I really do not think it enhances the credibility of this House if you have so few voting and taking part on major issues."
"So I would urge you to make a decision at the vote because the issue is that it is not acceptable that there is never a quorum."
"We think these urgencies are important."
"We should make sure that Members are present."
"We are trying to make sure that people do turn up to vote for these urgencies."
"It is not OK for us to keep passing urgencies when we do not have the full number of people."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Onesta asked me how I read Rule 149(4)."
"I do understand that Mr Posselt and others are saying that we should act anyway, even if we do not keep to the Rules of Procedure."
"I am delighted with the Member's argument: either we have Rules of Procedure and keep to them, or we do not keep to them and therefore do not need them."
"I may be Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but it was Members before me who made this rule and adopted it in plenary with an absolute majority."
"Paragraph 4 is quite clear."
"It states: 'Members who have asked for the quorum to be established shall be counted as being present [...], even if they are no longer in the Chamber.'"
"That is clear."
"If 40 Members, who were present at the sitting in Strasbourg, request that the vote or quorum be established, then they will be added to the number of those present."
"That is how I read it."
"If you wish to have it otherwise, then you have to change paragraph 4 but, as for now, it reads as it reads."
"Mr Posselt, anyone who reads it must understand it that way; there is no other way to understand it."
"Therefore, Mr President, now it is up to you to take a decision."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Leinen has accused me of suggesting that we ignore the Rules of Procedure."
"I was present when it was adopted, and you were not."
"The context was that, previously, 40 Members used to come into the Chamber, ask for the quorum to be established, and then leave."
"That is what the rule is about."
"This is my interpretation having, believe me, listened to you very carefully."
"The way in which the request from the forty petitioners is worded does not mention the issue of Kashmir, but all the urgencies, all the urgencies this afternoon, including the death penalty."
"This is an important matter."
"We can have the debates without any problem, Mrs Gill is right."
"The issue solely concerns the vote, but I wanted to have this debate from the start so that there would not be ambiguity all afternoon."
"I think that the reason why Parliament took the trouble to write Rule 149(4), stating that the Members who have asked for the quorum to be checked shall be counted, in accordance with paragraph 2, even if they are not in the Chamber, as Mr Posselt said, I think that this Rule was written solely to prevent Members from leaving the Chamber at the time of the count, which implies that they were present at the start of the count."
"As I cannot see that the forty petitioners are present at the start of the count - unless, as Mrs Gill says, they are all present later at voting time, which we will check, in which case there will be a quorum request - I will follow the precedents set by the other presidents of sittings who, like me, have been faced with this problem, by saying that the quorum request cannot be validated because the forty petitioners are not present."
"Having said that, Mr Leinen was right to draw our attention to the fact that the way in which paragraph 4 is written could cause confusion."
"This is why I think that this is a very good time - and it is not up to me to decide this, but to the competent bodies - for the Committee that you chair, Jo, to clarify very quickly whether or not paragraph 3 states that the Members have to be present when they submit their quorum request, and whether or not the Members have to be present when the count is done, at the start of the count."
"I think that the interpretation of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs will get us out of a tricky situation."
"However, as far as today is concerned, given the importance of the debates, and given the opinions that you have given me, which clearly largely support what I have just said, and on the basis of the previous decisions, we are going to have our debates, and when it comes to the vote, if the forty petitioners are not present, I will not ask for the quorum to be checked."
"The debates will therefore begin."
"1."
"Allegation of mass graves in Indian-administrated Kashmir"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the allegation of mass graves in Indian-administrated Kashmir."
"author. - Mr President, I am very glad about the very wise decision you have taken."
"Commissioner, thousands of civilians have been the victims of extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances, torture, rape and other serious human rights abuses which have occurred in Jammu and Kashmir since the beginning of the armed conflict there in 1989."
"Shamefully, most of these crimes have not been fully resolved to date."
"Furthermore, there is real concern about the safety of human rights activists, including those who are seeking to investigate the fate of the many missing persons."
"This Parliament strongly condemns all acts involving human rights abuses in the region and calls upon all governments concerned to show a strong will to uphold the rule of law and justice and to redouble their efforts in order to secure full investigations into the politically motivated crimes committed in Jammu and Kashmir in the past."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, I must say that it is not good when a president from the old EU discriminates against Members from the new EU by twice allowing a Member from the old EU, Mr Posselt, to speak, while I, the co-author of three reports, cannot rise to speak even once on this matter."
"I class this as discrimination and something that is totally unacceptable."
"I shall be submitting an appropriate letter on this, Mr President."
"This is a very disturbing thing."
"With regard to this situation, we are not looking at a black-and-white film."
"On the border between India and Pakistan conflicts arise that are often provoked by the Pakistani state, as we very well know."
"We know about the so-called line of control guarded by the armed forces of the two countries."
"Following the recent 20-year period of peace along this border, Pakistan has resumed its attacks on the state of Kashmir."
"I am therefore asking for attention to be given to the other side too."
"Of course, I am not underestimating the issue of the graves that we are discussing here, although the number of victims is probably considerably smaller there."
"author. - Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to debate this particular issue because it is of great concern to many of us in this House whenever, in any part of the world, a significant number of graves come to light that are only accessible with permission of the security forces."
"Therefore this motion for a resolution - along with the hearing in the Subcommittee on Human Rights next week - takes on an even greater significance because of the political and security situation in the area."
"As this House well knows, we have ourselves debated that general situation before, perhaps also under less than transparent conditions."
"There is indeed a history of disappearances in the region."
"We know that a number of these have been linked to the activities of the security forces."
"We know that it is the most heavily militarised area in the world."
"We know that this also is an area where there are arrests and significant detention without trial."
"Therefore that also colours our interpretation of such findings, making it all the more important that there should be a really open investigation allowing full transparency and full access for the international community."
"I hope that the European Union will, as the resolution states, offer its support for high-quality forensic expertise and any other assistance which is needed in this investigation, because it is important for our interpretation of what is happening there that we reach the fullest possible understanding."
"With that also goes - as others have said - the protection of human rights activists who are themselves trying to investigate the issue, such as Pervez Imroz."
"I think we would all agree that it is the duty of all democratically elected governments to investigate such findings fully in complete transparency, and to try and trace those whose bodies are there and their relatives, so that we can fully understand the situation and not apply various interpretations to it which might not be the truth."
"I think Parliament is absolutely right to be discussing this issue, and absolutely right to be calling on the Commission to offer its assistance, particularly given the ongoing problems that we are seeing in the region at present."
"author. - (FI) Mr President, I regard your interpretation of the Rules of Procedure as politically correct but legally incorrect and would definitely like the matter to be examined by the Presidents and the Parliamentary Legal Office; this is because the application of the rule in question does not allow for the interpretation you have made today and requires more detailed study."
"As for the matter in hand, India has been called the world's largest democratic State."
"It is indeed large in terms of population but the idea of whether a country is democratic also depends on its human rights situation."
"Measures alleged to have been taken by the government's security services against human rights activists in Jammu and Kashmir indicate that not all principles of the rule of law are respected in India, despite the fact that the country's government has clearly declared that it does not allow violations of human rights."
"We regard the action of the Indian government as lacking in credibility and ask where thousands of people have disappeared to and whose are the bodies found in the mass graves."
"We condemn forced disappearances, torture, rape and other violations of human rights."
"The fact that we suspect the Indian government of having a part in all this is an especially serious matter."
"Therefore we in the European Parliament demand that an independent investigation be carried out by the Indian government to identify the origin of the mass graves and the identities of the murderers and their victims."
"The matter is not insignificant given the nature of the Kashmir region."
"There is a risk that the neighbouring state, Pakistan, would be party to any new conflict and in that case the events in question may act as a spark to nationalist kindling in this explosive area."
"We must support the joint resolution on a thorough investigation into the events which occurred in Jammu and Kashmir."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, we have often discussed the conflict in Kashmir here, and I must add that there was a time of hope, of rapprochement between Pakistan and India."
"It was hoped that the situation would ease."
"Alas, the domestic political crises in both nations have brought a renewed hardening and we, the European Parliament, are working very hard to get the situation moving again."
"I am very grateful to Mr Gahler, who, as Chief Observer of our Elections Observation Mission in Pakistan, has worked so hard for democracy in Pakistan and to ensure that our contacts with India serve the same goal and that we are supporting confidence-building."
"One might wonder why we are addressing mass graves, as this will not bring the dead back to life and may worsen the climate between the two countries."
"We are doing it because real peace can only be created when there is justice for the victims - and there are victims not just with Pakistani or Indian passports."
"There are victims on both sides, and the main victim is the Kashmiri people."
"That is why we must investigate these mass graves, we must determine where the many people are who have disappeared and are being mourned by their families."
"Only then can the confidence be established that is necessary for a truly peaceful solution that people also feel they are part of."
"Kashmir belongs first and foremost to the Kashmiri people themselves."
"We should therefore support a solution that finally gives the Kashmiris some breathing space, finally creates political freedom and provides a sensible compromise solution, for this is one of the longest-running conflicts of all."
"It has been raging since the Second World War, and it is scandalous that nobody has yet managed to bring the problem under control."
"We therefore support all efforts to carry out these investigations and help give the victims the dignity and justice they deserve."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, just for the record, I am not an author of this resolution."
"I do not know who has put my name down because I have not signed it."
"I just want to say that I am really surprised to see this item as an urgency before we have debated it properly in either the Subcommittee on Human Rights, or for that matter, any other subcommittee or delegation of this Parliament."
"This is not a new issue and it has been extensively investigated by the media in India."
"It has been raised over and over again."
"It would have been good to have had the debate before."
"This is the reason that the Socialist Group were against having this item as an urgency now because we believed it should have been properly discussed in committee before."
"The whole urgency is based on reports by a single NGO."
"I am not denying that these things are happening, but I have had communication with the Commission, who are calling into question various things in this report."
"So I would really question what it does for this Parliament's credibility to have an urgency before things are properly investigated."
"As Chairwoman of the European Parliament's Delegation for relations with India, I personally would have liked an opportunity to look at the contents of this report and examine how many cases we are looking at and the result of the conflict in the region, where there have already been something like 4 500 deaths among military personnel and 13 000 civilians have lost their lives."
"The graves we are talking about are in the line of control."
"This resolution text ignores the fact that the issue has been investigated over the last five years, following the 2002 elections, and I have been informed that NGOs have had access to the area and have been invited to submit their names of disappeared persons to help the authorities to identify the graves."
"Nobody is denying that security forces have been involved in disappearances."
"What this resolution leaves out is that they have been investigated by the authorities."
"I personally would urge this House not to vote for this resolution."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I can only join in the concerns about the discovery of hundreds of graves in Jammu and Kashmir since 2006, but I am particularly concerned about the armed attack on the respected human rights lawyer, Pervez Imroz, just 11 days ago in Srinagar, and the continuous harassment of numerous human rights activists."
"I think it is opportune, therefore, to urge the Indian Government to launch an independent investigation into these graves and as a first step to secure the grave sites so as to preserve the evidence."
"We also call on the European Commission to offer the Indian Government financial and technical assistance through the Stability Instrument for such an inquiry, and possibly further measures of conflict resolution in Kashmir."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I think we should be clear what this motion for a resolution is not: it is not a re-run of the rather controversial and contentious report that we had last year; it is not about how to get a political solution to the territorial dispute and conflict over Kashmir."
"It is nothing of the sort."
"It is a simple focus on humanitarian questions, with a call for an independent and impartial investigation and accountability for alleged disappearances."
"It could have been handled in various ways."
"It is true that these discoveries of unidentified graves go back to 2006."
"But two things prompted the urgency request."
"One was the report going back to 29 March from the Association of the Parents of Disappeared Persons and the second was the attack on 30 June, with perpetrators unknown, on Pervez Imroz, the award-winning human rights lawyer and founder of that association."
"I think that justifies the urgency."
"At least part of the purpose of this resolution is to urge some action by the European Union, not least in paragraph 2, which urges the Commission to offer financial and technical assistance to the Indian Government."
"It also calls for EU Member States to take up the issue in the dialogue on human rights with the Indian Government in the second half of this year."
"So the focus is on getting an independent investigation and not least to assign a civilian prosecutor to the task."
"I think it is justified and is something that has a particular and circumscribed focus and does not talk about the whole issue of Kashmir."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the resolution speaks of facts that are an outcome of the conflict over Kashmir between Pakistan and India that has been going on for the past 50 years."
"This conflict has been the cause of several wars."
"Only China has benefited from it."
"There has been indirect involvement by Russia and the United States in the conflict, and funds have come from Arab countries and China."
"The UN has played a positive role in ameliorating the conflict."
"This conflict is still going on, and attacks by fundamentalists continue to bring a bloody harvest."
"This is the most serious problem faced by the inhabitants of Kashmir."
"Victims on the Indian side are buried, while on the Pakistani side in many cases they become objects of revenge."
"The key role in resolving the conflict and evaluating the facts should be played by the UN, not by us."
"We feel morally obliged, in so far as the democratic government of India does not take this on, to provide assistance and stabilisation in the prevailing situation in Kashmir, and in a moral evaluation of the actions taken in the conflict."
"I view the holding of a discussion on this subject more as a political manifestation than a pragmatic action."
"I do not support the resolution."
"(LT) We are fully aware of the fact that the military conflict in Jammu and Kashmir has been going on for several decades."
"However, today the most important point is that, in spite of the commitment of the Indian Government not to tolerate human rights abuse in Jammu and Kashmir, the international community still receives information on human rights violations, most recently regarding a large number of unknown graves containing hundreds of unrecognised human bodies."
"We want to know and must find out who these people were, of what violence they are the victims and what crimes they are alleged to have committed."
"We not only condemn unlawful killings and disappearances, but also insist that the Indian Government carry out a thorough independent investigation into the mass graves, having protected them in order to preserve the evidence."
"I do believe that the European Commission will find ways of rendering financial and technical support to the Indian Government in order to facilitate the investigation."
"Mr President, I only want to take the floor again because, as an author of this resolution, I feel obliged to answer what Mrs Gill has said."
"It is extremely rare that the urgency subjects we discuss on Thursday afternoon go before a committee before they come here, otherwise they would not be urgent."
"It is an urgency because there are mass graves which have been discovered recently, and we need to sort this problem out."
"Secondly, if the Socialist Group wants to have a majority when voting, then perhaps Mrs Gill's group should make sure that their MEPs do not leave before the end of the part-session in order to go back home earlier - while we have to stay here and discuss and vote."
"I would say to Mrs Gill: I think you should first look at your MEPs because you are the one who is complaining about it, and then discuss other groups' MEPs."
"(PL) Mr President, the mass graves and mass burials of thousands of people in the states of Jammu and Kashmir make one's blood run cold in one's veins."
"For us Europeans it is a reminder of German and Soviet crimes and of the dark sides of Fascism and Stalinism."
"It revives memories of Hitler's concentration camps and of the Soviet murder of Polish officers at Katyń."
"After our distant and more recent experiences, we should be doing all we can to put a stop to genocide, and where it has already taken place we should commemorate it and give families the right to the graves of their ancestors and compensation for them."
"The situation in Kashmir demands that the necessary financial and technical assistance be given to the Indian Government and that the UN response be strengthened in order to return the situation in this region of the world to normality."
"Mr President, when mass graves are found, wherever they are found, it is imperative to find out who the victims are, how and why they were killed, who is investigating and who is being investigated."
"Rather than being an incendiary activity, it establishes the truth and honours the humanity of the victims, and that is the start of establishing the truth that sets us all free."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission is aware of, and has seen reports about, mass graves in Indian-administered Kashmir and we are following closely requests from NGOs to the Indian Government to launch urgent, impartial and independent investigations on this matter."
"Meanwhile, the Indian authorities and the government at central level remain silent on the report."
"We have also received information that the lawyer Pervez Imroz and another NGO activist who investigated the charges of human rights violations in Kashmir were subjected to intimidation and harassment on 20 and 21 June."
"The Commission delegation in New Delhi is further investigating this matter, in close cooperation with the French Presidency and the Member States' embassies in the Indian capital."
"The Presidency has contacted the resident Commissioner of Indian-administered Kashmir in New Delhi and has expressed the EU's concerns over the situation."
"If accurate, such reports would constitute very worrying developments as to the respect of democratic principles and the rule of law, and would run counter to certain positive developments in Indian-administered Kashmir, such as the composite dialogue, which is still on track."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place after the debates unless, as I said earlier, a request is properly submitted and it is properly established that there is no quorum present."
"2."
"Situation in Bangladesh"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the situation in Bangladesh."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, in connection with the disturbances in January 2007, the caretaker government in Bangladesh introduced a state of emergency, and on 11 June this year it passed a new regulation limiting human rights through an imprecise definition of a terrorist act."
"In June there was a mass wave of arrests in Bangladesh, taking advantage of extraordinary powers enabling arrests to be made without a warrant when a link between the person being arrested and criminal offences can be presumed."
"In fact, the arrests concerned leaders, members and sympathisers of the two main opposition groups, the Awami League and the Bangladesh People's Party, who were refusing to cooperate with the government in organising general elections until their leaders were released from captivity."
"Today's incipient negotiations with the Awami League are cause for hope."
"The massive rise in food prices is threatening the stability of the country, however."
"Under these conditions, the elections planned for December are no guarantee that Bangladesh is setting off down the road of democracy."
"We call on the Government of Bangladesh to lift the state of emergency and respect human rights, which will help to maintain democratic standards during the course of the elections."
"We call for the armed forces to be withdrawn from actions linked to the organisation of the elections."
"author. - Mr President, as we know, Parliament has been concerned about the situation in Bangladesh for a considerable period of time."
"We supported calls for moves to ensure free and fair elections and we also supported the calls from civil society for revised and updated electoral registers to ensure that maximum participation would be possible within those elections."
"I think it is important to say that we very much welcome the progress that has been made on that new electronic register."
"It is a major task which has been undertaken and indeed, if it is fulfilled in time and ensures that minority groups etc. are also included on it, this will really be an historic achievement by the Bangladeshi authorities."
"We know that the electoral register has also had a very positive effect already, certainly for a number of women from poorer families and backgrounds, who feel that at last they have an identity, that they can now borrow small amounts of money to set up their own businesses etc."
"So there have been some positive moves."
"We also welcome recent action on war criminals and the action that the government, or at least some of it, has taken against corruption."
"But we have major concerns about the role and activity of the continuing interim government and the state of emergency."
"There are some who have said that the state of emergency is a technical issue, as it were, to ensure that a government can at least continue beyond the caretaker period."
"But whether one agrees with that or not, I think that what is happening with the state of emergency is really beginning to reflect a clear lack of checks and balances within the system there, particularly given the reports, as we have just been hearing, of mass arrests, the lack of due process, the allegations of torture, reports of extrajudicial killings, pressure on journalists and increasing violence against women."
"So there is a clear need for the interim government to rein in the security forces, to cease the mass arrests and to proceed to either charge or release those people arrested and to ensure due process."
"Certainly this resolution reflects the wish which I think is there in Parliament to lift the state of emergency and to ensure that civil society can proceed to full, fair, free elections with the support of the European Union, at any rate in its electoral monitoring capacity."
"author. - Mr President, Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries on the planet and one whose physical integrity has an expiry date since, if the curse of global warming is not stopped, much of the country will be submerged under the sea by 2050."
"The state of emergency, with all its anti-democratic manifestations - a state which was declared by the caretaker government set up in January 2007 amid violence in the run-up to the election - should have been lifted by now."
"All individuals held under emergency power rules should either be brought before a court of justice or be released."
"Furthermore, the new anti-terrorist ordinance must be urgently brought into line with internationally accepted standards, safeguarding personal rights and freedoms."
"In addition, the country's armed forces must terminate their involvement in the political processes of the country and the forthcoming elections must be held in a climate of non-militarised political tranquility."
"author. - (FI) Mr President, in the resolution which we have just adopted, the European Parliament demanded human rights for the people of India."
"The situation in Bangladesh is very problematic."
"The whole country has been in a state of emergency for 18 months and there are no free elections on the horizon."
"Bangladesh is not a democratic state, but of course the world is full of undemocratic states and violations of democracy."
"Of all the undemocratic states only Zimbabwe has received the condemnation of the EU and the United States."
"The undemocratic nature of its elections can be freely criticised in the western media because the country has no oil."
"Oil is a protective buffer against condemnations of violations of democracy."
"Bangladesh is not an oil state either."
"For that reason the media could highlight the situation in the country with the silent blessing of the oil-dependent ruling powers."
"Bangladesh has re-introduced the death penalty and following the declaration of the state of emergency 300 000 people were arrested on flimsy grounds, 12 000 of whom have died in the last month."
"Several of the people arrested in recent weeks were defenders of democracy, active local members of political parties and supporters of democracy whom the state and the government regard as criminals."
"Terrorism is the word of the day in Bangladesh too, and is the guise for violations of human rights."
"Bangladesh is not a state based on the rule of law."
"Human rights violations are carried out there in the form of detentions of the most varied kinds, shortcomings in the defendant's rights of defence, and defects in both the publication of judgments and in the grounds on which they are based."
"The human rights enshrined in the constitution are not respected."
"For those reasons we call on Parliament to support the joint resolution demanding the immediate abrogation of the state of emergency and the holding of free elections in due course."
"Mr President, the Ahmed transitional government must concentrate on its real goals: fighting corruption, making the country safe and creating the preconditions for elections to take place - in August at regional level and in December for the whole country."
"However, the elections must be conducted fairly, respect international conventions and give ethnic and religious minorities the opportunity to be involved, both passively and actively."
"Electoral observers, including from the European Union, should perform the necessary monitoring within the country."
"Obviously, extremist attacks must be prevented."
"The new Counterterrorism Ordinance 2008, aimed at achieving this, must comply with international law, however."
"That is not yet the case."
"Currently, it is being used mainly to target people who are victims of political persecution."
"It is no wonder that Bangladesh is a place of fear, when human rights activists and citizens who express criticism are arbitrarily arrested."
"Those arrested have a right to due process."
"The human rights organisation Odhikar has stated that information about mass arrests and maltreatment has been substantiated."
"As a member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) delegation of the European Parliament, I have visited Bangladesh several times."
"Many Members here today were also present. In that moderate Islamic country, there are many in positions of responsibility who are favourably disposed."
"They are waiting desperately for input from outside, namely from the European Union - the Commission and the Council."
"Mr President, I congratulate you on the decision you have just taken regarding quorums in the European Parliament."
"Mrs Gill, I wish we could keep all our urgencies alive and did not constantly have to say that they would be handled by the relevant committee."
"Mr Matsakis is absolutely right."
"One step further in this regard would be that suddenly there were no more intergroups."
"That would also be fatal, because committees cannot do this work."
"We must make the most of the opportunity of having enough time, so that we no longer see the situation we now have, where the poor President has to use the gavel - because, in the future, we shall hopefully have twice as long to speak, so that the European Parliament will be known as the voice of human rights and can become stronger - and that takes time."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, having chaired the Delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia and having visited Bangladesh, I would say that this is a fragile state which has faced more than its fair share of political, environmental, economic and social setbacks."
"However, when I was there I was impressed by the vibrant and free media and the determination of the people to overcome their difficulties."
"I believe the focus of our relations with Bangladesh should be to support the democratic movements in the country and the establishment of rule of law, as well as helping to build democratic institutions."
"Whilst the EU has an important role in assisting Bangladesh to achieve these goals, this should be translated into constructive action towards assisting the country, not into trying to micromanage their problems."
"I really welcome the announcement of elections scheduled for the third week of December this year and I call on the caretaker government to ensure that these elections will be free and fair, and to allow the Election Commission to continue with its road map."
"I would like to address the points Mr Mann raised against me because I think it is not proper to take on points from the previous debate."
"I would say that, if we take our urgencies really seriously, Mr Mann should make sure that those people are here."
"The onus is on all of us to make sure that our colleagues are here because we have minority groups influencing how the European Parliament is viewed across the world."
"It is important when we have these debates that we keep that in mind: it is important to have urgencies, but get all your people here."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (PL) Mr President, in terms of population numbers, Bangladesh is the seventh largest country in the world, with a population in excess of 150 million."
"This is a country that achieved independence in 1971, but has suffered for 20 years under autocratic governments, which have very often been of a military nature."
"In 1991, however, something else began there."
"Democracy sprang up, and there was a 5% rise."
"The well-known company Goldman Sachs stated that Bangladesh was a country with a very promising future, as far as swift economic growth was concerned."
"Today we are looking at a massive regression, and there is a political crisis."
"The army has appeared in the streets."
"Moreover, the army would like to change the Constitution in order to introduce, as it puts it, its own form of democracy."
"We have heard this one before."
"We have had the opportunity to observe close up what this special form of democracy is all about."
"If this new form is to involve bringing the army into politics, my view is that it is a very bad direction to take."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the situation in Bangladesh has always been very serious, but especially so in the last 18 months - since the time when a state of emergency was introduced there."
"One effect of this has been, for example, to increase the number of death sentences, and more than 300 000 people have been arrested, a number of them having been tortured."
"The problem is that these repressions are showing no signs of weakening."
"Six weeks ago more than 12 000 people were arrested."
"All this is taking place against a dramatic economic background."
"Rice and basic foodstuff prices have risen by a third."
"There will probably also be a vast wave of emigration, which will reach 25 million in the next 40 years."
"This exodus will be caused by the floods that are highly likely as a result of rising water levels in the Bay of Bengal."
"This all points to one conclusion: Bangladesh is a country in which we must take an interest; we must give it support."
"We must also support economic and democratic change in that country - the poorest country in the world."
"Mr President, under the emergency rule instigated in 2007, one can be imprisoned indefinitely without a court warrant on the grounds of reasonable suspicion of involvement in corruption-related activities."
"With the recent arrest of Motiur Rahman Nizami, the three main political party leaders of Bangladesh have now been apprehended on illusive charges of corruption."
"Since March 2008 at least 12 000 persons have been arrested and denied the right to seek release on bail."
"The number involves hundreds of political party members, but business people and journalists have also fallen prey to this anti-corruption witch hunt."
"With elections pending for December of this year, the key political leaders are unable to participate in dialogue, inhibiting the democratic process."
"Though the caretaker government denies allegations that these arrests are politically motivated, the strategic timing of these events is too coincidental to ignore."
"The detainees should be charged lawfully on the basis of substantiated evidence or released immediately."
"Otherwise the outcome of the coming elections will be fraudulent and far from democratic."
"(PL) Mr President, the problems in Bangladesh to which we have been drawing attention for some years now continue to remain unresolved."
"The world keeps hearing of more and more instances of human rights violations in that country."
"Since January 2007, Bangladesh has been in a state of emergency."
"The Anti-Terrorism Ordinance introduced on 11 June has placed additional restrictions on human rights, becoming another tool in the political battle."
"During the past 18 months 300 000 arrests have been made and the scope of application of the death penalty has been widened."
"Prisoners are subjected to torture and die in unexplained circumstances."
"The Bangladeshi authorities are not doing a lot to support the economy in the country, where food prices have risen by more than a third in recent months, and where a quarter of the territory is threatened by a constant risk of flooding and humanitarian disaster."
"An opportunity for change in the country is provided by free parliamentary elections preceded by a lifting of the state of emergency."
"It is essential for the caretaker government to guarantee freedom of the media in the pre-election period and the involvement of representatives of all the country's ethnic and religious minorities in the elections."
"The EU should restore as soon as possible its election observation mission in Bangladesh, and prior to that the European Commission's Office in Bangladesh must carefully monitor the political situation in the country and the status of observance of fundamental human rights."
"(PL) Mr President, freedom and statehood in Bangladesh were secured and purchased at the cost of the lives of many millions of its citizens."
"This nation also suffers vast losses because of its situation and the lie of the land."
"It is beset by natural disasters."
"The country is overpopulated, with 1 040 people per square kilometre; it is not urbanised, and it has a very low income per head of population."
"This is a country that is difficult to govern because of illiteracy and a lack of roads and communications."
"It requires constant assistance from outside, not least in the creation of an effective democratic system, which is an important and difficult problem in Islamic countries."
"Consideration of effective forms of assistance is a very important matter, with a view to Bangladesh not being run by totalitarian governments."
"I support the resolution."
"A discussion on the subject of democracy may stimulate positive action on the part of Parliament."
"(PL) Mr President, Bangladesh's caretaker government, supported by the army, is arresting thousands of people, among them members of the opposition."
"They are held in captivity for months on end without being charged with anything."
"This is being done under the pretence of a fight against corruption and terrorism."
"The government is also persecuting the independent media and allowing the practice of torture."
"This situation is taking place in a country that is in the vanguard of the world's poorest and most densely populated countries."
"Against this background it has to be stated with concern that the European Union is attributing too little importance to the problems of Bangladesh."
"This must change."
"A good opportunity for this should be provided by the parliamentary elections that have been announced for the end of the year."
"The European Commission and the Council should most definitely play a more active role in getting the state of emergency lifted and putting an end to human rights violations."
"The EU should apply special pressure particularly to the forthcoming elections and carry out careful monitoring of both the preparations for and the holding of these elections."
"(DE) Mr President, the European Union has a major interest in democratic conditions and respect for human rights in Bangladesh."
"I also join the call for free and fair elections and the lifting of emergency measures in the near future."
"Clearly, there cannot be any democratic debate in a climate of fear and intimidation."
"We make our demands to the caretaker government, that is true, but we must also point out that the political powers that be in Bangladesh also have a rather uncultured style, and that things do not happen peacefully, but very violently, particularly during election campaigns."
"Election campaigns are invariably used to intimidate minorities."
"Thus our message is directed to all the actors, primarily to the government, but also to the parties."
"Nevertheless, Mr President, I respect your decision, but I should just like to point out that our Rules of Procedure state that, 'If the vote shows that the quorum is not present, the vote shall be placed on the agenda of the next sitting.'"
"(Rule 149(3)). I should hope that such votes take place not with 30 Members present, but 600, which is always the case for midday votes."
"(LT) Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries in the world."
"It is also one of the most densely populated countries in the world."
"Bangladesh is the country at greatest risk from climate change."
"Lastly, this country is one of the least democratic."
"I have enumerated four problems, four threats, just one of which could bring even a flourishing country into submission."
"Therefore, in order to break this chain, democracy should be reinstated; even today's debates should lead in this direction."
"Mr President, I am sorry that I have to take the floor again, but I must again reply to Mrs Gill."
"She has made the accusation that the discussion on Thursday afternoon and the resolutions are the result of the wishes of small minority groups."
"Can I say that this is disrespectful, unfair and unfounded."
"These resolutions are discussed extensively at meetings where representatives of all the groups - including the PSE Group - are present, one or two days prior to coming here on the Thursday afternoon."
"They are approved by the representatives of these groups, if they agree to their content, and then they are debated and voted upon."
"So, if there is a problem with regard to the Socialist Group, it is not our concern."
"It is Mrs Gill's group's problem and concern."
"Perhaps they do not debate these issues sufficiently or in time, but it is her problem."
"As far as Thursday afternoon goes, it is exactly the opposite."
"It is not the minority groups."
"The PPE-DE Group has the majority on Thursday afternoon and it is what the PPE-DE Group wants that passes because they have the majority."
"(PL) Mr President, it has become a practice of the European Parliament to consider instances of violations of human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law and to adopt appropriate resolutions in plenary."
"One of the things we are looking at today is the situation in Bangladesh, where the elections planned for 22 January 2007 did not take place and have been postponed until December 2008."
"This fact has exacerbated the situation, leading on the one hand to numerous socio-political protests and on the other to a tightening of legal regulations and a tougher response from government forces."
"The expressions terrorism, acts detrimental to goods and individuals and serious crimes are often used as grounds for arrests and court rulings."
"The state of unrest is being made worse by a food crisis, causing a rise in expenditure on food by as much as 60%."
"The problem is not one that can be resolved by the use of force - arrests, court rulings, incarcerations."
"What is needed is a reconciliation between the warring factions."
"Such a reconciliation could be brought about by democratic elections, so a resolution calling for them to be held makes sense and should be supported."
"Before giving the floor to the Commission, I would like to respond to my friend Mr Leinen."
"Jo, you were saying that if we did not vote this afternoon, the vote would take place next time."
"You would be right if it were not a vote on urgencies, because Rule 115(6) of our Rules of Procedure, according to the interpretation produced by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that you chair, states very clearly that motions for resolutions on urgencies that cannot be dealt with within the time period allocated for the debate shall lapse."
"The same applies to motions for resolutions for which it has been established that the quorum is not present."
"Therefore, for urgencies and urgencies alone, if it is established before the votes that a quorum is not present, the vote never takes place."
"It cannot be deferred; this is stated in Rule 115(6)."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the parliamentary elections in December are indeed essential for securing sustainable democracy in Bangladesh."
"There is progress but much more progress is needed, especially in the field of human rights."
"So far we assess largely positively the steps taken by the government to prepare for these elections as regards the electoral framework and dialogue with political parties."
"Technical preparations have made substantial progress."
"Yet, since Bangladesh is under a state of emergency, we will be monitoring closely whether the progressive lifting of restrictions to the exercise of civil and political rights allows credible free and fair elections."
"Let me also make it clear that our engagement in the process, including the eventual redeployment of an electoral observation mission suspended in early 2007, will be linked to this commitment by the government."
"We also share the concerns expressed in your resolution of 6 September last year as well as in your motions submitted by political groups for this debate today."
"Restrictions to the exercise of fundamental freedoms must be limited to what is strictly necessary to guarantee security."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"in writing. - Bangladesh is a large and strategic South Asian country with 153 million inhabitants and some 80 million registered electors, making it one of the world's largest democracies."
"The caretaker government has now informed the EU and USA that it will proceed to democratic elections in December 2008, having successfully completed an electoral register which is robust against fraud."
"The military are now committed to withdrawing from policy-making."
"Ex-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has been released on humanitarian grounds."
"The emergency powers, which this resolution rightly wishes to see lifted, are still in place and need to go before the election."
"The large numbers arrested following the violence last year, which led to the state of emergency, need to be released or charged."
"Long-term EU observers should return as soon as possible to monitor the pre-election situation."
"The EU is watching Bangladesh very carefully, given the concerns about the deteriorating human rights situation over the last few years and increasing Islamist radicalisation of its society, with an exodus of Hindus, Ahmadias and Christians, and the government's seeming abandonment of its successful model of a secular multiparty democracy."
"Bangladesh has the makings of a successful democracy in the Muslim world and the EU needs to strongly support this."
"3."
"The death penalty, particularly the case of Troy Davis"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the death penalty, particularly the case of Troy Davis."
"author. - Mr President, this House has taken a clear and strong stance as far as the death penalty is concerned."
"It supports its abolition and the need for an immediate moratorium on executions where the death penalty still applies."
"The latter is the case in many states in the USA such as Georgia, where Troy Davis is awaiting his lawful killing to be carried out at the end of July."
"Apart from ideological and humanistic considerations against executing human beings, in the case of Troy Davis there appear to be additional reasons in the form of serious doubts as to the robustness and validity of the evidence which led to his conviction in the first place."
"Such doubts, we believe, justify the reasoning of any individual using common sense that retrial should be granted in this case."
"Consequently we call on the relevant authorities in the USA to order that Troy Davis be retried and, if found guilty again, that his death sentence be commuted to life imprisonment."
"Furthermore, we call once again on the US Government, and all governments in the world that still have capital punishment, to abolish the death penalty in the interests of humanity."
"In particular we call on the governments of those countries such as China, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia where executions are still carried out regularly, and where in many instances this is done in a most appallingly barbaric way, to stop executions."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, I would not want this to be a debate on the subject of the death penalty as such."
"Since we cannot conceal the fact that opinions differ on this matter, it seems to me that we should be talking about the very specific case of an individual who was given the death penalty, subsequent to which seven out of nine witnesses to the charge against him withdrew their testimony."
"This is a very specific situation."
"I would not want us to veer off in an abstract fashion into a debate on whether the death penalty is completely bad or not."
"I do not want at the present moment to call on the US authorities to amend a law that in 1972, that is 36 years ago, brought back the death penalty."
"We are talking about a specific and extraordinarily controversial case."
"It really is worth defending Mr Davis and demonstrating that there are situations in which it is worthwhile intervening."
"I would caution against generalisations, and that is why I did not sign this joint resolution."
"author. - Mr President, this case certainly is an urgency because, as we have been hearing, the execution is due to take place by the end of this month."
"So I would urge each and every one of us in this Chamber and listening to this debate to make personal representations to the American Government - and indeed the Georgia state government - to see if clemency can be applied."
"Then we would move towards a retrial, if that is necessary."
"At least we would have a living being and a retrial would be able to take place."
"I think it is really important that we take our personal responsibility on this as well as looking to representations by Parliament."
"Certainly, in this particular case, the evidence - as we have also been hearing from many of the witnesses - has been retracted and contradicted."
"The American Bar Association's Georgia Death Penalty Assessment Team released a report looking at the circumstances in that particular state and felt that one of the major problems they had found was inadequate defence counsel, and a concern that defendants already on death row may not have had adequate counsel at the time of their trials."
"They noted that Georgia was the only state that did not provide lawyers to death row inmates for their post-conviction appeals."
"So there are a number of reasons to be very concerned about this particular case, which is the one cited in the title of the resolution on the death penalty, notably the case of Troy Davis."
"But I would also like to raise other cases, in particular what is happening at the moment with some of those still detained in Guantánamo."
"One case in particular concerns a British resident, Binyamin Mohamed, who has been detained there for over six years now and is likely to face a military commission where the death penalty is all too possibly an outcome."
"This Parliament, and the European Union as a whole, takes a very strong view on the death penalty."
"We consider that it is not something that a civilised society should be applying, and that there are all too many reasons for death penalties not to be imposed."
"The case of Troy Davis is, I think, an absolutely classic example of the real problems with the implementation of the death penalty."
"Once again, as well as what is called for in this particular resolution, I would call on each and every one of us, as responsible individuals, also to take action in communicating our distress on this particular case."
"author. - (LT) The European Parliament has adopted quite a few regulations encouraging the abolition of the death penalty and executions or at least a moratorium on executions in the countries in which the death penalty still exists."
"Today we, the European Parliament, are supporting a person we have never met, Troy Davis, who is to be executed at the end of this month."
"Can you imagine yourself in his place, having had to spend 17 years waiting to be either cleared or executed, when there is strong evidence that he is innocent, with the seven witnesses who gave evidence against him having retracted their statements, and so on. We are aware of quite a few cases of a person being executed and his innocence being proved only afterwards."
"There are a lot of known cases where people are given the death penalty but avoid execution owing to the discovery of new evidence that proves they are not guilty of the crime."
"Therefore, today we are once again calling on all the countries of the world in which the death penalty is still used to take immediate measures to abolish it."
"Today we are making our position against the death penalty clear, standing by a real person and pleading with the relevant US courts to reinvestigate the case of Troy Davis and pass a more lenient sentence instead of the death penalty."
"In my opinion, supporting a real person, trying to protect him from being executed, even if he has made a huge mistake, is the best way to make our position on the necessity of abolishing the death penalty absolutely clear."
"Mr President, the first human right is the sanctity of life."
"The death penalty is the most disrespectful of all the instances of contempt for dignity, civilisation and progress."
"Right now, at this precise moment, when we are breathing and speaking freely, one man, Troy Davis, is locked up in a cell, counting the minutes left of his life."
"He has been on death row for more than 15 years and has always denied committing the crime he was accused of."
"Some of those who testified against him have recanted or contradicted themselves in their statements, which were obtained under police coercion."
"There is no clear, objective and convincing evidence in this case."
"The application of the death penalty to Troy Davis by the authorities of the State of Georgia runs completely counter to the moratorium on the death penalty adopted last December by the United Nations General Assembly."
"Although the moratorium is not legally binding, it carries enormous moral and political significance."
"It is now up to the States who do not abide by it to review their policy with a view to abolishing the death penalty and respecting human rights in their entirety."
"The State of Georgia now has the opportunity with this case to give the most fundamental values of democracy the substance they deserve once again."
"Commissioner Louis Michel recently heard the President of Sudan himself, Omar al-Bashir, say that he would not hand over those who have been indicted for crimes against humanity to the International Criminal Court, just as the United States does not."
"The United States' example in these two areas is a disgrace, and we have to bring all means available to bear on the United States to show that we cannot accept this stance and the terrible example that is being set for the world in the field of human rights."
"Therefore, as the resolution requests, it is vital that the Presidency of the European Union and the European Commission Delegation in Washington make representations so as to prevent Troy Davis' sentence being carried out and for the United States to effectively review its position on the death penalty."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, in 2007 some 1 252 executions took place in the world, in 24 countries."
"The true number was undoubtedly higher."
"Of those executions, 88% were carried out in China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United States."
"There are two matters I would like to raise in today's debate."
"Firstly, I disagree entirely with what was said by my fellow Member Mr Czarnecki, that this issue is the subject of differences within the European Union."
"That is not the case."
"I would like to remind Mr Czarnecki of the official stance taken in the Roman Catholic Church's doctrine, which was also the personal view of Pope John Paul II, who was against the use of the death penalty."
"It seems to me that that should be a very clear indication to Mr Czarnecki of the stance of the majority on this matter in EU countries."
"The second matter is of course the ongoing situation linked to the situation of Troy Davis in the United States, on whom the death penalty is to be carried out."
"We must do all we can to suspend the execution of this death sentence and to enable a review process to take place, with a possible replacement by a life sentence if he is proven guilty."
"(RO) Over 40 countries have given up the death penalty method since 1990 and, today, over 120 countries have legally prohibited such a penalty."
"At the European level, under the European Convention on Human Rights, which comprises an article 2 on the right to life and protocol 6, article 1, ""Abolition of the death penalty”, no one shall be either condemned to such penalty or executed."
"Shocking statistics have been presented worldwide."
"Over 1591 people were executed in 2006; over 3861 people were sentenced to death in 55 countries."
"I believe that no person has the right to take another human being's life."
"How could you take something that is not yours?"
"According to my reasoning, I cannot even conceive something like that, especially since, in the countries using the death penalty, the number of serious crimes has not decreased thanks to such penalties."
"We propose the replacement of the death penalty with the deprivation of liberty."
"(PL) Mr President, our discussion must of course allude to one fundamental matter, and that is the sense in general terms, as well as the moral aspect, of such court verdicts as sentencing a person to death."
"One of the arguments that I think is very important in this discussion is doubt regarding whether someone who has been accused in an absolutely final way may be recognised as guilty of the deed with which he is charged."
"In any other situation there is always the potential to drop the verdict and return someone to normal life."
"In the case of the death sentence this potential does not exist."
"In view of this, besides the purely moral aspects, exceptionally important though they are, this legal aspect too must be taken into consideration."
"This is particularly the case in the instance we are discussing, where there are major doubts regarding the grounds for the charge."
"(PL) Mr President, everyone should have the right to a fair trial."
"In this case, where there are many doubts about guilt, and seven witnesses have withdrawn their testimony, there is a need for the case to be re-heard."
"A further matter, which those who have risen before me have mentioned, is the problem of the irreversibility of the death sentence."
"If doubts exist, this is all the more reason for not applying such a punishment."
"Mr President, I should like to take the opportunity provided by this debate to call for a moratorium on the death penalty for innocent unborn human beings."
"It is high time civilised countries discontinued the practice of abortion."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the European Union is firmly opposed to the use of the death penalty and actively works towards the abolition of capital punishment worldwide."
"In countries that maintain the death penalty, the EU aims at the progressive restriction of its scope, as well as at the establishment of a moratorium so as to eliminate the death penalty completely."
"The Guidelines to EU Policy Towards Third Countries on the Death Penalty, adopted in 1998 and revised in 2008, set out the framework for EU action."
"They include declarations or demarches in international fora and towards third countries, including the United States of America."
"As regards the USA, the EU is deeply concerned about the resumption of executions since the lifting of the de facto moratorium on the death penalty in May."
"We have repeatedly urged the US Government to reintroduce a moratorium on the death penalty at Federal level and we hope that the United States will consider abolishing the death penalty by law in the foreseeable future."
"We take note of Parliament's motion for a resolution regarding the individual case of Mr Troy Davis."
"We have intelligence from our Washington Delegation that the Governor of Georgia has not yet signed the execution order and that he is apparently in no hurry to do so."
"The Commission, along with EU Member States and the Presidency, will of course follow this case very closely."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"Mr President, reference was made to me earlier by Mr Matsakis and I wanted to respond to it."
"I did not want to abuse the catch-the-eye system on a different debate, which was an important issue on the death penalty."
"But I think he made reference to my not understanding the system of urgencies."
"I would just like to say, for the record, that I have been involved in a number of urgencies and I would say that it is the least transparent and open system we have."
"Of course in my group we have a debate about it, but urgencies are only agreed on the Thursday before Strasbourg and there is an hour-long meeting on the Tuesday before, where urgencies are quickly cobbled together."
"I think that some of these issues are not urgent and should be properly debated in this Parliament to maintain its credibility."
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law(debate)"
"Quorum (continuation)"
"At the start of the sitting this afternoon, therefore, I asked the opinion of at least one representative per group, as I had received a request for the quorum to be established in accordance with Rule 149 of our Rules of Procedure."
"This request was based on a written request from forty Members."
"In fact, to be entirely honest, 39 + 1, because the eleventh name on the list is completely illegible."
"I cannot tell you, we cannot tell you, who the fortieth signatory is on that list."
"After a debate and having received the opinion of the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I took responsibility and I also interpreted Rule 149(4) of our Rules of Procedure, which states that the Members who made a request for the quorum to be established shall be counted as present even if they are no longer in the Chamber."
"I would like to draw your attention to the words 'no longer'."
"It does not say 'are not in the Chamber', but 'are no longer'."
"This implies that they must have been there previously."
"The 'previously' certainly does not refer to the fact that they were present in previous months, but most definitely to when the quorum request was made."
"I therefore specified that before the votes I would check whether the forty signatories were present, even if I was having trouble telling you who the fortieth one was."
"According to the services, five of them are present."
"Having said this, if forty Members now stand up and make a request for the quorum to be established, I will do so."
"Are there forty Members who will stand up and make a request for the quorum to be established?"
"Mr President, could you verify whether there are 40 Members here, because it is very difficult to tell?"
"Mrs Gill, I think that, especially since this afternoon, I am beginning to learn Rule 149 by heart."
"You are referring to paragraph 5."
"It is the job of the President of the sitting, and him alone, if he decides to do so at any time, to establish that a quorum is not present."
"However, given the importance of the votes that we are going to hold, especially on the case of a person sentenced to death, I will not play this little game."
"If forty colleagues do not take responsibility by standing up, I will not establish the quorum."
"Are there forty colleagues who will stand up?"
"I do not see them."
"Therefore we will proceed to the vote."

"(DE) Mr President, just a small thing - that we replace 'at 21 December 2008' with 'for the third week of December 2008'."
"This would then be the exact date."
"It is a small thing, but we should be true to the facts."
"(The oral amendment was accepted)"

"Announcement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to you all."
"I would like to begin with some comments about the situation regarding the plenary chamber in Strasbourg."
"As you know, due to the partial collapse of the false ceiling in the plenary chamber in Strasbourg on 7 August, this first part-session of the European Parliament in September has had, exceptionally, to be held here in Brussels."
"I took this decision with a view to ensuring the greatest possible safety of Members and staff, based on my perusal of the initial expert reports and after consultation with the chairpersons of the groups and the French Council Presidency."
"The decision also takes account of the need to maintain continuity in the European Parliament's legislative work."
"The preliminary findings of the investigations indicate that the partial collapse of the false ceiling was caused by fractures in the building components which connect the suspended ceiling with the actual ceiling structure."
"The investigations are ongoing and are being carried out by several independent international structural engineering firms commissioned by Parliament with a view to establishing further details and responsibilities for the collapse."
"These investigations are being carried out in very close cooperation with the relevant local authorities as well as with a senior buildings safety expert appointed by the French Government."
"The apportionment of responsibility and liability between the contractors involved in the construction of the original ceiling will be established on the basis of the final investigation reports, once they are available."
"The false ceiling in the plenary chamber will now be re-suspended using a new technique which has been approved by the independent experts and the local buildings authorities."
"Although every effort is being made to complete the work as soon as possible, the procedure involved is, of necessity, somewhat lengthy."
"Nonetheless, we hope that all the safety investigations and necessary repairs will be completed in time for the House to hold its September II part-session in Strasbourg."
"May I assure you that safety takes absolute priority in all our considerations and decision-making."

"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 28 August 2008 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"No amendments have been proposed, so the agenda is adopted."
"(DE) Mr President, looking at the agenda and assuming that the debate on Georgia takes place today, we do not have any specific requests."
"However, if there are delays and the sitting overruns, with the result that the debate on Georgia cannot take place until tomorrow, then we would move that the debate on the social package be postponed until the September II part-session for, in my view, it will be impossible for us to debate the social package and Georgia in a single morning."
"I just wanted to give the House advance notice, as it were."
"Thank you, Mr Swoboda."
"There was no interpretation, I believe, particularly into English, if I have identified the colleagues concerned correctly."
"Let me repeat what Mr Swoboda has just said."
"Mr Swoboda said that, if the debate on today's Summit does not take place today but happens tomorrow, the debate on the social package should then be postponed until the September II part-session, as the time allocated for this debate will then be taken up talking about today's Summit."
"That is as I understand it."
"Do we agree on that?"
"It seems we do."
"That brings us to the one-minute speeches on important political issues under Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"We now come to the one-minute speeches on important political issues."
"Mr President, the Beijing Olympics have proved, sadly, that authoritarian regimes are not able or willing to comply with Olympic ideals of respect for human rights and peace."
"Symbolically the Russian authorities preferred to mark the start of the Beijing Olympics by launching an armed invasion of a neighbouring country."
"All this happened in the immediate neighbourhood of the future Sochi Winter Olympics."
"I am convinced that by this unprecedented violation of the territorial integrity of a neighbouring country, and by annexing parts of its territory, the Russian Federation has lost the moral and political justification to host the 2014 Sochi Olympics."
"I call on the International Olympics Committee to designate in the shortest possible time another city to host these Winter Olympics."
"(ES) Mr President, as a Spanish Member resident in the Canary Islands, I want to thank you for remembering the victims of the accident on 20 August."
"I also want to add my condolences. I hope that this type of accident will not occur again and that the European Union will be able to act to guarantee aviation safety."
"(SL) Mr President, the problems of environmental protection and increased energy needs in connection with climate change are a challenge requiring a conscientious approach by all politicians."
"They transcend state borders and national interests."
"The construction of marine gas terminals in enclosed seas, such as the Adriatic, is even more sensitive."
"Terrestrial and marine gas terminals have been planned for the bay of Trieste with an intended location only five miles from the Slovenian coast, right opposite the largest tourist region of Piran."
"If the Italian Government dared, it could locate it in the Venetian Laguna as well, but this would not succeed because the whole of the civilised world would object to it."
"Citizens have the right to object to such a construction, and politicians must respect their wishes and make up for the democratic deficit in the European Union."
"We have neglected the environment too often to allow ourselves to do such a thing again."
"The Italian Government should be given a clear message about it from the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I wanted to raise with you quite a serious case about a Sri Lankan journalist, Mr J. S. Tissainayagam, which we raised on our recent delegation visit to Sri Lanka."
"He is a very well-known writer and journalist and has been running, amongst other things, a German-Government-funded website called 'Outreach' promoting peace and justice."
"At that point he had been detained without charge for over four months in poor conditions, and he was finally charged and remanded in custody last week under the country's Prevention of Terrorism Act, with charges related to bringing the government into disrepute and stirring up communal disharmony."
"We would ask you, Mr President, to use your good offices with Council and Commission to follow this important case, not least to see to it that he be able to meet his lawyers in private - which he has not been able to do yet - and that there will be full disclosure of the evidence against him."
"Our officials will follow the case."
"(PL) Mr President, Russia is one of our main political and economic partners."
"In recent days, however, Russia has made intimidating statements against the Union, threatening it with the Russian economic and military might."
"Countries involved in the European Neighbourhood Policy have received similar threats."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in the context of a partnership, is it normal practice for one of the partners to resort to such action?"
"I have in mind, in particular, our shared interests, namely the construction of oil and gas pipelines."
"The European Community is home to 500 million citizens and is the largest economy in the world."
"The fact that a country with significantly less potential can ride roughshod over the Union indicates that we are being treated as a weak partner incapable of taking serious political decisions."
"It is just as well that the Lisbon Treaty is not in force because if it were, even individual Member States of the Union would be denied the opportunity to give an honourable response."
"Thank you."
"The Lisbon Treaty is explicit: I would ask you to bear with me as I have just made the same point in my speech to the European Council."
"Solidarity between the Member States in the energy sphere is a principle laid down in the Lisbon Treaty."
"This means that should one EU Member State be faced with a threat to cut off its energy supplies, all the other Member States would have a duty to support it."
"For this reason, it is particularly important that the Lisbon Treaty be ratified."
"I apologise for reiterating the point, but the Treaty is very important for the energy sphere in particular."
"Mr President, I should like to take this time to point out the effect that the implementation of the Energy-using Products Directive will have on a company in my constituency that has expertise in this heating field."
"They inform me that the current proposal for implementation in relation to boilers will have a severe and unnecessary impact on Ireland's central heating industry, which employs many people in my constituency."
"Current proposals for boilers will require manufacturers to apply an energy-rating label to the boiler, as well as heating controls, pumps and some renewables."
"These labelling proposals overlook the key role of the professional installer."
"Installers are a vital part of the heating supply chain, and the Commission's approach will mean their expertise will be largely ignored or wasted."
"The Commission's proposals will fundamentally change the entire Irish domestic heating market, with wider implications in terms of restricted choice, misleading information for consumers, higher costs and a less flexible and competitive market, as well as loss of employment."
"Ahead of the Commission's Consultation Forum, I should like the Commission to listen to the experts when considering the effects of this directive on Ireland."
"(ES) Mr President, I too want to add my thanks for the formal statement made by the Chamber on the grave accident that occurred on 20 August at Barajas Airport and which led to 155 deaths."
"However, I also think it is perhaps time, ladies and gentlemen, for us to question whether all the airlines are strictly applying all the European directives on safety and maintenance."
"I think the time has come, and I make this request from this House, for the European Commission to critically review the level of compliance in terms of aviation safety, particularly in the area of aircraft maintenance."
"I therefore believe that this is the time, not only for sorrow, of course, and solidarity, of course, but also to critically review the level of compliance with the European directives on aviation safety and maintenance of European aircraft."
"Mr President, the EU often shows interest, with good intention, in my constituency of Northern Ireland."
"However, I wish to warn it against funding a project of immense divisive potential."
"I refer to the foolish embracing by the EU task force, at the behest of the DUP and Sinn Fein leaders of the Northern Ireland Executive, of possible support for a so-called 'conflict transformation centre' at the site of the former Maze prison."
"However it is dressed up and whatever spin is deployed, the preservation of the H-block section, including the hospital wing, would become a shrine to the terrorists who committed suicide in the Maze in the 1980s."
"That would be obnoxious to the vast majority of people, and is something that Unionists, whom I represent, would not accept."
"I would therefore caution the Commission against meddling with such an explosive issue and against being used by those anxious to hide behind the EU to deliver something which will severely set back relations in Northern Ireland."
"(RO) Following the Russian Parliament's recognition of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, the settlement of the Dniester conflict regarding the issue of Transnistria has entered a new phase."
"It is obvious for each of us that Russia's foreign policy has changed following the Russian Parliament's decision and, consequently, a repositioning is required at the level of the entire Union by taking into account this reality."
"Taking into consideration that the issue of Transnistria, a region close to the European Union's Eastern border, is of high interest for all Member States and in particular for Romania, I consider a decisive involvement at Community level to be necessary in order to avoid needless tense relations between the countries and entities that have declared interests in this region."
"Taking into consideration that Natalia Timakova, Dimitri Medvedev's spokeswoman, announced that several meetings shall take place, with participation of all interested parties, including with the Tiraspol representatives, it could be important to examine here the possibility of establishing a committee to determine and present the Community point of view in this matter."
"A recent study of the European Council on Foreign Relations shows that, following the events in Georgia, the negotiations for the Moldova-Transnistria agreement shall be much harder."
"Mr President, Georgia is not just another international crisis to which the EU has to respond."
"It signals Russia's military comeback, heralded by its offensive energy supply policy initiated in 2006."
"The EU is caught between principles and economic interests."
"Upholding the former would imply a readiness to sacrifice the latter."
"Conversely, giving priority to the latter would imply a major loss of face."
"In its turn, Russia is equally caught between the profits from its energy sales to the West and respect for international legality."
"The latter cannot be disrespected with impunity."
"That is the message our leaders should convey to Moscow loudly and clearly."
"It would be a major waste for the entire international community if Russia chose to invest its newly-acquired energies in a futile attempt to restore the bipolar world, instead of associating itself with shaping the new, multipolar, globalised one."
"(RO) I will speak about the blockage of Sapard payments for Romania and its short and medium-term effects."
"A European Commission mission of June 2008 visited Bulgaria and Romania and ordered the suspension of payments in Sapard projects."
"It requested actions to remedy procedures deemed non-compliant and, in Romania, the authorities directly involved and responsible proposed an action plan to remedy the problems, which was accepted."
"Nevertheless, difficulties have only begun now."
"National payments will be resumed, probably in September, by implementing procedures related to the manner of making payments and with an independent audit, which may last for one year, ensuring that they are compliant and with the major risk that money could be lost permanently, unfortunately in a region that was seriously affected by floods this summer."
"If the twelve previous audit missions found no irregularities, if deficiencies are not fundamental, I wonder and I ask the European Commission if sometimes savings from the agriculture budget are not more important than the Sapard projects and their results."
"I see only one solution, namely to accept the deadline extension by one more year."
"Mr President, there are threatening signs of the revival of racism, homophobia and anti-Semitism in many countries of the EU."
"The peaceful Pride Festival in Budapest this summer was brutally attacked by extreme right-wing groups, and stones and eggs filled with acid were thrown at the participants."
"Many of them were injured."
"After that shameful event, the Hungarian Prime Minister has initiated a Hungarian Charter, and here in the European Parliament I would like to launch a European Charter with my colleagues Michael Cashman and Edit Bauer."
"We condemn all kinds of violence."
"We cannot allow the formation of extreme organisations that want to practise their own idea of justice."
"We reject the rebirth of fascist ideas and prejudice against all kinds of minorities, and we strongly reject all forms of racism."
"We should act together against violence and intimidation with the help of legislation and also by setting a good example in our everyday lives."
"That is why I would like to ask for support for the European Charter here in Parliament as well."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe was founded on the conviction that it was no longer possible to guarantee well-being, freedom, democracy and peace on the basis of national sovereignty."
"However, we are condemning the Georgians, who cast off the suffocating yoke of dictatorship in the name of Europe and with hopes of Europe, we are condemning them to national independence, while much of Europe is now kowtowing to Moscow and Putin's politics in a most cowardly fashion, and preparing to do likewise with China."
"Our problem today is that we cannot carry on condemning Georgia, Turkey, Israel and Morocco - whose king asked to join the European Union in 1985 - we certainly cannot condemn them to something that we ourselves rejected, leading to our salvation!"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite substantial efforts and worldwide initiatives to secure justice for the former head of Yukos, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and his business partner, Platon Lebedev, their fate remains unchanged."
"'Freedom is better than unfreedom' said the newly elected President Medvedev."
"That should be the basis for Russia's future, along with a reform of the judicial system and a much-needed improvement in prison conditions."
"Unfortunately, the latest ruling in the Khodorkovsky case shows that hopes for more rule of law in Russia are not being fulfilled."
"The recent military policy decisions in respect of Georgia and NATO also indicate that, with the new Putin-Medvedev duo in power, a new Ice Age has begun, not only in the domestic but also in the foreign policy arena."
"We really do need to be alert to that."
"(PL) Mr President, I should like to refer to an incident that has caused considerable distress to my fellow citizens."
"In the course of a debate on criminality in a committee of the British House of Commons, a senior representative of the British police stated that all Poles carry a knife, because it is part of their culture to carry one, and that they need to be re-educated."
"I should like to make it clear that, although I am a Pole, I do not myself carry a knife and that the standard use of a knife in my culture is in conjunction with a fork for the purpose of eating a meal."
"It is unfortunate that such a statement was made, particularly as the large number of my fellow citizens living in the British Isles are far more likely to be the victims of crime than its perpetrators."
"Indeed, all collective allegations ascribing any kind of negative characteristics to any nation whatsoever are expressions of intolerance. No such allegation should ever be made in a Member State of the European Union."
"(PT) The media in Portugal has in recent days reported a further 312 redundancies at Yasaki in Ovar."
"Together with this latest round of redundancies, in the last year and a half Yasaki Saltano has made nearly 1 200 people redundant at the Ovar and Vila Nova de Gaia units."
"This poses a serious social problem in an area where there are few alternative jobs and where unemployment is constantly on the increase."
"However, this is also a real scandal, bearing in mind that this multinational has received millions of euros in Community funds to invest in Portugal."
"The people suffering from the change in its business strategy are the workers and residents of the areas where its plants are located."
"We must prevent these situations from being systematically repeated."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after yesterday's Sunday service in my home town, our Indian priest reported on the atrocities being committed in his home country."
"For the last week, Christians in the state of Orissa in East India have been subjected to a campaign of persecution, humiliation, abuse and murder."
"By the end of last week, this had left 26 people dead, with 41 churches destroyed, four monasteries in flames and many Christian homes in ruins."
"People are taking refuge in the forests, praying for safety from the Hindu fanatics."
"This is not the first attack on Christians, which is why some 60 000 Christians in Orissa have now fled their homes."
"The present conflict was triggered by the murder of a spiritual leader and member of the World Hindu Council on 23 August."
"Father Saji from my village has asked our parish to pray for the victims, but we can do more than that."
"I utterly condemn these crimes against humanity."
"The European Parliament must urge the Indian Government to guarantee the right to life and liberty of Christians in Orissa."
"(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, Transnistria has recognised the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"As far as the separatist Transnistria area of Moldova is concerned, this overheating has much to do with a frozen conflict."
"South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Transnistria are in a similar position - for years Russia has been refusing to withdraw its forces from there."
"The President of Moldova has said that Transnistria resembles a volcano which, like the events in Georgia, could begin erupting at any time."
"Russia has told President Voronin that it is interested in an agreement under which Transnistria would be treated as an autonomous region of Moldova."
"As such, if necessary, Transnistria could legitimately separate from Moldova following a referendum."
"It is vital to bring the 5+2 partners to the negotiating table: we cannot allow Medvedev and Voronin to resolve the conflict between them."
"As head of the Moldova delegation I strenuously urge preventive action on Transnistria."
"Transnistria should have an international peace-keeping force; we should offer Moldova a plan for closer partnership and allow Moldovans to enter the European Union without visas."
"Mr President, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided in July 2007 to grant the right to host the 2014 Winter Olympics to Sochi, Russia."
"Following the Russian aggression against Georgia, United States Congressmen Allyson Schwartz and Bill Shuster made an announcement that, as soon as the US Congress returns from its summer vacation, there will be a US Congress resolution calling on the IOC to designate a new venue for the 2014 Olympic Games."
"It is quite clear that, if the Olympic Games were to be held in Sochi, countries would boycott the event, just as in Moscow 1980 following the Soviet military invasion of Afghanistan."
"That would strike the Olympic movement much harder than selecting a new host for the 2014 Olympics now."
"Therefore it is time for the European Parliament to act."
"Otherwise we might once again be facing the idea of holding the Olympics in an authoritarian and aggressive country that respects neither human rights, civil liberties nor the Olympic Charter."
"(HU) Mr President, in connection with the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Traian Băsescu, the President of Romania, has lashed out violently at the collective rights of minorities since, in his opinion, they would lead to the collapse of some states."
"The European Community's concerns about the crisis in the Caucasus, the imperialist aggression and menace of Russia, and the dangers facing Ukraine and Moldova are justified."
"However, over and above any interests of great powers, and despite the endeavours of all separatists, a real, peaceful solution could ensure collective human and national rights, as well as full autonomy."
"According to Andreas Gross, rapporteur for the Council of Europe, autonomy is the most effective antidote against separatism."
"President Băsescu should not worry, because the Hungarians in Transylvania do not want to separate from Romania, in the same way as Tibet does not want to separate from China; they are merely striving to achieve their collective rights and autonomy."
"Mr President, during the summer break in Northern Ireland, the region I come from, we suffered very heavy falls of rain during the month of August."
"While many areas suffered, there were flash floods washing away topsoil, destroying many hectares of potatoes and flattening grain."
"I visited some of the areas that were worst affected, and what I witnessed was a pitiful sight for those who had worked so hard to try and produce food at this time, with road and bridges washed away as well as some livestock being lost."
"Now farmers are well used to battling the weather to survive, but on this occasion these small areas could and should be helped."
"In Europe we have the Solidarity Fund that should be made available to the Northern Ireland Executive by the Commission, and I would ask you to write to the head of the Commission, to contact the Office of the First Minister in Northern Ireland to see how best it can help."
"(PL) Mr President, today is the anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War."
"I believe it is an appropriate occasion on which to call on you and on all MEPs to support the call for 25 May to be declared an international day devoted to honouring those who fought heroically against totalitarianism."
"The choice of the date of 25 May is not accidental."
"On 25 May 1948 the Communists murdered Captain Witold Pilecki. The Captain was the only person to go to a concentration camp voluntarily, in order to organise resistance inside the latter and gather information on the mass murders taking place."
"After spending more than two years in Auschwitz, he escaped and subsequently fought in the Warsaw Uprising."
"He remained in Poland after the fall of the Nazis in order to oppose the next totalitarian regime, namely the Soviet one. This decision eventually cost him his life."
"People like Witold Pilecki deserve to be remembered."
"As the democratically elected representatives of Europe, we have it in our power to establish a day on which to honour their memory."
"Let us hope that, once the date of 25 May is set aside for that purpose, we will only need to remember past struggles against genocide and that the tragedy of totalitarianism will never be re-enacted."
"(BG) President, colleagues, at the beginning of July Filip Dimitrov, our first democratically elected prime minister of Bulgaria, retired from politics."
"Filip Dimitrov was among the founders of democratic opposition in Bulgaria, he took over the governance of the state from the disintegrated communist regime in the beginning of the 1990s, was a representative in the European parliament and, finally, Deputy Chairman of the Bulgarian National Assembly."
"In all the eighteen years when Mr. Dimitrov was in politics, to all of us who knew him, he served as an example of honesty, openness and a man who to the very depths of his soul believes in the European, Euro-Atlantic choice of our country, in the freedom of speech, in democracy and human rights."
"I am convinced that in spite of his retirement from politics, with his advice and with his experience he will continue to help all of us return to our state the image it deserves to have because of the efforts of people like Filip Dimitrov."
"(ES) Mr President, my speech concerns an issue that has not been mentioned."
"In Cuba, dissidents and people who do not agree with the dictatorship are being arbitrarily detained on a frequent basis."
"The latest detention was that of Gorki Águila, leader of a rock band, who has now fortunately been released."
"However, I want to bring to the President's attention the fact that these arbitrary acts of the Cuban dictatorship must be reported and publicised to prevent them from being repeated."
"I therefore invite the President, when he has the opportunity, to inform the Cuban Government and the Cuban Embassy to the European Union of our dissatisfaction and disagreement with such actions."
"Mr President, the consumer rights of air passengers travelling from third countries who are transiting through EU hub airports are being breached."
"Thousands of EU citizens continue to have their liquid duty-free purchases confiscated because of the failure of the Commission to speedily implement Regulation (EC) No 915/2007, which amends Regulation (EC) No 622/2003 laying down measures for the implementation of the common basic standards on aviation security."
"Thirteen non-EU countries have applied for recognition under the Regulation, but only one has been approved."
"I would appeal through you, Mr President, to again ask our new Commissioner, Antonio Tajani, to sort this issue out and implement the regulation as quickly as possible."
"Many competitors at the Olympic Games in Beijing - and, indeed, their supporters and families - had goods taken from them transiting back through the main hub airports in Europe when coming home."
"Again, the complaints have been coming in in their dozens."
"Please sort this out."
"It is not in the interests of consumer rights, and it is a farce if we are quoting security reasons."
"(DE) Madam President, on 14 August 2008 the departure time of a Ryanair flight from Austria to the United Kingdom was postponed until the following day."
"The company then guaranteed that they would reimburse passengers' hotel and transfer costs and, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, an information leaflet was distributed, pointing out passengers' rights in the event of a flight being delayed or cancelled."
"When one passenger applied to Ryanair to refund the additional costs, the airline refused to pay, without giving any precise reasons for its decision."
"Ryanair's refusal to pay is a clear contravention of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 which specifies the assistance to be provided for air passengers throughout the EU."
"In the event of a delay, or more particularly the postponement of a flight until the following day, passengers have a right to compensation which is regulated by law."
"Low-cost airlines such as Ryanair must also comply with the law and adhere to the Regulation."
"This type of thing is happening more and more frequently, at European air passengers' expense, and it really is time that the European Commission took some action."
"(PL) Madam President, 87 years ago Lenin, the then leader of world Communism and of the Soviet Union, took the decision to separate three regions from Georgia."
"South Ossetia and Abkhazia were two of those regions. Almost 90 years later, Georgia and Europe are paying a high price for this decision."
"It so happens that today's sitting of the European Parliament coincides with a meeting of the European Council."
"We therefore have the opportunity to say loud and clear to the Union's leaders that, in the name of the freedom of nations and of human rights, we cannot condone Russian aggression against Georgia."
"Like the Soviet attack on Hungary in 1956 and its later attack on Czechoslovakia in 1968, this is a notable case of a large state invading a small one during the period following the Second World War."
"It is, however, the first case in the last 60 years in which a large country has appropriated part of a small one through military action."
"After all, the declaration of the so-called independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia is merely an act of political theatre, choreographed by Mr Putin."
"The European Parliament should today declare its solidarity with Georgia and, more generally, with all the nations of the Caucasus."
"(HU) Thank you for the floor, Madam President."
"Hungarian public opinion witnessed a remarkable manifestation right in the middle of the Georgian crisis."
"The Russian ambassador to Budapest made a considerably undiplomatic declaration against the leader of the opposition, Viktor Orbán, since Mr Orbán stood up for Georgia."
"The Russian ambassador - this cannot be described any other way - threatened the Hungarian opposition, and thereby most of Hungarian society, with the malevolence of the Russian state."
"It is not difficult to decipher the coded message: whoever votes for FIDESZ must face the disapproval of the Russians."
"His Excellency's message is undisguised interference in Hungarian internal affairs, and thus in the democratic system of one of the Member States of the European Union."
"Of course, Hungary is not alone, and nearly all the former Communist states have received similar threats, which threaten the whole of Europe."
"Madam President, despite Ireland's military neutrality, Ireland is not neutral, or indeed unconcerned, about the crisis that has erupted in Georgia."
"There is deep public concern that powerful people on all sides seem to want a new Cold War, and worry about the self-destructive talk of sanctions against Russia."
"Knee-jerk reactions will not build or guarantee peace or justice for the people of the region, or indeed anywhere else."
"Essentially, Russia has fired a warning shot across our bows."
"The EU's response must be to use its resources to build new EU institutions capable of negotiating binding multilateral agreements."
"We must seek to build a new peaceful world in partnership with Russia, not in opposition to it."
"That concludes the item."
"European Judicial Network - Strengthening of Eurojust and amendment of Decision 2002/187/JHA - Application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments in criminal matters (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"by Mrs Kaufmann, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the European Judicial Network (05620/2008 - C6-0074/2008 -;"
"by Mrs Weber, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the strengthening of Eurojust and amendment of Decision 2002/187/JHA (05613/2008 - C6-0076/2008 -;"
"by Mr França, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments in criminal matters (05598/2008 - C6-0075/2008 -."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to speak to you today and to tell you about my deep attachment to the values of the European Union."
"At the heart of these values, without doubt, is justice."
"You wanted to start your part-session with a joint debate on justice issues."
"This shows the importance that this House places on the issues of European judicial cooperation and protection of fundamental rights."
"I am just as keen on these issues and thank you for this opportunity."
"Three texts are on the agenda, as recalled by your President: the decision on the European Judicial Network, the decision on Eurojust and the framework decision on the enforcement of decisions rendered in absentia."
"These three texts will improve judicial cooperation within the European Union and will also alter the way in which the Member States work."
"These three initiatives are also eagerly awaited by those working within justice in our countries."
"The work of the JHA Council on 25 July has allowed a political agreement to be reached on the draft decisions on the European Judicial Network and the strengthening of Eurojust."
"The combined efforts of the Slovenian Presidency and the French Presidency have brought this about in under a year."
"These two draft decisions will give greater protection to Europe's citizens and strengthen judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"That is the mark of a European Union that can act and make progress while taking account of freedoms and fundamental rights."
"As regards the European Judicial Network, the draft decision which should replace the 1998 Joint Action clarifies the obligations of Eurojust and the Network."
"It takes account of the wish of Member States to maintain both bodies and to reinforce their complementarity."
"The creation of secure methods of communication between Eurojust and the European Judicial Network will ensure effective judicial cooperation and greater mutual trust."
"The European Judicial Network is a well-known and recognised tool and has proven its usefulness in encouraging contacts between those involved on the ground. The report by Sylvia Kaufmann stresses the usefulness of the Network and its success."
"It highlights the Network's adaptability which meets the needs, in particular, of magistrates."
"This report further underlines the need to retain this flexibility and decentralised structure."
"Mrs Kaufmann, you have taken on board and supported the main lines of the original proposal for which I thank you."
"You have also raised some concerns."
"You have rightly said that secure telecommunications should be established in strict compliance with data protection rules. We absolutely agree."
"I can assure you that the Council will pay close attention to the proposals adopted by Parliament."
"This assessment of the operation of the European Judicial Network goes hand-in-hand with the strengthening of Eurojust."
"One cannot exist without the other."
"After six years of Eurojust, experience shows that we need to improve the operation of this judicial cooperation unit."
"Eurojust is not sufficiently well-informed, particularly on terrorism matters."
"The powers of the national members are not harmonised and the operational capacity of Eurojust is not sufficiently well-developed."
"The text on which overall political agreement was reached on 25 July is a vital stage in the construction of the European judicial area."
"You will be well aware that the fight against all forms of serious crime is one of the European Union's priorities."
"As an example, in 2004 fourteen cases on the trafficking of human beings were referred to Eurojust; in 2007 there were seventy-one cases referred."
"This shows that we must have effective tools for combating the trafficking on an unparalleled scale to which thousands of our citizens are falling victim."
"Eurojust must also become a leading unit in European judicial cooperation."
"Thanks to this text on which the JHA Council has agreed, Eurojust will be more operational and reactive. This is therefore an important step forward for us."
"I particularly want to congratulate the work of Renate Weber and to thank her for her support."
"I am well aware of her commitment and her desire to make this proposal succeed."
"With the strengthening of Eurojust, the prerogatives of the national members will be reinforced."
"An emergency coordination cell will be established and the transmission of information will be improved to better respond to the challenges posed by the new forms of crime. Some would have preferred an even more ambitious approach."
"As the institutional framework does not allow this, we must take advantage of every possibility to reinforce Eurojust, on the basis of established law and without delay."
"Some of your concerns have also been taken into account."
"The reporting to Parliament on Eurojust's operation in this respect will be looked at closely."
"As regards the application of the principle of mutual recognition, which is also one of the pivotal aspects in the construction of an area of justice, freedom and security, the framework decision on the enforcement of decisions rendered in absentia will allow existing instruments, such as the European arrest warrant, to be reinforced."
"It is vital that a decision rendered in a person's absence by a Member State can be enforced throughout the European Union."
"The framework decision will also be accompanied by a reinforcement of people's procedural rights."
"This involves allowing sentences delivered in absentia to be enforced while respecting the right of defence."
"However, this framework decision does not aim to amend national rules but rather to improve the enforcement of decisions rendered in absentia."
"Your report, Mr França, underlines the need to harmonise the existing instruments and that the right to be heard during proceedings must be guaranteed."
"The diversity of legal systems must be respected, for example with regard to how a person is summoned."
"The Council shares these concerns and the draft proposal therefore relaunches the joint debate on strengthening fundamental guarantees within the European Union."
"I know that your Parliament is deeply attached to this issue."
"The Council will examine your proposals which, in the main, are along the same lines as the text which has been the subject of political agreement in the Council."
"This is the case in particular with the proposals on representation by a legal counsellor and the right to a retrial."
"These amendments are undoubtedly improvements on the original proposal."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council will study closely the proposals that will be adopted this week and I must once again assure you of the Presidency's desire to work with your Parliament."
"We must move forward hand-in-hand and I will never forget that you are the representatives of the European people."
"Through these three texts, progress will be made in terms of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and also the common good in Europe."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) As you have just said, Mrs Dati, we are at a critical point in the formation of this European judicial area which we want with all our hearts and to which the European Parliament is making a vital contribution."
"I want to thank the rapporteurs, Mrs Kaufmann, Mrs Weber and Mr França, for their excellent reports on the three initiatives."
"These documents show that the European Parliament supports the proposals made by the Member States."
"I am also delighted, Mrs Dati, that the Council meeting on 25 July proved to be so fruitful, with a political agreement on the three texts."
"The Commission supports these three initiatives and we have endeavoured to contribute constructively to the Council's work."
"As regards Eurojust and the European Judicial Network, the Member States, taking inspiration from our communication of October 2007 on the subject, have clearly shown their desire for convergence."
"Many proposals have been included in these two Member-State initiatives: harmonising the powers of the national members of Eurojust, reinforcing the role of the College in the event of conflicts of jurisdiction, improving the circulation of information from national members to Eurojust, and the possibility of appointing Eurojust liaison magistrates to third countries."
"Many of the amendments proposed in the extremely useful reports of Mrs Kaufmann and Mrs Weber have already been taken on board during the Council discussions."
"Accordingly, Amendment 32 to the Eurojust decision, appearing in Mrs Weber's report, aims to improve the level of data protection in third countries cooperating with Eurojust."
"This cooperation will be evaluated not only when the agreement is concluded, but also after its entry into force."
"The Commission suggested taking up this idea and the draft decision was amended accordingly."
"It states that the cooperation agreement must include provisions on the monitoring of its application, including the application of data protection provisions."
"I will cite another example: Amendment 38 to the 'European Judicial Network' decision, as set out in Mrs Kaufmann's report."
"As highlighted by Mrs Dati, this amendment aims to ensure that a report is made to the European Parliament every two years on the activities of the European Judicial Network."
"This amendment was supported by the Commission and is included in the text of the draft decision."
"As you know, the Council has reached political agreement on the Eurojust and Network initiatives."
"I hope that the Council will soon formally adopt these instruments and, just as important, that the Member States will take the necessary steps to fully implement the decisions in their national legal systems."
"As regards the França report on the enforcement of decisions rendered in absentia, I note that most of the amendments, at least in their spirit, if not also in their wording, are already included in the text adopted by the JHA Council on 5 and 6 June."
"These are just a few of my observations, Madam President."
"I will obviously pay close attention to all Parliament's suggestions."
"However, I am very happy that we are starting this part-session with work that is extremely positive for the future of the European judicial area."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, I should like to make use of my full allocation of speaking time now, if I may."
"I am pleased to see that the President-in-Office of the Council and the Vice-President of the Commission are here today."
"The Committee adopted my report on the European Judicial Network unanimously."
"The cooperation was very constructive and I should like to thank everyone involved, especially Mr Popa, Mrs Gebhardt and Mrs Weber, the rapporteur on Eurojust."
"The European Judicial Network - or EJN for short - has been in existence for 10 years and has proved its worth in practice."
"Even after the launch of Eurojust in 2002, the EJN remains relevant."
"The EJN is not about coordinating investigations; it is about facilitating direct contacts, the proper execution of mutual legal assistance requests and the provision of information."
"It is important, therefore, to leave the EJN's decentralised structure untouched."
"Changes should only be made where necessary, or where such changes arise naturally from the practice applied over recent years."
"One example is the establishment of national contact points which play a coordinating role within the Member States and are responsible for maintaining contact with the EJN Secretariat."
"A key innovation is the establishment of a secure telecommunications network."
"I was delighted to hear that the President-in-Office of the Council has also drawn attention to this issue."
"Personal data are exchanged between authorities in the Member States, and this can include sensitive data such as fingerprints under a European arrest warrant."
"In order to ensure secure transmission in this case, a secure telecommunications network is needed for it would be unacceptable for such data to be transmitted by fax, for example."
"As early as 1998, when the EJN was established, a secure telecommunications network was envisaged, but it has been impossible, so far, to agree on the modalities, apparently on grounds of cost."
"The report proposes that safe telecommunications be established, initially, for the contact points alone."
"However, given that the aim is to ensure that, as far as possible, all contacts between the competent authorities take place on a direct basis, a second step envisages integrating all the relevant authorities responsible for legal assistance in their respective Member State into the secure telecommunications network."
"Due to the sensitivity of the data, the report makes reference to the relevant data protection provisions, and I would emphasise once more, in this context, how important it is to have a strong framework decision on the protection of personal data within the framework of the third pillar."
"This would apply to the exchange of data between the various contact points of the Member States."
"Regrettably, the Council has yet to adopt such a framework decision as lex generalis, so basic data protection provisions have been included directly in the legal text itself."
"The EJN's functionality largely depends on the contact points."
"For that reason, guidelines have been drawn up for the selection of contact points based on specific criteria."
"Persons acting as contact points should certainly have good foreign language skills in at least one other EU language and should have gained experience in international cooperation in criminal matters as well as have served as a judge, public prosecutor or other official in the justice system."
"It is important that these guidelines are complied with by the Member States and, of course, they must also ensure that the contact points are adequately resourced."
"In order to improve cooperation between the EJN and Eurojust and achieve better coordination of their activities, members of Eurojust should be able to attend EJN meetings by invitation and vice versa."
"The Eurojust decision states when the Member States' judicial authorities - in other words the EJN contact points - must inform Eurojust about specific cases."
"The present decision supplements this obligation to the effect that the EJN and Eurojust must inform each other on a reciprocal basis about all cases on which they take the view that the other organisation is better able to deal with these."
"Using this flexible and needs-based rule, the aim is to avoid a situation in which national authorities have to provide overly extensive information to Eurojust and also avoid 'swamping' Eurojust with information which the authority simply cannot process."
"Finally, as regards reporting on the administration and activities of the Network, this should be carried out by the EJN itself, not only to Council and the Commission but also to Parliament."
"I am pleased that this approach is expressly supported by the Commission."
"With the present decision, the European Judicial Network will be adapted to the developments that have taken place over recent years, and its relationship to Eurojust defined in more precise terms."
"As a result, the European Judicial Network will be better able to fulfil its remit in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters, especially in the event that the Lisbon Treaty does come into force, with the ensuing communitisation of judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, conceiving of the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice would be nothing but a remarkable goal without the involvement of the already-established European agencies, whose capacities to act and react to combat organised cross-border crime should become stronger."
"I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, with whom I have worked very well on nearly all aspects of this report, and also the President of Eurojust and his team for their openness during this process."
"While drawing up this report, I heard many colleagues call for a European prosecutor."
"In this respect, I am much more in favour of harmonisation and the setting-up of a European justice system than of reinforcing cooperation."
"However, for a number of reasons we are, for the time being, still pretty far from such a goal: firstly, because there is no European legislation addressing the issue of jurisdiction in cases that are the competence of Eurojust; secondly, because of the reluctance shown by Member States even to transfer some of their investigative powers to a European agency."
"The text on the possibility of Eurojust's national members being part of a joint investigation teams provides a good example."
"It is a paradox that while the Members of the European Parliament are ready to truly address serious cross-border crime - including by granting more powers to Eurojust, with our major concern being respect for human rights - the Member States are preaching one thing but legislating in another."
"It is difficult to explain to European citizens how we can establish an area of freedom, security and justice if Member States do not sufficiently trust our own European agencies."
"We as a Parliament understand and agree with the fact that Eurojust must work 24 hours a day, seven days a week."
"The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has also agreed that in order for Eurojust to be efficient it is essential for its national members to have the same judicial powers they enjoy in their own countries."
"It also voted in favour of strengthening relations with Europol and the European judicial network, and of creating links with other European and international agencies, such as Frontex, Interpol and the World Customs Organisation."
"What we as Members of this Parliament require - and the report is a reflection of this approach - is a proper balance between the powers of Eurojust and those of its national members, on the one hand, and the rights of the defendant, on the other."
"That is why several of the amendments I have tabled aim to increase the level of protection of procedural rights, such as the right to defence, the right to a fair trial, the right to be informed and the right to judicial redress."
"At the same time, although we are aware of the strong data-protection system established by the agency, several amendments represent additional safeguards."
"However, a major concern still exists about data transmitted to third countries and international organisations, because the truth is that we do not know, in reality, what will happen to this data."
"Therefore, in order to make sure that our own European standards are observed, I propose setting up an evaluation mechanism."
"I should like to thank Commissioner Barrot for mentioning this."
"Last but not least, I am concerned about the role that the European Parliament should play in relation to Eurojust."
"Not knowing what the fate of the Lisbon Treaty will be makes things even more worrisome."
"However, there is nothing in current Community law to prevent Parliament from playing an active role in supervising the activities of Eurojust."
"It is entirely a matter of political will, and I truly hope that this House will be allowed to do its job."
"rapporteur. - (PT) Madam President, Madam Dati, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the process of European construction initially involved the communitisation of the economic area."
"However, step by step, the Community, this method idealised by Jean Monnet and its founders, has advanced into other areas in order to find common solutions to common problems."
"We have not yet reached the end of this long and difficult road, but must continue taking firm and decisive steps."
"One of the areas that causes us all complex and difficult problems within the European Union, now enlarged to 27 Member States and occupied by nearly 500 million people, is justice."
"Justice is one of the pillars of democracy and one of the instruments at the service of freedom."
"Democracy and freedom are two of the EU's fundamental values."
"As a result, due to the challenges posed by the process of European construction itself and due to the new problems of modern life, justice has now, in my opinion, assumed critical importance."
"It demands particular attention from those of the EU's institutions with responsibility for legislating, making decisions and giving political guidelines on this issue."
"Decisions rendered in the absence of defendants in criminal proceedings, known as decisions in absentia, have different procedural solutions which vary a great deal from Member State to Member State."
"The situation is serious as these different procedural solutions form a permanent obstacle to the enforcement in one Member State of criminal decisions rendered in another Member State."
"This situation hinders, or even prevents, the application of the principle of mutual recognition and encourages an increase in crime and insecurity within the Union."
"We therefore welcome the legislative initiative of Slovenia, France, the Czech Republic, Sweden, the Slovak Republic, the United Kingdom and Germany, as received and welcomed by the Council."
"Its main aim is to lay down procedural rules on summoning people, retrials or appropriate appeals and legal representation."
"These rules will make criminal proceedings quicker and more efficient."
"They will also increase the effectiveness of the principle of mutual recognition, particularly in terms of the European arrest warrant and surrender procedures between Member States, and also the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties, confiscation orders and judgments in criminal matters imposing custodial sentences and other measures involving deprivation of freedom for the purpose of their enforcement in the European Union."
"The recognition and supervision of suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences must also be included."
"The report that I am presenting to the House today includes contributions from a large number of members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Various amendments were proposed by myself or by other colleagues, resulting in numerous compromise amendments and a firm consensus between Members of the PSE, PPE, ALDE, Verts/ALE and UEN Groups, such that there were only two votes against this report."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this report therefore contains amendments to the proposal for a Council framework decision which, in our opinion, technically enrich this and make it politically robust, particularly with regard to the procedures for summoning defendants and the guarantee of their rights of defence, the possibility of the defendant being represented in his absence and being represented by a legal counsellor appointed and paid by the State and also the possibility of a retrial or appropriate appeal, in accordance with national laws, to be instigated by the defendant already judged in absentia."
"Finally, I must highlight and express my thanks for the understanding and consensus of the political groups and I hope, and wish, that the outcome of the vote will at least match the broad consensus achieved."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - Madam President, I welcome these reports, especially the one on in absentia, because it will make it easier and simpler for those who have to defend or take legal action where one or the other party is not able to be present."
"Differences in approach across the Union have created a degree of uncertainty and have undermined confidence in each other's judicial systems."
"I therefore welcome the statement made by the Minister that the Council will try and ensure that this process is harmonised across all Member States, because to date some Member States have not made every effort to contact the defendants."
"I believe that the onus has to be on the judicial system, wherever it is, to ensure that the defendants understand the implications of any judgments made in their absence, and that their fundamental rights are protected in this respect."
"I would also call upon the Council to ensure that all Member States have a system where defendants are able to have legal representation regardless of the country they may reside in."
"Finally, my congratulations to all the rapporteurs in their work to simplify a complex set of legal processes and proposals that I believe will give substance to the European arrest warrant."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE group. - (RO) Thus, cross-border crimes have increased and the judicial system must adjust to the new situation."
"Thus, I have noticed the need to harmonize legislation between the Member States and, in particular, during this period, the need for rapid and efficient information of the relevant authorities of Member States."
"This report is obviously a step forward for solving this challenge that the European citizens and institutions are dealing with."
"Modernizing the European judicial network shall create an adequate response to the cross-border crime phenomenon."
"The report, which was voted unanimously in the LIBE Committee, makes the European judicial network more efficient and capable of providing necessary information at all times and from anywhere in the Member States."
"The beneficiaries of this modernization will be the European citizens, who will notice that the national judicial institutions have the necessary means for a rapid response, through a modern and safe telecommunication network."
"Both Eurojust and the judicial system in the Member States shall be able to rely upon the European judicial network structure and nobody shall be able to come up with excuses anymore for the lack of necessary information."
"As a Shadow - Rapporteur from the European People's Party, I thank Mrs. Rapporteur Silvia-Yvonne Kaufmann for her work and for the way in which we managed to find compromise solutions."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, I am delighted that we today have the opportunity to debate such an important package together, and I fully anticipate that tomorrow we will be adopting decisions on the basis of a very large majority."
"I should particularly like to thank the two rapporteurs whom I shadowed, Mrs Kaufmann and Mrs Weber, for their very good cooperation, as this was a prerequisite for being able to produce such good work."
"Good work is essential in this area and I am also very pleased that, when it comes to the European Judicial Network (EJN), the outcome achieved enables us to take forward the work that has already been done."
"Good cooperation among jurists, magistrates and the relevant authorities in the Member States is essential if we are genuinely to create law and justice for our citizens, and that, after all, is what we want to do."
"I am particularly gratified, in this context, that we are finally establishing the cooperation between the EJN and Eurojust on a formal basis and ensuring links which can only be productive and which we can only welcome."
"However, whenever increasing volumes of data are exchanged, data protection naturally becomes increasingly important, and this applies to security of telecommunications and the exchange of these data as well."
"I am therefore very pleased that Parliament, the Commission and the Council apparently agree on this, and again, this is something I can only welcome."
"I am equally glad to say that we will get a large majority on all the reports tomorrow, for this expansion that we have proposed - and which I hope will secure the endorsement of the Commission and the Council - this addition by the European Parliament which we have Mrs Weber to thank for, namely that the sexual exploitation of children or child pornography is now also to be included as an offence, which was not the case before, this is, in my view, a very important issue for our society, and one which I would underscore."
"A particularly important issue for the Socialist Group in this context - but also one where I believe a solution has been found - is ensuring that, in this area, it is not just about organised crime but also serious crime."
"I think it is important that we do not have to produce evidence, first of all, that organised crime is taking place, but that, through the exchange of information, we can demonstrate that organised crime may be happening somewhere along the line."
"It cannot be a basic prerequisite."
"I think there has been something of a misunderstanding here between the groups and I wanted to try and clear that up."
"I hope, and I am confident, that we can move ahead in a positive way, and I greatly welcome that."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, when our Prime Ministers' meeting almost a decade ago in Tampere set out the main guidelines for EU criminal justice policy, they rightly stressed that European citizens had the right to expect the Union to ensure there was no hiding place for criminals."
"That is why European Liberal Democrats have consistently supported measures like the European arrest warrant, unlike British Conservatives who spout hot air on law and order but oppose EU cooperation instruments."
"Those measures also explain the justification for strengthening the ability of national prosecutors to work together in Eurojust and bring major criminals to justice."
"It is legitimate to ensure that they are available around the clock and to give them more powers to get their decisions implemented, like issuing search and seizure warrants in their own Member States and accessing their own national criminal databases."
"There is also certainly scope for clarifying and streamlining the rules on when judgments delivered in absentia without the presence of the accused will be recognised, but this must not shade into lazy habits of not trying hard enough to inform the defendant."
"I would not want every Member State to copy the worrying Italian volume of in absentia trials."
"When I questioned the Commission a few months ago, it stressed that the initiative was balanced, increasing the fundamental rights of citizens while also enhancing the principle of mutual recognition."
"But bodies like the European Criminal Bar Association, the Council of Bars and Law Societies, and Fair Trials International have all expressed fears at weak safeguards for defendants."
"The presidency minister stressed and promised that the Council would consider Parliament's amendments with attention."
"I am sure she means well, but my response is: big deal."
"Directly-elected MEPs are marginalised in decisions on EU law as regards cross-border justice."
"Until we get the Treaty of Lisbon into force those laws are largely decided by national civil servants and that is a big part of the reason why the second part of the 10-year-old deal, which promised to raise justice standards in Member States like good data protection rules and to strengthen defendants' rights like legal aid, translation and bail, have not been kept."
"Until we get a democratic instead of a technocratic EU justice policy, one truly balanced between catching criminals and guaranteeing fair trials, support for the measures discussed now must be qualified."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Madam President, I know that I could never be accused of being a Tory, but I too voted against the European arrest warrant."
"The reason for this is not that I am against extradition, against suspects being handed over from one country to another."
"Actually I am very much for that."
"My problem at the time was that I believed that we had not put in place adequate regulations on the rights of suspects and that we should have done that at the same time."
"The procedural rights of defendants were not regulated."
"Despite the energy put into this and the excellent proposals that we are going to debate here today and which I am also in favour of, it remains a fact that we have still not got that proposal through which has been on the table for years and which is a crucial element to creating trust between Member States, and therefore also facilitating extradition."
"I should very much like to hear from Minister Dati whether she also considers that proposal to be so crucial to our European cooperation, on what points it is still sticking in the Council and whether there is a possibility, in this energetic French Presidency, to make any headway with this issue of the rights of defendants."
"The fact of the matter is that this is really essential to facilitating extradition."
"As far as the judgments in absentia are concerned, it is good that the requirements as presently worded are being put in place for extradition."
"The question is: are they sufficient?"
"You could infer from the political agreement within the Council that you should be given a retrial or that a possibility of appeal is sufficient."
"Can Minister Dati assure me that everyone has the right to a retrial?"
"After all, an appeal does not give you all the chances and all the options that you have with a completely new trial."
"I really would like to hear, therefore, whether people do indeed have the right to a completely new trial and not only an appeal."
"Now to my final point which I will keep short: we hear a great deal about what is needed to facilitate the work of the investigation authorities."
"We hear too little - or it is unorganised - about how things are with the loopholes in the area of defence, loopholes that are precisely because of the European cooperation."
"I hope that we will arrive at a Eurorights panel, an ombudspanel, so that we can see what loopholes there are in the area of defence, and so that we can find solutions for them together."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, here is a concrete example of what a one-size-fits-all integrated European judicial system leads to."
"A 19-year-old man in London, Andrew Symeou, faces extradition to Greece on a manslaughter charge."
"Mr Symeou maintains that he has nothing whatsoever to do with the crime in question."
"The evidence against him is suspect, depending on dubious identification and statements allegedly beaten out of his friends by the Greek police."
"That evidence should be scrutinised by a British court before it agrees to his extradition."
"However, under a European arrest warrant, a British court now has no right to examine prima facie evidence in order to satisfy itself that extradition is justified, and no power to prevent it."
"The European arrest warrant means that British citizens now effectively no longer enjoy the basic protection of the law against arbitrary arrest and detention as established by Magna Carta."
"That does not serve the interests of justice for the victim or the accused, both of whom deserve it."
"(EL) Madam President, let me first congratulate the Slovenian Presidency and the other 13 countries that have endorsed this proposal brought before us today."
"It is a significant contribution to the issue of justice in the EU."
"Let me also congratulate the three rapporteurs, Mrs Kaufmann, Mrs Weber and Mr França, on their fine, methodical work."
"They have basically approved the proposal with the amendments, which the Council and the Commission are on the verge of adopting."
"I was glad to hear this and welcome it."
"I should be even happier if today we also had the proposal to adopt the minimum procedural rights for suspects and defendants before us for approval."
"Efforts would then be complete."
"I therefore appeal to the Commission and the Council to put forward this proposal as quickly as possible."
"As shadow rapporteur for the proposal on Eurojust, I must say that I am pleased with the strengthening of this body."
"When it was founded, it seemed to be merely a typical institution with precious few prospects and of minimal use."
"The facts have proved this to be wrong; its usefulness has been proved, as has its need to be strengthened further."
"I need not refer to what previous speakers and rapporteurs have said about the additions to this body; I merely welcome its reinforcement."
"These proposals undoubtedly make for useful progress towards the development of justice, freedom and security."
"More radical steps need to be taken, however."
"We must overcome an obstructively nationalist approach to issues and implement broader justice in the European area."
"Then we shall be able to say that justice really is the same throughout the EU."
"I hope that this will come about with the approval of the Lisbon Treaty."
"(RO) First of all, I would like to congratulate the Rapporteurs."
"In recent years, the activity of the European Judicial Network and Eurojust has proved extremely important and useful in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"The adoption of the Council's decision regarding the European Judicial Network, as well as of the decision on the strengthening of Eurojust, is necessary for the two structures to become increasingly prompt, taking into consideration that the mobility of people and cross-border crimes have increased significantly in recent years."
"The two structures should cooperate and supplement each other."
"The creation of a contact point as national correspondent for coordinating the activity of the European Judicial Network, as well as the creation of a Eurojust national co-ordination system, is important for permanent mutual information, as well as for guiding the national authorities either toward the Judicial Network or toward Eurojust, according to the specific cases handled."
"Structured information, provided in due time, is essential for an efficient Eurojust activity."
"Increased attention should be given to the creation of a special communication network for the transmission of personal data."
"Ensuring adequate protection of data in the activity of the two structures is extremely important."
"(SL) The nature of Mr França's report seemed at first to be more legal and technical than concrete."
"However, it transpired that among the Member States there are some which are totally unfamiliar with this legal institution."
"This report also exposed differences between the Anglo-Saxon and Continental penal systems."
"It is therefore logical that some of my fellow Members will oppose the report."
"Of course, that does not imply that the topics are not important."
"We of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are of the opinion that the right to be tried is a fundamental political right."
"However, there have been cases when the accused did not attend the trial, but the court nevertheless pronounced sentence."
"Sentences pronounced in absentia in one country have not so far been recognised in another Member State."
"This outline decision ensures that such sentences could also be enforced in other Member States of the European Union, under certain conditions of course, one of those conditions, in our opinion, being that the accused was summoned to the court in a correct manner and that, despite being summoned by the court authorities, failed to attend the court."
"Evading justice is common and a person legally sentenced in one European Union country should not be allowed to stroll peacefully down the streets of other Member States."
"We of the PPE-DE are of the opinion that the rapporteur has managed to harmonise the amendments and prepare a balanced report, for which I would like to thank him."
"I would also like to make the following remark: it is right and proper for us to secure conditions for just trials, but we must also take care of the victims of criminal acts."
"Madam President, I rise to speak solely on the França report on mutual recognition of judgements in absentia."
"The very concept of this proposal is alien to many judicial systems within Member States, especially those who have a legal system based on common law."
"In the UK we have over centuries built up our legal system based on the idea of habeas corpus and the right of the defendant not to be judged unless he has the opportunity to defend himself."
"This principle is enshrined in the well-known document I have here - Magna Carta of 1215 - which has guaranteed this right in my country for 800 years."
"Recognition of trials in absentia goes wholly against the basic ideals of this historic document."
"For a judgment to be made in one Member State and subsequently recognised in another, once a European arrest warrant has been issued, certainly raises the question of whether a fair trial has taken place."
"The organisation Fair Trials International, in their paper on this proposal, mirrors my concerns and highlights - and I quote - 'significant concerns on the issue of extradition procedure to be followed'."
"Colleagues, I urge you to look seriously at what is proposed and think how this will affect your constituents and their right to a fair trial."
"Madam President, no sensible person wants to make life easy for criminals, but we do have to guard against justice in Europe being reduced to the lowest common denominator."
"And with such a wide range of judicial procedures, safeguards and processes across the EU, talk of obtaining judicial equivalence often involves exactly that."
"In the United Kingdom, our common-law-based legal system is quite different in practice, precedent and processes to the system in our continental neighbours."
"So when I see reports that are predicated on the fusion of practice for fusion's sake, I must be concerned."
"I take the report on mutual recognition of judgments in absentia."
"I frankly say that there is not equivalence between the painstaking judicial precautions taken before someone is convicted in absentia in the United Kingdom and what seems to me the far more casual approach in, for example, Greece or Bulgaria."
"Therefore, I do not agree that my British constituent convicted there in his absence should have that conviction automatically recognised in the UK."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I simply want to congratulate the rapporteurs and also the Council Presidency on the results achieved at this stage of the debate and preparation of the texts."
"Many of our citizens question the added value of Europe in their daily lives."
"As regards justice, any measure to improve this vital public service is likely to improve the perception of Europe's usefulness in relation to the security of its citizens."
"In this respect, it is particularly important to ensure that decisions can be enforced across Europe and to remove the barriers to their enforcement within the EU territory."
"This is the aim of the proposed texts."
"While respecting public freedoms, these measures will reinforce the effectiveness of penalties ordered by national courts."
"Madam President, this is just to react to the British sceptics because I agree with them that we should not make legislation on the basis of the lowest common denominator."
"The thing is, however, that you then have to think about how you want to make legislation, because if we also agree that we want to have a common approach in catching criminals, then you cannot make legislation through unanimity."
"That is why everything is now stuck in Council."
"But I also expect their help in coming up with a decision-making process with Qualified Majority Voting (QMV), because otherwise we are stuck."
"Either you isolate yourself and do not want to cooperate in the field of justice, or we go over to QMV, because that is the only way we can make really substantial, meaningful legislation."
"(FR) Madam President, I must reiterate what Mrs Buitenweg has just said."
"The question raised by these texts, as by all the progress made in this area in the last 20 years, is very simple: in the European Union, as stated by my colleague Jean-Paul Gauzès, do we first of all take into account the interests of the people, in particular honest people, or do we first of all take into account the interests of the States and the mechanisms of State?"
"It is clear that European construction - and this may be regretted but it is a fact and a positive fact in today's world - involves ensuring that the mechanisms of State of the 27 Member States cannot, as they have done for too long, prevail over the interests of the people and in particular the interests of security."
"This is the whole purpose of the European project, otherwise there is no European project."
"The Council and these three proposals must therefore be supported."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, your words this afternoon bear witness to the great importance that you place on these three texts."
"They also show your commitment to ensuring that effective progress is made in judicial cooperation, particularly in criminal matters, and, as you have pointed out, while respecting fundamental rights."
"This dual requirement is essential as it forms the very condition for the construction of the European judicial area, because we all have different legal systems and even different legal organisations."
"The guarantees given in the operation of Eurojust and the European Judicial Network, like those which will be offered when enforcing decisions rendered in absentia, clearly obey an identical logic."
"I should therefore like to thank the European Commission, and Jacques Barrot in particular, for its support of the Presidency."
"As you indicated, numerous elements of these reports were agreed by the Council, in the end, almost unanimously."
"As you also said, we have a lot to do and must work together on this."
"I also want to thank Sylvia Kaufmann for her report and for her speech today because the assessment of the European Judicial Network is an important step in improving judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"It should be noted that this Network has been important and effective."
"Mrs Kaufmann, you have again today rightly emphasised the links between Eurojust and the European Judicial Network."
"Their development goes hand-in-hand; this point was also raised on numerous occasions during the last European Council."
"I also want to thank Renate Weber for her report and for the important contribution that she has made."
"Her speech in Toulouse on this subject was also brilliant."
"Mrs Weber, I must also thank you for your welcome."
"I know that you have carried out remarkable work with all the other people involved in Eurojust."
"You also mentioned the Lisbon Treaty."
"I understand that you would have preferred to work within another institutional framework but we must, however, progress on the basis of established law as this affects all the European institutions."
"Mr França, your speech highlighted the need to adopt a single framework for enforcing decisions rendered in absentia."
"You are right to raise this point and it is one way for our legal systems to prove their effectiveness."
"Mrs Gebhardt, there is a vital need for cooperation between all political and legal players because the challenge facing judicial cooperation in criminal matters in Europe is to learn to work together in order to effectively combat all forms of crime."
"I know that you are a demanding advocate of this cooperation."
"I should now like to respond to those of you who have doubts about a Europe of justice and who fear that we are endangering fundamental rights."
"It is true that, under the German Presidency, we could not reach agreement on the minimum procedural guarantees."
"In response, I must say that the framework decision on decisions rendered in absentia provides for the right to a retrial which is a fundamental guarantee."
"The result of this process is eagerly awaited by judges, public prosecutors and legal professionals who cooperate on a daily basis and also by the victims who suffer from the forms of crime which are constantly adapting and changing."
"We must show that we are equal to these demands and put in place effective and useful tools."
"We must build a Europe that protects its citizens within such a judicial area."
"The Presidency knows that it can count on your full support for these three texts."
"It would like to express its recognition of this fact and thank everyone who has today shown an interest in these issues."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, I should like to join in the praise and thanks of Mrs Dati who is chairing the JHA Council during the French Presidency."
"I must say to Mrs Kaufmann that she is right to insist on data protection."
"I must also remind her that the draft framework decision on data protection actually lays down detailed rules that will also apply to information exchanged between the contact points of the European Judicial Network, but we should certainly make sure of this."
"I must also say to Mrs Weber that, in order to ensure the success of these texts, trust between Member States and in the EU agencies is clearly very important."
"Mrs Weber, I believe that you made some very strong statements on this subject."
"Mr França has clearly shown the importance of the text on more rapid enforcement of decisions, for which he was rapporteur."
"He did this in a balanced manner, which I must highlight, while confirming that there will also be a possibility of a retrial, as just mentioned by Mrs Dati, and that the right of defence will clearly be maintained."
"I must respond to Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Demetriou on procedural rights."
"I regard procedural rights as extremely important for the development of the common area of freedom, security and justice."
"The Commission was disappointed that no agreement could be reached last year on our proposal for a framework decision on procedural rights."
"I am now considering initiatives in this area that could be taken in the near future."
"I am determined to make progress in this area, perhaps by presenting a new proposal on procedural rights."
"In any event, you may be sure that this matter is receiving my full attention."
"I must also say to Mrs Gebhardt, although I believe Mrs Dati has already responded on this subject, that we are talking about serious crime in new forms that perhaps do not correspond to the overly strict definition of organised crime."
"Serious crime must also form one aspect of this judicial cooperation that we truly want."
"I do not have much else to add, apart from reiterating what Jacques Toubon said, namely that we must consider the interests of European defendants and the interests of everyone of us and our compatriots in order to ensure that this judicial cooperation proves to be increasingly effective, while of course respecting human rights."
"In any event, I too should like to thank Parliament for the quality of its contribution to this important debate which will mark a very positive step in the development of this European judicial area."
"Madam President, Mrs Dati, thank you for having urged on this European Council which was able to reach a consensus in this area and arrive at these political agreements."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I should like to say a few words in my capacity as a shadow rapporteur on the other two reports and to thank Mrs Kaufmann for the way we worked together, and Mr França for his work."
"There were 57 compromise amendments in his report, which says something about the level of work we put in."
"Concerning the report on decisions rendered in absentia, probably the most sensitive aspect relates to the fact that, in some Member States, when judgments are rendered in the absence of the defendant, the solution is to have a retrial, thus fully respecting the European Convention on Human Rights (Protocol No 7, Article 2) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, whereas other countries recognise only the right to an appeal."
"Unfortunately, the proposal in this report is not about harmonising current legislation in the 27 Member States."
"Although we should aim at having a European legislation in the future, for the time being we have done our best, at least by ensuring that even in the appeal the defendant enjoys the procedural guarantees as provided for by Articles 5 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"I should like to conclude by saying that the good functioning of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions requires a high level of mutual confidence between the Member States, and this confidence must be based on a common observance of human rights and fundamental principles."
"rapporteur. - (PT) I must thank the Minister for her words and also the Commissioner and my fellow Members, both those who agree and those who disagree, because the latter give me the opportunity, here and now, to clarify one or two points."
"However, first of all I want to say the following: both as a Member of this House and as a lawyer and citizen, I feel particularly satisfied today to be able to endorse the Council's proposal and our amendments."
"Why do I hope and pray that the framework decision will be adopted and applied?"
"The answer is because the situation in Europe is serious and we must respond without further delay."
"There are many people who have already been sentenced and who are moving freely through the Union without the courts being able to enforce the decisions rendered in other countries."
"This is serious in terms of the development of crime itself and security in Europe and it is important that the European institutions respond."
"In particular, the framework decision promotes the principle of mutual recognition, and our amendments, the amendments proposed by Parliament, must be read in conjunction with one another."
"The solutions proposed on summoning people, on the rules for the representation of defendants and on retrials or appeals must be read in conjunction with one another."
"All these technical solutions are interlinked and, in our opinion, the rights of defence of defendants must always be guaranteed in all circumstances."
"We well know, and this must be said, what we should leave well alone."
"Under these circumstances, the solution that has been found is, in my opinion, a solution that we must adopt."
"It is both an important and a great step forward and also another small step forward."
"According to the old rule, this is how to build the European Union, this is how to build Europe."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (IT) The legislative proposal on decisions rendered in absentia must be adopted in order to overcome serious differences in treatment and the huge amount of discretion granted to executing authorities in the 27 EU Member States."
"These are the objectives which the Committee on Legal Affairs set itself when presenting its opinion to the Committee on Civil Liberties."
"The four amendments, adopted unanimously last May and basically taken over by the committee responsible, aim to ensure a fair balance between citizens' fundamental rights and freedoms and the need for mutual recognition of judgments."
"It has therefore become essential to harmonise our criminal justice systems, by introducing into the proposal uniform criteria recognised by the largest possible number of EU countries, with a view to legal clarity."
"These are minimum standards geared to combining safeguards for guarantees to protect the accused with the need to preserve efficient cross-border judicial cooperation."
"Nevertheless, in certain cases the Member State is granted the leeway needed to take into account the specifics of its own legal system."
"The European Parliament voted in favour of the proposal for mutual recognition by the legal authorities of the EU Member States of penal sentences in absentia, that is, sentences that have been pronounced in another Member State in the absence of the accused party."
"Together with the European arrest warrant, this means that anyone is liable to be arrested and sentenced in any EU Member State in which they have been tried and sentenced by default, without ever being told or realising that proceedings have been brought against them."
"The problem is even greater for Member States such as Greece, where the legal system, at least for the most serious offences, does not recognise the possibility of the accused standing trial in their absence."
"This regulation crucially undermines the accused's right to a fair trial."
"It destroys the right of the accused to a real defence; it has already led to violent reactions in legal bodies and associations throughout the EU."
"It is now becoming clear that harmonising the Member States' penal systems and the so-called 'communitarisation' of criminal law being promoted by the EU are leading to the infringement of fundamental sovereign rights and of the rights of Member States to determine their own guarantees of protection in critical areas such as criminal proceedings."
"Use of the Visa Information System (VIS) under the Schengen Borders Code (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Brejc, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 as regards the use of the Visa Information System (VIS) under the Schengen Borders Code - C6-0086/2008 -."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I should firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Brejc, for his work on this proposal."
"An important step is being taken which will allow us to benefit fully from the technical tools available to secure our external borders."
"It is extremely important to use the Visa Information System (VIS) to ensure that the checks carried out at external borders are efficient."
"The VIS provides a reliable link between the visa holder, the visa and the passport in order to prevent false identities from being used."
"The full benefits of this system will only be gained with the introduction of biometrics."
"The legislative instrument on the agenda will lay down, once formally adopted, the common rules to guarantee the efficient and harmonised use of the VIS at our external borders."
"Without common rules, those border crossing points where the VIS is not systematically used could be exploited by illegal immigrants and criminals."
"By amending the Schengen Borders Code, these common rules will be established."
"I can therefore fully support the compromise reached and congratulate the European Parliament and the Council on the agreement at first reading."
"rapporteur. - (SL) I would like to thank the Commissioner for his kind words."
"The European Parliament is involved in a co-determination process for amending the regulation governing the use of the Visa Information System."
"The amendments to the visa system proposed by the Commission initially envisaged a very thorough control of the entry of third-country citizens needing a visa."
"This would involve not only the usual procedure of matching the person to the document, but also fingerprinting."
"The regulation contains all the search measures and conditions for the appropriate authorities managing the controls at external border crossings to access data for checking identity and so on - I will refrain from listing all these checks."
"In accordance with this regulation, the border official has access to the Visa Information System, where he can check all the data on the passenger at the border, including fingerprints."
"The proposed regulation, that is to say a systematic checking with fingerprinting of third-country citizens every time (I emphasise every time) they enter the Schengen area, would certainly prolong the waiting time at border crossings, especially during the tourist season and at the beginning and end of public holidays."
"Since Europe is a global economic power as well as an interesting tourist destination for third-country citizens, who of course need entry visas, in my opinion it is, or was, necessary to ease the regulation appropriately."
"That is why I proposed random checking and fingerprinting at border crossings."
"I thereby wanted to draw attention to the fact that the visa holder was fingerprinted once in the process of obtaining a visa, and then again on entering the Schengen area for the purpose of comparison and verification of identity."
"I think that such an operation or such a rigid provision is an exaggeration because we actually have no data on, or estimates of, the numbers of forged visas."
"On top of that, fingerprinting totally unsuspicious people is senseless and time-consuming."
"Despite separate lanes for citizens of the European Union, very long queues would form at border crossings where everyone, namely citizens of the European Union and those with visas, would be queuing during public holidays and vacations."
"In this session of Parliament we have managed, relatively quickly, to reach a consensus on certain deviations from such rigid provisions, and a compromise with the Council and the Commission was also reached after two trialogues."
"The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs approved the proposal with a large majority, there being no votes against and only two abstentions."
"In brief, I think that the current regulation is good because it ensures a smooth border crossing."
"Even when there are many people queuing, the border official makes his own assessment in accordance with the regulation and, if conditions dictate, carries out a random check."
"The decision to carry out random checks is not a matter for the official alone, but primarily for his superiors at the border."
"I think we have ensured appropriate safety standards and at the same time enabled passengers to cross the border in the shortest possible time."
"Allow me to take this opportunity to thank the Council and the Commission for their excellent cooperation, and especially the shadow rapporteurs, in particular Mr Cashman, for a number of good ideas and their active search for a compromise."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, the extension of the Schengen area has removed border controls in most of the EU and made day-to-day travel within those borders quicker and easier for our citizens."
"It also means, however, that non-EU citizens entering the Schengen area are effectively only checked once, at the external border."
"While our citizens often equate illegal immigration with dramatic scenes of unseaworthy and overcrowded vessels breaching our maritime borders, or container-loads of unfortunates - victims of human trafficking - crossing land borders, the reality is much more complex."
"About 50% of illegal immigrants enter the EU legally, but fail to leave our territory on expiry of their visas."
"Secondly, incidents of falsified documents are widespread, especially at airports."
"In order to reduce the number of overstayers, as well as to decrease the risk of granting access to persons with falsified documents, a harmonised and secure system for checking visa validity and taking fingerprints will apply in the Schengen area."
"However, as all our citizens who travel are well aware, increased security leads to increased inconvenience and waiting times at borders for bona fide travellers."
"Therefore a degree of pragmatism is also necessary."
"If there is deemed to be no risk related to internal security and illegal immigration, and traffic at a border is of such intensity that waiting times become excessive, then the need to take fingerprints may be waived."
"This more flexible system may operate for a maximum of three years, after which an evaluation of its effectiveness will take place."
"While we aim to make Europe secure, we need at the same time to be welcoming to business travellers and tourists alike."
"I believe that the proposed visa information system has struck the right balance between those two objectives."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for the excellent work he has done."
"The compromises we have achieved with the Council are sensible and effective, and I say this as the original rapporteur on the Schengen border code."
"Brevity is the source of wit, so I will detain the House no more, other than thanking - as every MEP should - the two wonderful assistants, Renaud and Maris, who work with me and who make my work not only enjoyable but also productive."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, as the rapporteur on the visa information system (VIS), and still working on the amendment of the common consular instructions to govern the actual collection of the biometrics, I take a great interest in anything that concerns the visa information system."
"When we decided on the VIS, we allowed for this three-year period when the search could be done using just the visa sticker, without the fingerprints in the VIS."
"But I have slightly mixed feelings about the compromise."
"I support it because that is what has been able to be agreed."
"But on the other hand the Commission has rightly said that only a biometric check can confirm with certainty that the person wishing to enter is the one to whom the visa has been issued, and therefore a systematic consultation of the VIS, including a biometric check by border guards, should be performed for each visa holder."
"I am therefore a little bit worried about the derogation and the ability to have random checks."
"I shall look forward to this report after three years, and ensure that flexibility has not become a loophole, because of course if we are going to have the VIS we had better apply it properly."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Brejc for his excellent report."
"We appreciate his point that consulting the VIS using the visa sticker number in combination with the verification of fingerprints will create a lot of problems."
"Therefore we welcome the introduction of a derogation in exceptional cases to consult the VIS without verification of fingerprints."
"Nevertheless, in our opinion, the report is not as ambitious as it should be."
"The derogation should instead be a general rule."
"We suggest that the VIS should be consulted in exceptional cases when there are doubts regarding identity."
"It is well known that the Verts/ALE Group strongly opposes the extensive introduction of biometrics until its necessity is proved beyond reasonable doubt."
"We believe that it has crucial implications for personal data security and for fundamental rights."
"Therefore we cannot vote in favour of the regulation at this time."
"(NL) Mr President, the regulation rightly provides that, for everyone in possession of a visa, the Visa Information System (VIS) should be systematically consulted for a biometric check."
"This is the best and safest way to check the authenticity of a visa."
"It is regrettable, therefore, that Parliament feels the need to undermine the principle by introducing a list of situations in which we will make do with checking the identification sticker and not proceed to check the biometric data."
"There is a danger then that, due to the introduction of this list, biometric checks will become the exception rather than the rule."
"I know, of course, that it is impossible to perform the biometric checks routinely in all circumstances, but it should certainly be the rule."
"In the context of the fight against illegal immigration and the fight against terrorism and cross-border criminality, we cannot permit a lax and informal approach in this case."
"(HU) Mr President, Hungary was naturally also very pleased about joining the Schengen zone."
"Allow me to say a few more sentences in connection with this topic, concerning the unfortunate situation that has developed on the border of Hungary and Austria."
"In many respects the Austrian authorities do not take the Schengen system into account: although Hungary has been part of Schengen for nearly a year, they ask for the passports of Hungarians arriving from across the border and impose fines if they do not have a passport."
"Naturally, this is not a frequent occurrence but, when it does happen, it understandably and justifiably causes great antipathy in Hungarian public opinion."
"Unfortunately, in addition to this, there is also a practice of closing, at the border, roads that have existed up to now, to prevent Hungarians from using them to cross the border without a passport under the Schengen Agreement."
"I hope that there will be a way for us to stop these abuses by the Austrians. Thank you."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I must once again thank your rapporteur, Mr Brejc, because he has grasped the main aim of the proposal, which is to secure the borders, without forgetting, however, that these borders must be sufficiently flexible."
"I believe that the two can be reconciled and that you have achieved this in this text which is the result of an excellent compromise."
"I would add, as an echo to what Mr Weber has just said, that we do have a problem in terms of both opening up Europe to everyone wishing to enter and leave on a regular basis, while being relatively attentive to those who, it must be said, try to cheat and abuse the rules."
"This dual requirement of openness and, at the same time, regularity and respect for the law must therefore be taken into account."
"My thanks go to the House for allowing us to make progress in securing our borders while maintaining the necessary flexibility."
"rapporteur. - (SL) I would like to comment on two contradicting opinions: deviation as a general principle and strict observance of the rules laid down in the Schengen Code."
"It is precisely the compromise we have reached that allows reasonable border crossings even when the queues are really long."
"Just imagine a border crossing between, say, Slovenia and Croatia during a public holiday when fifty to sixty thousand people turn up, ten thousand of whom have a visa."
"If those ten thousand had to be fingerprinted, the others, who are citizens of the European Union and can cross the border without any formalities, would have to wait a day or two."
"Therefore, let us be realistic and create a strict control system comprising reasonable measures for a smooth border crossing."
"Let us not forget that the regulation clearly states, and I quote: '... for the sole purpose of verifying the identity of the visa holder and/or the authenticity of the visa ..., the competent authorities for carrying out checks at external border crossing points ... shall, ..., have access to search using the number of the visa sticker in combination with verification of fingerprints of the visa holder'."
"Therefore, in all cases where there is even the slightest doubt, the border official will check; in all other cases, when there are a large number of people at the border, he will act in accordance with the regulation, which allows for some deviation."
"We must not build a new 'Berlin Wall' of officials and information."
"The European Union is and should continue to be a global power that is considerate towards its own citizens and to others who are entering."
"I would like to thank Mr Cashman, among others, and of course the Commissioner for their patience when we were working on this compromise."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree on the necessity of amending the Schengen Borders Code so that its provisions are consistent with the stipulations of the Visa Information System."
"However, the Commission's original proposal is problematic since it stipulates that, when citizens of third countries cross the border, not only should the validity of the visas be checked but fingerprints should also be taken from them."
"This may, however, cause huge congestion at the EU's external borders, mainly at inland border-crossing points during holiday periods or on public holidays."
"I therefore welcome the rapporteur's proposed amendments, which provide that these checks should not be carried out systematically but only as random samples, under well-defined conditions and time restrictions."
"In the vote tomorrow, please support the Committee's opinion that crossing our external borders should become possible without long waiting times, not only in principle but also in practice."
"This regulation comes as an answer to the need to secure and strengthen the European Union's borders by making control at border check points more efficient."
"Nevertheless, the most important aspect refers to establishing common rules for the harmonization of the Visa Information System."
"Although some Member States deemed that the mandatory use of VIS could only be achieved when the technological development allowed the feasible use of portable devices, with a rapid transfer and a certain check, I believe the rapporteur's proposal to let the border police officer choose whether to use the Visa Information System or not represents a solution until the technological system allows rapid data transfer and its systematic use."
"We should also not forget that an adequate control at the EU borders would increase the internal security of Member States and, consequently, would fight frauds such as organized crime and even acts of terrorism."
"Moreover, in addition to the significant increase in the efficiency of border controls, a systematic consultation of the Visa Information System would also constitute a preliminary condition for greater flexibility when submitting the visa application."
"Evaluation of the Dublin system (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Lambert, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the evaluation of the Dublin system."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I should also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their serious interest and commitment, and all those who have contributed to this report."
"The Dublin II Regulation, as you will know, is part of the European common asylum system and it determines which Member State is responsible for the examination and determination of an asylum claim."
"Its effect is also linked very much to the sound implementation of other directives, such as the Reception and the Procedures Directives."
"Our committee report makes clear that the Dublin Regulation, and indeed the system as a whole, is a system based on mutual trust and reliability, so that all Member States have to fulfil their responsibilities."
"We have a number of concerns which we address in this report - although I obviously will not address them all here - about the quality of delivery in terms of the asylum system, the impact on the individuals concerned and whether Dublin II is effective overall."
"What problems does it create for some Member States?"
"Are we almost looking at something and making it too simple for the complexity of the issue?"
"On the quality of delivery, we know that there are enormous variations between Member States in delivering a fair and thorough examination of claims for protection."
"This is unjust for the individual and unfair to other Member States."
"In fact, looking at one or two Member States within the European Union, if you were an asylum-seeker really fearing for your life you would have to be almost suicidal to claim asylum in one or two of them, because your chances of having your claim recognised would be so low and, therefore, your risk of return would be very high."
"So we agree as a committee that we wish to see systematic measures taken against those Member States which fail in this respect."
"A majority in the committee also wants to see the Dublin transfers to such Member States stopped until failures are rectified - although there is an amendment on this issue which we will vote on tomorrow."
"For the individuals concerned, we want to see a clear improvement in the quality and consistency of decision-making."
"We want to see cases fully examined on transfer and not closed due to technicalities (our paragraph 11)."
"We want clear information provided to those coming under the Dublin Regulation; we also want to increase the possibility of family reunion and a wider definition of family for this purpose - although, again, I know there is an amendment on this - so that, for example, a minor can be transferred to live with their sole family member in the European Union, even if that person is a cousin rather than a sibling."
"We also want clear procedures in relation to minors, who should only be transferred for the purpose of family reunion; these procedures should include their representation and accompaniment throughout, so that no child is lost in transit, as has unfortunately happened on a number of occasions."
"We are also asking for greater use of the humanitarian clause, for example, for those who are particularly vulnerable."
"We have concerns about the potential extension of Eurodac for purposes other than identification."
"The Council and the Commission will be aware that Parliament takes such issues very seriously."
"As regards the problems - and I know that other colleagues will talk more on this - one of the issues which also concerns us is that Dublin II can create pressure on certain Member States which find themselves as primary points of entry to the European Union for asylum-seekers."
"We are, therefore, asking the Commission to bring forward proposals on so-called 'burden sharing' which are not just financial but actually provide a solution for the Member States and the individuals affected."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, the application of the Dublin system was technically and politically evaluated during the debate commenced in 2007 following the Green Paper on the future Common European Asylum System."
"Based on the conclusions of this dual evaluation, the Commission intends to propose, before the end of the year, amendments to the Dublin and Eurodac Regulations while retaining the basic principles of the Dublin system."
"The aim is to reinforce both the efficiency of the system and the protection of those concerned."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must thank Parliament for instigating this debate on these future amendments."
"This is a debate that is shaping up to be constructive and undoubtedly intense."
"The Commission shares the concerns expressed in your report, Mrs Lambert, as regards the shortcomings."
"It agrees with the conclusion that the success of the Dublin system depends on greater harmonisation of protection standards at EU level."
"This is the way to guarantee equal access to protection for all asylum seekers transferred to other Member States."
"We need both this greater harmonisation of the laws of the Member States on asylum and also an increase in practical cooperation as envisaged in the second phase of the Common European Asylum System."
"The Commission plans to better define the procedures and time-limits to be respected and also to improve the quality and reliability of the data contained within the Eurodac database."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not wish to go into too much detail, but it is true that we are considering a series of amendments. These include improving the information given to asylum seekers, making the right of appeal more effective, ensuring that the detention of asylum seekers is not arbitrary, clarifying the conditions and procedures to be respected in the application of the humanitarian clause, offering more guarantees for unaccompanied minors, and expanding the right to family reunification for asylum seekers and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection."
"Although, despite everything, the evaluation of the Dublin system has been positive, it is also true that this system has led to additional burdens for certain Member States which have limited capacity for reception and absorption while, at the same time, being subject to particular migratory pressure due to their geographical situation."
"The Commission is considering the possibility of introducing a temporary suspension of the application of the Dublin provisions for an overburdened Member State and also creating teams of asylum experts who may be called upon by these somewhat overburdened Member States."
"The Commission takes note of the substantial and constructive recommendations contained in Parliament's report."
"We will not spare any efforts in taking all the necessary steps to respond to the concerns expressed by Parliament in its report on the operation and impact of the Dublin system."
"Thank you Mrs Lambert, ladies and gentlemen."
"I am going to listen to you closely as I am convinced that perfecting the right of asylum is an important issue for the future and, I would say, for our design of Europe which must remain true to its great tradition of welcoming people."
"This law needs to be revised."
"Let me try to explain why."
"When this law was issued, the aim was that anyone seeking asylum - that is, asking for protection - could do so in the country in which they first landed."
"This seems reasonable, but when this law was issued, no-one ever imagined, especially in this day and age, that many people would end up entering and arriving in the European Union or a Member State by boat, crossing the Atlantic or the Mediterranean Sea to enter the European Union."
"This was never the idea of this Regulation, and now it is forcing countries in this situation to welcome these people who arrive by boat, in a disproportionate, difficult and serious situation."
"I am pleased to hear Commissioner Barrot say here that one of the possibilities for revision of this Regulation is to temporarily suspend it in the case of those countries that are bearing a disproportionate share of a particular burden."
"This is what we need: either this, or a well-functioning mechanism, one of solidarity, which permits immigrants arriving in a country bearing such a burden to proceed to another EU country."
"It is imperative that this revision is carried out, and as soon as possible."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, the Dublin system must be used to determine the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application."
"However, this system is deeply unjust."
"Asylum seekers can sometimes therefore be returned to a Member State which it is known will reject their asylum application whereas the Member State in which they are found would have granted them refugee status."
"This is the first injustice."
"In addition, this system poses a problem of solidarity between Member States."
"It is well-known that Member States situated at the external borders of Europe bear a greater burden."
"On our return from Malta, we demanded that the very principle of the Dublin system be questioned."
"We believe that the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application should not necessarily be the first country entered."
"There must be solidarity in the examination of applications."
"We have observed serious shortcomings, particularly with regard to the protection of unaccompanied minors."
"We have seen that Member States do not sufficiently use the instruments allowing minors to be reunited with members of their families present in another Member State."
"We also want minors to be able to join, for example, aunts and uncles in another Member State, rather than being left to their own devices."
"We must therefore extend the idea of the family."
"Finally, we deplore the virtually systematic use by some Member States of the detention of people awaiting a Dublin transfer."
"We would point out that these people are applying for international protection and that their application has not yet been examined in detail."
"The evaluation of the Dublin II Regulation must therefore allow us to correct the serious shortcomings that we have observed during our visits to the detention centres."
"We have visited numerous detention centres and I must tell you that some of these visits have left us quite disgusted."
"I must remind you that the aim of the Dublin Regulation is to determine the Member State responsible for examining the asylum application."
"The Regulation must allow access to the asylum system and must guarantee that a Member State carries out a detailed examination of every asylum application."
"The European Union must not ignore its responsibility towards third countries."
"It must guarantee protection of the right of asylum."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur for what was generally a balanced piece of work."
"I do not want to split hairs over a few details therefore."
"Besides, if we are completely fair, the evaluation is already quite dated."
"Priority number one, at least as far as the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is concerned, is to bring the available data from the Member States up to the same standard."
"Only then will a really good, and therefore effective, evaluation be possible."
"The Member States really do need to work on this, with the necessary guidance from the European Commission, of course."
"It is important to emphasise - and obviously I am making a different distinction here from Martine Roure - the fact that, on the basis of the transfer data obtained, we cannot conclude that the Dublin system as such results in a disproportionate transfer burden for the Member States at Europe's external borders."
"Of course - and that is what the rapporteur and also what the Commissioner said - the geographical position of these Member States means that they are confronted with a substantial burden."
"That is precisely the reason why the ALDE Group has been arguing all this time for a compulsory burden-sharing mechanism alongside the Dublin system, not only in terms of financial and material resources but also in terms of putting in manpower on the ground."
"After all, all 27 Member States are responsible for what is going on at Europe's external borders."
"I am also very intrigued, Commissioner, about what exactly you mean by the possibility of temporary suspension."
"What does that involve?"
"Does it mean that the asylum seeker can choose the Member State he wants to go to, that he is free to travel on?"
"If it does, that would seriously undermine the political message of the Dublin system."
"In short, just go for the compulsory solidarity mechanism that we have been arguing for all this time."
"Finally, if the EU wants to retain its credibility, there really does have to be an adequate and consistent level of protection in all 27 Member States."
"The importance of a proper common asylum procedure and corresponding status cannot be over-emphasised."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, Mrs Lambert's report should spur us on to deliberate seriously on this issue."
"The facts that the report describes are worrying."
"While the European Commission continues with new initiatives in the area of asylum and legal immigration, it appears that the implementation cannot be controlled."
"The cost calculation, data on asylum applications and the handling of personal details are inadequate."
"I find that a worrying conclusion."
"If the Dublin system already does not operate as it should, how will it work with the new initiatives on migration?"
"Can this House rely on the Council and the Commission to make serious work of the cost calculation?"
"Will the protection of personal data be taken seriously then?"
"I am very keen to hear what conclusion the Council draws from Mrs Lambert's report."
"It is clear to me that the Dublin system is not perfect yet."
"Can the Council investigate whether the exchange of data will work properly with the new initiatives on asylum and migration?"
"(EL) Mr President, the Dublin II system for granting asylum should, at long last, be revised."
"Firstly, it is not truly European: it does not guarantee genuine solidarity and support for those Member States that receive a disproportionate number of asylum seekers owing to their geographical location."
"The second and more important reason why it should be revised is that such disproportionate numbers often directly threaten the humanitarian principles and the obligation to treat people arriving at our borders in search of protection with dignity."
"We know that occasionally many Member States are either perfectly reasonably unable to fulfil their obligations according to the regulation or, in the worst case, they hide behind a lack of European solidarity to justify even extreme violations of human rights committed by their authorities."
"Practices such as detaining minors in unacceptable conditions and the wholesale rejection of asylum applications on political grounds are not justified by any lack of solidarity."
"We also know, however, that other Member States that do not face such problems consider their humanitarian obligation fulfilled if they accuse other states."
"We hear nothing about solidarity, however."
"Thus Dublin II has in practice led to a series of accusations and counter-accusations between Member States."
"The only real losers are the asylum seekers."
"It is therefore of crucial importance to establish a genuine common European asylum system."
"The debate will be resumed after the debate on Georgia."
"Situation in Georgia (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Georgia."
"(FR) I should like to welcome the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, President-in-Office of the Council and a former Member of this European Parliament, Mr Kouchner."
"I also welcome the Secretary of State for European Affairs, Jean-Pierre Jouyet."
"In particular I welcome the responsible Commissioner, Benita Ferrero-Waldner."
"I also welcome Jacques Barrot who unfortunately is leaving us."
"The European Council has just ended, but Minister Bernard Kouchner will undoubtedly tell us all about it himself."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I firstly want to welcome the European Parliament's political commitment to Georgia."
"I also want to start by congratulating the efforts of the French Presidency, in particular the speed of the actions taken at the moment of crisis."
"It is true that the European Union, through the negotiation of a ceasefire and the prompt delivery of humanitarian aid, in particular by the Commission, has proven its efficiency."
"Today's European Council was, in my opinion, very important and, given the complexity of the issues raised by this conflict, the European Union must and had to react collectively and define, by mutual agreement, the appropriate responses."
"I will be brief because a lot has already been said."
"In my opinion, our meeting today sent out a very clear message on Georgia, aimed at both Georgia and also Russia, in terms of our capacity to respond to crisis situations and the unity of the European Union."
"That is what we have always demanded."
"Secondly, our unity is also expressed through the defence of our values."
"Since the start of the crisis, as I have already said, the Commission has contributed to the EU's efforts aimed at stabilising the humanitarian and security situation in Georgia in, I believe, a fairly significant way."
"In terms of humanitarian aid, we immediately made available EUR 6 million which should allow the immediate needs of all the civilian populations affected by the conflict to be met."
"To this sum must be added nearly EUR 9 million made available in the meantime by the Member States."
"We have therefore managed to cover all the immediate humanitarian needs."
"As regards aid for reconstruction, last week we sent a Commission expert mission to make an initial assessment of the needs and, according to our initial evaluations, as Bernard Kouchner has already said, which do not include the areas under the control of Russia, the property damage is much less than anticipated."
"Around EUR 15 million will be needed for reconstruction and repair."
"However, the most pressing need is in relation to the fate of the 22 000 people recently displaced by the conflict."
"Around EUR 110 million will be required to meet their needs."
"It is important that the European Union shows that it is ready to provide real support to Georgia, as evidence of our political determination to strengthen our relations."
"First of all, the Council has decided to plan a substantial increase in our financial aid to Georgia, particularly for reconstruction, as I have just mentioned, and for the refugees."
"We are currently in the process of assessing the reserves that could be rapidly mobilised from the 2008 appropriations."
"However, there is no doubt that, without an extraordinary budget appropriation, we will be unable to mobilise the necessary funds."
"I am already delighted at the general political support that we have received today from President Pöttering in this regard."
"A conference of international donors will also be needed to send out a strong signal of confidence to investors."
"In my opinion, it is also more important than ever to strengthen the instruments of the neighbourhood policy in order to stabilise Georgia."
"Based on the European Council conclusions, we will step up our efforts to prepare, once the conditions are met, to create a free trade area and to facilitate the issue of short-term visas."
"The latter agreement will of course also be linked to a readmission agreement and it remains essential to encourage Georgia's commitment to democracy, rule of law and freedom of expression."
"It is crucial to speed up the democratic reforms and political pluralism."
"As regards stabilising security and implementing the ceasefire agreement, we are effectively relying on the civilian observation mission organised under the European Security and Defence Policy, as already mentioned."
"This must be closely linked with other EU actions, such as reconstruction."
"Now for some comments on relations with Russia."
"Russia's actions raise wider questions about the nature of our relations in both the short and long term."
"Its failure, to date, to honour the six-point plan brokered by the presidency and its decision to recognise Abkhazia and South Ossetia are against the basic principles that underpin international relations."
"We have been seeking to rework our relations into a modern partnership to reflect our growing economic integration."
"I think fundamental mutual interests are at stake - economic interdependence, the need to find common approaches on non-proliferation or counterterrorism or many other international questions - so keeping channels of communication open with Russia was - and is - vital."
"However, relations with Russia cannot remain 'business as usual' in the light of recent events."
"Therefore it was important to strike the right balance between maintaining channels of communication and sending a clear signal to Russia."
"I think the right approach is for our existing joint work and dialogues to continue but for new initiatives to be put on hold."
"Therefore the Commission will now review all new initiatives under way to deepen our relations, which then will allow the Council to draw conclusions ahead of the Nice Summit in November."
"Regarding long-term implications, recent events will give new importance to some areas of policy."
"Our commitment in June to developing an Eastern Partnership and a European Neighbourhood Policy does indeed demonstrate the EU's legitimate interests in the region."
"These policies underline the fact that we will not accept new dividing lines in Europe and that partners like Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova can count on our support for their territorial integrity and sovereignty."
"We are ready to accelerate and also to submit as soon as possible new proposals for a new Eastern Partnership, certainly before the end of the year but maybe even in the late autumn."
"Secondly - and this is my last point - energy is at the heart of our relations with Russia."
"What we do on energy inside Europe will directly shape our relations with Russia, so we must keep up the momentum to develop a coherent and strategic energy policy for Europe."
"In conclusion, recent events have posed a real challenge to the European Union."
"In the coming months, I think we will need to continue to show that we can rise together to the tasks ahead."
"Today has been a very important marker."
"Only through coherent strategy, united positions and concerted action can we defend European interests and values."
"I applaud Parliament's commitment, and trust that we will all play our parts in ensuring that the Union maintains a strong and a united front."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, the situation that has developed in Georgia since this summer is unacceptable and intolerable and merits a firm and determined response from the European Union."
"Russia has the same rights and obligations as all states in the international community."
"One of these obligations is to respect sovereignty and territorial integrity and in particular not to violate internationally recognised borders."
"By invading and occupying Georgian territory, and by recognising the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, the Russian authorities have flouted, one after the other, each of these three fundamental principles of international law."
"The European Union must actively participate in the resolution of this conflict and I congratulate the French Presidency on its proactive attitude."
"We must show that we are equal to meeting the hopes of thousands of Georgians who are proclaiming their distress in the streets of Tbilisi."
"My Group invites the Commission, the Council and all the Member States to demonstrate both their unity and also their resolve with regard to our Russian neighbour."
"The European Union cannot be content to verbally condemn these systematic violations of international law."
"Our Group believes that Europe must use the means that it has available, and in particular its political and economic tools, to put pressure on Russia and make it respect the agreements that it has signed."
"We call on Russia to honour all the commitments that it made on signing the ceasefire agreement, starting with the full and immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgian territory and the reduction of the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"We also condemn the looting perpetrated by the Russian invading forces and the accompanying mercenaries, as you very rightly said, Mr Kouchner."
"We are extremely concerned about the fate of the Georgian populations in South Ossetia who have been displaced by force, even after the signature of the ceasefire agreement."
"We strongly call on the Russian and South Abkhazian authorities to guarantee the return of these people to their homes."
"We call on the Council and the Commission to review their policy towards Russia, including the negotiations on the partnership agreement, if this country should fail to respect its commitments on the ceasefire."
"We also call on the Council and the Commission to positively contribute to the international mechanisms that will be put in place to resolve the conflict, including through a field mission under the European Security and Defence Policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this crisis has revealed the vulnerabilities of the European Union in several sensitive areas: firstly, our energy supply."
"More than ever we must ensure the security of Europe's energy supply."
"We must develop and protect alternatives to the Russian energy transport infrastructures."
"Furthermore, it seems obvious that the role of the European Union could be much greater in the management of this crisis if the European Security and Defence Policy were reinforced."
"The Lisbon Treaty allows for this reinforcement."
"We therefore call on the Member States which have not yet ratified this Treaty to do so as quickly as possible."
"Our Group considers that the only way of ensuring stability and security on both sides of the Atlantic is to develop cooperation on an equal basis between the European Union and the US."
"Finally, we would point out that Georgia wants to eventually join NATO."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a crucial moment and the European Union must not fail to take advantage of this opportunity to show that it is firm and determined with regard to the Russian Federation, however great and powerful the latter may be."
"The credibility of the European Union, the stability of the whole region, and the protection of our closest neighbours and even Member States of the Union depend on this."
"I also call on you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to ensure that relations with Ukraine are also very quickly resumed."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Please stand firm."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, for several days now, advertisements have been run in various newspapers with the following message: 'Lenin."
"Stalin."
"Putin."
"Give in?'"
"In fact, the message is somewhat simplistic, for it was actually under Lenin that South Ossetia became part of Georgia."
"In the process, some 18 000 lives were lost and around 50 000 people were expelled."
"Abkhazia became part of Georgia under Stalin."
"It is important to stick with the truth here and to take account of all sides' positions."
"Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who became the first http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Georgia"" \o ""President of Georgia"" of the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)"" \o ""Georgia (country)"" and has now become very fashionable again, described the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossetians"" \o ""Ossetians"" as 'trash that has to be swept out through the Rokihttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roki_tunnel"" \o ""Roki tunnel"" tunnel'."
"We do need to be mindful of this aspect of Georgian nationalism as well."
"None of this, however - and let me make this very clear, as Martin Schulz has done on many occasions - none of this justifies the Russian intervention which, after all, has been ongoing for years."
"It is the expression of imperialist behaviour and we have repeatedly seen Russia exploiting the existing minority conflicts accordingly."
"We have witnessed repeated threats and boycotts which we absolutely cannot accept."
"I do not wish to deny that mistakes have been made by the West and by Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, but in its relations with its neighbours, Russia has repeatedly sought to exploit internal conflicts for its own ends."
"Nor does the recognition of Kosovo offer any justification for this action."
"The fact is that the European Union has always made clear and unequivocal attempts to achieve an international multilateral solution."
"Russia has made no such attempt."
"The European Union has also offered clear and unequivocal support for the Serbian minority in Kosovo and will continue to do so."
"What has Russia done?"
"It has, at the very least, looked on while Georgians were expelled from South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and I hope that Mr Kouchner is right when he says that a new policy will now be adopted."
"The EU should now concentrate on giving our neighbours our backing and support."
"We have been proposing a Union for the Black Sea for some time."
"Whatever name we choose for this structure, it is clear that the current Neighbourhood Policy must be strengthened and reinforced and that we must invite everyone in the region who has an interest in the integrity and stability of this region, from Turkey to Kazakhstan, to get involved."
"If Russia is prepared to revert to a policy of cooperation and respect for its neighbours, Russia will be invited to join as well."
"Russia feels strong at the moment because of the high energy prices, but we all know that this is not a sound economic basis for Russia and that it has a lot to gain from partnership and cooperation with Europe."
"In the meantime, we must focus on giving our neighbours our clear support."
"In that sense, Mr President-in-Office, may I say that the conclusions that you have agreed at today's Summit are good conclusions which offer a sound basis on which to move forward, for they are a clear expression of what is realistic and sustainable."
"I hope that the European Parliament will arrive at similarly clear and consensus-based conclusions as the Council, so that the European Union can speak with one - and a stronger - voice."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I am a little surprised by the President-in-Office's speech tonight, as indeed I am by its delivery from the podium d'honneur."
"The conflict in the Caucasus is one for which both sides must take responsibility, as you have said, President-in-Office."
"So why do the Council's conclusions not reflect this?"
"President Saakashvili cannot have believed that military intervention would evoke no response from Russia. Equally, Russia's reaction was disproportionate."
"You said, 'Les dégâts n'ont pas été considérables,' and yet Commissioner Ferrero Waldner has given us the figures and this House will be called on to agree to pay the bill!"
"On one thing we do agree with you: we must condemn Russia's actions; they are indefensible, but we will not dissuade the Russian bear by backing Medvedev into a corner."
"Dialogue and engagement will defuse tensions better than isolation."
"That is the lesson of the Cold War, and the Union - as with the Helsinki Process - has a central role to play."
"This conflict highlights the need for us to build a common foreign and security policy."
"And though Member States hold diffuse views about Russia, your presidency was quick to negotiate its six-point plan and for that credit is due."
"The plan may not be perfect, but it has brought an end to violence and it should be fully implemented, including Russian withdrawal from the Black Sea port of Poti."
"But what steps should the Union take now?"
"The Council is right to agree a crisis-management and reconstruction fund and the rapid deployment of humanitarian assistance."
"Now it must designate an EU representative who will make both sides listen."
"The Union is right to send observers, but they must replace Russian peacekeepers, which will mean commitment from those Member States which are not already stretched militarily on other fronts."
"Europe should convene a trans-Caucasian peace conference, bringing together all sides in the search for the settlement of unresolved conflicts."
"But the Union should start in one area of glaring inconsistency which requires little more than ministerial fiat to fix."
"End the anomaly whereby Georgian citizens with Russian passports have freer access to the European Union, because this encourages them to adopt Russian citizenship."
"Georgians should have the same access to Europe as Russians, although this could be achieved by freezing the visa facilitation agreement with Russia."
"In strengthening our neighbourhood policy, how can we ensure continued cooperation with Russia while showing that a full 'strategic partnership' is no longer credible?"
"What more can we do to cut Europe's dependence on Russia's energy supplies?"
"You did well to strengthen the text of your conclusions in that regard."
"Russia must of course face the consequences of its illegal actions, perhaps including a discussion on the future of the Sochi Winter Olympics just 40 km from the border."
"Can Russia's behaviour be considered in keeping with the Olympic Charter?"
"No."
"Solving these matters requires determination, foresight and patience."
"That is a challenge that this Union must meet and I am afraid, President-in-Office, one that we must meet before we offer you your vin d'honneur."
"Could I say to the next speaker that, at the next Conference of Presidents, we will be looking at the order of the political groups as one objection has already been raised."
"For today, I will call Mr Szymański next, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group."
"We will be looking at this matter on Thursday, as no one can explain to me why the order is as it is."
"It is an issue that needs to be clarified systematically."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Kouchner, Russia is not complying with three of the six points in the agreement negotiated on our behalf by President Sarkozy."
"By failing to do so, Russia has forfeited the right to be deemed Europe's partner."
"The European Union's credibility is therefore also at stake in this dispute."
"It is not enough to set up humanitarian aid, rebuild Georgia and introduce visa facilitation and trading agreements."
"Russia needs to fully experience what self-isolation is like."
"If it does not, we shall actually be depriving it of the opportunity to review its policy."
"Russia will simply be confirmed in its belief that it can get away with anything."
"In the run-up to the next presidential elections, due in 2012, generating awareness of increasing political and economic isolation is our only chance of sowing doubt and division amongst the dominant group in Moscow."
"Russia must not be allowed to benefit from this aggression."
"We need to review our energy policy."
"Europe's room for manoeuvre is already limited because of its dependence on Russia."
"Do we really wish to aggravate the situation?"
"The Member States should put an end to their involvement in the construction of the northern and southern pipelines at the earliest opportunity."
"If we fail to draw these long-term conclusions, we run the risk of being sidelined and becoming a laughing stock."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, in the current situation, we should be discussing what to do now."
"I believe that what the Council has decided and what has been done is basically what was possible, although we could always quibble about whether an Extraordinary European Council of the Heads of State or Government should not have been held straightaway to show our cohesion, but so be it."
"I believe that we must now ask some fundamental questions. The most fundamental question clearly concerns our position towards Russia, our cooperation with Russia and how we are in fact going to solve these problems in the Caucasus, because there is also Nagorno-Karabakh."
"We could from now on see permanent conflicts and President Sarkozy could therefore find himself permanently faced with such situations."
"He could take a room in the Kremlin and remain there indefinitely; that would also be a possibility."
"My opinion is as follows: firstly, Mr Daul, if there is something that we should not be discussing, it is Georgia and Ukraine joining NATO."
"This is truly the most idiotic idea at the moment because it means that we would be unable to go any further politically."
"Will Georgia or Ukraine join NATO when its reforms have been carried out?"
"Perhaps, I am not sure."
"However, this is not really the relevant issue today."
"Do you think that, if Georgia had been in NATO, Article 5 would have been mobilised?"
"Of course not!"
"Therefore we should not talk rubbish."
"On the other hand - and here I agree with Mr Watson - how we can control actions such as those of President Saakashvili? While we agree that Russia's action was unacceptable, it was also unacceptable for a Georgian President to decide to bomb a town, for whatever reason!"
"If you are provoked, you should respond in another way, not by bombing."
"Therefore there is a real political problem."
"We propose to tackle this political problem as follows: we should propose to Georgia and Ukraine a privileged partnership as a first step towards possible integration."
"This integration can then take place if there is a fundamental reform in Europe, and so on. However, we should have political instruments and not just economic and social instruments to bring pressure to bear on these political classes."
"A future in the European space specifically means a future in which these countries are rid of nationalism."
"We should consider the phrase of François Mitterrand: 'nationalism is war'."
"Georgian nationalism, Russian nationalism, Abkhazian nationalism and South Ossetian nationalism is war!"
"We in Europe must say 'our view is to go beyond that'."
"Therefore, by proposing a European view, we are also proposing to put on the table European values because, if nationalism endures in these regions, we will never find a solution."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, with regard to the crisis in the Caucasus, adopting a pro-Georgian or a pro-Russian stance can only lead to deadlock."
"This has been blindingly obvious since the breakup of the Soviet Union 17 years ago as this region is full of recurring tensions and disputed borders. It is a place where the collective memory is haunted by the inherited traumas of successive wars and violence, where the ethnic and religious mosaic and the accumulation of resentments and humiliations provide dangerously fertile ground for nationalism."
"In this context, political irresponsibility will cost dear, and that is true for everyone."
"It is certainly true for the Georgian President who, since his election in 2004, has constantly pandered to the spirit of revenge in relation to the breakaway territories."
"He has constantly pushed his luck in terms of his allegiance to the Bush administration and his policy of confrontation in the region."
"He has launched an attack on South Ossetia, about which Mr Van den Brande, one of the co-rapporteurs of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, responsible for monitoring problems in the region, has declared having been - and I quote - 'shocked by the stories of the refugees about the massive and indiscriminate shelling and bombing of Tskhinvali and the destruction of residential areas'."
"This strategy is disastrous for Georgia, for the Caucasus and for Europe."
"This lesson is also valid for Russia."
"The brutality of the counter-attack, including against civilian populations, the continued occupation of strategic sectors of the Georgian territory, the expulsion of Georgian populations from South Ossetia and the unilateral recognition of the independence of the two breakaway territories are just as likely to threaten the interest generated in more than one European country by the initial international initiatives of the new President."
"Russia has everything to lose by returning to a period of political isolation in Europe and in the world."
"Finally, the West as a whole would do well to assess the unprecedented damage already caused by the American attitude of adventurism and the European attitude of follow-my-leader in this part of the continent."
"The limitless expansion strategy of NATO, the bombing of Serbia, the recognition of the unilaterally proclaimed independence of Kosovo, the support for the installation of the anti-missile defence shield on European soil, not to mention the extreme glorification of the region's leaders who should, perhaps, be more cautious when making anti-Russian and pro-Western statements, all these choices are evidence of a short-sighted policy worthy of the current White House, but not worthy of a European security policy."
"This strategy of militarising international relations and causing political confrontations has failed before our very eyes."
"In addition to sending in European observers under the aegis of the OSCE, the EU's priority should therefore be to prevent any escalation at any cost so that, as quickly as possible and without any signs of arrogance, it can explore the possibility of drafting a new pan-European treaty for security and cooperation which would be legally binding and which would encompass all the problems that have currently been shelved: territorial integrity, inviolability of borders, the fate of conflicts that have reached a stalemate, non-use of force, disarmament and even security of energy supplies."
"This challenge is certainly more difficult to tackle now than ever before but, without such a perspective, I fear the worst is yet to come."
"In adopting our position, let us remember that today, the first of September, is the International Day of Peace."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I come from a country whose history is marked by war and suffering."
"Poland supports endeavours for peace everywhere."
"It is imperative that this goal be achieved."
"The East European countries, the so-called 'Baltic States', inspired by their leaders, want the European Union to show that Russia will pay some unspecified price for its military action in Georgia."
"This can be depicted as a classic example of political orthodoxy which assumes that Russia pursues nothing but imperial goals."
"This traditional mindless attitude to Russia, full of empty platitudes, seems to be humiliating because it can be perceived, for example by Russia, as a clinical example of a response by a few hot-headed politicians."
"The European Union needs Russia as much as it needs Georgia, if not more."
"Therefore, it is imperative that the European Union should not be a party to this conflict or take sides with either Russia or Georgia."
"The European Union must show the world that its policy is independent of the United States and, at the same time, is a friendly policy based upon a full partnership."
"Russia is the EU's third-biggest trading partner, accounting for half a trillion dollars in European goods."
"Can we afford to risk that kind of relationship?"
"There is no doubt that the European Parliament is a genuine co-legislator with the Council under the codecision procedure."
"However, is it really an equal partner in the matter of the EU's foreign affairs?"
"Minister, you spoke to us after everything seems to have been decided on Georgia."
"Let me ask then: is the voice of the European Parliament supposed to mean nothing?"
"What is this debate for when everything has been arranged and done?"
"on behalf of the NI Group. - (PL) Commissioner, there is a strong link between the outbreak of fighting in the Caucasus and the issue of Kosovo."
"I am one of those who opposed the carve-up of Serbia. From the outset we highlighted the fact that the unilateral decision by the Kosovo Albanians, supported by the United States and by many European countries, would amount to opening Pandora's box and would re-ignite similar disputes the world over."
"The Georgian situation is one such case. President Saakashvili of Georgia took the decision to attack civilians in Ossetia."
"It should be recalled that Abkhazia and Ossetia are nations that have occupied their respective homelands for centuries. They have developed their own culture and identity and have on several occasions fought for their independence, which Stalin deprived them of before the Second World War."
"Serbia and Georgia constitute an excellent example of how some are more equal than others in the international arena, and of how international law is always interpreted by the strongest allies."
"Furthermore, the European order has been destroyed, with the support of many Members of this House."
"Let us restore peace and the rule of international law to Europe!"
"Let us restore the European order!"
"I call on the countries that supported the carve-up of Serbia to withdraw their recognition of Kosovo, and on Russia to withdraw its recognition of Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"If the partition of Serbia recognised by the United States and by most Member States of the Union is deemed to be a good thing, how can a similar operation in Georgia be condemned?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I can but appeal to you to be less hypocritical."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) I understand that my big mistake, Mr Watson, was to have spoken from this podium."
"If you only have that to reproach me for, I can make amends, because the last time I was here, I spoke from this podium and I was not Head of State."
"When all is said and done, everyone can make a mistake."
"There are a number of questions which I can try to answer and others which I truly cannot."
"It is clear, Mr Daul, that we all want, particularly in relation to this crisis - and this is one of the priorities of the French Presidency - to successfully implement a European defence policy."
"What does 'successfully' mean?"
"It means, in any event, that we must restart the process that allowed us, in Saint-Malo, to at least reach an understanding. We must then build on this with a common purpose."
"We will do this, or so I hope. In fact we must do this, but not because this crisis merited a military response."
"Not by any stretch of the imagination!"
"To have considered a military response to Russia's invasion of Georgia would have been worse than anything."
"In fact I do not believe that the vessels which arrived in the Black Sea were an appropriate response, as some of these vessels were carrying missiles. In my opinion, that was not what we should have done, but the French Presidency had the opposite opinion."
"In fact, in order to enjoy a solid European defence, which we do need, the Lisbon Treaty must be accepted, which brings us back to our own institutional difficulties."
"We absolutely have to find a way out of this institutional crisis."
"In my honest opinion, I do not think that NATO is the right response in this situation."
"It is in fact the wrong response as, if we had voted for the Membership Action Plan (MAP) in Bucharest, strictly speaking this would not have made any difference because I believe that no one was ready to make war on behalf of Georgia. I say this without any cynicism."
"I say this because this was the opinion that was truly unanimous at the start of all the meetings and conversations that we had."
"This does not mean - because we have said so - that neither Georgia nor Ukraine have the right to become members of NATO."
"There is also something else to be considered."
"It is hard to say this at the moment, so I will be very discreet, but there is one country, Russia, which for 20 years felt that it was badly treated."
"I believe that, in one way, in particular here in the European Union, this was somewhat true."
"We were unable to find the language to speak to Russia."
"Perhaps we would not have been successful anyway, but I believe that we did not sufficiently realise that changes were happening because, after all, Georgia, 20 years ago, was itself also in the Soviet orbit. It was also a Communist country."
"On both sides there has been a truly incomplete exercise in democracy."
"I believe that, as with all countries, the problem will arise later on for Ukraine and for Georgia, but I truly do not believe that this was the response."
"On the other hand, you are right: we must strengthen our relations with Ukraine, as mentioned in this document."
"We will talk in a minute about a privileged partnership."
"To Mr Swoboda I would say - and this is an anecdote - that I wanted to go and see Stalin's house in Gori, because that is where his house is."
"He was born there."
"You could say that he drew small red circles on the map to mark where there could be autonomy or, in any event, communities where there could not."
"He was very familiar with the region and already Ossetia and Abkhazia did not get on with either the Georgians or the rest of the region."
"We did not need this crisis to find out that there were conflicts in the area."
"What is worse than the Balkans?"
"The Caucasus."
"What is worse than the Caucasus?"
"The Balkans."
"I am not sure, but I think what is happening there is actually very widespread. If you go back just a bit further, if you think about what happened in Chechnya, which I strongly condemn, you can see that the allies of the Chechens were the Abkhazians against Georgia."
"We should leave all that in the past, although it may be necessary to return to it."
"You have said, and I agree, that nothing justifies this reaction."
"Nothing."
"However, we must look at how this series of provocations has arisen because, honestly, the stories are so different that it all becomes very difficult."
"When we were in Moscow negotiating this document, we were asked how they should have reacted. Should they have left their own to die and allowed the bombings?"
"Do not forget the initial figures."
"I am not going to discuss these because I really have no way of checking them, but the Russians straightaway talked about 1 000 to 2 000 deaths which is no doubt untrue because the only people who went there, namely Human Rights Watch, talked about a few hundred."
"In fact they reported hundreds, or even dozens."
"I am not sure."
"In any event, it was a reaction that theoretically was justified by the very high number of victims and, once again, I went to listen to the refugees in North Ossetia and the accounts were dreadful: grenades in basements where children were hiding."
"I have not made this up."
"Perhaps this was not true but there is a tone of voice that does not lie."
"I have seen many refugees in my life. These were scared witless."
"They had travelled for two days on this road through the tunnel."
"This must also be checked."
"You are absolutely right that we need a neighbourhood policy, but that is exactly what the Turks are trying to do at the moment."
"The Turks have put in place what they are calling a regional platform and they want to set up talks between Russia, which has already agreed, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and - it is they who are responsible for this - obviously Georgia and Turkey."
"I think that this is a good idea and, on behalf of the Presidency, I have agreed to meet them very shortly."
"Mr Babachan should have been here today so that we could find out how to exchange our experiences, but I do agree with your analysis of the need for a neighbourhood policy."
"Mrs Benita Ferrero-Waldner must also agree with me that this is what we should do."
"They are our great neighbour."
"If they cannot find ways to talk to Russia, then we will certainly have great difficulty, all the more so as you heard Mr Medvedev say yesterday that sanctions could be applied in both directions and that he also knew how to do it."
"Sanctions do not amount to the same thing when one side supplies the gas and the other side does not want to receive it."
"We must therefore look realistically at the situation."
"It is he who turns the tap, not us."
"Mr Watson, as regards the figures you gave, I agree with your sentiment."
"What has Mr Saakashvili done?"
"When we had our discussions with him, given that I have met with him on two occasions, he said that - actually we should not go into that discussion because I would certainly be biased and I do not have enough information - but he said that he had been obliged to respond to the provocation."
"He had watched the other side prepare the batteries, and in particular the Grad rockets."
"They had arrived and set up in the Georgian villages around the capital of Ossetia."
"Who do we believe?"
"I do not know."
"In any event, some advisors have said that things did not happen at all like the international press told it."
"There is no one really credible in this whole affair."
"As an observer, you know that the problem has not been solved."
"We have tried."
"Javier Solana says that we must call them observers. We are therefore calling them observers and in the text they are termed observers."
"Peacekeepers are something else because that would need the full withdrawal by the Russians of all those who took part in the battle."
"The resolutions on both Abkhazia and Ossetia indicated that there should be two-thirds/one-third."
"Two-thirds were responsible for keeping the peace, the Russian peacekeepers, and the rest were Georgians."
"Each accuse the other and they both accuse the peacekeeping forces decided by the OSCE and by the UN of having participated in both sides, right from the start of the battle."
"It therefore seems to me that this cannot continue and sending in peacekeepers is a bigger operation which we will try to set up. However, for the time being, it is going to be difficult."
"We need an international conference to resolve these conflicts that have reached a stalemate."
"For the moment we should try to have a conference on Ossetia as that is the most urgent, and then on Abkhazia."
"As regards passports, I do not know who raised this problem of passports."
"Yes, passports were distributed, very widely, and therefore the people that I met, the Ossetian refugees, felt like Russian citizens, which is clearly very perverse."
"They felt like Russian citizens, they were welcomed in Russia and they were defended like Russian citizens."
"When you realise that apparently the same happened in the Crimea, you can only feel very concerned."
"We must therefore tackle this problem with the Russians in an extremely subtle but firm manner."
"They are distributing passports to populations that they deem to be Russian."
"However, this cannot be said without remembering that the borders of Russia were fairly arbitrarily drawn by Mr Gorbachev and Mr Yeltsin, at great speed and without taking account of history."
"I am not going to go into this problem. I do not want to dwell on the fact that Kiev was the capital of Russia and that the Crimea provides access to the seven seas."
"However, if you thought that the Russians were going to abandon the only tunnel passing between North Ossetia and South Ossetia, in other words crossing the Caucasus, then you were mistaken."
"We must understand these contradictions of history and also these contradictions of geography, but not give satisfaction to one side or the other."
"The Presidency of the European Union has not made any moral judgements about either side. It has been said that this action was excessive, that this was not the way to solve the problem, that this town should not have been bombed at night and that such a heavy attack should not have occurred in reply."
"However, once again, we need to know something about how this happened."
"Mr Szymański, you said that only three points have been implemented."
"That is not bad as no one else has tried to do even one apart from us."
"Three points have been implemented and these were the three most important: ceasefire, withdrawal of troops and access to humanitarian aid."
"If that is all we have achieved, then we need not be ashamed."
"I believe it was very important to start with these."
"As for the other three, we should wait for 8 September because, after that, no pressure will be spared. We will decide all together what we should do."
"That means the 27 countries of the European Council and also Parliament which we have got into the habit of consulting in the meantime."
"In fact Jean-Pierre and myself have got into a constant habit of consulting you and talking to you."
"Nothing is taken for granted."
"If, on 8 September, we find that movements have begun, then alright."
"However, if nothing has been done, we must take another look."
"That is absolutely clear."
"Aggression cannot pay."
"Of course it cannot pay, but who should pay the price?"
"I like the sermonisers who say, with regard to the Russian army, what did you expect?"
"What should have been done?"
"I note that the most resolute people and a number of those who will in fact tomorrow visit Georgia and who were very decided in their thundering replies will not do anything at all."
"I believe, like Francis Wurtz, that for a very long time Georgia has been encouraged to prove that it is, how should I say, robust and virile."
"I believe that this was not good advice because encouraging a country to prove itself to be vindictive, or in any event decided in its resistance, when it is not given the means, does not sit very well with me."
"I felt, together with the government, that, not only were they very unfortunate, because there were victims and because Georgians were in the streets not knowing which saint to pray to, but that there was also something like a feeling of abandonment among them."
"They were promised so much, they were promised a lot, and these promises were not kept."
"As regards the Nabucco pipeline, of course there are explanations like that."
"It is a pipeline; it is oil that passes through it."
"Obviously all that must be taken into account, in one sense or another."
"This brings us back to what you said."
"I would point out, Mr Daul, that, in reality, that is not the only priority of the French Presidency. There is also energy and this is one way of truly focusing our attention - and this is in the text - on energy and on renewable energies, of course."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, what are we doing now?"
"We have done what we could, namely to try and halt the war."
"Perhaps this was not perfect, perhaps the document is not perfect, perhaps it was quickly written and perhaps a struggle had to be fought between the two delegations in order to arrive at some sort of coherence."
"It was not at all perfect."
"However, in the end, it has worked for the time being."
"It is not sufficient, but it has worked."
"I completely agree that there are other difficult places, such as Nagorno-Karabakh, Nachichevan and others."
"There are plenty of places - and I do not think that the Russians are interested in these in the same way - such as Nagorno-Karabakh, but also other places, in particular the Crimea."
"There can be no doubt of this."
"It is not insulting the Russians to say that we are watching what is happening."
"That is actually our duty."
"As regards NATO, I will say something else very cautiously."
"At the Bucharest Summit, we - the six founding countries of Europe - voted against the MAP. In fact, in the end, we did not vote, we did not even have to vote, because there was no unanimity."
"The explanation was really very difficult and the six founding countries said that this is our neighbour. We must take into account that we have not been able to build or maintain adequate relations with this great country and that we do not want to leave it with a siege feeling, a kind of permanent siege."
"I believe that we were right."
"Now we are talking about anti-missile batteries set up in Poland and also in the Czech Republic. It is true that this is also not the way to dialogue, although they are not aimed towards Russia."
"However, what is important, without doubt more on the side of Iran and our policy towards Iran, is absolutely keeping the six together. Perhaps this policy could be conducted with Russia, and this is very important, because I believe that we would have a lot to lose by not retaining these channels of partnership."
"How can we control the actions of Mr Saakashvili?"
"I do not know, but a town cannot be bombed at night."
"I believe that a town should not be bombed at night."
"Once again, I do not know what the level of this bombing was, but how could they have expected any other reaction from Russia having done that?"
"I do not understand."
"I should just like to make a quick comment on the François Mitterrand quotation."
"François Mitterrand actually said: 'Nationalism, to a point, is about culture and is what forms a nation."
"I wanted to correct that."
"In response to Francis Wurtz, I should like to go back to the words 'Cold War', which he did not use but which he implied, because each time we hear all around: 'are we returning to the Cold War?'"
"However, this cannot mark the return to the Cold War, firstly because the historical circumstances are totally different."
"There may be animosities, but I agree that we must absolutely condemn this expression."
"On the other hand, the need not to talk, but to re-form two blocks, one against the other, has been much mentioned."
"A number of the Members of this noble House, and in fact their countries, think like this."
"We must tackle this idea head on."
"I absolutely disagree with it."
"It is absolutely the opposite of what we should do and would clearly resemble Cold War, minus the ideology."
"That does not mean that we must absolutely accept all hyper-nationalist statements as we have done."
"We must find a way to talk and maintain these channels."
"That is what we are trying to do."
"I would remind Francis that several of the proposals were made by Mr Medvedev in the security treaty that you mentioned, although he does not seem likely to apply this straightaway."
"Perhaps he will do so at a later date."
"He proposed this on 5 June to you all."
"He received the reply that it was interesting and that it was essential to take him at his word."
"However, we were immediately caught up by a small wave of panic."
"The European Union apparently needs an independent policy from the US which is itself a great independent country."
"Mr Wojciechowski, that is what we have done."
"The European Union needs an independent policy from the US and from Russia. It needs an EU policy."
"That is what we have tried to do."
"The initial reaction of our American friends when we decided to get involved was not very kind."
"They thought that we should not do so but, very quickly, they realised, on the contrary, given that they are very pragmatic, that this was exactly what should be done."
"As a result, they were, shall we say, cooperative as it was Mrs Condoleezza Rice who got the six-point agreement signed."
"They were then extremely critical, not of the six-point agreement but of the fact that the Russians had not abided by it."
"This I can understand."
"We were also critical."
"My final point is about Pandora's box and Kosovo."
"I wanted to talk to you about this."
"There is an intellectual tendency to compare Kosovo to Ossetia, with which I really cannot agree."
"We cannot say, just because there is a small population which feels, due to some particular nationalist urge, the need to be liberated, that this is the same thing."
"No!"
"Firstly, in the Caucasus, people are in the habit of tearing each other to pieces in a truly violent manner with there being a great deal of profit in murder over the centuries."
"This is not at all the case with Kosovo and Serbia. What was different with Kosovo and Serbia was the unanimity of one group, 98% of Kosovars, and in particular the international decision."
"This was not because we bombed Serbia through NATO."
"In fact this occurred after nearly two years of the Contact Group, in which Russia was involved, and a Rambouillet conference which lasted over a month and at which everyone was in agreement except for Mr Milošević."
"What triggered everything, and I will end on this point, was the decision by Mr Milošević in 1999 at Kosovo Field, at Obilić, to declare that there would be no more autonomy, to hound the Kosovars out of the administration and to bring in Serbians from Belgrade to replace them, such that Mr Ibrahim Rugova, from the Democratic League of Kosovo, had to set up underground schools and clandestine hospitals."
"This is totally different."
"The process was accepted by international opinion because there had been a whole international approach."
"The Finnish President, Martti Ahtisaari, produced a document that everyone at the UN accepted and that said 'the parties are not able to reach an agreement'."
"I am about to finish. There are some hatreds that cannot be overcome."
"I am sorry, I sensed - and I am being very careful in what I say - in the words of the Ossetians about the Georgians, something which resembled that undying hatred which is based on tens of years and centuries of opposition."
"This does not mean that one day this will not happen, but it will take time and several generations, I believe."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner: 'Le nationalisme, c'est la guerre!'"
"This is an exact quote from François Mitterrand's speech to the European Parliament, with no abbreviation."
"I think we can learn from this, and the lesson to be learned is European integration."
"That means no longer attempting to settle past accounts, but starting afresh in order to make war and dictatorship an impossibility in Europe once and for all."
"I should like to voice my most heartfelt thanks to the French Presidency for its rapid intervention to end the war and for bringing about a European Council decision today which is an expression of unity."
"Unity is the most important signal that we can send out."
"It is a signal that we will not accept violations of international law, that we will not accept war and the invasion of foreign countries, and that we will not accept the destabilisation of democratically elected governments or the invasion and occupation of another country."
"It is important, therefore, to make it clear that there will be no negotiations on the partnership and cooperation agreement until there is compliance with the fifth principle of the ceasefire agreement - namely a return to the lines held before 7 August - and that an evaluation of compliance with all six principles of the ceasefire agreement must now begin and continue in the run-up to the forthcoming summit scheduled to take place in November 2008."
"It is important that we make clear that certain things will not be accepted, but it is also important - so that we do not slip into an escalation spiral - to make it clear that lines of communication must remain open."
"Above all, we must reinforce our own capacities, and that means reinforcing our friends' capacities as well."
"It means providing immediate infrastructural assistance to Georgia without red tape."
"It means participating in peace missions in Georgia and in initiatives carried out by the OSCE and the UN."
"We must make it clear that negotiations on a free trade agreement are the right path to pursue, as indeed are the proposals that we have made here in the House in line with the Polish-Swedish initiative or our proposal for an 'EEA Plus'."
"This applies not only to Georgia but also to countries such as Moldova and especially Ukraine."
"I think these are clear signals which enable us to move forward in a positive way."
"If in so doing, we could recognise that we could do this so much better, if only we did not always have to bale out a situation which others have caused, if only we had a European foreign policy which, under the Treaty of Lisbon, would give us appropriate mechanisms and increased preventive capacities to stop this situation from arising in the first place, that would be a policy that we should pursue."
"This crisis should clearly demonstrate that, as the European Union, we must strengthen our own capacities if we want to prevent war and move towards a positive future."
"(NL) Mr President, I endorse the words of many fellow Members that the reaction today of the European Summit to the events of the past month is the right reaction."
"We have spoken with one voice and at the same time maintained our composure."
"However, the EU - and this is also made clear in today's statement - has let it be known in no uncertain terms that what happened there, especially the Russian reaction, is not acceptable and that the disproportionate reaction of Russia to the military developments in Georgia must be condemned."
"At the same time all parties have stated that the use of military force is not the right solution and I consider that also to be an implicit criticism of the actions of the Georgian Government which started the military activities."
"This reaction also shows that we believe, and rightly so, that we do not solve problems in Europe in this way, that this is not in accordance with the security agreements that we have and which were made in the past on the problems with South Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia."
"I also distance myself from the statements of the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr Lavrov, that the way Russia reacted has set the tone for Russia's new foreign policy in the surrounding region."
"I think that the European Union should do everything it can to persuade Mr Lavrov and the Russian Government that this is not the way that we in Europe try to resolve issues or press our interests."
"Cooperation is the watchword, not unilateral action."
"I remember discussions over the past few years about the actions of the Bush Administration."
"I hope that we will not end up having the same discussion with Russia."
"That is why it is so important that the Council today, under the leadership of the French President-in-Office, has called again for attention to be given to this issue and has put the emphasis on the six-point plan, especially the return to the previous military status quo."
"By doing that he is laying the foundations for an international mechanism to keep the peace and particularly for an international debate about the future status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and he is dissociating himself, and rightly so, from the recognition by Russia of the independence of these two separatist regions."
"That is also our opening position for a mission to Moscow that will take place next week at the highest level and which will again have to put pressure on Moscow to implement those six points."
"In these circumstances it goes without saying that our position is that, as long as there is no clarity about implementing this agreement, as long as there is no agreement, we will not engage in any further talks about the new partnership agreement."
"This crisis is placing great demands on the European Union."
"It is right that we take the lead in the search for solutions."
"There is no alternative: NATO cannot do it, the OSCE is too weak, America is not in the position that we are in, and the UN cannot play a mediating role due to the blockades in the Security Council."
"Today's summit was of one mind, let that remain so."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in fact find ourselves commenting on decisions already taken and, given the widely differing information on fatalities, crimes and possible war crimes, I believe the European Union ought to propose that the investigation be an international one, if necessary with the involvement of the International Criminal Court."
"Apart from that, as for the reasons why we have reached this point, Mr Kouchner said that some people had given Georgia too much encouragement to flex its muscles and issue threats."
"This is undoubtedly true, but in that case let us say that some people also discouraged the Georgians from feeling European. We, in the European Union, are those people, because the European inclination of Georgia and its people is a fact that we have ignored."
"Hundreds of them signed a Radical Party appeal at the end of the 1990s calling for a European future for Georgia, which we have denied them."
"That is why, and I am concluding, the suggested international conference ought to involve the unrepresented peoples of the entire area and examine that area's European prospects, both political and strategic."
"(LV) Ladies and gentlemen, today's summit meeting is focused on offering assistance to Georgia."
"That is necessary, but it is also Russia's duty to participate financially in Georgia's reconstruction."
"What else must happen so that the European Union can properly assess Russia's role in events and take action to ensure that nothing of the kind is ever repeated?"
"Firstly, it must be acknowledged that this was planned aggression on the part of Russia, and that it started with the systematic provocation of Georgia over many months."
"If Russia's aggression and recognition of the independence of the separatist regions are not met with an appropriate response, then that will be a clear signal that it can act in the same way again in the future."
"After all, there are many Russian citizens in the EU states, too, whom the EU is willing to protect."
"There are many things that Russia needs from us, but we consistently lose the initiative."
"Firstly, we should freeze the agreement on the visa facilitation system with Russia."
"At the same time, such an agreement should be concluded with Georgia."
"Secondly, until Russia has fully released the occupied territories, the operation of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement must be suspended."
"Thirdly, the so-called Russian peace-keeping forces must be replaced with international peace-keepers, respecting Georgia's territorial integrity."
"I also suggest that the International Olympic Committee be called upon to announce a new competition for the organisation of the Winter Olympics in 2014, since holding them in a totalitarian state will only lead to problems."
"We should not be worried or fearful about the suspension of so-called dialogue."
"At the moment the dialogue has turned into the expression of one-sided offers on our side and infringement of the rules on the Russian side."
"We need to understand that only strong action can make Russia opt for a position worthy of a 21st century state."
"Russia is just one state."
"It is not special."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I represented you in Georgia when I was sent there by our President from 12 to 17 August."
"I gave our full support to the Georgian people and reassured them by saying that the European Union would not abandon them."
"I therefore thank the Presidency for the efforts that were made to act very quickly in Georgia."
"Resolving this conflict is clearly a test for the European Union to which it has finally responded, but at what price?"
"At the price once again of innocent citizens because these events were in fact inevitable."
"How long have some of us been preaching in the wilderness?"
"Even those who are today saying that we must aim for integration and offer the prospect of accession to the European Union previously said to us: 'wait, be reasonable'."
"Now we have a war between Russia and Georgia."
"When we said that this was not a conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia and South Ossetia, but that it was a conflict between Russia and Georgia, no one wanted to listen."
"Now we have one war behind us."
"Therefore these events were inevitable, particularly if you go back to other events or other times before the 11th."
"Let us go back to 2005 when Russia vetoed having border guards on the Russian-Georgian border."
"No one replied and even France - please excuse me Mr President - even France refused when we called for OSCE forces on the border."
"No one reacted."
"When the Russians violated Georgian airspace, we again had no response and the situation escalated."
"Now this regrettable war has occurred and we must not only rebuild, but also resolve the conflict."
"Of course we must have a conference on reconstruction, but we must also have a conference to resolve the conflict."
"I would ask you perhaps to use what happened in Kosovo as a model, in other words to put in place an international civil administration, together with peacekeeping forces."
"What Georgian citizen could now agree to the Russian army playing the role of policeman?"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, I should like to start by voicing my thanks for the objectivity of this debate; it is certainly more objective than the extraordinary meeting held by the Committee on Foreign Affairs on 20 August."
"Let us be blunt."
"Georgian President Saakashvili ordered a military offensive."
"That was what actually sparked off the war and triggered a spiral of violence."
"If we ignore that fact, we deny the real cause of the war."
"The attacks, especially on the civilian population in Tskhinvali, are to be roundly condemned, along with the military response, especially the military response by Russia and the attacks on the civilian population, particularly in the town of Gori."
"Both sides have deployed cluster bombs in this conflict as well, which is unacceptable."
"International humanitarian law and the law of war have been clearly violated by both sides in this conflict."
"The message which I have heard very often, however, is that Russia is solely responsible for the current situation."
"That is not the case, and I am pleased that the French Council Presidency has adopted a more balanced position on this point."
"My own position remains unchanged: recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia are comparable, under international law, with recognition of Kosovo."
"The Western countries recognised Kosovo and really opened Pandora's box."
"The West, NATO and the European Union are heavily implicated in the escalation of this conflict and the war in Georgia: the US redeployed Georgian troops from Iraq to Georgia and a number of Western countries - NATO countries, EU countries - have played a role in arming Georgia."
"Even Israel has armed Georgia, and the arrival of NATO warships in the Black Sea is not necessarily a sign of peace."
"We know that, in this war, geopolitical interests are also at stake;"
"I need only mention the oil pipelines in this context."
"The conflict should not be used as a pretext to drive forward the militarisation of the European Union."
"The EU has been successful as a non-military actor."
"If we now take sides, the EU will lose its credibility as a mediator."
"We are on the brink of a Cold War, and as for what lies ahead, well, it could go either way."
"Today is 1 September, a day which is celebrated as an Anti-War Day."
"We should be mindful of that: war is unacceptable and should never be supported, directly or indirectly, by countries in the European Union."
"(NL) Mr President, the display of naked Russian power on Georgian territory in this day and age is an attempt to legitimise two ethnic cleansing operations, in Abkhazia in the early 1990s and in South Ossetia last month, in August."
"It is also based on the mass issuing of Russian passports in these regions. What can and should the European Union do about this brutal resurgence of imperialist ideas in Kremlin policy?"
"We should offer a deeper and stronger European, even transatlantic, commitment towards our East European neighbours along the lines of the Swedish-Polish proposal for an eastern partnership."
"I am grateful to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner that she has spoken out clearly on this."
"In addition, the current situation in Georgia makes it imperative that the Member States really do press on seriously with a common foreign energy policy, with energy diversification."
"Naturally pipelines that are under the control of the sovereign states through which they run and which are not under threat are part of that."
"Mr President, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Europe has been impotent in the face of Russian aggression."
"Whereas condemnation has greeted Russia's effective annexation of parts of the sovereign state of Georgia, even the tone from within the EU has varied."
"The message of ambivalence will not be lost on Moscow. It is hardly shaking in its boots over the divided mutterings of Europe."
"Without a robust response to Russian aggression, I fear these matters will not end with Georgia."
"Is Ukraine next, one has to wonder?"
"And what will it take, with the EU now having made itself wittingly so dependent on Russian energy, to eventually permit an effective response?"
"If the last few weeks have demonstrated anything, they have been an object lesson in the unworkability of a common foreign policy in this EU."
"It has merely delivered the paralysis..."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"(ES) Mr President, the European Council met this morning to decide its position on three challenges, as explained to us by Mr Kouchner."
"These are: firstly, the disproportionate reaction, violation of international law, and invasion and ongoing occupation of a sovereign State; secondly, the disregard for a peace plan signed thanks to the diligence of the Presidency of the European Union, and, thirdly, recognition of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia which, by curiously invoking the precedent of Kosovo, has been rapidly recognised by Venezuela, Belarus and Hamas: 'A man is known by the company he keeps'."
"Today's response from the European Council to these challenges is very clear: we are at a crossroads in our relations with Russia."
"We have to be serious, Mr President, because we cannot continue in this way."
"The prestige and credibility of the European Union are at stake. The EU cannot simply sign the cheque for these great modern dramas."
"Despite the excellent work of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, we, as the European Union, are not just here to pay for the damage and destruction wrought by the Russians in Georgia or by the Israelis in Palestine. We must have a proper foreign policy."
"I would ask you, Mr Jouyet, to ensure that, on the 8th when the President of the Council of the European Union, Mr Sarkozy, visits Moscow, purely in the interests of ensuring consistency in the principles that we apply and value in the European Union, he gives a clear warning and a blunt and credible message that flouting international rules and law and violating the territorial integrity of a sovereign State will have a cost in terms of relations with the European Union."
"This is important as there must be consequences, Mr President, and, in this respect, there is a lot riding on this."
"(FR) Mr President, this summer there have been various attempts to force our hand with, in addition to this tragic drama, two immediate consequences: firstly, the almost immediate acceptance of the anti-missile defence shield by Poland - even aimed towards Iran this is a problem - and secondly, the commitment of the European Union to finance the reconstruction of Georgia, although we very well know that the foreign affairs budget will not allow this as it is dramatically underfinanced."
"You said this, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, and I support you: we must find other sources of financing, otherwise we may not be able to deal with this situation."
"I therefore believe that any escalation must be prevented. My Group and I are in favour of clear, albeit firm, relations with Russia, particularly in terms of energy issues, human rights and international law."
"I would also warn against the hurried entry into NATO or the European Union of countries which cannot yet offer the necessary guarantees."
"I invite the French Presidency, which I congratulate on its rapid action this summer, to consider the idea of the Union for the Black Sea, along the lines of the Union for the Mediterranean."
"Finally, I say to my counterparts in the East, particularly in the Baltic States, we are no longer in 1938 but in 2008. We will not allow history to falter."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FR) Mr Kouchner, ladies and gentlemen, in January this year, as rapporteur on the South Caucasus, I became aware of the danger of an unrestrained arms race and stressed the importance of a peaceful resolution to the conflicts inherited from the Soviet era."
"We suggested organising a three-plus-three conference, in other words the three countries of the Caucasus plus the European Union, Russia and the US."
"Since then, as recalled by Mrs Isler, we have proposed to grant the same visa rights to Georgians as to Abkhazians."
"We are now all well aware of what has happened - a military action and a disproportionate response - but the fact remains that two countries which had said that they wanted to abide by European values, by becoming members of the Council of Europe, have flouted these principles by using violence."
"This is unacceptable. This must be denounced and cannot be forgotten overnight."
"Europe, which has important relations with both countries, must play a careful and considered role to ensure that they return to a more reasonable policy."
"This is why it was important to speak with one voice and I am very happy that this was possible, even without the Lisbon Treaty ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"?"
"I must remind Members that the time allocated to them was determined by the political groups."
"You agreed to one-minute speeches, ladies and gentlemen, and that calls for exceptionally well-disciplined interventions."
"I therefore beg your understanding when I need to interrupt speakers."
"(IT) Mr President, the Ossetia and Abkhazia of today are yesterday's Kosovo."
"None of the many governments now calling for peace in Georgia can deny their own responsibilities: by recognising Kosovo, the US and most of the European countries set a precedent which was bound to destabilise the Caucasus region."
"Owing to the expansion of NATO right up to Russia's borders, the US is politically, even more than militarily, responsible for having encouraged Georgia to mount its surprise attack during the night of 7 to 8 August."
"Indeed, when attacking South Ossetia, Tbilisi thought it could count on protection from the United States, including military protection."
"It was an unjustifiable attack, which struck at civilians and shattered already highly fragile agreements."
"The Russian response had been prepared well in advance and was only awaiting an opportunity to unleash its full force."
"No governments are innocent in this affair!"
"The sole victims are the civilian populations, whatever their allegiance, forced to abandon their homes and subject to all kinds of violence."
"We are witnessing a war where the nationalist aspirations of local leaders are overlaid by a clash of great powers over control of energy resources: the real reason for the conflict is the gas and oil pipelines running westwards from central Asia."
"Indeed, both the route through Turkey to the Mediterranean and the one from Georgia across Ukraine into Poland run through the Caucasus."
"It is no accident that the US asked Poland in particular to accommodate its missiles pointing to the east."
"Europe must work towards a peaceful solution, calling both for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgian territory and for the people there to have the right of self-determination."
"The EU must first and foremost assist the refugees and refrain from any political action likely to worsen the situation even further."
"Georgia's entry into NATO must be flatly refused, the US fleet should be called upon to withdraw from the Black Sea, and Poland should be asked to reject the installation of the US missiles."
"We must be certain that our aid is not used to purchase weapons and that the refugees are not used as instruments of war by the conflicting parties."
"(FR) Mr President, many speakers, starting with the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Bernard Kouchner, deplore Russia's recognition of the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
"Certainly this decision has led to some serious consequences for the countries of the Caucasus and for Europe and could do so in the future for Russia itself."
"This is because recognising the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia could give ideas in the future to North Ossetia, Chechnya, Ingushetia, Dagestan and others which currently form part of the Russian Federation."
"Whether in the Caucasus, Tibet, Africa or elsewhere, one of the challenges of our times is to find a balance between the aspirations of certain peoples to autonomy, on the one hand, and the inviolability of borders, on the other hand."
"Without this inviolability, the peace to which true patriots aspire could be seriously threatened."
"However, we Europeans are also open to criticism."
"We have heard talk of respect for international borders, but we set a precedent in Kosovo, whether Mr Kouchner likes it or not."
"To say that there was an international decision on Kosovo is a joke because the UN never authorised war against Serbia."
"Russia has withdrawn from Eastern Europe, which not so long ago was ruled by the implacable Communist dictatorship. It has withdrawn from the Baltic states, from Ukraine and from the republics of Central Asia."
"The more it has withdrawn, the more it has become encircled."
"The Warsaw Pact has disappeared but we have not offered any response other than the ceaseless expansion of NATO."
"We are now reaping the rewards of this!"
"(FR) Mr President, I must first of all congratulate the French Presidency on this achievement."
"I believe that we have come a long way from Europe's position on Iraq to its current attitude towards the crisis in the Caucasus."
"Congratulations."
"Thanks to its Presidency, the Union has been more effective and quicker off the mark than Washington."
"All this is positive, but questions do remain: firstly, how can we minimise the suffering of the population; secondly, how can we ensure that the Russians respect the rules and what strategy do we adopt, in the longer term, with regard to Russia?"
"I greet the measures and the text by the Council with moderate optimism and satisfaction."
"It contains all the main elements of condemnation and action, including the more generous offer in terms of Community assistance and a potential ESDP mission."
"But I would say to the presidency that it is just an hors d'oeuvre."
"(FR) It is just an hors d'œuvre or an entrée."
"We are waiting for the main course which will be peace and stability in the region, and the European Union's long-term strategy in this region of the Caucasus."
"We need to deploy all efforts to make Russia understand that it has the choice: either to cooperate with the EU as a responsible partner assuming its obligations and commitments and fully respecting the six-point Sarkozy plan, or to expose itself to the condemnation of the international community, which may evolve into ostracism, and eventually into isolation encompassing a set of appropriate measures to be taken if the need arises."
"We, the Union, also have a choice - either to be satisfied with our verbal actions and avoid measures which Russia would understand, or to revise, if necessary, our policy towards Russia, making clear that we can be both assertive and respectful in the event of non-compliance by Russia with the rules which we expect..."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Kouchner, Russia's actions amount to an attempt to revert to the imperialist policy of the former Soviet Union."
"They are an attempt to impose Russia's own political vision on an independent state."
"How should Europe respond?"
"In my view, we should begin by addressing Russia with one voice and making it abundantly clear that there can be no question of reverting to the policy of spheres of influence."
"There can be no return to imperialist policy, no repetition of previous actions, and no reversion to the use of force in international relations."
"We must speak with one voice as we convey this message to Russia, and do so in a clear and unambiguous manner."
"We need to make it quite clear to Russia that aggression does not pay."
"Secondly, the Union must launch two types of long-term action."
"The first would involve drastically reducing its dependence on Russia for energy."
"I do not wish to be blackmailed by Russia over gas or oil, and I am sure the same is true of everyone else in this Chamber."
"We do not want our political activity and the defence of our principles and values to be dependent on the supply of gas or oil."
"The second type of action is strategic in nature and amounts to making an offer to states that were formerly part of the Soviet Union."
"Not only should Georgia be involved but also, and most especially, Ukraine, along with other countries."
"What we have on offer is definitely more attractive than what Russia is proposing."
"I am very pleased that these views have been enshrined in the conclusions of today's Council, and I think this is the right course of action for the future."
"(PL) Mr President, I am sure we all hoped and dreamt that Russia would begin to develop, become democratic and respect certain principles which are also the foundations on which the European Union is built."
"Those hopes and dreams must now be consigned to oblivion."
"The current situation is entirely different. I welcome the statement that talks on the partnership agreement and the EU-Russia Summit will be suspended until such time as Russia fulfils the commitments entered into by virtue of the documents signed."
"Furthermore, I believe the suspension should be for longer and that within the Union we should reflect on what kind of a relationship with Russia we actually want."
"Can we really go on referring to a common area of security shared with Russia?"
"Can we really consider Russia to be our strategic partner, when it espouses values so radically different from our own?"
"I should now like to mention another issue, namely our energy security."
"To give one example, we keep reiterating the importance of the Nabucco pipeline."
"It has become a mantra."
"Now is the time to go beyond mere words and provide financial support for that project."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council was quite right to send a very clear message to Moscow today, namely that we Europeans uphold the rights of peoples and will not sacrifice them to geopolitical pacts or accords."
"Moreover, we have a moral duty towards our own populations, especially those which endured many decades under the heel of Soviet imperialism, to defend these principles of freedom."
"However, those - such as Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi - who kept open a channel of dialogue with Moscow also did the right thing, so as to explain Europe's way of thinking and to warn of the risk of re-entering a climate of Cold War, not just from a political point of view, not just from an economic and political point of view, but also and above all from a historical point of view, in that as time passes there is the prospect that Europe can of course include Russia or can exclude it once and for all."
"It is therefore very important to open up and maintain a dialogue."
"Europe, the peoples of Europe, do not want a Cold War because Cold War reminds us of death, persecution ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution is the most positive achievement since the ceasefire agreement and contains most of the demands made by Elmar Brok and myself, on behalf of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, after our visit to Georgia."
"However, this is not enough."
"The European Union still has a role to play and our credibility is at stake."
"The resolution must be followed by resolute joint action, as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has made clear with her encouraging statement today."
"We must implement this resolution down to the last dot and comma, just as we are demanding Russia's full compliance, down to the last dot and comma, with the six-point plan."
"What is more, over recent weeks, we have seen how important the European Union is and can be, but we have also seen where our weaknesses lie and where we have to take action - including preventive action - to remedy them."
"Yes, we can be mediators, but if that is what we want, we must have a common European foreign policy, a pro-active foreign, security and defence policy."
"We have also felt acutely, over recent weeks, the lack of a common position - indeed, the lack of political will to achieve a common position - and, even now, the lack of a shared resolve."
"The absence of the Lisbon Treaty is weakening us."
"Reconstruction is not enough."
"We must invest in these countries' independence and cut the ground away from nationalism."
"Engagement by the EU is more important than the prospect of NATO membership."
"Commissioner, you have said, very eloquently, that there can be no more 'business as usual' towards Russia, and that our policy needs to be reappraised."
"We must invest in economic, democratic, social and educational stability."
"It is not just about money."
"We must also expand our Neighbourhood Policy and put forward practical projects such as those you have announced today."
"We look forward to that."
"Mr President, the main problem we are facing does not concern the answer to the question of who is right and who is wrong; who is the aggressor or who is the victim; what is a sovereign right and what is a disproportionate reaction."
"The real problem is that we have no real means to impose a status quo ante or to exert efficient pressure on a country like Russia to revise a certain policy."
"Moreover, we cannot ask Russia to observe any provision of international law which we have not already breached before."
"A world in which every crisis is dealt with on a sui generis basis is not a world of order, but of disorder."
"What we see around us today is not the beginning of a new Cold War, but the end of the unipolar order."
"It is a geopolitical confrontation at global level which takes place within an unregulated international environment where the unilateralists are clashing."
"When the unipolar order is dead and the multipolar order is not yet born, anarchy and the rule of might prevail."
"The only reasonable thing we must do is to convene an international conference for security and cooperation, where all the global and regional players, together with the local stakeholders, should negotiate and redefine and reinvent the principles of international law in international relations, the role and powers of international organisations, the procedure for dealing with local crises and the system of security guarantees which could meet the specific opportunities, challenges and dangers of our times."
"Meanwhile, we must accelerate the process of economic integration, political association and institutional approximation with our eastern neighbours such as Ukraine and Moldova."
"Let us hope that the European Union will be up to these expectations."
"(Applause)"
"(ET) We have already discussed here today the need to send international peacekeeping and civilian missions to Georgia."
"As a member of the South Caucasus delegation I support this wholeheartedly, all the more so given that in early spring, speaking in this very spot, I drew attention to the urgent need for these very measures."
"History has made many of our countries multi-ethnic, including Georgia."
"I am concerned about the potential for a very grim scenario."
"Specifically, a number of days ago, Russia recognised Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
"As though pursuing that theme, North Ossetia's Minister for Population talked about South and North Ossetia merging under Russian law, in other words of South Ossetia becoming part of Russia."
"In the view of a number of countries, there is a clash between two keystones of international law here: national self-determination and territorial integrity."
"We know that we must take the Helsinki Final Act as our starting point, but my question to the Council is: 'What steps are being taken to prevent the violation of the territorial integrity of a sovereign State?'"
"(PL) Mr President, the outcome of the European Council could be described either as a glass that is half empty or as one that is half full."
"The important thing is that agreement was reached and that the Union spoke with one voice."
"It is, however, disappointing that the Council joint position does not go far enough. It falls short of what most of those who expressed their opinion in this House would have liked."
"During the Russian offensive in Georgia, the Russian media reported how Mr Putin found time to travel to Siberia and sedate a tiger that was threatening local people."
"This incident is a good illustration of Russia's behaviour and of the treatment it metes out to Europe."
"Moscow has not been entirely responsible for sedating the European tiger, however."
"In this context, how should the North Stream and South Stream projects be assessed, together with the support they have received from certain Member States of the Union?"
"Lack of solidarity and subservience to an aggressor always encourages the latter. This is particularly true when certain partners pay for the benefits enjoyed by others."
"The current pronouncements about the Union's unity with regard to Russia, the emphasis placed on the Eastern partnership and the other statements made are certainly encouraging. If we content ourselves with words alone, however, the aggressor may strike again."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to pick up on a few practical points from this evening's debate."
"First of all I would pay tribute to the French Minister for having been bold enough to make some highly important assertions in this House."
"I fully endorse everything the French Minister said. I agree with absolutely everything."
"I shall not repeat any of his words because tomorrow's press will already be full enough of what he has stated here, but I must say that the position outlined by the Presidency of the European Union is a very strong and very precise one."
"What I wanted to say is that I believe the European Union has made a step-change: we can say whatever we like in this auditorium but we are not the makers of EU foreign policy and do not have powers to intervene in it; only the European Council can do that."
"The European Council - as far as I can judge from my brief experience in this House - has demonstrated what Europe is making: a step-change."
"Today's European Council has shown that the European Union really does exist, that even though the Lisbon Treaty is not yet in force, the EU is capable of addressing itself to extremely important issues."
"I should also like to express great appreciation for what has been done by the French Presidency, by President Sarkozy, as well as by Chancellor Merkel and Prime Minister Berlusconi, in this crisis."
"I believe that the united response passes over the comments made by the British Prime Minister, who may have duly fallen into line today, but whose earlier statements to the press were far from welcome."
"I believe, and I am concluding, that the step-change is this: the European Union exists!"
"Let us proceed cautiously with accessions to NATO and the EU."
"Let us see how things stand."
"The French Minister is quite right."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to acknowledge the speed and effectiveness of the French Presidency in brokering a truce between the parties to the conflict."
"The six-point plan must now be brought to life, including, of course, the withdrawal of Russian troops to their positions prior to the outbreak of the conflict."
"The Georgia issue , however, is not an isolated issue as there is a whole series of interlinked conflicts and problems throughout the Southern Caucasus."
"It is therefore essential for the European Union to apply itself far more effectively and intensively than previously to the entire region of the Eastern Mediterranean and Transcaucasus."
"In other words, it is essential to strengthen the eastern dimension of our policies towards our neighbours through real measures."
"Since I am a Member from a country which has not yet ratified the Lisbon Treaty, I should like to invite the Governments of the Czech Republic, Sweden and, of course, Ireland too to work hard on the ratification of this document, because it is the prerequisite for more unified and more effective common foreign and security policies enabling us to deal with the challenges, including the challenges coming from the East and from Russia, and to solve these problems."
"(PL) Today is the anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War."
"That war was immediately preceded by a secret pact between the Soviet Union and Germany, and by the policy of appeasement adopted by the countries of Western Europe."
"In 1939 it was naïvely believed that sacrificing selected smaller states would satisfy the aggressor."
"I am recalling all this due to the war in Georgia. Georgia has become the first target for attack in the course of contemporary Russia's pursuit of the imperialist tendencies that it inherited from the Soviet Union."
"Russia is using Georgia as a testing ground, to establish how much Member States of the Union are prepared to put up with."
"It does not expect them to stand firm. In view of the armed conflict, the European Parliament must not confirm Russia's expectations."
"We must adopt a common, unambiguous and determined stance."
"Georgia is entitled to count on our diplomatic and material support."
"The European Parliament should send its own observers to Georgia, to verify information concerning ethnic cleansing."
"We must do all we can to stop expansion and prevent our tragic history from repeating itself."
"Mr President, we are witnessing the collapse of the 'end of history' paradigm, but this should also mark the end of the era of wishful thinking, replacing peace through speech with peace through strength and solidarity."
"Russia has placed itself in the category of unstable, unpredictable states."
"It can no longer be seen as a reliable partner, and clearly does not share our common values."
"By invading Georgia it has challenged the fundamentals of the international security system, trying to replace it with the model of 'might is right'."
"Everything now depends on EU actions - not just reactions."
"No 'business as usual' entails taking concrete steps, because Russia will only understand if we act."
"I propose the following measures: firstly, a genuine international peacekeeping force - Russia cannot play the dual role of peacekeeper and invader; secondly, freezing the PCA negotiations; thirdly, putting on hold the Nord Stream and South Stream projects; fourthly, freezing visa facilitation; and, fifthly, cancelling the Sochi Olympic Games."
"If nothing concrete is done, Russia will not only never release Georgia from its hold, but will also follow the same pattern elsewhere."
"The first priority of the democratic community is to set firm limits."
"Today, we have to answer the same moral challenge."
"If not us, then who?"
"If not now, then when?"
"(Applause)"
"(ET) In spring during the Georgian elections I met, in the town of Gori, a Georgian woman who had been forced to flee Abkhazia 15 years previously."
"Today she has become a refugee in her own country for the second time."
"What a tragedy."
"It is also tragic that here today, in this Chamber, we have so many different interpretations of what has happened, and for that reason I think it especially important, above all else, to send an independent research commission, an international commission, to Georgia to establish what really happened."
"This conflict is not between Georgians or Ossetians, this conflict did not begin on 8 August, it is not only Russia and Georgia's conflict, it is a conflict of values and it involves us all."
"(FR) Mr President, I believe it is important to congratulate the French Presidency, President Sarkozy and Mr Kouchner who is here today, not only because they have adopted, in this crisis, a very firm attitude towards Russia, but also because they have managed to maintain the unity of the European Union, a unity which unfortunately did not exist in 2003."
"I would join with those who say that this issue, grave though it is, is not only about Georgia and the illegal occupation and invasion of that country."
"I would say to the Commissioner that it is also about the EU's relations with Russia."
"It goes to the heart of what used to be described as the common values we share."
"I personally find it very difficult to see what common values I share with a country that uses force, military aggression and a propaganda war to accuse the occupied country of being the invader and aggressor."
"It appears that the Cooperation and Partnership Agreement is likely to be on hold for some time unless Russia withdraws its troops."
"The question then arises of what we will do if Russia were to refuse to withdraw its troops."
"We are told we must have dialogue, but what kind of dialogue can you have with a partner who does not respect the values you are trying to defend and support?"
"It seems to me that, from a historical perspective, we want harmonious relations with Russia, but not at the price simply of surrendering the values we hold dear."
"I agree with Mr Kelam and others that there are already consequences for Russia, with massive disinvestment on its markets, because international investors now regard Russia as a very uncertain place in which to invest."
"However, Nord Stream and South Stream also have to be re-examined."
"We cannot simply go ahead with these as if a Russian monopoly on energy supply was perfectly normal."
"The Winter Olympics in Sochi also have to re-examined; there cannot be an Olympic truce."
"The Russians will recognise the consequences of our taking resolute action and not simply being driven by their agenda."
"(Applause)"
"(ES) I should like to say two things very quickly."
"Firstly, I think I am right in saying that Mr Jouyet previously regretted in the press the influence of US conservative sectors, or certain conservative sectors, in the 'No' vote in the Irish referendum."
"I believe we all now regret the extravagant praise of neo-con policies in the Caucasus crisis."
"In this respect, many can be held responsible."
"Tbilisi is responsible for the incomprehensible decision to take military action."
"Moscow is responsible for deciding on a brutal and disproportionate response."
"Washington, with a happily retiring President, is responsible for having fuelled years of tension in the region."
"Secondly, I believe that Europe has a fundamental responsibility which can only be met by building, not soft power or hard power, but political power which depends on the unity of all the Member State governments."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"For many years, Russian power politics have primed the tension in Georgia, which has degenerated into a brief but destructive war."
"The Russian military forces have violated international law and invaded the territory of a sovereign state."
"The Kremlin has crowned this process by recognising the independence of the two breakaway provinces."
"This has given a new dimension to the international political stage."
"It is a dangerous situation, partly from the perspective of the states that border Russia and partly because Putin and his men have created a dangerous precedent for themselves."
"Why is it important for the international community to unite?"
"Russian politics have now come to a standstill and have gone down a dead end, so we must make the most of this moment."
"The EU must press for the sending of neutral, international peacekeepers, thus relieving the peacekeeping forces that have now lost their credibility and authority."
"Our decision to facilitate visas for Russians should be reviewed, and at the same time the visa requirement in respect of Georgia should finally be eased."
"Georgia is an integral part of our neighbourhood policy and so we have an obligation to ensure the maximum support necessary for rebuilding the country. Thank you very much."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Saakashvili adventure is the result of an unpardonable error of judgement: namely, to think that Russia would not respond to military aggression, because military aggression is what took place."
"Russia is no longer what it was in 2000, and will no longer withdraw either tactically or strategically."
"The first thing to do is face the facts: Europe and its unity have been seriously damaged by this error."
"We cannot allow ourselves to repeat it, and we cannot allow anyone else to force us to repeat it."
"Some people believe that the entry of Ukraine and Georgia into NATO should now be accelerated, but I would ask anyone who believes that to think hard, since such a decision would do nothing to enhance our safety; on the contrary, it would be jeopardised."
"As we now know, Russia will react, if not in equal measure, then certainly with counter-measures."
"We would soon run the risk of having a crisis much bigger than that of August on our hands, and in a country like Ukraine at the heart of Europe."
"Wisdom dictates that we redo a number of calculations, since they were wrong, and that we sit down at the negotiating table with Russia on a basis of reciprocity and ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, the day before yesterday I had a long dinner conversation with one of the wisest heads of Europe, Otto von Habsburg."
"He said that, based on his broad knowledge of the facts, European governments have been enormously corrupted, as it is well known that Russia is using a new secret weapon against the West - namely global bribery."
"Today's Council meeting might shed more light on that dark corner of European politics."
"If the Council and our Parliament, the last fortress of political conscience in Europe, do not demand immediate withdrawal of Russian occupation forces from Poti and the buffer zones established by the occupier, then political disaster would appear to be looming for our fading Europe."
"Those zones are most needed by Russian and Ossetian smugglers in order to prevent Georgia having any control at the internal borders between the puppet Ossetia and the still independent Georgia."
"The idea of giving the occupier until the EU-Russia summit in November to build fortifications is totally wrong, and points to the fact that Otto von Habsburg is probably right."
"(Applause)"
"(FR) Mr President, our discerning and determined position is eagerly awaited."
"The United States, due to the wishes of the Russians but also due to the current election period, cannot act as the catalyst of a global political situation in this area neighbouring the Union."
"We, the European Union, have a unique historical opportunity to build our foreign and security policy and develop Europe through its achievements and experience."
"We must not waste this opportunity."
"The necessary condemnations do not offer solutions."
"Even if Pandora's box was opened with Kosovo, with a recognition defying the rules of international law, let us return international law and respect for human rights to the heart of the solution."
"Let us be firm and act politically. Let us adopt a clear, common and firm position towards Russia, but one which is aimed at finding a solution and a partnership, because we should be clear-headed in our approach to Russia in 2008."
"Let us propose, under the aegis of the European Union, a regional conference on the resolution of the situation and on the future of the partnerships."
"It is with this determination for a single voice of the European Union that we will minimise the destructive venom of nationalism which always, inexorably, leads to war."
"(PL) Mr President, today the Council reached agreement concerning Russia."
"This may be deemed success of a sort, though many were disappointed that Russia was treated so gently."
"We must now await Moscow's reaction."
"No doubt the Russian press will quote those parts of our debate in which the Council's representative and certain MEPs blamed Georgia."
"In public, Moscow will express strong criticism of the Council's stance, yet in private it will be delighted."
"I would say to those in power in Moscow: do not rejoice prematurely."
"Europe no longer considers you a reliable partner that keeps its word and respects international law."
"Europe is seriously considering whether it can be dependent on Russian oil and gas."
"Europe has not dealt with you too severely today, but the ranks of your supporters have been significantly depleted."
"(HU) We are completely agreed that we should condemn Russia for awarding citizenship, and we should condemn it for the excessive military role that it has assumed, and for recognising Abkhazia and Ossetia; at the same time, we should also condemn Georgia because the Georgian leadership should have known what its own geo-strategic room for manoeuvre was."
"At the same time, we agree that there should be peacekeeping forces, but we are not talking about what the basis would be for a lasting solution, and this would only be extensive autonomy for the Abkhazians and South Ossetians under the Ahtisaari plan."
"We are not talking about the minorities that are affected, but we are talking about everything else, so I believe that it is not only the conflict that has frozen but also, in many respects, our thinking."
"We should find a long-term solution for this problem."
"(NL) Mr President, most of the attention has been focused on the Russian military intervention in Georgia."
"The possible use of cluster bombs and the occupation of a port outside the disputed area are just cause for anger."
"That does not apply, in my opinion, to the protection of South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, these two regions have not in practice been part of Georgia."
"Most inhabitants of these two small states do not want to be subject to Georgia under any circumstances, just as most of the inhabitants of Kosovo do not want to belong to Serbia under any circumstances."
"They would, unfortunately, be second-class citizens in those countries."
"For these people equal rights and democracy are only possible if their secession ceases to be a matter of debate and they have a guarantee that they will not be subject to military attack from outside."
"To sum up, there is very good reason to criticise Russia, but not on account of the fact that it has now recognised the de facto independence of these two small states."
"Kosovo could not be a unique case ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SK) The events in Georgia paradoxically took place in the month of August, just like in the former Czechoslovakia 40 years ago, when my country too was invaded and occupied for many a long year by the Soviet Army."
"Fellow Members, we must not forget that Russia has shown by its actions that it has not put its past behind it."
"Just as in 1968, it has not hesitated to send in tanks to achieve its political goals."
"Once again military force is destabilising countries which are trying to free themselves from Russian influence."
"Today it is Georgia, tomorrow it could be Ukraine."
"I am convinced that the EU must be even more resolute in its opposition to Russia's stance with regard to recognition of the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
"I am convinced that the EU's response must be to intensify cooperation with Georgia and especially with Ukraine, not only with words but also by clear and meaningful actions."
"Mr President, Georgia is not a simple episode in international politics."
"It is the beginning of a chain reaction with important consequences."
"First, it indicates Russia's military comeback, which will have to be reflected in the new European security strategy under preparation."
"Second, this apparent reconquista indicates Russia's desire to use its newly acquired energies in making good its losses from the 1990s and pay back for the accompanying humiliation, rather than willingness to contribute to the shaping of the future world."
"Third, it highlights the weak position of Europe due to increasing energy dependence on Russia and the delay in ratification of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Fourth, it can either restore or further damage transatlantic unity."
"Fifth, it demonstrates that international legality needs to be strengthened both in concept and in respect."
"Sixth, it makes clear that the Black Sea area needs much more attention and involvement from the EU and therefore that it requires more than a simply synergy."
"Mr President, I support democratic Georgia's right to seek security in the west and I disapprove of Russia's disproportionate aggression and continued occupation of the country."
"The EU must increase its aid to Georgia for reconstruction, fast-track an EU free trade agreement and press ahead with visa facilitation."
"Georgia should also be allowed to go on the path for NATO, eventually for full membership."
"We must use this opportunity now, through the EU's common external energy security policy, to break Moscow's stranglehold on Europe's oil and gas supplies."
"Germany and Italy are both building pipelines in joint ventures with Gazprom."
"To balance this, the EU should also support the White Stream pipeline project which will transport gas from the Caspian Sea to Europe through Georgia and Ukraine - both governments supporting this project - thereby circumventing Russia."
"Targeting Gazprom's monopoly and Russia's use of the gas weapon as our long-term response will hit Russia hard."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief because Bernard Kouchner has already spoken twice and I know that you too have a lot of work to do."
"As this debate comes to a close, I should firstly like to thank you for your constant involvement in this matter."
"The resolutions adopted, the fact that Chairman Saryusz-Wolski convened the Committee on Foreign Affairs on 20 August and the fact that Mrs Isler Béguin - as she pointed out - went to the conflict region and gave a powerful testimony on behalf of this institution and, beyond that, on behalf of the European Union have confirmed the European Parliament's involvement in this crisis."
"This leads me to say that I have been surprised to hear certain comments about the European Union: firstly, that it has not reacted; secondly, that it was powerless, and thirdly, that it adopted a position of weakness."
"If the European Union was not influential, if it did not play a role in this crisis, then I should like to know who did?"
"Who was powerful?"
"Who proved themselves either militarily or in any other way?"
"I saw no power other than the European Union taking action and it was during this crisis that the European Union was possibly seen in a new light as a partner and as a power."
"Everyone has their own responsibilities."
"The European Union has its responsibilities which are not the same as those of NATO or the US. However, through its values and its means - to which I will return - the European Union has fulfilled all its responsibilities."
"People say to us: 'Russia does not have the same values as the European Union' but, between us, that is old news."
"It is not a scoop."
"We know that Russia does not have the same values as the European Union."
"If it had the same values as the EU, other questions would be asked about Russia."
"All the questions asked about Russia concern what type of relations we want to have with this neighbour, what type of partnership we want to build, what type of dialogue we want to have, how we can encourage Russia to fulfil its duties and assume its responsibilities and how can we steer it towards an approach more in line with international law."
"These are the questions."
"As for myself, I have never believed that we have the same values, whatever respect I may have for Russia, and I have known Russia for some time."
"The third thought you have had, and you have all had this thought, is that we cannot go very far, despite a rapid reaction and despite what has been done today, because we do not have the instruments needed, because we will only have these instruments if the Lisbon Treaty is ratified and because this crisis has perfectly demonstrated how much we need this Treaty, how much we need to strengthen our foreign policy and how much we need, also, to strengthen our defence policy."
"We must be very clear on this and several of you have rightly underlined this."
"I now come to the European Council."
"Today's European Council forms a starting point."
"It did not cover everything and it cannot cover everything in relation to the management of this crisis by the European Union and the relations between the European Union and Russia."
"Today was about reviewing the situation on the ground and assessing the consequences for relations between the European Union and Russia."
"It was about showing that we are united and that we are active in this conflict."
"This European Council has enabled us to show that we are united, that we have acted and that we have firm positions. I would remind you of these: condemnation of Russia's disproportionate reaction; support for Georgia in the financial, humanitarian, economic and political spheres; confirmation of the strengthening of the relationship between the European Union and Georgia; implementation of the six-point conflict resolution plan including - and several of you have stressed this point - the existence of an international monitoring mechanism; commitment of the European Union on the ground by sending a Special Representative; strengthening of the eastern partnership, particularly with regard to the Black Sea area and Ukraine, which was explicitly underlined in today's conclusions, and an energy policy which is more diverse and independent and better organised at European level."
"I have understood everything you have said this evening."
"You can be sure that the French Presidency will remind everyone of its wish to have a much more diverse, independent and better structured European energy policy."
"You can count on the Presidency in this respect."
"This is a starting point because it has been decided that an important journey should be made by the President of the Council of the European Union, the President of the Commission and the High Representative, on 8 September, to Moscow and Tbilisi. It is in that context that we must assess the subsequent actions that we will need to take."
"Finally, we have agreed on the fact that all meetings on the partnership agreement should be postponed until the Russians withdraw to their previous positions."
"This is therefore a starting point."
"Our aim today was not to solve everything but to show our unity and our determination and for this we need the support of the European Parliament."
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, I am the final speaker, so I will try to be as brief as possible."
"As I am the last speaker, however, I should like to highlight a few key points from this debate."
"Firstly, I am sure I do not need to remind you that it was on this day, 1 September, in 1939 that the Second World War began."
"Today, on that anniversary, we are debating a new war which has broken out, but this new war was one which we - the European Union - have been able to stop very quickly."
"In my view, that is a very important point."
"That is why this has been a lengthy and wide-ranging debate, but it has also been a good debate."
"We had a good debate in the European Council too, with sound conclusions."
"In my view, the European Union's credibility has played a key role here: credibility and unity."
"As the President-in-Office of the Council and I have both said, this was a major test for the credibility and, indeed, the unity of the European Union, but it is a test which we have passed with flying colours."
"Assistance for Georgia is important, as we have heard."
"We have said that there is a need for humanitarian aid and reconstruction assistance, where we will be looking to Parliament for support."
"I should like to thank you, as of now, for your support and will of course be coming back to you with more precise figures."
"Above all, however, I am thinking about the visa agreement."
"We are aware, of course, that there is discrimination taking place here: Abkhazians and South Ossetians, many of whom have Russian passports, are in a more favourable position than Georgians, but I would also point out that many of the individual Member States have a role to play here, and let me emphasise that the same applies to a free trade agreement."
"I would remind you that we had already identified three issues in relation to the strengthening of the European Neighbourhood Policy, but these did not really strike a chord with the Member States at the time."
"Mobility was one, the second was the issue of economic partnerships, and the third was enhanced security, which means, of course, that all conflicts, actions and consequences have to be discussed in the case of Russia too."
"We are at a fork in the road - a crossroads - but the future will mainly be determined by Russia, for it will be Russia which will be called to account here, just as we have said today: there will be no more negotiations on the new agreement without a withdrawal of troops."
"Russia has it in its power to comply with what we have said today."
"I very much hope that a good solution will be found on 8 September."
"Beyond this, there are two main consequences: the Neighbourhood Policy Plus, or whatever we call it in future, must be strengthened at regional and bilateral level; this means going beyond Georgia and involving Ukraine, Moldova and, indeed, other countries as well."
"This is something we have often talked about, but I am hoping that now, I can perhaps count on more support from the individual Member States."
"Finally, let me say a word about energy policy."
"This is another issue which has been of particular concern for me over the last 18 months, and I can assure you that it will continue to be a very important issue for me personally in future too."
"That brings me to the end of my quick resumé of what has been a lengthy but extremely important debate."
"(Applause)"
"? The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"As a Rapporteur for the Black Sea region, I have always insistently emphasized the major challenge that unsolved conflicts represent for the regional stability, as well as the need for a EU firm and deep involvement in the above-mentioned region."
"Russia's actions in Georgia are regrettable, dangerous in the context of regional and European stability and, implicitly, unacceptable by the international community."
"Therefore, it is imperative and urgent for the EU to pass from promises to action, and to demonstrate firmness both in its actions in Georgia and in re-examining its relations with Russia."
"For ensuring stability in the Black Sea region, three key principles should guide the EU action."
"First of all, all decisions should be based upon compliance with Georgia's territorial integrity and the international law."
"Secondly, this formula for managing the conflicts in the region should be re-examined in order to accelerate and increase the possibilities for their final settlement."
"This supposes the EU's active involvement in peacekeeping operations in Georgia, as well as in the process of managing and solving the other conflicts in the region, i.e. the Transnistrian conflict."
"The EU efforts to ensure its energy security should also be increased to the maximum, including by the development of the Nabucco project."
"in writing. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Jouyet, Mrs Benita Ferrero-Waldner, I must firstly thank my fellow Members who have congratulated the French Presidency of the European Union and welcomed the actions of Nicolas Sarkozy in this difficult conflict between Russia and Georgia."
"It could take for ever to determine the borders of the former Eastern Roman Empire with, to the west, the Balkans and Kosovo and, to the north, the Caucasus, South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"What must guide the European approach is respect for people. I suggest that, given how serious the situation in Georgia has become, an extraordinary meeting of the Committees on Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament and of the national parliaments of the Member States should be envisaged because it is we parliamentarians who represent the people."
"It is finally becoming clear that the 'Black Sea Synergy' introduced at the end of 2007 by the European Commission is not sufficient."
"It is now urgent for the Union to propose a truly ambitious neighbourhood policy with the countries bordering the Black Sea, starting with an economic free-trade area."
"in writing. - (RO) The EU is not entitled to allow the Georgian scenario to repeat in other conflict regions as well."
"The events in Georgia represent a serious test for the EU capacity of response and involvement in the frozen conflicts regions of the former Soviet area."
"It is necessary that the EU examines the possibility of sending to Georgia a European Union civilian observer mission to monitor compliance with the cease-fire agreement."
"Russia's disproportionate counterstroke in South Ossetia had a negative impact on the civilian population, as well as on the infrastructure, and was a serious infringement of the international rules."
"This obviously indicates the need to strengthen security through the presence of a multinational and impartial peacekeeping force."
"The EU should also seriously consider a more consistent process of cooperation with the Republic of Moldova and the possibility to provide, under certain conditions as regards Chisinau's guaranteeing certain democratic standards, a much clearer European perspective for this country."
"In order to strengthen good relations and avoid any conflict situations, regional cooperation between the countries bordering the Black Sea should turn into a multidimensional cooperation to be institutionalized, for instance by establishing the Union of countries bordering the Black Sea."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, in recent weeks we have witnessed an attack by Russia on a sovereign and independent state."
"We have seen how land hundreds of kilometres away from the theatre of war has been occupied, and how the promises made to the West have been torn up."
"I am convinced that Georgia's European aspirations were half of the reason for Russia's attack. The other half was the desire to control the routes through Georgia used to transport raw materials for energy."
"It is our political and moral duty to support the people of Georgia and to make Russia understand that the time when it could act at will in its self-proclaimed sphere of influence has gone forever."
"The latest events have made it abundantly clear that Russia cannot be a reliable energy partner."
"Russia's control of oil and gas has made us hostages to the Kremlin."
"As a result, the main challenge now facing us is to free ourselves from dependence on Russian raw materials."
"How to achieve this is currently a controversial issue."
"If, however, we continue investing in ventures such as North Stream and South Stream, we shall be providing the Russian authorities with new and powerful ways of exerting pressure on the European Union."
"The Russians will have no reservations whatsoever in using these to their advantage when the time is right."
"in writing. - (FR) I must firstly thank Mrs Lambert for the quality of her work."
"The report on which we must decide tomorrow has the dual merit of taking a very clearheaded look at the imperfections and problems of the Dublin system and of formulating proposals to improve the efficiency of procedures and the situation of asylum seekers."
"I should like to stress a number of points that, in my opinion, are fundamental: the need to reinforce the rights of asylum seekers and guarantee these in the same way across the whole EU territory; the fact that detaining asylum seekers should always be a decision of last resort and duly justified; the need to ensure better distribution of asylum applications as the current system places a disproportionate burden on those Member States situated at the external borders of the EU; the need to take measures against Member States not guaranteeing an in-depth and fair examination of these applications, and finally, the importance of family reunification and a broader definition of the 'family member' concept, to include all close relatives."
"in writing. - (RO) The great gain of today's extraordinary meeting of the European Council is the unity of Member States."
"We must not enter the situation of a Cold War again."
"The Russian Federation should receive a unitary message from the EU: It must comply with the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries, withdraw its troops from the frozen conflict regions by complying with the international conventions and treaties it signed and must not establish its foreign policy on the capacity of energy supplier."
"This unity of Member States should also be seen in the Union's future actions: - a common energy policy based on the creation of new transportation routes to use different sources than the present ones, the development of a set of Black Sea policies to increase the geostrategic and security importance of the region, as well as the active involvement and promotion of new mechanisms for solving the frozen conflicts in the region."
"In this context, the review of the Neighbourhood Policy is absolutely necessary."
"Countries such as Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia or Azerbaijan should be included in a coherent and accelerated mechanism that, in the case of meeting the necessary requirements, could lead to their future membership in the EU."
"in writing. - (HU) Georgia - the illusion of freedom?"
"We all know that the Georgian-Russian war is not about Georgia."
"My fellow Members know, and the Heads of State or Government meeting in Brussels today know, that they are debating the possible sanctions."
"In the midst of our work for ever closer integration of the European Union, the Georgian-Russian conflict has come like a bolt from the blue to remind us that force makes decisions even in the 21st century."
"Over the next seven years, Russia may spend 190 billion dollars on arms and on developing its army."
"It will not be afraid of deploying its army, updated using the dollars from oil and gas - August 2008 was proof of this, at least."
"As a Hungarian who was once forced to be a citizen of the Russian empire, it is especially difficult for me to draw this conclusion."
"Russian menace lives, and has already penetrated our everyday consciousness, not only through energy prices but also in the image of columns of tanks filing into Georgia."
"At the same time, I trust that it is clear to my fellow Members and to those taking part in the European summit that it is not the peace of Georgia, Ukraine or Western Europe that is at stake in our current conflict with Russia."
"We can lay down the framework and emphases for future dialogue with a common, resolute Union response - or we will have excessively cocksure Russian foreign policy as our bedfellow."
"Those Member States of the Union that suffered from Soviet oppression twenty years ago know what this danger means, whatever ideological form it may be dressed up in."
"The leaders of the new Member States therefore have a moral responsibility to protect their voters from the increasing external threat."
"in writing. - Mr President, the Russian aggression against Georgia has provoked the world public to question the decision of the International Olympic Committee to grant Sochi, Russia, the right of hosting the Winter Olympics in 2014."
"Sochi is located on the coast of the Black Sea just 20 miles from the border of the Russian Federation and Abkhazia, and therefore in close proximity to a zone of conflict."
"But there is another aspect that concerns me as well."
"Just as in Beijing, people's homes are getting in the way of the construction of Olympic facilities."
"For example the construction in progress is wiping out a whole village called Eesti-Aiake or ""Estonian Garden"" in English, which was founded 120 years ago by 36 Estonian families, who migrated to the Caucasus region in Imperial Russia and who were granted lands there."
"The Russian authorities are constructing stands, intended to be used for only 14 days during the Olympics, on the location of the oldest part of the village."
"The compensation that will be paid to the families is said to be lower than the market price of the land."
"Such outrageous actions violate the natural right to property and therefore should be condemned."
"in writing. - The Georgian President, Mikheil Saakashvili, whom the opposition accuses of vote-rigging on a massive scale and widespread corruption, came to office by stirring up extreme Georgian nationalism and promising to force South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which are kindly disposed towards Russia, to become Georgian."
"The United States of America has been Georgia's best ally, but Israel has not been too bad for Georgia either."
"The United States sent 130-170 military trainers to the country, Israel over 100."
"Iike Tomer, a code name, was a soldier in an elite unit in the Israeli army enlisted as a trainer by Defensive Shield, a company that sells military services run by General Gal Hirsch, the anti-hero in the war Israel lost against Lebanon."
"He had this to say: 'By Israeli standards, the soldiers had almost zero capability and the officers were mediocre."
"An offensive that was illogical and unwise led to the total defeat of Saakashvili's army of clowns."
"The soldiers abandoned their heavy weaponry, leaving it in the hands of the Russian troops, and fled in a chaotic frenzy to Tbilisi."
"Daring exploits of this kind do not deserve the support of the European Parliament."
"It has the support of America's neoconservative Georgia Lobby, which is headed by Randy Scheunemann, presidential candidate John McCain's adviser on foreign policy."
"He has been on both McCain's and Saakashvili's payroll at the same time, and during the last 18 months has received USD 290 000 in fees from Georgia."
"I agree, however, that the Russians reacted too strongly."
"in writing. - (HU) According to some people, the crisis in the Caucasus started with President Bush's speech in Riga in 2005, when he announced that a new Yalta Agreement was needed."
"He could just as well have said a new Treaty of Trianon, since the misery of many small peoples and countries did not start with the Second World War but with the Trianon Peace Treaty that ended the First World War."
"The recommendation of the then American President, Wilson, concerning the self-determination of peoples has only remained a dream."
"Today, in connection with the crisis in the Caucasus, people are talking about the interests of great powers, about oil and about war, but they are saying very little about the right of self-determination of the peoples living there."
"The most important task for the EU in such conflict situations could be to set an example."
"Of the Member States of the EU, 11 ensure autonomy for minorities in some form or other."
"This is 41% of the Member States of the EU."
"The objective is an exemplary policy on national minorities for every Member State of the EU: not in 41%, but in 100%!"
"A European Union with an exemplary policy on national minorities could even take more effective action in the Caucasus too."
"in writing. - (CS) From the very start of the discussions about recognising Kosovan independence, we have been warning that such a step would start a spiral of events, the negative consequences of which can only be imagined with outcomes which are hard to predict."
"Even on the floor of the Czech Parliament, the CPBM has expressed its disagreement with the Czech Republic's recognition of Kosovo."
"Those who have been playing with fire should not now be surprised that fingers have been burnt in another part of the globe, especially when their partner was such a problematic person as President Mikhail Saakashvili."
"The solution to the current situation is the observance of international law, which is especially important for such a small state as the Czech Republic with its historic experience."
"Evoking any kind of phobia through certain policies is in this situation simply wrong and dangerous."
"The reaction of some NATO states and the change in relations with Russia needs to be contrasted, for example, with Russia's part in the fight against international terrorism and also, for example, with the fact that 70% of the supplies needed for the expeditionary force in Afghanistan are transported across Russian Federation territory."
"NATO headquarters is clearly aware of this fact."
"The situation will not be resolved by strong language and gestures, but by rational negotiations around the table."
"in writing. - (HU) Forty years have passed since the Warsaw Pact troops crushed Czechoslovakia and overthrew the government that had set itself the task of making the Communist dictatorship democratic."
"Unfortunately, Socialist Hungary also assumed a shameful role in the operation, together with the other Soviet satellite states, thus serving the raw, imperialist despotism of Moscow."
"We ask the Slovak and Czech peoples to forgive us for this."
"For us Hungarians this is especially painful, since twelve years before that, in 1956, Soviet troops similarly drowned the Hungarian revolution in blood."
"By crushing the Prague Spring, Moscow signalled that it could do whatever it wanted in its sphere of influence, which it had stolen from Europe at the end of the Second World War, and that there were no borders to the imperialist shamelessness and hypocrisy of Soviet Russia."
"There is only one possible tool against this - the firm, resolute defence of citizens' human rights and of the principles of democracy and national sovereignty, and action against aggression."
"This is needed so that democratic Europe still has a clear message today!"
"in writing. - (PL) I believe great caution should be exercised when assessing the conflict between Russia and Georgia."
"There can be no doubt that Russia violated the principles of international law when it crossed into Georgian territory."
"I strongly condemn such a disproportionate reaction on Russia's part."
"It should be borne in mind, however, that the Georgian side is also to blame, because it initiated the military action."
"Recourse to such action can never be the solution to a dispute."
"The European Union has been called upon to perform the very important role of mediator in this situation."
"I believe the Union was right to condemn Russia's recognition of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"Georgia's sovereignty and its territorial integrity must be respected."
"In my view, given the present situation, it is essential for the European Union to send a peacekeeping and monitoring mission to South Ossetia."
"The current situation demonstrates the need for ever-closer cooperation with the countries of the Black Sea area."
"I voted in favour of adopting the joint motion for a resolution on the situation in Georgia."
"in writing. - (RO) I believe it is very important that, at this delicate moment, Europe shows it is united and supports a unitary position regarding the conflict in Georgia."
"Nevertheless, we need to continue to provide assistance and help the reconstruction of the affected regions in Georgia, support confidence-building measures, as well as the development of regional cooperation."
"At the same time, it is necessary that Europe accelerates the development of the European energy projects (such as Nabucco şi P8)."
"Even if most of the attention is turned to Georgia, taking into consideration the geographical situation of Azerbaijan, I believe we should also have in view the need to establish an EU - Azerbaijan partnership for supporting and continuing the EU's energy projects."
"I would like to emphasize that the settlement of frozen conflicts in the Black Sea region can only be achieved within the limits and based upon the international law, in compliance with the territorial integrity of countries and their sovereignty over the entire territory, as well as in compliance with the principle of border inviolability."
"I support the Council's position, according to which the European Union is ready to commit, including through a presence on the ground, to support all efforts to ensure a peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict in Georgia."
"I believe that only through dialogue and negotiation could we achieve the desired results."
"Evaluation of the Dublin system (continuation of debate)"
"Let us resume the debate on the report by Mrs Lambert on the evaluation of the Dublin System."
"(SV) Mr President, this is a huge change of topic but, if we do not resolve the crisis in Georgia, we will need an even better asylum and refugee policy in Europe."
"I would like to start by thanking Mrs Lambert for a very thorough report."
"I also support the amendments tabled by Mrs Roure and Mrs Lefrançois."
"The Dublin system and the choice of first-country-of-entry for people entering the EU really need to be evaluated, especially regarding the problems this involves for the countries which receive refugees."
"Here I am thinking of the Mediterranean countries, but also of Sweden, which is the European country which has accepted the largest number of refugees from Iraq."
"The EU should take greater joint responsibility, otherwise the Dublin Regulation is meaningless."
"A year ago the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs went on a fact-finding visit to the Mediterranean."
"The situation was appalling!"
"It was not improved by Sweden starting to send refugees and asylum seekers back to Greece, which had been heavily overburdened for some time."
"Subsequently, the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats in the European Parliament adopted a directive on the return of illegal immigrants which contained inhumane rules, such as deportation after a wait of up to 18 months, which is particularly tough for children."
"A common European asylum and refugee policy is necessary, but I feel that it is heading in the wrong direction and I am concerned about this."
"I am worried that we are not accepting and are not prepared to pay more attention to children."
"However, there is one thing to which we have paid attention and that is Commissioner Barrot's talk today of a temporary suspension."
"As a Swede, I would like to take the opportunity to highlight the municipality of Södertälje, south of Stockholm."
"Södertälje has taken in more refugees from Iraq than the whole of the US and Canada put together!"
"In my view Södertälje must be included in the kind of trial the Commissioner referred to. Thank you."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, this debate is clearly very important and was interrupted, but that happens."
"In any event, I too am convinced that equipping Europe with a truly harmonised right of asylum will be an excellent response to the problems that were mentioned during the previous debate."
"I should briefly like to pick up on certain comments."
"It is true that the current system is not 'fair' in that asylum seekers, depending on the Member State to which they apply, do not always receive the same response."
"You are right, Madam, to underline how certain countries have been much more open and generous than others."
"We therefore need this harmonisation."
"We also need to consider a number of issues that are of concern, such as the problem of unaccompanied minors."
"We must also examine the problem of the detention of asylum seekers and, quite clearly, we must do this within the framework of a review of these texts, not necessarily to move away from the Dublin system but to perfect this European response to asylum seekers."
"We must remain faithful to Europe's tradition of a democratic and humanist welcome. That is why, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have found this debate extremely useful."
"It definitely gives us food for thought and I will of course return before Parliament to present the texts that we are now going to prepare in light of the excellent observations that have filled this debate."
"I must therefore warmly thank Parliament and you, Mr President, and I hope that, by the end of the year, I can return with draft texts that will enable us to significantly improve the situation with regard to the right of asylum in Europe."
"I should like to apologise to the Commissioner once again for the interruption of the debate. Unfortunately, the priorities were established in such a way that we were obliged to depart from normal procedure and interrupt this particular debate."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I too would like to thank the Commissioner very much for what he has just said, and for his assurances."
"I think it is clear, from what has been said tonight from all parts of the House, that there is need for not just an efficient but a high-quality system which is one based on joint responsibility: as my colleague Ms Segelström has said, there must be joint responsibility or the system is meaningless."
"I think that the Council too needs to hear that message very, very clearly, because they, the Council, are the governments that are responsible for fulfilling their obligations."
"It is true that some Member States, such as Sweden, are very good at fulfilling their obligations."
"Others are not."
"This means that the actions that the Commission can take to support them in that - for example, the use of the UNHCR, and the idea of the Asylum Support Office - become very important, providing they are adequately resourced."
"That, too, is something which I think all of us involved in the budget system need to think about."
"However, on behalf of my colleague Mr Busuttil I would say that some of us still remain to be convinced that the pressures on certain Member States are temporary rather than systemic, and therefore that the responses we make perhaps need to be more systemic - unless, of course, we foresee a rapid change in the world situation which would then have an effect on refugee flows."
"So again I would like to thank the Commissioner and my colleagues for their warm words."
"We will see what we can do to pass the message to Council, and we very much look forward to the proposals coming from the Commission later in the year."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday."
"Common frame of reference for European contract law (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the common frame of reference for European contract law - B6-0456/2008)."
"draftsman. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentleman, the Draft Common Frame of Reference (DCFR) has brought the work on European civil law to a head, at least for the moment."
"It is, of course, a draft produced by legal scholars which has yet to be debated politically."
"The goal of this debate, then, is to try and get a broad policy discussion going on the future of European private law."
"The European Parliament wants to achieve a situation in which all stakeholders are involved in this debate but, in order for that to happen, we have to make sure that the academic draft, which is currently only available in English, is produced in other official languages as well."
"Commissioner, the funds earmarked for translation have not been used up for 2008 yet."
"We need these translations if there is to be a proper Europe-wide dialogue on the future of European civil law."
"It is not enough just to get the forthcoming Commission document translated, although obviously that has to be done."
"The Commission has started a selection process internally, trying to sift through the rules of the academic frame of reference and picking up what needs to be included in the Commission text."
"We welcome the fact that all the relevant Directorates-General are involved in this selection process."
"However, I would stress that the 'European contract law' project should really be led by DG Justice and Home Affairs because the reference framework is not just about consumer contract law; it is also intended to make it easier for SMEs to shape their cross-border contracts with other business partners who are not consumers."
"Precisely because the Common Frame of Reference (CFR) needs to take account of the SME sector as well, over recent months the Commission has been holding workshops on selected problem areas in the business-to-business (B2B) arena, and the outcomes of these workshops need to be taken into account in the forthcoming Commission text as well."
"In the resolution, we also say that the final version of the academic frame of reference could play a toolbox role; indeed, it has already done so, in effect, simply by virtue of its publication."
"The Community legislator will have to make sure that, in future, legal acts in the field of Community private law are based on the CFR."
"The CFR can, at a subsequent stage, be turned into an optional instrument; the parties would then be able to choose an alternative system of civil law to govern their legal relationships."
"That is a step that will need to be taken in order to solve problems that are quite clearly still with us in the sphere of the internal market."
"In order to give a boost to legal transactions in the internal market, an optional instrument will, however, have to go beyond general contractual law."
"For example, besides rules governing the conclusion of sales contracts, there will have to be rules on transfer of property and on the rescinding of asset transfers which have no sound legal basis: in other words, the law of obligations."
"Parliament is particularly keen to ensure that it is consulted and involved on an ongoing basis by the Commission throughout the selection process."
"We will undoubtedly have to consider how, in future, the significance of this project can be enhanced, especially in the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"The Commission needs to start considering now, though, what sort of mechanisms we need in order to ensure that the new Commission document can take account of future developments."
"In the current selection process, the Commission must already start to consider, in its planning, the changes that will feature in the definitive version of the academic frame of reference."
"All this shows that this CFR is taking us into new territory in European contract law."
"The European Parliament, the Commission and the Council need to make a clear commitment to this project, which is likely to be the most important initiative for the next parliamentary term."
"It is a project which offers benefits for everyone: consumers, because they will soon be able to go shopping all round Europe with the backing of European contract law, and companies, because with this greater legal certainty, they will be able to tap into new markets, and as there will be a uniform set of rules, they will be able to achieve substantial cost savings."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission as a whole welcomes wholeheartedly the interest that Parliament is taking in the Common Framework of Reference, or, as I will refer to it in short, the CFR."
"The CFR is a long-term project to improve the quality and coherence of EU legislation."
"Let me answer your questions in this connection."
"First of all, I would like to say that the Commission indeed intends to ensure that the Commission CFR will be translated so that it can be discussed and applied in order to improve the quality of EU contract law legislation and to make it more coherent."
"However, this reasoning does not apply to the academic preliminary draft."
"The Commission CFR will most probably be considerably shorter than the academic draft."
"Given the huge work which will already be necessary to translate the CFR, it does not make sense to spend valuable translation resources to translate parts of an academic draft which are not relevant for the purposes of the CFR."
"The Commission is currently proceeding to select those parts of the academic CFR which are relevant for the final Commission CFR, on the basis of its policy objectives."
"All the DGs concerned are involved in this selection process according to their field of competence, of course including DG JHA."
"The final selection will be presented for consultation to the other institutions, including Parliament and stakeholders."
"The Commission will indeed ensure that the outcome of the workshops which were organised in 2007 will be taken into account in the CFR."
"The Commission has always conceived the CFR as a tool for better law-making."
"The CFR should contain a set of definitions, general principles and model rules in the field of contract law."
"The Commission has not yet decided which topics of contract law the CFR should cover."
"In adopting the decision on CFR, the Commission will take into account the position of Parliament and the Council."
"As I have already mentioned, the Commission will in all likelihood shorten the present academic draft and it will probably be necessary to amend the remaining text in order to make it useful for policy-making purposes."
"Even if it is premature to say so, it is likely that the CFR should form a non-binding legislative tool."
"The Commission understands fully that Parliament wants to be kept informed of, and involved in, the ongoing work on the CFR."
"We welcome Parliament's involvement in the CFR process and we very much rely on this involvement."
"The Commission will continue to keep Parliament informed of developments in the most appropriate way, in particular through the Parliament working group dedicated to the CFR, and will consult Parliament and all stakeholders on the results of its preliminary selection process."
"Once the Commission CFR is completed, the Commission will decide on the need for keeping it up to date and on the best possible mechanism to do this."
"I would like to conclude by thanking you for Parliament's support for the Commission work on this important dossier."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, our colleague Mr Meyer has correctly indicated the challenges of this issue. I should like to say to the Commissioner that I do understand your technical answer on the translations, but what Mr Meyer said on this subject absolutely embodies the real issue: how do you go from university work to a political decision and a legal decision?"
"I believe it is absolutely vital that everyone understands this because this draft Common Frame of Reference (CFR) that was presented to you at the end of last year must be considered in relation to all the work done on this issue, and not just the draft presented to you."
"For example, it is clear that a choice must be made between the law of obligations and the law of contract."
"There are several schools of thought on this but this is the choice that we must make and, to do so, there must of course be several proposals on the table."
"Likewise, will the content of the CFR be restricted and therefore binding or will it be general and therefore much more indicative?"
"As a result of all this, we need a range of information and it is of course essential that Parliament can do its work, and that it can do this at a very early stage."
"That is why - and I will conclude on this very practical point - it is very important that many Members participate in the hearing that the Commission will organise with experts at the beginning of October and in the conference that the French Presidency of the European Union will hold in Paris on 23 and 24 October."
"This subject merits open and transparent debate that goes beyond the experts and involves those responsible for the political decisions."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I agree with Mr Toubon's observations, namely that the work of the academic group on the Common Frame of Reference is clearly very valuable and serious work."
"However, how do we get from this academic work to political proposals?"
"Perhaps the answer is, based on the use of a single language and, possibly, only one theoretical direction."
"While recognising the internal work that has been done, Commissioner, I believe that we must move on to the next phase in which Parliament and the sectors concerned are involved, not just large companies, but also small companies, trade unions and other types of economic operator."
"The PSE Group has tabled an amendment to increase the participation in this project at an early stage, for which we of course would need a translation of the text, albeit a summary of the text."
"This text could subsequently form the basis of an optional element but, to do this, we first need to define what the content is."
"To sum up, this debate must serve to inform European citizens that the Commission is working on a project. However, the Commission, given that it is only one of the European institutions, cannot keep this project to itself."
"The time has come for the Commission to share this knowledge with the European Parliament and with the general public."
"I repeat: trade unions, large companies, small companies, other economic operators and people in general."
"Regulation of the contractual framework affects all European citizens and the drafting of a possible code of substantive law would require the greatest possible number of sectors to be involved which, without a translation into all the languages of the European Union, would seem impossible."
"This would also be impossible without increased participation by other sectors."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the Commissioner has answered some of the questions put by my colleagues."
"However, this project is of great importance to all our institutions, and we are now coming to the politics of it, and the major issues concerning the democratic legitimacy of the creation of a CFR."
"There has been a lot of consultation, with many working groups and many stakeholder groups, from which we can learn a lot, but now it is time for decision-making, and we need a process that is open, inclusive and coherent."
"The Commission is rightly conducting a selection process before presenting a white paper."
"However, that process needs to be as inclusive as possible, and we are obviously worried about the languages used, since if this were mainstream legislation it would be available in all the languages."
"Can Parliament have an assurance that at white paper stage it will still be possible to change the selection if it considers that appropriate?"
"This is at the heart of the conundrum we face."
"Will the white paper kick off a legislative process, or something analogous to it, or are we going to deal with a separate legislative process each and every time in the future that we look at anything to do with contract law?"
"It comes down to the question of whether it will be binding or non-binding."
"The Council seems to think it should be non-binding and voluntary."
"If that is the case, it is arguable whether we need a selection process at all."
"You can keep everything open and have the political debate at every moment in the future that a contract law question arises in a legislative proposal."
"On the other hand, if we are creating something binding now - which Parliament is well known to prefer, in the form of an optional instrument - then we have to have some very serious inclusive political debates now about content and coverage, leading us on to the next set of questions about a legal base and the involvement of Parliament as something more than a mere consultee."
"(NL) Mr President, I endorse what the previous speakers have said and I should like to highlight two points in particular."
"One is how we guarantee that there really is an inclusive and democratic process of consultation, in which not only this Parliament, but also national parliaments play a role and in which all stakeholders can be consulted."
"I am especially concerned about whether this consultation will be balanced and whether, for instance, consumer organisations, small and medium-sized enterprises, trade unions and others will be able to bring in the expertise and pay for it, so that they can also play a real role in this consultation process."
"The Commission has a responsibility in this respect and so I should like to ask the Commission how they intend to support this."
"I should like to ask Parliament to support an amendment that we are submitting on this point."
"The other point concerns the breadth of the selection."
"I ask myself whether we should really be ruling out certain things now in paragraph 12."
"It makes more sense to keep these things open at this stage."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have followed this debate with great interest, but have had the impression at times that the various joint meetings between the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection never actually took place."
"Yes, Mrs van den Burg, we have noted - also among our colleagues in the committees - that it is extremely difficult, at the various events, to find the interest and expertise that are required for this important legal policy initiative in Europe."
"In my view, doing so is not only a task for the Commission, it is also the job of parliamentarians to ensure that the relevant associations, trade unions, employees and SMEs are involved in this debate as early as possible."
"However, I also take the view - and I fully endorse what Hans-Peter Mayer has said on this point, and Jacques Toubon also touched upon this - that this early involvement of the various stakeholders can, of course, only be successful if the legal bases are available in all the languages."
"I am not surprised by the Commissioner's answer and her withdrawal to the position that the available academic documents are no more than a technical basis for the development of the White Paper position."
"Nonetheless, in this difficult process, I would say to the Commissioner that, in my view, it is indeed necessary to translate these bases of her White Paper recommendations as well, as this is the only way to ensure a meaningful debate."
"I believe that the motion therefore points in the right direction and I would ask the Commissioner to take appropriate supportive action here."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, all the honourable Members' remarks have been very well presented and very wise."
"I would like to stress that the decision to translate only parts of the academic text is a political one."
"That is because the areas which are not useful for the purposes of the CFR will not be translated."
"I am sorry to repeat myself, but it is very important to stress that the CFR will be a toolbox by nature, and Parliament will be fully involved in the decision on which parts of the text are to be translated."
"I would also like to inform you of the meetings tabled by the French presidency, which has scheduled two meetings of the Civil Law Committee for 5 September and 3 November, in order to discuss selection of the chapters of the draft academic CFR for the future Commission CFR."
"As you can see, nothing is set in stone."
"Both Parliament and the Commission can fully participate and do the job together."
"The outcome of these discussions should be adopted as JHA Council conclusions in December 2008."
"That gives us sufficient certainty that the process is truly inclusive of all the interested parties."
"With reference to Mrs van den Burg's remark, I would like to assure you that the consultation process will be broad and inclusive."
"I have received feedback from the academics, who have announced that they will translate their draft, which means that there will definitely be French, German and English versions."
"This guarantees, besides the efforts of the Commission, that the project will certainly be available in those three languages."
"The Commission has a clear interest in working together with Parliament, which has been so supportive of this project, and with the Council, to ensure proper scope, with translated versions of the already-completed academic part of the project."
"I have received one motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday."
"Certain issues relating to motor insurance (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Mladenov, on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on certain issues relating to motor insurance."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, Madam Commissioner, colleagues, and interpreters who are staying this late on such an interesting day as today with the European Council discussing Georgia, I hope you will have a little time and energy to focus on another report which is, despite its technicality, quite important for all of us."
"It goes back to an issue raised in this House when the fourth Motor Insurance Directive was adopted."
"Back then, this House decided to ask the Commission to undertake a more in-depth study of a number of questions that were raised by Parliament but were not addressed in the fourth Motor Insurance Directive itself."
"Namely these three sets of questions: the first being to look into whether the national penalty provisions are effectively implemented across the European Union; then to look at how the claims representative system set up under the directive functions and whether there is a need to harmonise across the European Union; and finally to look at perhaps the most important and controversial issue that is intimately connected to questions raised by consumers which is whether the current availability of voluntary legal expenses schemes for motor insurance in Europe should be converted into a compulsory scheme to cover cross-border accidents across the European Union."
"Let me start with the last question because that is perhaps the most important question and clearly one of the questions which is of most interest to European consumers."
"I myself when I went looking into this report was very much tempted to argue for harmonisation and to argue for compulsory legal expenses insurance across the European Union."
"But detailed study suggested that that might not be in the interests of the consumers or in the interests of the European insurance industry."
"It would, if that were adopted, raise the costs of motor insurance for consumers in many Member States."
"It would create incentives for higher and unjustified claims to be made."
"It would create many delays in addressing existing claims and it would create a very strong disincentive for people to go for out-of-court settlements."
"Finally, it would create a very strong and unfortunate burden on the judicial systems of our Member States, something which I do not believe any one of us really wants to do."
"So perhaps the other approach which this report suggests is the better approach and that is to increase awareness of existing voluntary schemes across the European Union."
"Now, in many of the old Member States, they exist and function quite well and are now developing in the new Member States."
"In the new Member States in particular they need to be promoted more, perhaps through including them in pre-contractual information on taking out such options across the European Union with a particular focus on new Member States."
"As far as the question of claims representatives is concerned, the European Commission did undertake a study. We looked at that study very carefully."
"We consulted with industry and we consulted with consumer organisations across the European Union, and national information centres have been set up in all Member States."
"Through these national information centres, consumers can pursue their claims and can find the information that they need."
"Now what we do need to do there is to make consumers actually more aware of the existing system rather than try to set up a new system on top of it."
"Finally, on the question of national penalty provisions and whether to harmonise them or not, the report argues that we should uphold the principle of subsidiarity."
"That means that existing national penalty provisions in European Member States have to be upheld. There is no need to harmonise."
"There is, however, a need for the European Commission to monitor the situation in more detail across the European Union and make sure that, when national authorities do need help, they receive that help from the European Commission."
"This is the gist of the report that we are debating tonight."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, on behalf of my colleague Commissioner Charlie McCreevy, let me first of all congratulate the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee and the Legal Affairs Committee, and in particular Mr Mladenov and Mr Gargani, for their work in producing a thorough and consistent report on a number of specific motor insurance issues."
"Mr Mladenov, I cannot agree more with you that this is also a consumer issue."
"The Commission welcomes your support for the conclusions we draw in our Motor Insurance report of 2007."
"Allow me to address briefly some issues covered in this report."
"Let me start with national penalties introduced in respect of the reasoned offer procedure."
"The Commission welcomes the clear position you have taken in the report on this issue."
"Indeed, your report seems to confirm our stance on the matter, namely that national penalty provisions, although not equivalent, produce the desired effect and therefore no harmonisation at EU level is needed in this respect."
"The Commission will stay vigilant and take steps, if necessary, against those Member States which do not fully comply with the Directive's provisions in question."
"Therefore we can only welcome your call upon the Commission to further closely monitor the functioning of the mechanism introduced by the EU motor insurance Directives."
"The motor insurance expert group, set up by my services a year ago, brings Member States' representatives and stakeholders together and has proven to be a very useful tool to this end."
"In line with your suggestion, the Commission will involve consumer organisations representing traffic accident victims in the process of assessing the effectiveness of the systems existing in the Member States."
"Let me now turn to a second point: the legal expenses, which are very important for the consumers and for insurers as well."
"Your report considers several pros and cons of a system where legal expenses would be compulsorily covered, EU-wide, by the motor insurance policy of the liable party."
"As stated in the Commission report of 2007, we are convinced that such a solution would be very unlikely to provide clear benefits for road traffic accident victims; it might even lead to a distortion of well-established national systems of motor claims settlement."
"In addition, premiums are likely to increase in those countries where either no or limited reimbursement of legal costs has been the practice so far."
"I am pleased to see that your report reflects some of these concerns and that it gives preference to market-led solutions, such as the use of voluntary legal expenses insurance."
"It seems to be evident, though, that in some markets this type of insurance cover is hardly used, and that better promotion is needed."
"This is a mission the market should accomplish itself, as the Commission should not promote particular insurance products or particular lines of insurance business."
"Finally, let me address the issue of the awareness of tools and mechanisms under the EU motor insurance directives."
"The Commission agrees that there is room for improvement, especially in relation to the new Member States, as regards the degree of citizens' awareness of the tools created by the EU motor insurance directives, such as the claims representative mechanism or the existence of national information centres."
"The insurance industry can and should play a major role in this area."
"The Commission has contributed to the information need of both traffic accident victims and motorists through the publication of a number of motor insurance leaflets placed on the 'Your Europe' portal."
"Many other information sources exist at national level, such as automobile clubs, motor insurance bureaux, claims settlement agencies and others."
"In conclusion: Over the last years, regular reporting to the European Parliament on motor insurance issues has become a well-established practice and I am looking forward to our continued good cooperation."
"representing the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Gargani, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his report and the good cooperation."
"There are three points in particular which I should like to mention: firstly, consumers' interests; secondly, the principle of subsidiarity, and thirdly, relevance."
"We believe it is far more in line with consumers' interests not to convert voluntary legal expenses schemes for motor insurance in Europe into a compulsory scheme."
"We do not need mandatory product bundling or product integration which would simply push up the price of insurance and restrict consumer choice."
"On the issue of subsidiarity, I welcome the fact that the rapporteur is not attempting to drive forward harmonisation at all costs."
"The countries in which some legal costs are already covered by motor insurance can continue with this type of scheme without other countries being forced to follow suit."
"As to the issue of relevance, I would remind the House that we are dealing with an issue which, in numerical terms, is of only very limited relevance."
"Cross-border accidents account for only around 1% of road traffic accidents in Europe, and almost all of them are settled out of court."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on the report."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking my colleague Nickolay Mladenov for his truly excellent work on this very difficult issue."
"His own-initiative report covers all the key problems and does so quite outstandingly."
"Nonetheless, I would point out that this report is just one little piece of the puzzle in people's everyday dealings with the EU."
"Mr Karas has rightly pointed out that cross-border accidents account for a very small percentage of road traffic accidents and that most of them are settled out of court."
"However, a major German weekly newspaper published an article last week which described how an ordinary citizen wished to re-register a German car in Italy, only to fail eight months later, having realised that it is simply not possible."
"Citizens dealing with this type of problem on an individual basis feel extremely unhappy about it."
"That is why the report, with its incentive for voluntary schemes, is the right approach."
"However, the Member States have a role to play in determining whether harmonisation of compensation law in the European Union might not, in the long term, be a far better solution which is more in line with citizens' interests."
"Here in Parliament and especially in the Committee on Legal Affairs, we have dealt with the issue of non-contractual damages - in the case of Rome II, for example - on various occasions and it is now up to the Member States to look at which alternative solutions they can identify, if harmonisation of compensation law and the adoption of legal costs as damages is not possible for this House due to the issue of competence."
"This is an issue which we will need to resolve in future."
"That being the case, Mr Mladenov's proposal is outstanding and deserves our support."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, motor insurance has been a success story of this Parliament and the long line of directives still actually represents some unfinished business - business which sadly involves an increasing number of our citizens as they exercise their rights of free movement across the Union."
"Mr Mladenov's report makes a very important contribution to the ongoing work."
"It is clear that claims need to be simplified as much as possible and the three-month period has to be respected."
"Accident trauma must not be increased by legal trauma."
"We know that there are complicated issues of conflict of law that this Parliament wanted to solve in our approach to the Rome II Regulation."
"We have now been assisted by the Court of Justice in its Oldenburg judgment, where the Court has read together the fourth Directive and the Brussels Regulation in the way we intended, allowing a victim to take direct legal action in their country of residence rather than going to the defendant's court."
"This will put pressure on the need for out-of-court settlements."
"It is an important development."
"It may in the short term create some difficulties but, Commissioner, you need to ensure that Member States respect this judgment and this interpretation of EU law."
"The next step is to devise a system arising from the Rome II follow-up studies that ensures that victims are compensated fully in relation to their home country circumstances."
"The story is ongoing but the achievements, likewise, are very far from being inconsiderable."
"Mr President, first of all I want to join in thanking Nickolay Mladenov for a very important and serious piece of work."
"His first major report for the Committee on the Internal Market will, I hope, be the first of many."
"It has been very helpful that he has come in and looked at this issue with fresh eyes, representing citizens who are enjoying new entitlements through their membership of the European Union and who perhaps expect some of these issues to be dealt with better than in the past."
"I want to build on some of the points that a number of my colleagues have made, particularly Diana Wallis and Andrew Schwab."
"Diana and I have been involved in this area since we came to Parliament in 1999, and therefore understand its importance."
"I think it is fair to say that if Parliament had not consistently raised these issues with the Commission and said that the motor insurance regime, and particularly its cross-border aspects for mobile motorists, was deeply unsatisfactory, then I do not think that we would be where we are now, anywhere close to the fourth Motor Insurance Directive, and maybe looking for a fifth."
"This shows how Parliament really can reflect the interests of citizens in what are complex cross-border issues, but ones that do not come into play unless people run into serious problems."
"People have brought their problems to us, when they have had accidents in other countries and are unable to claim compensation for what are, in many cases, severe or even lifelong injuries."
"I was pleased that the Commissioner, in line with her very strong commitment to consumers and the energy she has brought to this portfolio, wanted to seize this issue."
"However, I would particularly highlight what Nikolay Mladenov says in his report about the need to step up the level of cooperation between the insurance industry, Member States and the Commission, in order to get better deals under existing legislation."
"We are acting as a ginger group to put salt and pepper into the system, and I feel we are entitled to a bit more support from the European insurance industry."
"(SK) Like my fellow Members who have contributed to today's debate, I too consider Nickolay Mladenov's report to be correctly timed and very important with regard to consumer protection."
"In the context of the increased volume of foreign automobile travel, especially following the enlargement of the EU and the extension of Schengen, many European citizens are becoming accident victims abroad and, through ignorance, often experience serious problems."
"Before travelling abroad by car, citizens must be provided with basic information on how to handle claims."
"It is important to contact the appropriate information centres which, pursuant to the Fourth Motor Insurance Directive, are to be established in every Member State."
"The pre-contractual information package should include comprehensive information to consumers on how the claims representative system works and on legal expenses insurance."
"Member States have established different systems and national regulatory bodies are better placed to guarantee the highest possible level of consumer protection in their national markets."
"For this reason, I agree with the rapporteur that it is not necessary to harmonise national penalty provisions at Community level."
"(SK) I consider the creation of a network of claims representatives to be a benefit of the 2000 Motor Insurance Directive."
"Their efforts will speed up the settlement of motoring claims."
"As regards penalties for delays in addressing claims, I agree with the rapporteur's view."
"On the basis of subsidiarity, national regulatory bodies are better placed to guarantee the highest possible level of consumer protection in their national markets."
"According to the available data, more than 90% of all claims are settled out of court so, in this respect, there is no need for the Commission's initiative to introduce compulsory legal expenses insurance across the European Union."
"It would raise the costs of compulsory motor insurance and burden the courts with additional disputes, which could be settled out of court."
"The voluntary nature of legal expenses insurance needs to be retained and, in the new Member States, citizens must be provided with more information on insurance products."
"Mr President, as a legal practitioner who has dealt with cross-border claims, it is not all rosy in the garden as might be suggested in the report."
"While I welcome the report, some of the kind of problems that I have come across are problems where there is legal cost insurance and where the claimants are finding it difficult to recover costs on the basis of it."
"These claimants have gone through court procedures and expended monies in order to validate their claims and then find that, on the one hand, the insurer of the offending party which caused the accident is not paying the full costs of putting the case together, and on the other hand, their own insurance company, with whom they had insurance for covering legal costs, is also not paying up and is walking away from its responsibilities."
"This is an area that we need to look at and be very careful about. I had one case, for instance, where we had to pay EUR 30 000 for a forensic accountant's report and where we were not allowed to recover the full cost of that report."
"Although the person had their own insurance, they were not able to add their own insurance policy for costs and were not able to recover under that policy either."
"That is a matter that we need to look at and make sure that it is properly monitored."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me thank you once more for the very useful piece of work which Mr Mladenov presented with the help of his colleagues."
"It is very useful for the Commission as well."
"The Commission is preparing a study dealing with compensation levels awarded to cross-border victims and this issue was raised by Mrs Wallis and some other colleagues."
"We are aiming in this study at obtaining an objective, well-founded and evidence-based analysis of the issue."
"The study is under way and the Commission is examining the second interim report."
"Mr Harbour also mentioned that we need to be very concrete in our work and cooperate firmly on this issue to make the internal market more complete both for businesses and for consumers."
"It is very important for this cooperation to be straightened up."
"I am really more than glad to see that Mr Mladenov's report is doing this through the good set-up of the pieces of his work and also has such nice and meaningful support from his colleagues."
"Once more, congratulations and thank you."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and my colleagues for their very interesting and insightful comments on this report."
"I am a firm believer that the best-protected consumer is the consumer who is best informed on their rights and can defend those rights based on the information provided."
"We as legislators need to make sure that consumers receive information and are free to make the choice of whether to take certain protection against a certain risk or not, rather than to impose a uniform level on all of them."
"Mrs Wallis, Andreas Schwab and Mr Burke raised extremely important points that go beyond the very limited scope of this report."
"I am very happy that Commissioner Kuneva has said that the Commission will pursue a further study of many of the questions raised in this House."
"I am convinced that Parliament will look very carefully at the study that the Commission produces, precisely to go back and look at the questions that Mr Burke has raised, which are absolutely valid and an increasing matter of discussion in many Member States, including my own."
"Mr Schwab raised the question of a uniform approach to damages, which is a very valid question for all of us."
"I hope that the Commission's study will address that issue."
"Let me also say a couple of things about the follow-up to this report."
"I hope that the Commission will take very seriously its responsibility to monitor national authorities' implementation of existing penalty provisions."
"Indeed, when we were gathering information in order to put this report together, a small number of Member States were not very forthcoming in providing information on how the system functions in their societies, but we did manage to receive an adequate reply in the end."
"Looking carefully at how the system functions and at how it can be improved in the future is an important task that I am sure the Commission will take very seriously in the months and years to come."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday."
"Coordinated strategy to improve the fight against fiscal fraud (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Bowles, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on a coordinated strategy to improve the fight against fiscal fraud."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, may I first take this opportunity to thank colleagues for their input, especially on one or two topics where we still have differences of opinion."
"I think we have more in common than divides us and that we can reach a satisfactory outcome by not straying too far from the core subject."
"The broad principles underlying this report on fiscal fraud are simple, and only fraudsters themselves would disagree."
"The tax losses due to fraud are difficult to assess."
"Fraudsters and tax evaders take care to hide their activity from the tax authorities, but estimates put the level of fraud at EUR 200-250 billion or 2-2.5% of the total GDP of the EU."
"My question is, do we put 2-2.5% of our collective effort into resolving it?"
"Since the answer to that question is clearly no, there can only be one conclusion."
"It needs more effort, more attention and in particular it needs more collective cooperative attention by Member States."
"Now VAT fraud, particularly the missing trade or carousel fraud, may be the largest single cause of tax loss."
"It comes about simply because of the loophole in the arrangements for VAT under which it is not levied on cross-border intra-Community trade."
"So VAT-free purchases can be sold on, the VAT pocketed and then the trader vanishes."
"In complex carousels innocent traders can get enmeshed, and measures within Member States to combat fraud, such as freezing rebates, can damage innocent businesses."
"This is a well-known problem in my own country, the United Kingdom."
"So that is all the more reason to tackle the problem at its root."
"Pragmatically VAT will have to remain a consumption tax based on accruing to the fiscal authority of final destination."
"The report proposes that VAT should be levied on intra-Community supplies at the minimum rate, 15%, with the importing Member State then levying its own domestic rate for subsequent stages."
"The 15% collected by the originating Member State then needs to be handed over to the Member State of final consumption by some method of clearing or settlement."
"This now is technically feasible; all the more so as we move inevitably to real-time recording of transactions."
"And it does not have to be centralised; it can be done in a decentralised or bilateral manner."
"Regarding other ways of combating fraud and tax evasion, the exchange of information and cooperation are central to this and, dare I say it, a 'cash now' attitude of 'What am I getting out of it?' in some quarters does not lead to progress and is a short-sighted view."
"Payback comes another time when you are on the requesting end."
"Tax authorities need to know about assets in order to help track down hidden income which may be undeclared or originate itself from criminal activity."
"This is undermined if exchange of information between authorities is restricted."
"Here we also need to act in the international dimension to be most effective."
"Finally this brings me to revision of the Savings Tax Directive."
"It is proper to revisit that Directive, for example to close loopholes such as using alternative legal entities like foundations to escape its provisions."
"Withholding tax is not ideal, but here we are divided on whether it can be done without undesirable consequences."
"These are the issues that we address in this report."
"I commend it to you and I look forward to the forthcoming debate with interest."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the European Parliament and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mrs Bowles, for its very constructive report on a coordinated strategy to improve the fight against fiscal fraud."
"In May 2006, the Commission presented a communication aimed at launching a broad debate on the different elements to be taken into account in an anti-fraud strategy in the Community."
"I am pleased that the European Parliament recognises and supports the initiatives taken and the approach chosen by the Commission in its communication."
"Equally, I am pleased to see that the European Parliament invites the Commission to submit further proposals."
"The report is a very useful and comprehensive contribution to the ongoing discussion about the fight against fiscal fraud."
"The Commission fully agrees that fraud is not a problem that can be combated successfully at national level alone."
"The Commission will take account of the numerous comments and suggestions made by the European Parliament in the context of its work on the current and forthcoming legislative proposals for conventional measures to combat tax fraud."
"As far as actions foreseen in 2008 are concerned, I can confirm that the Commission is planning to present three sets of legislative proposals - one in October, the second in November and the third in December 2008."
"Those sets of measures include improved procedures for registration and de-registration of persons liable for VAT in order to ensure the swift detection and de-registration of fake taxable persons and to give more security to honest business."
"The legislative proposals will also cover traders' joint and several liability, the creation of a European network (EUROFISC) aimed at improving cooperation in order to detect fraudsters at an early stage, fixing conditions for VAT exemption at importation, mutual assistance in recovery, automated access to data, confirmation of the name and address of taxpayers in the VAT Information Exchange System database and shared responsibility for the protection of all Member States' revenues."
"By October, the Commission will present a communication setting out the coherence of the approach it will present, together with a timetable for further actions."
"The communication will also address issues relating to a long-term approach, notably the necessity to examine the better use of modern technologies, which has also been underlined in your report."
"The Commission is still open to examining alternative systems to the current VAT system, provided that certain conditions are met."
"The report mentions, in this context, a reverse-charge mechanism and the taxation of intra-Community supplies."
"The Commission has offered both of these radical options for consideration to the ECOFIN Council, but so far Member States have not shown the political will to take such far-reaching measures."
"Regarding direct taxes, the Commission is working on the review of the Savings Taxation Directive, and intends to present the report on the operation of the Directive before the end of September, as requested by the ECOFIN Council of 14 May 2008."
"During the review process, we have been carefully analysing the current scope of the Directive and the need for amendments in order to enhance its efficiency."
"The report will be followed by a proposal for such amendments to the Savings Taxation Directive that prove necessary and appropriate."
"The Commission has also carefully taken note of the ECOFIN Council conclusions of the same date, emphasising the importance of promoting the principles of good governance in the tax area - that is transparency, exchange of information and fair tax competition - and the inclusion of related provisions in agreements with third countries and third country groupings."
"Thanks to close cooperation with the Member States in the Anti-Tax Fraud Strategy expert group of the Commission, the idea of an anti-fraud strategy at EU level is taking concrete form."
"The announced measures will be a big step forward, even if further efforts will have to be made."
"Concerning your discussion on tax competition, you will know that we have been working in the Code of Conduct Group on abolishing harmful business tax regimes in the EU."
"All in all, the Code of Conduct Group assessed over 400 measures by the present 27 Member States and their dependencies and overseas territories, of which over a hundred were considered harmful."
"Almost all of those hundred have already been abolished and the remainder are set to be abolished, subject to the transitional arrangements."
"The work conducted under the Code has been successful. It has led to the dismantling of almost all harmful tax measures in the Member States and their dependent or associated territories."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank the European Parliament for its constructive contribution to the debate on the coordinated strategy to improve the fight against fiscal fraud."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, thank you for the good cooperation and your report."
"I have four points to make."
"Firstly, we believe that we need to stress that fiscal fraud is not something that can be combated in isolation and that a coordinated approach is essential, both among the individual Member States and with third countries."
"Secondly, the planned pilot projects to fight carousel fraud are a good idea and we take note of these, but we would make the point that this must not lead to any deterioration in framework conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Thirdly, we expressly support the Commission's proposals for amendment of the VAT Directive and the Council Regulation on administrative cooperation in this area."
"Fourthly, I am pleased that the discussion on a general lifting of banking secrecy is something which did not command a majority in any committee and has now been resoundingly rejected by a large majority."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I should like to add my own congratulations to those expressed to the rapporteur."
"Combating fiscal fraud has been an ongoing issue for the House for years, and unfortunately, despite numerous initiatives and comprehensive support from Parliament, the Commissioner still has little to show in the way of success - although this is urgently needed - because of blocking, to a greater or lesser extent, by the Member States."
"One would think that it would be in the interests of the Member States to make progress on fighting fiscal fraud, given that we are talking about recouping a figure in excess of EUR 200 billion a year - in other words, more than the EU budget - without any need to raise tax rates for honest taxpayers."
"In any discussion of this issue, then, it is essential to underline that some of the responsibility lies with the Member States themselves."
"The adoption of the report proved rather difficult, for problems initially arose with one particular issue in committee, but this matter has now been resolved."
"Mrs Bowles showed a great deal of willingness to cooperate."
"From our perspective, this was a difficult report because it has involved one amendment which we cannot support."
"Even now, there are proposals to squeeze the very last drop out of the taxpayer and tax sources."
"Whether this is a sensible option or will simply lead to new offences remains to be seen."
"Above all, Amendment 4, which was proposed by two of our fellow Members from the Socialist Group and is aimed at the repeal of the Savings Taxation Directive, is not something that we can support."
"This, then, is our position: we fully support Mrs Bowles' report in all other respects, but if Amendment 4 on the abolition of the Savings Taxation Directive gains a majority, we will reject the report in its entirety."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I too should like to thank Mrs Bowles for the quality of her work and for the result that we were able to achieve in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on such an important text as this."
"I should like to remind my fellow Members that the public purse currently loses between EUR 200 and 250 billion due to fiscal fraud in the internal market."
"These missing billions mean less public investment, fewer schools, fewer public services, more social needs that cannot be met and, of course frequently, in compensation, higher taxes for those honest and humble taxpayers who do not have the time to spend on tax evasion and tax shopping."
"I am delighted to see that, on the issue of VAT, there is broad consensus within this House on putting an end to fraud and practices which take advantage of the fragility of the transitional system set up in 1993."
"We are all well aware since the Liechtenstein scandal that the biggest fiscal fraud is committed by those large savers who place considerable sums of money in third countries, often tax havens, to avoid tax."
"The European Union has an instrument for fighting this fraud: the Directive on the Taxation of Savings Income."
"However, as underlined by Mrs Bowles, there are too many loopholes in this Directive and it only covers savings income in the form of interest payable to individuals."
"It is therefore currently far too easy to artificially set up a legal entity, sometimes with a single partner or shareholder, or to invent financial revenue that is not strictly interest in order to avoid tax."
"It is therefore absolutely vital to widen the scope of this Directive, as proposed by the report, so that, at the very least, fiscal fraud is not so easy. This is in fact a moral imperative."
"I must express my astonishment and disappointment at the amendment tabled by the PPE-DE Group which, due to both its timidity and its direction, ends up proposing that nothing should change and that, in terms of fiscal fraud, we should stick with the current situation."
"Let us put these positions to the European people, in particular the German people, and let us see how the European and German people judge the choices made here."
"I have heard big statements made in the media, particularly in the German media, about this issue of fiscal fraud."
"Here, in the silence of the European Parliament, other choices are being made."
"I hope that the European people will be the judge of these."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to highlight three issues in the course of this debate."
"Firstly, it has been estimated that tax losses due to fiscal fraud relating to VAT and excise duty amount to more than 2% of the European Union's GDP. The losses total between EUR 200 billion and EUR 250 billion."
"These are enormous sums of money. National incomes are reduced, and there is also an impact on the structure of the European Union's budget income as the proportion of own income based on GNI is increased."
"Secondly, despite this diagnosis, the solutions proposed in the report could do more harm than good."
"I refer, for instance, to the solutions relating to intra-Community transactions, such as the reverse charge mechanism whereby the tax is paid by the recipient, not by the supplier."
"I am also concerned about the proposal to unify VAT rates, which in effect means eliminating the reduced rates, and about the proposal to set up a clearing house system to apportion tax between Member States."
"Thirdly, it would seem that what is really needed in order to combat fiscal fraud is closer cooperation between the fiscal administrations of the Member States."
"This should involve swifter exchange of information, and perhaps even automatic access to certain data concerning VAT taxpayers and excise duty payers."
"(DE) Mr President, I rise for two reasons: firstly, because this is an issue - as Mr Langen has said - that has been on our agenda for many years and we really should be asking why no progress is being made, especially when it comes to VAT evasion."
"Secondly, it is unacceptable to the vast majority of Europeans that here we are discussing tax evasion and fraud - taxpayers' money - so hypocritically without addressing the problems here in our midst."
"The European Parliament, as represented by many MEPs, is a hotbed of fraud."
"We can read about it in the Galvin report and elsewhere, but attempts are being made to sweep this under the carpet."
"I need only mention Chichester, Purvis or certain Liberal MEPs."
"It is scandalous."
"Unless we address the cases of fraud in our own ranks, we lack any credibility and have no right to criticise others."
"I urge OLAF, but particularly the parliamentary administration and parliamentary groups, to establish clarity here."
"It is outrageous that attempts are being made to hush things up, here of all places."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"I am very pleased that a Community strategy is emerging for this issue, albeit slowly, perhaps too slowly."
"I agree that the fight against fiscal fraud must be incorporated into the individual national obligations of the Member States on the one hand, but it must also be incorporated into the Community's Lisbon programme."
"My observations are as follows: first, I do not agree with the phrasing of the Parliament's report according to which the strengthening of tax competition would distort the internal market unnecessarily and undermine the social model."
"This reflects the obsession with stipulating minimum levels of taxation for every area of taxation that exists, which would in fact cause unfairness in addition to the impact of inflation, since it would hit those who have otherwise put their houses in order and are able to lower taxes."
"Concerning indirect taxation that falls under the Community's jurisdiction too, the policy of referring exclusively to minimum values without having us regulate the maximum is unacceptable."
"I would like it to be noted that the hotbed of abuse occurring with excise duty is due to the increase in minimum levels, since it stimulates the spread of the black-market economy and the manufacture of home-made produce, which contradict all the Community's policies."
"Next, in the area of VAT, I am pleased with the policy of taking slow steps and with the experimental idea of the reverse charge, but resolute steps forward are also needed here."
"In my opinion, given the level of technology we have today, this could easily be done for cross-border transactions within an internal market, and the supplier's VAT for the destination country could easily be collected and transferred to the destination country."
"In order to do this, of course, there must be improved willingness for cooperation between the tax authorities of the Member States, which is still lacking, and we can take a deep breath and achieve this now that the euro has been introduced and the Payments Directive has come into being."
"Finally, I feel that it is important to take action concerning the operations of primarily offshore companies outside the Union, since the tax base is often channelled there before taxation and is then returned from there to companies in the Union through messy transactions in order to evade tax, and this is not in the interests of selecting a favourable tax location. Thank you."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner Kovács, ladies and gentlemen, according to some estimates, fiscal fraud in Europe exceeds 6% of tax revenue. It has a corrosive effect on confidence in tax systems, on the capability and fairness of treasury departments and on the wellbeing of citizens."
"It is a breeding ground for the informal economy and organised crime."
"Within the European Union, it affects the proper functioning of the internal market, distorts competition and harms the financial interests of the EU and also fulfilment of the Lisbon Strategy."
"If tax were paid on the one-quarter of global wealth that is hidden in tax havens, according to data from the International Monetary Fund, the Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations could be covered with money to spare."
"The European Union must be tough in its fight against fiscal fraud."
"This can be done safely and responsibly, without imposing exorbitant burdens on our economy."
"The increase in cross-border trade and the effects of globalisation demand that we be determined in promoting a European strategy against fiscal fraud. National actions are not enough."
"This strategy must have an internal dimension, tackling problems posed by fraud in VAT and special taxes, and also tax evasion issues in terms of direct taxation, as well as an external dimension, by asserting the economic weight of the European Union."
"We cannot disappoint those of our citizens who scrupulously comply with their tax obligations and who expect leadership from the European Union."
"In this context, we demand that the package of measures against VAT fraud that the Commission will present next month is ambitious and that the report announced for the end of this month on the application of taxation to savings is useful for making definite progress in the fight against fraud in this area in Europe."
"We welcome the general contents of the report produced by Mrs Bowles who we congratulate. We trust that this report will be adopted in plenary and that, if improvements are not made, then at least we do not go backwards."
"(BG) Ms Bowles, I admire your desire to overcome tax fraud at European level."
"Consider, though, what this will cause to those who govern Bulgaria now."
"If cases of tax fraud stop in Bulgaria I assure you that at the next elections the liberals from the Muslim party Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) will not win even half of the percentage they win at the moment."
"If the theft of public funds in my country is terminated once and for all, the socialists can no longer sponsor their campaigns or, respectively, their absurd initiatives."
"As a member of the Attack party I will support this report of yours, for Attack is the only party in Bulgaria which works for stopping the syphoning of state funds and Attack is the party, whose platform includes the firm commitment to review all shady and tainted deals, which resulted in damages for the state budget and which have so far benefited not one or two political forces. Thank you."
"(FR) Mr President, please allow me first of all to say to Mr Hamon that his blackmail does not impress us at all, and I regret that he has clearly been the victim of a huge misunderstanding."
"Mr President, while agreeing with the broad outlines of the report by Mrs Bowles, I believe that two points must be highlighted."
"Firstly, the transitional system of VAT, which dates back to 1993, is now showing its limitations."
"I do not believe that we can any longer accept the continuation of this transitional system."
"Fiscal fraud, which we all condemn due to its direct and indirect effects, is partly attributable to failures in the current system which should therefore be changed."
"Obviously I am aware that there are certain problems."
"That is why I recommend to the Commission that it promotes the solution devised by the RTvat organisation which should allow a tax loss of EUR 275 million per day to be avoided, while reducing administrative costs for SMEs."
"The second point concerns the issue of tax evasion in connection with the Directive on the Taxation of Savings Income."
"The report contains unjustified remarks that have led me to table amendments in order to rectify the situation."
"The legitimate and necessary fight against fiscal fraud must not cause us to call into question the principle of tax competition."
"I absolutely reject this as the two have no connection."
"Furthermore, experience shows that the system of tax deduction at source for the taxation of savings is the most efficient system, rather than trying to impose, across the board, the information exchange system which has its own problems."
"Finally, the demands to reform this Directive, in terms of widening its scope to all legal entities and all other sources of financial revenue, are also very badly thought out because they will simply have the effect of hounding savings out of the European Union."
"That is why I want these points to be amended. If they are not amended, we will be unable to vote for this report."
"(PL) Mr President, fiscal fraud has been a global problem for some time now."
"Estimates suggest that the losses incurred are in the order of 2% to 2.5% of GDP, which is between EUR 200 billion and EUR 250 billion at European level."
"There is therefore an urgent need to coordinate action at Community level and to tighten up cooperation between Member States."
"Article 10 and Article 280 of the Treaty establishing the European Community state that the Member States shall take all appropriate measures to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaty and to coordinate their action aimed at protecting the financial interests of the Community."
"It is important to bear in mind, however, that although the free movement of goods and services within the Community's market makes it difficult for countries to combat this type of fraud on their own, the actions taken should not hamper economic activity and place unnecessary burdens on taxpayers."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I want to thank the Members of the House for the comments and views they expressed during the debate."
"As I said in my opening remarks, the Commission very much appreciates the contribution made by the European Parliament to the debate on a coordinated strategy to improve the fight against fiscal fraud."
"The Commission has assumed its responsibility and will take further initiatives to strengthen the legal framework and administrative cooperation between Member States."
"Member States certainly have to do the same."
"Some of you have referred to the review of the Savings Taxation Directive, and I can assure you that the ongoing review is a very thorough one, where we are examining in detail whether the current scope is effective, and the pros and cons of extending it."
"It is a complex matter where many factors have to be taken into account: efficiency from a tax compliance point of view; the administrative burden for market operators, and also for tax administration; the need for a level playing field both inside the EU and in relation to the outside world - to name just a few."
"As I mentioned earlier, we will soon present the report."
"It will be followed by a proposal for amendments to the Savings Taxation Directive, and we will do our utmost to strike a proper balance."
"It is clear that there exists no single and global solution for eliminating tax fraud."
"Each individual measure should bring an added value, but it is only their implementation as a whole which provides the tax authorities with an enhanced framework for combating tax evasion and tax fraud."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, tax fraud is the business of the EU because fraudsters make use of cross-border loopholes, and that is what we are trying to close."
"As the Commissioner says, the savings tax issues are complex."
"I think it is possible for us to reach agreement through our voting that we do not pre-empt too much the more detailed discussions that we are going to have to hold on that topic when the Commission comes out with their further proposals."
"Likewise I think that we can also avoid reference to tax competition where we are divided but which is not core to this report."
"Therefore I think we can achieve some harmony amongst ourselves."
"On all these fronts, colleagues and Commissioner, I do not think that inaction or tentative action is an adequate response."
"2.5% of GDP is at stake."
"That is a huge chunk of the tax base."
"As our colleague, Mr Sánchez Presedo, points out, that is possibly 5% of tax."
"If any politician here or in any Member State campaigned on the basis of putting up tax by 5% to pay for nothing, they would not get very far."
"So, and I say this to Member States in particular, getting prickly about exchange of information, doing the minimum, being fearful, is just the same as taxing 5% for nothing, for that is what it costs the honest taxpayer."
"That is the message that I wish to send in this report and I believe it is the collective message that this Parliament wishes to send in this report supporting the Commissioner in his efforts and urging him to be bold."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (ET) Fiscal fraud is a problem for both the EU and the Member States, distorting competition and reducing the revenue base of the EU and the Member States alike."
"One of the roots of the problem is cited as being the current transitional system of VAT, which is complex and outmoded."
"It needs updating."
"In that regard the EP proposal that the European Commission should put forward a decision on a new VAT system in 2010 is undoubtedly welcome."
"The working out of a new VAT system obviously means ensuring that the current tax system is not replaced by a more complex and bureaucratic one."
"It is obviously also important to stress that, before it is applied Europe-wide, it must be piloted to ensure that it works in practice because this will prevent many problems which may emerge later."
"An equally important step in the fight against fiscal fraud is to update the availability of inter-State information, a process which would be assisted by the establishment of a pan-European e-tax administration information centre."
"The balance between the public interest and the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual will not be disregarded when personal data is processed."
"Finally, the term 'tax haven' must also, in view of the point at issue here, be regarded as important."
"I welcome the ideas set out in the report that the EU should make the elimination of tax havens at worldwide level a priority."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"(The sitting was closed at midnight.)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m.)"
"Documents received: see Minutes"
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (announcement of motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes"
"Social package (First part) (debate)"
"The next item is the Statements by the Commission and the Council on the Social Package (First part)."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, two months ago the Commission adopted a renewed social agenda."
"It is designed to help the Union to solve the social problems which Europe will have to tackle in the 21st century."
"It contains an ambitious and cohesive set of measures in the field of social policy, enabling Europeans to grasp the opportunities open to them."
"As has been said already, the renewed social agenda was discussed by Ministers for Labour and Social Affairs at an informal meeting of the Social Council held in early July at Chantilly."
"I was pleased to receive a report on the very positive welcome of the renewed social agenda by Member States and I await with interest the conclusions which the Council should receive by the end of this year."
"I have already had the opportunity to present this package to the Conference of Presidents and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"A suitable time has also arisen for an in-depth debate here in Parliament."
"I am convinced that today's exchange of views will help us to reach a consensus on the question as to what kind of social Europe we wish to build for European citizens."
"I should like to remind you of developments up to now."
"This complex package is the result of two years of joint efforts."
"The Commission has been working with all interested parties, including representatives of workers and employers, civil society, Member States and regional and local bodies."
"The package forms a cohesive whole, emphasising links to other areas, such as education, health, environment, the information society and the economy, and it clearly shows that economic and social objectives are two sides of the same coin and must operate in close cooperation for the benefit of the people."
"It is an ambitious package, attempting to offer practical responses to the concerns of the people and to improve their living conditions."
"It is also a very comprehensive package - the largest that the Commission has ever adopted in one go - with 18 initiatives presented together with the report."
"In excess of another 20 relating to a wide range of topics are also under discussion."
"Today we are looking at two measures: at a proposed directive to combat discrimination and at a revised directive on the establishment of European Works Councils."
"First of all, however, I should like to say a few words about the basic principles of this package."
"The renewed social agenda is based on three main principles: opportunities, access and solidarity."
"We Europeans value the worth of individuals and want everyone to have an equal opportunity to achieve their potential."
"This means removing the obstacles which people have to overcome and creating the conditions to allow everyone to grasp the opportunities offered while still respecting European diversity and avoiding discord."
"Europeans' faith in equality gives rise to a shared belief in social solidarity: solidarity between generations, between regions, between those at the top and those at the bottom, between wealthy and less wealthy Member States, and also with our neighbours and friends in other parts of the world, since solidarity is an integral part of the functioning of the European Community and of our relations with other countries throughout the world."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the extent of legal protection against discrimination differs at present in the EU depending on the reasons for the discrimination."
"Discrimination is not, however, restricted to one area."
"This is why we have proposed, as part of the package, a horizontal directive prohibiting discrimination on the basis of age, sexual orientation, religious belief and disability outside the employment field."
"A horizontal directive will provide Member States, economic entities and citizens with the greatest degree of clarity and legal certainty."
"This draft is a response to repeated calls from Parliament and meets the political undertaking which the Commission made upon taking office."
"It is a flexible instrument based on principles already adopted in Member States and embedded in existing regulations."
"I should like to emphasise that tackling all the reasons for discrimination in the same way does not mean that uniform rules have to apply in all areas."
"In insurance and banking, for example, it will be possible to apply different approaches on the basis of age or disability."
"However, such differences will have to be supported by convincing grounds and reliable statistical data."
"Elderly people will still be able to enjoy preferential rates on public transport and at cultural events, and it will still be possible to restrict access to certain goods in order to protect people's health, for example the sale of alcohol to underage youths."
"The directive covers the supply of all goods and services and relates to both business and private individuals, but only insofar as the commercial supply of goods and services is involved."
"The directive will also be proportionate with regard to the burden it imposes in accordance with the concept of proportionality embedded in both the existing anti-discrimination directives and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which has been signed by Member States and the European Community."
"The draft directive prohibits discrimination, but at the same time respects the other fundamental rights and freedoms, including the protection of private and family life and acts undertaken in this context and also the freedom of religion and the freedom of association."
"Another problem to which I should like to draw attention is discrimination against the Roma, which the Commission has repeatedly condemned as incompatible with the principles of the EU."
"The package contains a declaration of our renewed undertaking to ensure equal opportunities and to fight against discrimination and also a Commission Staff Working Document on Community Instruments and Policies for Roma Inclusion."
"It is a response to the request from the European Council in December 2007 that the Commission should review existing policies and instruments and submit to the Council a report on the progress achieved."
"According to the Commission Staff Working Document, the necessary legislative, financial and coordinating instruments are in place and are being used, but not yet to a sufficient extent."
"The renewed social agenda includes several initiatives intended to improve the Union's ability to react more effectively to changes."
"We are convinced that European social dialogue and the European Works Councils have a special part to play in this context."
"The European Works Councils Directive has been crying out for updating for some time."
"At the present time, there are 820 European Works Councils in the Union, representing 15 million workers."
"However, recent cases show that they are not quite doing their job and employees are often not kept well informed or consulted with regard to company restructuring."
"The initiative therefore aims to strengthen the role of social dialogue within companies at the supranational level."
"It is a balanced draft which should guarantee that employees' representatives are kept adequately informed and consulted prior to decisions relating to circumstances affecting them and should also allow businesses to adapt to globalisation."
"The Commission would of course prefer to give priority to a solution first discussed by representatives of workers and employers, but the fact that we did not manage to persuade them to come to the table for discussions last June forced the Commission to submit a draft on its own initiative."
"We nonetheless value the joint letter which representatives of workers and employers sent to the Council and Parliament in August."
"We appreciate the efforts made by both sides to reach agreement on this complex topic and I am also pleased that they decided to accept the Commission's draft as a basis for further work."
"I really hope that Parliament will bear in mind the practical proposals made by representatives of workers and employers when they come to the first reading."
"I believe that we shall achieve a rapid resolution."
"As far as it is able, the Commission will try to smooth the path as much as possible."
"Now I must say a few words about the impacts of globalisation."
"Company restructuring is sometimes unavoidable, but the impacts on employees and their families may be very painful."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund exists to help in such situations."
"So far the Fund has helped 7 250 employees to find new jobs."
"We can be pleased about this, but it must be ensured that the Fund is accessible to all those who might benefit from it."
"The report contained in the social agenda package states that, of the EUR 500 million available annually, just 4% was used in 2007."
"Thought must therefore be given as to how to improve the results of the Fund's activities."
"As regards workforce mobility, I should like to say that the 1996 Directive concerning the posting of workers supports the free movement of services and also offers protection against the abuse of workers and guarantees them observance of fundamental rights in the Member States to which they are posted."
"Recent rulings by the Court of Justice on this matter have thrown up a whole series of questions."
"The reactions to them are quite legitimate and we must together find an answer to them."
"I am convening a forum to discuss this topic on 9 October, when this complex problem will be discussed with political bodies, representatives of workers and employers, representatives of European institutions and experts in the fields of law and the economy."
"The Commission will of course continue to listen to all comments, but we do not as yet see any need to amend the Directive."
"In any case, however, we shall ensure that there is no conflict between the fundamental freedoms embedded in the Treaty and citizens' fundamental rights."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this new social agenda affirms the undertaking of the European Union to promote a strong and real social dimension for Europe, a social Europe, which will meet the expectations of our fellow citizens."
"Of course, this is impossible without including an educational dimension, which is very important."
"In this context, I should like to mention the following three documents:"
"1."
"Council Recommendation on mobility of young volunteers across Europe;"
"2. Communication entitled 'Improving competences for the 21st Century: an Agenda for European Cooperation on Schools';"
"3. Green Paper: Migration & mobility: challenges and opportunities for EU education systems."
"It is our joint wish to strengthen and deepen the social dimension of Europe."
"The 18 measures contained in the package represent the first step in our efforts in this direction."
"I know that I can rely on you, whose job it is to represent the voice of the people, to consider these proposals and political documents in depth and with care."
"It is of fundamental importance for their future."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are here to talk about social Europe."
"We shall talk about social Europe, and I am glad to be doing so today before the European Parliament, which is a key player in the institutional structure of Europe, an essential partner with which the French Presidency is keen to work as closely as possible."
"I have said it before and I will say it again now: 2008 is to be the year in which social Europe is re-energised."
"Something that I believe all our European players want to see."
"The June summit in Luxembourg, the Chantilly meeting in July, are milestones along that route."
"We were keen for the French Presidency to tackle the issue of revising the European Social Agenda, which Commissioner Špidla talked about just now."
"This is a key issue which demands the ability on our part to define a social vision for Europe and to translate that vision into concrete action."
"The discussions at Chantilly, in which Parliament took part through your committee chairman Mr Andersson, enabled us to reaffirm a number of common values which we all share, and it is precisely these that define Europe's ambitions for social policy."
"Those values are social dialogue, intergenerational solidarity, action against poverty and discrimination, equality between the sexes, social protection, occupational mobility, and the importance of services of general interest in guaranteeing social cohesion and social responsibility in business and industry."
"Observed from Beijing, Washington, the Cape, New Delhi or from Brisbane even, these values give the European social model its originality."
"Chantilly was an opportunity for us to remind the world that these values are central to Europe's development strategy, to the Lisbon strategy."
"In other words, Chantilly provided a reminder that this social model, these common values, constitute a European strength in our globalised world."
"Why?"
"Because the knowledge-based economy, the innovation economy, can only be built by focusing firmly on developing human capital and on lifelong learning."
"Because the economy as a whole loses out when whole categories of the population are shut out of the world of work for long periods of time, cannot contribute to wealth creation and cannot access goods and services."
"Because workers too are more productive when they have good terms of employment and social protection which cushions them against the hard knocks that life delivers."
"Economic progress does not mean sacrificing social progress, far from it."
"I am not alone in seeing the two as indissociable."
"Without social progress, economic progress will run out of steam sooner or later."
"So Europe must advance on both fronts: economic progress, yes, and social progress too."
"Along with this conviction which we collectively reaffirmed, we took on board another fact: the European social model needs to change, to adapt to globalisation, climate change, demographic change and the growing diversity of European societies."
"So we need to adapt our labour markets and introduce flexicurity, that is to say new securities and flexibilities for both workforce and employers."
"And things are moving."
"At first the term 'flexicurity' frightened people, alarmed them."
"But now it represents a European ideal aspired to by all players, including the social partners."
"The word has become commonplace, an everyday term, which proves that things are indeed changing, that mindsets are changing."
"Something else which must be addressed if we are to move our social model forward is the guarantee of social cohesion, with measures to combat new forms of poverty, specifically where they affect children."
"It is time we joined forces to prepare our societies better for this demographic change, strengthening intergenerational solidarity and ensuring that people have access to high-quality social services of general interest."
"This process of adjustment has been under way for a few years already."
"Thanks to initiatives by the Commission, the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament and the social partners, we are making progress on specific initiatives which respond to popular concerns in Europe."
"How do we allow freedom of movement for workers within Europe and at the same time safeguard the employment rights of those who move?"
"How do we improve the management of restructuring operations by involving the workforce Europe-wide?"
"How do we ensure that people are able to work and thus play a part in society and what can we do to counter discrimination more effectively?"
"These endeavours will continue throughout the French Presidency."
"Especially - and I say this in all honesty - since the upcoming elections mean that the second half of 2008 will be our last shot at securing results in this parliamentary term on a number of issues."
"All of us will shortly be held to account by our fellow Europeans at the ballot box."
"The people of Europe expect results here."
"The reactions to recent rulings by the European Court of Justice are proof of that."
"This is an area where the European Parliament can help us, along with many other areas which I will touch on briefly."
"Firstly, revision of the European Works Council directive, which Vladimír Špidla talked about just now."
"This is a major undertaking that will strengthen social dialogue in Europe."
"The present directive applies to more than 14 million workers and 820 employers."
"Revision of the directive will increase the number covered still further."
"At Chantilly we brought together representatives of the European Trade Union Confederation and of Business Europe to hear their views on the revised text put forward by the Commission."
"They were happy with the proposal as a working base and said they could negotiate to overcome points of disagreement."
"They are now finalising a number of common proposals which they will announce in due course."
"If this comes to fruition, if the social partners produce common proposals on revision of the directive, this will be helpful to our work, the work of Parliament and the Council."
"So why not reach agreement at first reading as quickly as possible?"
"If at all possible, by the end of the year?"
"Concerning our second focus of work: I must of course mention the proposal for a directive on protection from discrimination beyond the workplace, which the Commission also adopted on 2 July."
"This was much discussed at Chantilly and the Presidency opened talks on this text from the beginning of July."
"Parliament will be consulted on this matter but I should point out that the Commission's proposal, covering four grounds for discrimination, took account of the resolution which Parliament adopted last spring on the report by Elizabeth Lynne."
"The third matter which also received a lot of attention was social services of general interest."
"All the Member States are talking about these."
"They are all talking about the same thing even if, admittedly, they are not all saying exactly the same thing."
"But adoption of the Protocol to the Lisbon Treaty and evaluation of the Altmark package gives us an opportunity to think about the contribution which these services make to social cohesion in Europe, the need to ensure that they are of high calibre and the importance of giving them a sound legal framework."
"We hope to work on a roadmap with the Commission, and with anyone keen to contribute, to identify a number of intermediate objectives so that progress on this highly important matter can be sustained."
"Then, of course, there are the directives on temporary work and working time."
"On both these, the ball is in the European Parliament's court, for the second reading."
"We must try to avoid conciliation."
"Millions of temporary workers in Europe are waiting impatiently for the directive on temporary work to come into force and there is pressure on some Member States to settle the question of on-call time."
"So I can only encourage Parliament to keep us informed of what happens, with due regard, here too, to the counterbalancing factors of which I am well aware."
"But here too, people have expectations of us and all eyes are upon us."
"I am also mindful, on the subject of mobility, of the need to reach agreement on the implementing regulation on the coordination of social security schemes."
"The French Presidency needs the European Parliament's support on these various issues in order to achieve concrete results."
"Those results - you know this, but I will say it again - are keenly awaited by the people of Europe, who expect us to pursue our European social vision to the benefit of their everyday lives, to make Europe more a part of everyday existence."
"We know today that we need not less Europe but more Europe."
"We know full well today that we need not less social Europe but more social Europe."
"We know full well, ladies and gentlemen, the challenges we have to meet."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Commissioner Špidla, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats sets great store by social justice."
"Upholding European social models is one of our priorities in an increasingly globalised world."
"And for this reason, as Chairman of the EPP Group, I welcome the Commission's proposal on the new social package."
"This text offers some answers to questions of fundamental importance to our societies, such as demographic change, globalisation and poverty reduction."
"My group feels that the Commission should go still further and take more specific measures."
"Alleviating poverty, getting population groups who are excluded from the labour market into employment, promoting worker mobility and improving workers' education and training - these are things that call for a specific programme, concrete measures and strong commitment on the part of the European Union and its Member States."
"Demographic change is a major challenge for our economies."
"Workers over pensionable age, women, young people and above all persons with a disability - generally speaking everyone who has been out of the labour market for a long period of time - must be given a new chance."
"We must help these people to find work or get back to work."
"To that end we want concrete measures to promote lifelong learning."
"Persons who are in work continue to face inequalities."
"We are very concerned by the continuing pay gap between men and women."
"That is something which ought not to exist in the Europe of 2008."
"Similarly, appropriate care facilities must be provided to help people combine work and family life."
"We thus call on the Commission and Council to take specific measures here."
"My Group is opposed to all forms of discrimination."
"So we approve of the Commission's declared intention to plug the loopholes which persist in the relevant legislation."
"Action on discrimination against disabled people in particular must be intensified."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we believe that the most effective instrument we have for upholding social models in this age of globalisation is economic growth."
"But we are convinced that in order to attain the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy we must promote the cause of business and industry, because it is enterprise that basically drives job creation."
"We must improve the image of the entrepreneur in Europe and encourage young people to set up their own businesses."
"We must also encourage a competitive environment for our businesses, giving special support to small and medium-sized enterprises which are the leading creators of jobs."
"With this in mind we urge all players in the field to work for more flexicurity in Europe."
"The concept has proved its worth in those countries that have adopted it."
"It allows businesses the flexibility they need to be internationally competitive, whilst protecting workers at the same time."
"I welcome the Commission's intention to promote social dialogue."
"For us, partnership based on trust within businesses is key to their success in the marketplace."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in the current treaties social matters are still essentially the province of the Member States."
"That may, and must, change but until it does we have to abide by the subsidiarity principle."
"We have no choice."
"That does not stop the Commission from conducting impact studies, condemning inequalities and seeking to assess the social consequences of any new proposed legislation."
"Indeed I urge it to do so."
"The social and societal challenges we face are considerable: we need to reform our economies, adapting them to be more competitive, so that fewer people suffer exclusion."
"There cannot be social progress without economic growth, but the economy cannot be competitive without social progress."
"The EPP-ED Group is determined, now more than ever, to achieve results here."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, listening to the speeches delivered by the previous speakers - by Commissioner Špidla, by the President-in Office of the Council, Mr Bertrand, and by you, Mr Daul - one has the impression that all is well."
"You are progressing nicely, and 2008 will be remembered as the year when the European social model was relaunched."
"That all sounds very fine, but the reality is harsher."
"Yes, the real picture looks quite different."
"The real picture is one of gross social inequality in the European Union."
"Profits spiral ever higher while wage levels stagnate."
"The income gap has become an ever-widening chasm."
"The loss of purchasing power that has hit ordinary people in the European Union, compounded by the drastic increases in energy prices, is a veritable impoverishment programme."
"This is a problem that we must address in the European social model, and not just with fine words."
"What you are initiating, Mr Špidla, is good, and we welcome it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we shall be dealing in detail with our views on the various proposals."
"For this reason I can make a few basic remarks about what we expect of a European social model."
"Fifteen years ago, if people in the European Union - in whatever country - had the feeling that something was going wrong, that some long-established national standard was endangered, they responded by looking to Europe to put things right; they felt the need to rectify matters in the European framework, because people believed then that European rules in a European framework would provide protection transcending national boundaries."
"Today, fifteen years later, just try telling anyone that we will put things right in Europe."
"It would strike fear into employees, because they believe that this Europe, in its present-day disposition, can no longer guarantee them social protection."
"If you take the time to analyse the Irish referendum and the voting behaviour of young people, you will see these people saying that Europe is a great idea."
"But when they look at how it is organised and constituted today, they are not impressed with its organisation or its disposition."
"Since we are entering an election campaign, it is only right to ask why there was such optimism fifteen years ago about the future of social policy in Europe, and why there is such pessimism today."
"Our reply as Socialists must be that Europe is governed by the Right."
"You delivered a fine Socialist speech, Minister; what you said here was marvellous."
"But what line did your government take in the Council on the Working Time Directive?"
"(Applause)"
"Your governing party is a member of the European People's Party, whose member parties provide the vast majority of the heads of government in the European Union."
"In the Commission, they provide an absolute majority of the Commissioners as well as the President of the Commission."
"The European People's Party is the largest political group in this House, but, to hear you speak, one would think you had nothing at all to do with the stunted social development of Europe."
"Europe is governed by the Right and is being guided in the wrong direction, and that must be rectified in the European elections."
"(Applause)"
"You will have a good opportunity to get us back on track when the time comes to implement the measures you have outlined."
"The European social model is one of our priorities, you said."
"For our group, it certainly is!"
"What do people feel seriously threatened by in the European Union?"
"Uncontrolled financial markets."
"Uncontrolled hedge funds and private-equity firms that buy some company or other, cherry-pick its assets and dump its employees on the streets - simply to maximise the investors' profits."
"My honourable colleague Paul Nyrup Rasmussen has presented us with a very good report."
"We need qualified majority voting on this issue, so that the Commission can launch an initiative for the regulation of hedge funds and private-equity firms."
"Who is it that refuses to support such a move?"
"You, the European People's Party, whose representatives on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs are against it."
"This is why we need to spell out very clearly that the struggle for the European social model is also the struggle for a basic philosophy."
"Mr Bertrand rightly ascribed the success of the European Union to its having married economic progress with social progress."
"That was always the underlying philosophy in Europe - for the Christian Democrats too, by the way."
"For decades, these were two sides of the same coin, until the neo-liberal mainstream began to tell us in the early nineties that lower wages, longer hours and less say in company management were the basic recipe for faster economic growth."
"For decades, of course, there have been people - and they are still present in great numbers today, even within the Commission - who attach more importance to horse racing than to the European social model but are responsible here for the internal market and who have been telling us, and still tell us - the prime example being Mr Trichet, who does so at every press conference - that wages in Europe are too high."
"Perhaps they are in the case of board members at the European Central Bank, but not for ordinary workers in Europe."
"We shall therefore have to ensure that a general change of political direction takes place, a change of direction that will actually put the European social model back where you want it, Mr Bertrand, so that every economic advance achieved by the European Union will also have a beneficial impact on the lives of all citizens of the European Union."
"You are right, of course, in saying that the EU can only compete in the world, be it in Beijing or Brisbane, if we develop this internal market."
"We want to do that; we want an internal market that can perform."
"We want an efficient and competitive European continent."
"But the reason why we want it is to create wealth that accrues to everyone, not only to investors in major corporate groups, in large joint-stock companies and in the big banks."
"As long as we have this philosophy in Europe that awards European prizes to people who boast, when presenting their companies' performance figures at press conferences, of having made billions throughout Europe on which they do not pay any taxes in Europe, because their profits are European and not national and are therefore exempt from national taxation, and as long as we continue to put tens of thousands out of work to perpetuate this state of affairs and maintain our shareholders' profits - as long as this remains the reality of the European social model, we can talk here as much as we like, but the people will never identify with this Europe."
"We do wish, however, to consolidate the European ideal and to further the cause of integration."
"For this reason, let me remind the House that a European social model is judged by its fruits."
"The same applies to you, Mr Bertrand, in the Council and to you, Mr Daul, here in Parliament."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, this social package is a welcome step forward in the building of a European community which cares for its citizens."
"The people who cast votes against the European Constitution and the Lisbon Treaty sent a clear message."
"The message is they will not give the European Union new powers simply because we want them."
"Our people want to know what kind of European Union we are building."
"This package is extensive and controversial, and we must make sure that people know the benefits that it will bring to their lives."
"There is much to praise, as Commissioner Špidla says, in the European Works Council Directive and, of course, in the proposal on patients' rights in cross-border health care, for which my group has fought so hard."
"But I want today to concentrate on two specific measures in this package."
"First, the revision of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which helps people who have lost their jobs to find new ones."
"At present, a thousand posts must be under threat before a company can apply."
"Liberals and Democrats welcome the proposal to lower that threshold and to simplify claims procedures, not because the European Union should plan work for Europe - that role is best filled by the internal market - nor in the belief that the EU should provide unemployment benefit - that is for Member States."
"Rather, we welcome this proposal because it is based on a sound liberal principle: that employment is the best source of welfare."
"With growth grinding to a halt and some Member States already in recession, this policy will help prevent a spiral of sudden job losses that create welfare dependency."
"Second, the Anti-Discrimination Directive: my group has fought for this from the beginning of this Commission's term of office."
"The definition of discrimination will now cover the main spectrum of minorities - older people, gay people, disabled people, people of all faiths and none - and it will apply to clients and consumers, as well as employees."
"This, too, is a liberal measure which will proffer practical benefits, the kinds that come from knowing you can do your job and live your life free from the tyranny of prejudice."
"The draft directive should go further than it does."
"There are still loopholes, still opportunities for discrimination to rear its head."
"Why, for example, Commissioner, is it right to outlaw discrimination in the workplace, but to allow Member States to use discriminatory schoolbooks in the classroom?"
"Nonetheless, Europe is breaking down the barriers of discrimination, piece by piece."
"My group welcomes the commitment of the Commission and the Council to further that process, just as we insist on the full involvement of this House in framing the measures that complete it."
"In February Mr Barroso brought to us a major package of measures to fight climate change."
"Today, the Commission's proposals on social policy demonstrate to its detractors that Europe cares for community cohesion and that liberal economic policies need be no threat to progressive policies for a healthy environment and a society served by solidarity."
"Mr Schulz bemoans the predominance of centre-right governments in the European Union, but we live in a democracy and people choose their governments."
"They are distinctly unconvinced by what the Socialists are offering."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group very much welcomes the European Union's new social package."
"The social dimension is what most distinguishes Europe from other world powers such as the United States or China."
"In the west twentieth-century Europe was built to a great extent on social values."
"It provided a valuable social model for the new Member States upon their accession to the European Union in 2004 and 2007, since in many of them, after the recovery of political and economic independence at the end of the 1980s, capitalism sought to assert itself in its worst form, violating workers' rights and showing no respect for human dignity."
"In the 21st century we all have to contend with globalisation, which can be an opportunity but also a threat to humankind."
"Brussels must therefore send clear signals to the Member States encouraging them to preserve and further develop the social gains that serve the interests of all citizens of the European Union."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I very much welcome what the Minister has said this morning, and hope that much of it will be echoed by the Council, although the evidence so far does not give us great cause for confidence that it will."
"Many of us still see question marks hanging over our protection of the social aspect in the face of market dominance."
"We are invited in this package to consider the impact of the recent European Court of Justice rulings."
"Well, many of us have indeed considered them and consider them extremely worrying, when we are constantly being asked to justify measures on the basis of their not disturbing markets rather on the basis of their delivering a high quality of services and quality of workers rights etc."
"This is evidenced in the social package, where we are now looking at recognising the fact that we have poverty among people actually in work, and that we are still looking at a growing gap between rich and poor."
"While welcoming the sentiments on dealing with poverty expressed in the Commission's package, what we are really looking for is concrete action."
"We obviously welcome the horizontal directive on equalities."
"That is something we have championed throughout this Parliament."
"It is important for all sorts of reasons, not least because it now actually offers the possibility of full participation in society."
"We also welcome many of the proposals on the Roma."
"We welcome the Commission's commitment and want to see all Member States responding positively, rather than entrenching prejudice and bigotry."
"Training on equal opportunities is an important part of the skills agenda, especially for those delivering policy in the areas concerned."
"We welcome the existence, at least, of the proposals on the European Works Councils, although we have a number of criticisms about what is in them."
"As regards the mobility aspect of the package, we now also need to be looking at the impact of mobility in social terms: what happens to people, in particular the economically inactive who move and find themselves disbarred from Member States' health-care systems; what happens to people as they age, having moved to other Member States, and what will their future bring?"
"We also welcome the proposal on 'New skills for new jobs', and trust this really will link in with the climate change agenda, which also needs to look at new skills in old jobs, because most of the workforce have now passed the stage of formal education, making lifelong learning crucial."
"We must ask how we are going to deliver the skills we actually need in order to make our climate change targets practicable."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, three points from the present discussion stick in my mind."
"The first is the desire expressed by the Minister for the Interior, Mr Bertrand, to make 2008 the year when the European social model is relaunched."
"Then there are the words spoken by Commissioner Špidla, who said that the social package met public expectations within the European Union, and lastly there is your statement, Mr Schulz, that Europe is governed by the Right."
"I believe that all three statements require critical analysis."
"Firstly, how can the representative of the French Presidency declare the aim of making 2008 the comeback year for the social model when the French Government declined even to refer to social policy as a priority of its Presidency?"
"In my view, the social package is far from meeting people's expectations, because it simply does nothing at all to bridge the social divides in Europe and does not even take any action to halt the widening of these divisions, to freeze the situation as it now stands."
"The process is set to continue in spite of the social package."
"Lastly, Mr Schulz, I can happily give you a taste of your own medicine."
"It was back in the 1990s, when Socialist governments were in power, that this development took root."
"We should have expected you to say that, in the wake of Lisbon, there will be a new construct in 2010, a new strategy which will focus sharply on protection of the European social model and which will reorder our priorities once more."
"As for the social package itself, it does not come up to expectations."
"It is high time we broke out of the situation in which the decline in proper employment is accompanied by a growing number of jobs from which people cannot earn their livelihood."
"We must finally stop using mere job numbers as our criterion in the European Union and focus instead on jobs that pay a decent wage."
"This social package contains no announcement of the inclusion, wherever necessary, of a social progress clause in all European treaties."
"Nor is there any answer to the question whether those who play an important part in defending social rights within the European Union are to be given more instruments and more powers in the European Works Council Directive."
"The proposal merely invokes the status quo and maintains the present line with no additions."
"We reject this package as an excessively abstract and misguided approach."
"In their subsequent contributions to this debate, members of my group will be commenting on the individual components of the proposal."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, the Lisbon Treaty was dismissed by the legitimate Irish referendum, so of course you need a big programme to divert attention."
"Hence this new package."
"Well, it is not really new."
"It is a rehash of earlier proposals."
"But it is big."
"It has EU legislation, social dialogue, cooperation, funding, partnership, dialogue, communication... and that is just one page."
"Allow me to focus on funding."
"A prosperous economy will provide the funds, but you have lumbered yourselves with the euro, where the ECB's interest rate is trying to cover such diverse economies."
"One size fits all, some say."
"Actually it is one size that fits no one."
"In the UK the Bank of England cannot get it right for all our regions."
"Indeed, the weekend papers remarked that the economic North-South divide in the UK is now greater than ever before."
"The EU is protectionist."
"You are afraid of globalisation."
"Do not fight it."
"Do not combat it."
"Join it. Join the world market of an ever-growing population."
"Encourage enterprise by slashing red tape."
"Call a halt to the never-ending stream of directives and regulations which only hinder business."
"Accept the rest of the world on even terms and the European economy will increase, bringing the greatest social package of all: more and better jobs."
"In conclusion, one notes that it falls to the French presidency to kick-start this venture, but will they?"
"According to EurActiv on 3 July, the Commission and the French presidency have both declared social policy a priority in 2008."
"But if we read the Deutsche Welle of 2 July, French President Nicolas Sarkozy has made it clear that social policy will not be a top priority."
"Issues like immigration, climate change and energy will take centre stage."
"So which statement do you believe?"
"For my part I think the French will do as they always do and look after themselves."
"For that I congratulate them. I wish my government did the same."
"(FR) Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, it is normal in this House for us to rabbit on about social policy."
"Unfortunately the European social model is now no more than a myth, because the social reality in our country of France, and my own region in particular, Nord-Pas-de-Calais, is that we have a state of social decline, despair, social precarity and working conditions, mass unemployment and - something else that is altogether alarming and huge - a falling birth rate."
"Our thinking is still based on the social model of the 1960s, that is to say a model that assumes full employment and a large workforce."
"But for the last thirty years we have had mass unemployment and a sharply declining birth rate, which has taken us from baby boom to old folks boom and plunged the funding of our pensions into crisis."
"We must stop thinking that we have to defend the European social model at all costs and get ready instead to reorganise it."
"Our economic and historical analysis suggests that this should be done in two ways: first, we need a family policy that will bring the birth rate back up, otherwise we shall not be able to fund our pension schemes in the decades ahead and, secondly, we need a policy to re-energise the single market and get people back to work."
"In order to re-energise the EU single market we must reindustrialise and, unfortunately, if we persist with our almost religious faith in free trade and uncontrolled liberalism, we shall be unable to do what we must do to make our businesses competitive on our own home market."
"For these reasons our future efforts and our goal of improving social conditions must be rooted in this idea of national and Community preference and national and Community protection."
"(DE) Mr President, the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Employment has contributed to the creation of more and better jobs - a success that is being disputed by those who find it hard to come to terms with this Europe of change, outsourcing, rationalisation and takeovers."
"No one who is constantly made to feel dispensable on a personal level can begin to relate to the export boom of the European economy."
"As one of the countermeasures to this sense of insecurity, we need a coherent new social strategy."
"The package on the table, however, is so comprehensive that it cannot possibly be implemented by 2009."
"This diminishes the credibility of what is essentially a commendable approach."
"Commissioner Špidla, our aim cannot be action for its own sake."
"This is all about sustainability."
"Nor can our objective be the unadulterated electioneering in which Mr Schulz has just been revelling, but I see he has already left the chamber."
"We bear a share of the responsibility for ensuring that people are not marginalised and that they do not withdraw into parallel societies or a world of make-believe."
"This effort begins in schools, where the alarmingly high number of drop-outs must be sharply reduced in order to prevent any further widening of the gulf between those people who have qualifications and those who have none."
"To this end we need motivating lessons."
"Talents and skills must be nurtured from an early age - a profitable investment in every case."
"Our strategy of lifelong learning will then provide the added European value, the widespread wealth creation that Mr Schulz found wanting."
"So will our educational programmes - Socrates, Leonardo and Erasmus - which must be attuned to the world of work as a matter of urgency."
"To that end, we must manage to work in tandem with SMEs."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises provide most jobs, and they have training places to offer."
"They must also, however, work hard to ensure that they do not stop investing in continuing education and training, otherwise our innovations will dry up."
"One resource continues to be criminally neglected, namely older employees."
"It is high time that their wealth of experience, creativity and resilience was available to our economy."
"They are still well adrift at the foot of the demographic employment league."
"Lastly, the cohesion of our society must be strengthened."
"In the European Works Council Directive, for example, we need a tenable compromise between employers and employees."
"We shall do what we can in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to contribute to the achievement of that aim."
"We also need an inter-regional balance, and that is why we provide the European Social Fund, the Regional Fund and the Globalisation Fund."
"There is one issue, however, that we still regard as extremely critical, namely that of non-discrimination."
"We in the PPE Group reject the horizontal directive."
"It would exacerbate the legal uncertainty that already prevails and further diminish the scope for national creative action."
"If the social agenda in its entirety is to succeed, primary responsibility must remain in the hands of the Member States."
"It is more efficient to coordinate and communicate nationally, regionally and locally, and it is time to start adopting best practices instead of merely observing or analysing them."
"Then there would be a good chance of achieving the social and economic change we want and need and of bringing the European social model to life."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, this new social agenda comes late in the day and it is a feeble response to the precarious situation, inequalities and effects of recession currently plaguing the workforce and many of our fellow citizens in Europe."
"With more than 70 million people in poverty, even where unemployment levels are falling, with precarious living and working conditions and the growth of atypical forms of employment, we really do need a solid social base, a Europe that protects us."
"This is one of the focuses of the French EU Presidency."
"And as you said, Minister, 2008 was supposed to be a come-back year, the year in which social Europe was re-energised."
"Regrettably, your Government did not make the social dimension one of the four priorities for its Presidency."
"As we approach the end of the European Commission's term we have proposals, some of which, it must be said, do at last reflect things which the European Parliament and our Group in particular has called for: a genuine directive against discrimination in all areas, not just disability; at long last the raising of moves to strengthen and revise the directive on European works councils, and measures to ensure that our existing principles and laws on equal pay for men and women are properly upheld in the Member States."
"But just look at the shortcomings, the gaps in this new social agenda!"
"I will name two of them in particular."
"One is the response to recent judgments by the European Court of Justice in the Laval, Rüffert and Viking cases, which weaken our resistance to social dumping in the European Union."
"We think that the assurance given in the Commission's communication, that the Commission will provide legal clarity and interpretative guidelines on this directive, is not enough."
"Due note must be taken of the fact - and we have held Parliamentary hearings organised by the Employment and Social Affairs Committee - that the directive is inherently defective and that Union law must, by revising the directive on the posting of workers, make it clear that the Union's economic freedoms, freedom of establishment, cannot stand in the way of fundamental workers' rights, the right to collective bargaining, rights on pay, the right to strike in defence of their interests, if need be."
"So we want the revision of this directive to be placed on the agenda and we want a social safeguard clause guaranteeing that in future no directive, no Union policy, no treaty principle can be applied to the detriment of workers' rights; so that where one country has a higher standard of workers' rights than another, that higher standard can never again be lowered by invocation of the country of origin principle, as we saw with the first version of the services directive - the Bolkestein directive."
"Secondly, Mr Bertrand tells us that social services of general interest, operations in the general interest, should be encouraged for the wellbeing of our social model."
"But we have had no proposal for a directive on services of general economic interest."
"We cannot properly protect social services of general interest and implement Article 14 of the Lisbon Treaty, which provides the legal base for such services to be commissioned and funded, unless the Council puts a request to the Commission and unless the Commission uses its right of initiative so that we can at last talk about a legal framework that will protect public service operations, guarantee the independence of local authorities in the local services they provide and give us the assurance that future Court of Justice rulings will not threaten this fundamental feature of the European social model, so that people feel, not as Mr Schulz said, that Europe works against their social model but on the contrary that the Commission and the other European institutions work to safeguard it."
"(FR) Mr President, the Commission may have carried out a slick public relations exercise with its 'package' presentation of texts which are very different in nature and quality, but ultimately it has exercised its right of initiative on matters of major importance."
"It is moving in the right direction and we should applaud that."
"So the ball is back in our court and above all perhaps in the Council's."
"Everyone knows that Parliament will be quite tough and will look to produce innovative texts that reflect the needs of Europe's citizens."
"Will the same be true of the Council?"
"It is perhaps doubtful, as we know."
"I hope they will listen to you, Minister."
"Bombastic talk that produces only ambiguous and non-binding texts seriously undermines the credibility of the work we do."
"Let us take three examples among many."
"I have long been one of those calling for an overall directive against all forms of discrimination."
"For that we should take as the basis the Lynne report of May 2008, which is far more ambitious than the Commission proposal."
"Second example: works councils."
"We shall take care to ensure that the text clarifies their international powers and responsibilities."
"Consultation of the social partners is increasingly crucial in the case of restructuring operations by concerns which operate in more than one EU country."
"We shall make sure that the workforce is consulted in advance of any restructuring and that works councils are able to give their views on matters which are often highly technical."
"Third example: social services of general interest."
"We have wasted enough time here."
"Operatives in this field are confused."
"There is huge legal uncertainty, damaging the quality of services that are essential to cohesion in our societies."
"And here we are, about to waste another year."
"It is irresponsible."
"To me this is proof that the Commission's work, which appears to cover a broad sweep of areas of activity, is not good enough because it knowingly disregards certain essential points."
"I will end by insisting that the social package should be just one step along the way."
"I am convinced that the open coordination method has gone as far as it can in some areas."
"We must resolve to go for more cooperation but also more harmonisation, wherever possible."
"(PL) Mr President, the Council representative called for a more social Europe."
"I would respond to the Minister with a call for more common sense."
"That would be better."
"The European Union can of course propose a great deal, but it must be stressed that social policy is an area in which Member States have sovereign powers of decision."
"In short, what we need is less rhetoric and more concrete action."
"The European Union is proposing as many as 19 interesting initiatives, of which only three are legislative proposals."
"What is perhaps the most important proposal, that on cross-border health care, will not be discussed today."
"That is very regrettable, and it is a pity that the discussion will have to wait until the French Minister of Health shows up at our sitting."
"In conclusion, it must be stressed that EU Member States allocate as much as 27% of their GNP to social policy, compared to 15% in the USA."
"The question is whether the money is well spent."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to have taken the 'no' vote in Ireland, the victory of the opponents of a communal Europe, to shake the Commission out of its lethargy."
"The fact is that the Commission has long been distancing itself from the interests of the Union's citizens by pursuing its neo-liberal policy."
"The demand for a more socially responsible Europe has long been on the agenda."
"It is downright embarrassing to see the omissions of past years finally being piled on the table at the end of this term of office."
"I also find it brass-necked that the whole thing is being sold to us under the fanciful title of a new social agenda."
"The issues under discussion in July should have been dealt with long ago."
"When we examine their substance, it seems as though the Commission has not yet learned its lesson after all."
"Apart from two exceptions, today's proposals say nothing of solidarity, equal opportunities, social balance or public participation."
"On the contrary, they are largely another product of a basic neo-liberal attitude."
"The Commission calls for more mobility of labour."
"At the same time, it is seeking court judgments that would reduce the protection of posted workers."
"As an afterthought it says that we shall resolve the problem in a forum."
"Workers, however, need protection, not a forum."
"Do you really believe it will help people who are being deprived of their wages every day if you tell them to wait until you have discussed their problems in some forum?"
"Moreover, Commissioner, the amended Works Council Directive, which is nine years overdue, does not deliver on your promises."
"Parliament will have to make numerous improvements to this draft."
"For example, there is no provision at all for sanction mechanisms."
"Let us move on, though, to the subject of solidarity."
"The Health Directive ignores criticism by opening the door to more market-driven health services, thereby undermining the principle of solidarity in the Member States' welfare systems."
"It jeopardises solidarity instead of bolstering it."
"There are few components of this package that truly reflect people's desire for a progressive European social policy."
"One that I should like to highlight is the new directive against discrimination outside the workplace."
"This instrument, however, was first announced in 2004, and parliamentary pressure is the only reason why the Commission has finally presented it."
"It is clear that a majority of Parliament will support this directive too."
"It will likewise need improving in many places, however, especially as regards the rights of people with disabilities."
"On the whole, the name 'social package' is quite simply a misrepresentation."
"In my opinion, the Commission's record on social policy tells a sorry tale."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, in recent years your policy, the fundamentalism of the marketplace, has dangerously increased inequalities and eroded the welfare state."
"The package you have presented to us with fine words is but an empty tunic."
"Of the 19 proposals only 3 are of a legislative nature and one of these, the proposal for cross-border health services, introduces the Bolkestein directive by stealth, since it adopts a neoliberal stance."
"While you utter these fine words in presenting this empty tunic, the Sarkozy government is playing a key role in the Council by passing a deplorable directive on working hours."
"This constitutes a major social regression."
"Rather than try to create a good impression with your fine words and keep an eye on the Euro elections, which are looking awkward since the Irish 'no' vote, you would do better to propose specific measures and allocate revenues from the Community budget."
"A word to Mr Schulz, too, if he is listening to me."
"It is true that right-wing governments have contributed much to the demolition of the European social model."
"In several countries, Mr Schulz, as in your country, Germany, or in the Netherlands or Austria, they have teamed up with the Social Democrats to destroy the European social model."
"(DA) Mr President, I would like to use my speaking time today to focus on the health policy agenda."
"The current proposal for the Directive on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare has been improved significantly in relation to the original proposal."
"However, unfortunately no change has been made in connection with the fundamental grounds for all matters that fall under the internal market."
"Consideration for the free market always wins over consideration for the people."
"It goes without saying that we all want to be able to receive the best treatment as quickly as possible if we become seriously ill."
"Unfortunately, the directive does not in any way ensure that this will be the case."
"It ensures that the wealthiest patients from the wealthiest countries in the EU will receive the best possible treatment."
"This means that there is a great risk of patients becoming divided into a group A and a group B. The patients with the most resources will have the opportunity to seek the best treatment in other countries, whereas those without funds or power will not have this opportunity."
"The directive secures an entitlement to treatment in another country at the cost of that same treatment in the patient's home country."
"This also creates the risk of having A and B countries."
"The cost of the same treatment will naturally vary from country to country."
"The current directive allows market conditions to determine the outcome, but this is a high-risk approach."
"When the market reacts, the losers will always be those who cannot cope under the prevailing market conditions."
"(DE) Mr President, in my view, a European response to constant waves of price rises and increasing poverty is long overdue, and indeed it is gratifying that the new draft EU-wide social package makes a start in the right direction."
"The intention to facilitate access to health care in other European countries, for example, is to be welcomed."
"In practice, holidaymakers, for instance, are all too often shamelessly exploited today, being presented with doctors' bills for which they are only partly reimbursed, if at all, when they go back home."
"Conversely, individual Member States owe each other millions of euros - mere declarations of intent are not enough in such cases."
"Nor is it sufficient to beat the drum for causes such as a better balance between family and working life."
"So that more people can afford to have children, it is essential to act against wage dumping and social dumping - a task which, sad to say, is being largely neglected."
"It is a travesty that the EU decrees, on the one hand, that public contracts must be put out to public tender and that the clause requiring successful tenderers to pay at least the statutory minimum wage is then revoked by the European Court of Justice on the grounds of incompatibility with the directives on services in the internal market and on the posting of workers."
"In this the EU has shown its true colours as a purely economic community that fobs off the socially underprivileged with peanuts and empty words."
"Empty catchphrases can no longer pacify the citizens of the EU, nor can they cushion the impact of a falling birth rate and increasing poverty."
"Maybe you can say what you like on paper, but people are undoubtedly tired of empty promises."
"Mr President, let me start by thanking Martin Schulz for reminding everybody that the centre-right is the largest grouping in this Parliament, that the centre-right has the largest number of Commissioners and, indeed, that the centre-right has the largest number of governments in the EU Member States."
"I would remind him in turn that there is a reason for that: the reason is that it is what the people have decided."
"The people have decided this because they have recognised the growing gulf between the rhetoric of the left and the reality, and they have rejected it."
"I would also remind him, as a good democrat, to remember that the people are, of course, always right."
"Turning to the social package in general, on our side we welcome the thoughtful comments of the Commissioner and his initiative regarding the revised Social Agenda, in particular the theme which reminds all of us that the EU is about people, about giving people more and better opportunities, and in particular equipping and empowering them to cope with the challenge of change."
"I would just like to pick up three points very briefly from the excellent contribution from my colleague, Joseph Daul."
"One is the important role here of the Member States, of subsidiarity."
"Many Member States have different approaches, but all of them should take heart from the themes and the direction that he has outlined."
"The second point is about the importance of jobs."
"Harlem Désir talked very appropriately about the rights of workers."
"We respect the importance of the rights of workers, but my political group would also highlight the rights of non-workers - those people who currently do not have a job, who have been frozen out of the job market for whatever reason, and who want to have a job."
"They are increasingly important, especially in these difficult times of global credit crunch where unemployment is likely to get worse before it gets better."
"So we have to make certain that everything that we do helps the creation of jobs and helps more individuals into those jobs."
"The third point concerns small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which he also mentions."
"I noted in yesterday's Financial Times that there was a reference to the agreement within the UK regarding temporary workers, and the SMEs said that they had not even been consulted about that."
"The point I would make is not a UK point, but there is a genuine problem - and I say this to the Commissioner - of really involving SMEs in the consultation process, because SMEs are not only the largest number of employers but they also have the largest number of employees."
"We know from the problem of referenda - on the Lisbon Treaty, for example - that if you try to impose something from the top, it does not work: you have to connect with the people, and more people work for SMEs."
"Finally, concerning European works councils - to which both the Commissioner and the President-in-Office have referred, and on which I am rapporteur - certainly my political group will recognise the reality that there has been welcome agreement from the social partners."
"I personally do not like the agreement very much, but I absolutely welcome the fact that there is an agreement and I believe we in Parliament should try to build on that, as we will also try to build on the agreement regarding working time and temporary workers; we wish to move fast, because we want to deliver real social progress rather than just make pretty political speeches with an eye to the next election."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"The Commission's preliminary announcement of the social package filled the Social Democratic parties and citizens who feel responsible for resolving social problems with hope."
"Accumulated debts and the series of questions that have just been asked have given an almost surprising picture of how little we have progressed despite our efforts and how many unsolved problems there are."
"It is a fact that the economic growth of the last fifteen years has not closed the gap between rich and poor, but has actually widened it."
"However, the rivalry of poverty has taken on a new dimension."
"Every country has its poor people, and the amount and quality of poverty is different in individual Member States, but we know that it hurts in the same way."
"However many of the eighteen or so documents indicated in the social roadmap are drafted, the identification of European citizens with the Union can only be reinforced by what is specific and obvious and offers the opportunity for common progress instead of reciprocal tension between rival poverties."
"I am pleased that, after many requests from the Council and the European Parliament, the Commission has prepared an assessment of the situation of Roma and of the practices relating to them."
"Unfortunately, however, it does not outline the framework of a long-term Roma policy."
"Another question is whether this document does enough to exhort to concrete action, whether it holds out the prospect of an accurate assessment or of Member States failing to take steps and deviating from the desired practice."
"I feel that the proper resolution is lacking."
"We are also pleased about the anti-discrimination directive."
"The Parliament and the Commission were divided about having to regulate the prohibition of discrimination in a comprehensive directive, and in accordance with the social-liberal viewpoint we ultimately failed to classify the groups that are discriminated against."
"We can expect the directive to enable the comprehensive protection of people and groups who are threatened in many ways."
"There is a very great need for this, since hate-mongers, racists and those who want to give only to the worthy may also find supporters among the rival poor."
"Voters are always right, but they may be misled by populism."
"Thank you."
"(FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a member and also Chairman of the Civil Liberties Committee, I shall confine myself to the proposal for an anti-discrimination directive."
"First of all we congratulate you, Commissioner, on finally getting the Commission to adopt a proposal for a directive which seeks to counter discrimination based on religion, belief, disability, age and sexual orientation."
"Until recently we were afraid - as you know, we were anxious and we made our anxiety known - that you might limit yourselves to a mini-directive dealing only with discrimination based on age and disability."
"You will not be surprised to learn that I find it unfortunate, on a matter as fundamental as this, that the European Parliament is merely to be 'consulted', but my distinct impression is that the Presidency is amenable to any proposals or suggestions which the European Parliament might make."
"So we shall get to work straight away, Commissioner, and I myself can see three aspects of the text which we shall try to improve."
"Firstly we need to be more precise on a number of concepts or the demarcation between some of them."
"I am thinking of the area of 'objectively justified' differences in treatment."
"I have no quarrel with these, obviously, but these objectively justified differences in treatment must not be allowed to metamorphose directly or indirectly into discrimination."
"That can happen very quickly."
"Secondly, the directive must not be stripped of its substance by the overhasty inclusion of notions like public safety or public order, as I think is currently happening in one big country in the south of the European Union, which shall remain nameless."
"Thirdly, we must try harder on the question of sanctions."
"When you write in Article 14 'Member States shall lay down the rules on sanctions applicable to breaches of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive', Commissioner, that does not get us very far."
"In short, I trust that this directive, the repository of so much expectation, does not turn out in reality to be a big mini-directive, big on principles but very small on details."
"(PL) Mr President, economic growth should serve to improve the material situation of our societies."
"However, in putting comfort and security first, we are liable to forget that the social model of the economy means in practice greater bureaucracy."
"If we also forget that the surest foundation for social policy is economic growth, we may lose ourselves in fine-sounding slogans that have no connection with reality and may also, like the provisions on non-discrimination, breach the principles of subsidiarity and common sense."
"How can we break the vicious circle?"
"The new social agenda is only a partial answer to this challenge."
"It talks too much about rights and privileges and too little about the fact that they cannot be guaranteed without a well-organised effort and responsibility for the economic effects at each stage."
"From each according to his means, to each according to his needs."
"That is a utopia that is bound to result in a shortage of goods and services of suitable quality."
"Mr President, following on from my colleagues I would like to speak about the fight against discrimination."
"First of all I would like to thank the Commission for its courage in coming with a horizontal approach in the draft directive on equal treatment outside the workplace."
"We have to take into account that some Member States keep blocking the adoption of this necessary document."
"Nevertheless, there is room for the European Parliament to make improvements."
"I do not understand why there is an opt-out for private persons as regards supply of goods and services."
"The existing Race Directive does not include such an opt-out."
"Unfortunately, multiple discrimination is also not appropriately addressed in this draft, so I hope that we will all work on this directive further."
"(FR) Mr President, 51 years into their lifetime, the EU institutions are only now discovering the social dimension."
"The discovery is only relative, because social concerns are conspicuously absent from the French Presidency's priorities; it is disturbing to institutions so close to the world of business and which confuse the general interest of the peoples of the Union with the private interests of money markets, and it is a discovery inescapably prompted by the Irish, Dutch and French 'no' votes and the many social movements supporting wage demands in the Union."
"Yes, the Commission and most of this House find themselves obliged to recognise that the Union is populated not only by shareholders and consumers, but also by the workforce, whose labour creates Europe's wealth."
"As a result the Commission finds itself obliged to dig out and dust off the directive on European works councils: this was a worthy initiative but its substance is poor."
"European works councils must be made into a genuine forum for social democracy, giving employees the power of action they need to influence the strategy choices of their employers."
"Yes, Europe urgently needs true social democracy to prevent bad moves such as raising working time to almost 70 hours a week."
"So for the sake of the workers, let us move faster, much faster."
"(SV) Mr President, at this sitting we will be debating the renewed social agenda, the millennium goals and much else besides."
"In a couple of hours we will vote on cultural programmes, the labelling of organic products, and requirements for harmonising taxation, all issues in which the Union should not involve itself at all."
"This concentration of political power means that the distance between those governing and those governed increases."
"Indignation is rising among citizens."
"The establishment is forced to take increasingly tough measures to ride roughshod over the will of the people."
"It would be far better to produce a report about what we mean by the term subsidiarity and have a thorough debate about that."
"We should do that before we try to regulate centrally how the social partners should behave in 27 different countries."
"In my own country there is great anger over the fact that the EU and its judges can take the liberty of controlling the establishment of a labour market system other than the one which has grown up amid considerable national unity over the past 70 years."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the proposed directive on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment, which prohibits any kind of discrimination outside the workplace, is a superfluous regulation which we should not discuss at all."
"I should like to point out that discrimination is already prohibited by three EU directives, the UN Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities."
"Equal treatment is also governed by the Amsterdam Treaty and the Lisbon Strategy."
"I should also like to point out that the directive requires two very dangerous things."
"It requires positive discrimination and it requires the principle of transferring the burden of proof from the prosecutor to the defendant."
"This is contrary to European legal traditions and may give rise to injustices and new wrongs."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that the European Union is still a democratic and civilised area, where people with real abilities receive recognition, and an area which offers a helping hand to the weak."
"However, human capabilities, either innate or developed through education, are individual and different in every person and thus logically unequal."
"If we try to eliminate inequalities of this type through regulation, then we are arrogantly overlooking cultural diversity and interfering with the natural development of society, and worst of all, we are putting equality above the freedom of choice."
"The directive on equal treatment should therefore not come into being at all."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, this social package will only be able to bear fruit and be effective if we are able to agree the substance of the key initiatives."
"It is obvious that unemployment is the greatest of all social ills which we must combat."
"It is what most destabilises a society and is at the root of other, lesser evils."
"Therefore, the best social policy is one which helps create jobs."
"We must move right away from the false dilemma between solidarity and competitiveness because they are not incompatible."
"However, in order to construct a healthy, effective social policy and eradicate poverty, we need growth and stability."
"Therefore our social model needs to come to terms with the new reality."
"Globalisation also brings opportunities: those who adapt come out as winners, those who do not as losers."
"Europe is facing neither a classic crisis of growth nor cyclical problems but profound changes; the welfare of future generations depends on our wisdom to take good decisions today."
"Population ageing and demographic decline have already reached Europe; they are not a threat but a reality: closing our eyes to them will not help at all."
"What answers can we give today to the many consequences of the trend?"
"Very few."
"For example, we do not have the tools or the incentives to make flexible, planned retirement possible which will allow our people to work beyond the average age at which people leave the labour market."
"Achievement of a uniform level of protection against discrimination and exclusion is crucial but the mass of European legislation does not guarantee that discrimination has been eradicated; accordingly, work to eradicate these bad social practices needs to start in schools."
"School failure and drop-out rates are a tragedy of our times and may well be for the future."
"We have much riding on this area; this is where we have to focus our minds, focus the added value the Union can bring, to end the situation and put a stop to it."
"In short, ladies and gentlemen, we do not need to abandon our social model, but renew it, giving it greater flexibility, greater mobility and greater security so that the most vulnerable are not left by the wayside."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Špidla for the fact that we have a social package at all because, as I have said many times before, his task in the Barroso Commission cannot be easy."
"The package itself actually illustrates the tensions inside the Barroso Commission, between those, on the one hand, who want to stick to the neoliberal agenda come hell or high water, and those on the other who see an urgent need to make Europe matter to its citizens."
"Our people need to be assured that Europe is part of the solution, and not part of the problem, when it comes to tackling the issues raised by globalisation, demographic change, climate change and other global challenges."
"If that is what we need to do, I am sad to say that this package simply is not up to the task."
"It is a grudging package of too little, too late."
"Even the good elements are spoiled by the knowledge of just how grudgingly they were included. The horizontal directive to combat discrimination is a good example."
"It is in the package, but we all know just how bitterly President Barroso opposed its inclusion, right up to the 11th hour."
"The European works council directive proposal is another example."
"The content is extremely weak when compared to the earlier communication from the Commission to the social partners."
"I think that the neoliberal forces in the Commission and their allies here need to wake up and recognise the reality we face."
"Many millions of our citizens are living in fear, poverty and exclusion, and more and more have joined them during the Barroso years."
"All in all, I see this as a belated attempt by President Barroso to persuade the Left here that he has a social conscience, and that he is worthy of support for a second term as Commission President."
"Well I am not fooled, and many of my colleagues are not fooled either."
"As I have said, it is much too little and much too late - much too late, in fact, to guarantee safe passage of the sparse worthwhile elements before the election next year."
"President Barroso is insulting the intelligence not only of the Left in this House but also of the millions of citizens out there who deserve better."
"Mr President, the Commission's first year report on the European Globalisation Fund states that over 13 000 redundant employees in eight Member States are being helped."
"3.7% of available funds have been distributed."
"Obviously it is very slow."
"The Commission's suggestions are to simplify procedures, broadly promote the programme, spread best experience and expand the duration of assistance, and I welcome these measures."
"The fund was established to show solidarity with the redundant employees of companies failing due to globalisation."
"Therefore it is most important that these funds reach real people who need help."
"They shall not be distributed among intermediaries, trainers or brochure publishers."
"In one year we will find out what the actual results are."
"It is not how much money has been distributed, but how many redundant employees found new jobs."
"I call on the Commission and Member States to establish proper criteria and benchmarks in order to evaluate the results achieved."
"We must ensure efficient use of the European budget."
"(PL) Mr President, I am pleased to see that the new social agenda includes the revision of the directive on European Works Councils in the package of future activities."
"We recently debated the problems caused by the lack of precision in the provisions of the directive, whose purpose was to ensure employees' rights to information and consultation."
"The directive on part-time work and combating poverty among workers in full-time employment is also exceptionally important."
"I am hopeful about the emphasis on the situation of young people, their access to education and health care, and prevention of their exclusion."
"The professional mobility of future workers is their chance in life, but it is also a chance for the economy."
"The emphasis on the protection of patients' rights is a fundamental requirement in the protection of public health provision."
"However, the green paper on health sector employees which we are awaiting will be important for the implementation of these measures."
"(PT) Mr President, this so-called social package merely sows illusions regarding the seriousness of the social inequalities affecting the 80 million or so people who live in poverty, including the ever-increasing millions of poorly paid workers with insecure jobs and the millions of unemployed, while the scandalous profits of economic and financial groups and multinational relocations continue."
"The real causes of this situation have been overlooked - the perpetuation of the neoliberal policies the proposed health services directive would intensify, the job flexibility the working time proposals would exacerbate, and the attack on public services and production sectors strategic to development."
"We therefore call for a genuine social package that rejects the new proposed working time directive, promotes a reduction in the working day without loss of pay, revokes the stability pact and the liberal Lisbon Strategy, changes the European Central Bank's criteria and false independence, creates an employment and social progress pact as an alternative, promotes investment and support for micro and small enterprises and public services, and respects the dignity of working people."
"Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, 'people are those who determine the value of things': so said the ancient Greeks."
"Thus if people take responsibility for implementing this package presented to us today, if they can harmonise the old measures and proposals with the new, then these people will in fact not be used as resources, but will be active agents as employers, employees, the unemployed, those engaged in small and large businesses, men and women, the young and the elderly."
"There will be no discrimination in the EU over democracy and subsidiarity, no jingoistic verbiage about who is in power, or about right- or left-wing affiliations, as has been heard here."
"Next to me is my colleague Mr Őry, who tells me that in his country the socialist government is fighting against social benefits."
"We cannot therefore blame the global crisis; we must see things positively."
"We must face our own, demographic crisis, in the best possible way."
"Let us remember the old commitments, the Barcelona decisions on the harmonisation of family and professional life, the European Alliance for Families, the European Youth Pact, the common immigration policy and the enhancement of mobility in education and training for job mobility."
"There must be respect for the diversity, traditions and language of migrant employees."
"Social discrimination has to be opposed, and the rights of the weak and disadvantaged, and of children, have to be upheld as we in the European Union have championed them."
"Poverty must be fought, so we shall devote the year 2010 to the struggle."
"We must strengthen the social and territorial cohesion of our regions through dialogue, goodwill and transparency in the use of financial mechanisms."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, I add my voice to those of my fellow Members who view this agenda as a step forward, albeit a very modest one which is clearly very far removed from the needs facing us today in Europe."
"Therefore, Commissioner, I regret to say that you were wrong to state a moment ago that this agenda dispels public concerns."
"The public are concerned and with very good reason when faced with a European Union which does not resolve the basic problems they worry about every day."
"The agenda has a very grand title, the agenda for the 21st century."
"Regrettably it has one feature which has already been condemned: it is an internal commitment to the contradictions within Europe, with those of us who want more of Europe and those who would like there to be less of it; it is therefore a forest of empty rhetoric and a desert of specific content."
"Only three directives are being summarised by the European left, and in fairly critical terms."
"Are these Europe's ambitions for the 21st century?"
"No, Commissioner."
"Debating social problems is not only our ambition."
"The European Union, not just Europe, needs answers and it is very difficult for those answers to be achieved if, as the agenda states, they have to be found at national level."
"There are some answers at national level and there should be other answers at European Union level; the construction of the internal market should go hand in hand with rules which give it a human face, which prevent social dumping and which implement each and every one of the powers enshrined in the Treaties."
"It is all very well to debate the problems but it would be better to resolve them and not create new problems with measures such as the working time directive."
"Commissioner, Europe needs stronger initiatives;"
"Europe needs a much more go-getting agenda in order for it to be close to the public and I hope that at the next elections, and this is not an entirely rhetorical matter, the Europeans who are seeking other policies give European politicians a new, more social face."
"Mr President, I welcome the long-awaited proposal on completion of the anti-discrimination package, which means that we can finally end the hierarchy of rights."
"A European Union in which some Europeans are more equal than others has failed in its mission."
"I completely concur with the wise words of Gérard Deprez: the directive needs substantial improvement."
"It contains far too many escape clauses, which risk codifying existing discriminatory practices rather than ending them."
"Family law and public order are, and remain, a national competence, but in practice they are being used - or misused - as a pretext for discrimination, mainly against homosexuals."
"It is a shame that the Commission seems to be condoning this."
"Freedom of religion is a fundamental right and one that I will defend ferociously, but it is an individual right: it is not a collective right for certain groups that entitles them to discriminate and not apply the law."
"Finally, I would like to add that, ironically, this package seems to provide a higher level of protection against discrimination on all grounds apart from gender discrimination."
"The gap between the directive on gender discrimination and this directive will have to be closed."
"Mr President, the debate on the social package requires us to be critical, as, quite apart from the timing, which arouses suspicion about the hidden agenda, we also fundamentally disagree with its content."
"The package has arrived at a time of increasing reaction and popular displeasure with the social face of Europe."
"We are not the ones saying this; none other than EU data are painting a gloomy picture of the future: such is the prevailing mood among European citizens, especially young people, and it is constantly getting worse."
"Perhaps the package is aiming to restore citizens' trust before the Euro elections."
"We on the left cannot accept the contents of the package, since its legislative rules strengthen market liberalisation, as is the case with the proposed directive on cross-border health care, which is based on the previous Bolkestein proposals."
"At the same time, the Commission's proposal on cross-border health care is leading to class-based health segregation: the rich and educated are being given the option of shopping around for health care wherever it is in their best interests."
"A more social Europe needs a broader philosophy, not the announcement of measures that scratch at the surface of the problems involved and remain within the narrow confines of the EU's character today."
"(DE) Mr President, Europe is more than a common market."
"Besides being an economic entity, Europe is a community based on common values."
"I understand the European Union as a response to globalisation."
"In a globalised world, a certain social framework at European level provides essential protection."
"That is the idea behind the European social model, and it is an idea that I support."
"On the other hand, however, we must also succeed in international competition."
"In the Lisbon Strategy we emphasise our goal of developing the Union into the world's most competitive knowledge-based economic framework."
"To that end we must focus most of our attention on small and medium-sized businesses, for they are the pillar of economic development."
"We must also accept that it is legitimate to ask how our rules affect these firms."
"The anti-discrimination policy is a good example."
"It goes without saying that I am opposed to discrimination, but in my view, and in the view of another 261 Members of the European Parliament, a comprehensive framework directive is not the right way forward; in particular, it is not the right way to protect the victims."
"We shall achieve the exact opposite and are more likely to marginalise these people."
"A great deal of legal uncertainty has been created for the Member States and for European citizens."
"At the present time, numerous Treaty infringement proceedings are pending against 14 Member States for failure to implement the four existing directives."
"The first thing we should be doing is to implement the existing legislation before creating any new rules."
"A new anti-discrimination directive will simply not give us the clarity that Commissioner Špidla promised."
"The new rules raise many questions."
"Who, for example, can invoke the right to freedom from discrimination on grounds of religious or ideological beliefs?"
"Does that right extend to Scientologists or members of right-wing extremist groups?"
"Is every restaurant, however small, now required to have a wheelchair ramp in order to guarantee unhindered access?"
"The draft directive may provide for exemption from disproportionate measures, but how are such measures to be defined - by a national law or by a court ruling?"
"Imprecise, amorphous instruments like the framework directive are impractical and, most importantly, do not help victims."
"That is not the idea behind the European social model."
"It will not work like that."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, at the time I was rapporteur for the social action plan presented to us by Mrs Diamantopoulou and completed under the previous French Presidency under Mrs Aubry."
"What concerns me, ladies and gentlemen, is how European social ambitions have systematically crumbled away."
"To my mind there are clear political reasons for this."
"It is noticeable how the Commission always stresses that social policy must remain a national matter."
"Commissioner, the social package contains very interesting working documents and statements, but only four legislative initiatives."
"However welcome, that is certainly a very meagre result!"
"As if protecting social rights, creating a social level playing field, is no longer a European responsibility in the Europe of 27."
"Together with the EPP and the social organisations, we expect, on top of this social package, at least stronger legislation in regard to posting that protects social rights, better legislation to eliminate the wage gap between men and women, a framework law to protect social services and binding commitments in the fight against poverty."
"What we need is a real social pact, with a coherent vision and a serious commitment to a social Europe, so that at least we show citizens that Europe is more than just a market."
"I hope, Mr Bertrand, that we can for now count on the support of the French Presidency in this fight."
"Mr President, for years I have campaigned with others for comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation to outlaw discrimination in access to goods and services for disabled people and older people."
"I know that employment is covered on all grounds already, but for years we have been promised action and then nothing has happened."
"Today we can say that we are on the brink of achieving that legislation, not just covering age and disability but sexual orientation and religion, as I called for in my report."
"I would like to thank the Commission for bringing this forward and Commissioner Špidla in particular for his tenacity."
"We know that the proposed legislation is not perfect and we will want to see changes."
"It would also have been better if it had been subject to codecision."
"But, having said that, I am delighted to be able to stand here and say that we are at long last on our way to seeing all EU citizens treated as equals."
"Mr President, the so-called 'social package' that the European Commission has presented is a failed attempt to defuse the indignation the Commission's unpopular policy has aroused among employees."
"It fails to stem the rising tide of doubt about itself and the structure of the EU, as also expressed by the resounding Irish 'no' vote."
"Working-class people and the poor find themselves in the line of fire because of a long, harsh, anti-popular attack by the EU, which aims to increase the profitability of its own cartels."
"Working-class people and the poor have to put up with the deregulation and privatisation of public bodies and services of strategic importance, the complete breakdown of labour bargaining, the undermining of collective employment contracts, the widespread implementation of flexicurity, temporary flexible forms of employment and the extension of the Bolkestein directive to cover the health authorities sector."
"The Council has decided to partition working time into active and inactive segments."
"This obliges employees to work 65 to 77 hours a week."
"The institution of heavy and unhealthy labour is rendering hundreds of thousands of Greek workers useless."
"According to the formal statistical data from the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work - Mr President, please bear with me for a few moments, as the information I am about to impart is very important."
"Let me point out the following: according to the formal data, every 4½ seconds an employee has an accident and every 3½ minutes an employee loses his life."
"There are 7 million accidents every year..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by dealing with two points from the debate."
"Firstly, Europe is not governed by the Right, but by the Liberal Centre-Right."
"I must point out that we had a Social Democratic Government in my own country, and five million people were unemployed when it left office."
"Today we have three million unemployed, which means that two million people are back in work today."
"That is real social policy; that is social progress."
"Secondly, as a Member of this House, I personally feel angry when we ourselves speak so badly of our European ideal."
"Europe is a social project today."
"When I think that the single market is creating millions of jobs and is giving people prosperity and good prospects and that our cohesion policy, our European Social Fund, is providing us with billions to practise solidarity on a European scale, to be a model of European solidarity, I must urge everyone, in spite of all our problems, to refrain from denigrating our own project."
"I should like to devote special attention to the discrimination issue, because we are dealing with it in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Everyone rejects discrimination."
"It poisons our society, and Europe must set an example in the fight against discrimination."
"Everyone in this House, I hope, will endorse that view."
"Nevertheless, questions may be asked."
"Firstly, does the directive constitute a proportionate measure?"
"The issue of the burden on small businesses has already been addressed."
"Secondly, what about the implementation of the present legal provisions?"
"An evaluation has already been made on paper, but what is the position on the ground with regard to the application of the existing directives?"
"That question has to be asked before any new directives are created."
"Thirdly, do we really have gaps in European legislation?"
"Does Europe have sole responsibility for social policy?"
"All Member States of the EU are democracies, and they all have structures built on the rule of law."
"We must therefore ask whether there is any compelling need for Europe to be nicer, kindlier and more convincing in the realm of social policy."
"Can we not just rely for once on subsidiarity working and the Member States managing to cope with their own tasks in these fundamental areas of activity?"
"(PL) Mr President, social Europe is a splendid goal, and a great deal has already been done towards achieving it."
"Nevertheless, the existing inequalities and the new challenges facing the world create the risk of permanent social divisions in our societies at many levels: between children from rich and poor families, between the well and less well educated, between men and women, between immigrants and those who have been Europeans for generations, between persons of different sexual orientations, different ages or in different states of health."
"I could give many other examples."
"The struggle against inequality in and outside the workplace is a fundamental task for us."
"The European Union and the Member States must respond to real needs, create real opportunities and new hopes in the interests of all the citizens of Europe."
"The new package of Commission initiatives in the field of the European social model is a long overdue and incomplete supplement to activities undertaken at national level in the struggle to improve the standard of living of European citizens, reinforce their rights and combat discrimination."
"I am hopeful that the new directive on equal treatment, which as a socialist group we have long been demanding, will enable us to say we are really combating all forms of discrimination."
"Revision of the directive on European Works Councils, which is at present fulfilling its role as an instrument for social dialogue, is a positive element in the social package."
"We still have to contend with incomplete protection of workers in the drastic restructuring processes imposed by globalisation."
"Legislation on social policy is also of enormous importance for the political awakening of Europe and Europeans and the restoration of faith in a common project, especially in view of the institutional crisis and the imminent elections to the European Parliament."
"(FR) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, the long and lively debates we have had on the European Globalisation Fund ring in my ears to this day."
"Our fellow Member Mrs Bachelot, with whom I worked on this fund along with Mr Cottigny, persuaded us to take some extremely important decisions. And what do we see today?"
"Barely 4% of the aid budgeted for this European fund was distributed in 2007."
"You have already indicated, Commissioner, verbally and in writing, that you plan to revise the criteria."
"Is this revision of the criteria adequate to deal with the issues?"
"No, it is not!"
"When 96% of this aid is not being used, we really have to ask the basic question: is our aim in adopting this decision on the European globalisation fund appropriate?"
"We face demographic challenges, as you said, and we face many economic challenges, given the reality of globalisation, of technology."
"I urge you Commissioner, on this Globalisation Fund, not only to revise the criteria but also to look at the very purpose of what we are doing here."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot conceal my disappointment at the statements from the Council and the Commission."
"Many words were spoken about the European social model, and some of the Commission's proposals overshoot the mark, in my opinion - my fellow group members have made several points about the anti-discrimination directive."
"When it comes to the nuts and bolts of legislation designed to protect workers, however, the Council and the Commission bottle out."
"The President-in-Office did, however, refer to the compromise adopted in June on agency and other temporary work, but somehow or other - I believe it was out of shame - the Council and the Commission managed to adopt the Working Time Directive."
"What the Council adopted in June, I have to say, is by no means a glorious chapter in the history of Europe's social model."
"Before I entered Parliament, I was a doctor on the staff of a hospital, and I know that many salaried doctors and many other employees were initially pleased when the European Court of Justice ruled that time spent on call constituted working time."
"I also know, however, that there are difficulties in implementing this ruling and that time spent on call may have to be weighted on the basis of costs and frequency of call-outs."
"What the Council has done, however, in virtually reversing the ruling of the Court of Justice and even ignoring the improvements that the Commission's proposal had made to some aspects of the previous legal position is unacceptable."
"We need a compromise, and this Parliament pointed the way at first reading with proposals such as the use of a quotient."
"But if a doctor is on call in a hospital, for instance, and a patient with a life-threatening condition could arrive at any moment, that cannot be regarded as a rest period, which would be possible under the Council's compromise."
"This is another area where further improvement is needed, otherwise the whole debate on the European social model will serve no purpose."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, current economic and social circumstances call for a strengthened social Europe."
"Whereas 16% of today's European population is on the bread line, discrimination is still marked and generally widespread."
"Economic policies increasing unemployment, and insecurity, deepen citizens' crisis of confidence at the expense of Europe and its prospects."
"In this context, the renewed social agenda represents a step forward in the field of social legislation after a long period of inertia."
"Nevertheless, only three of the raft of proposals are legally binding while the rest are recommendations and non-legislative communications."
"We are therefore coming to the conclusion that the new social package will have a limited effect on the lives of European citizens."
"The intentions are good, as can be seen from the new draft directive against discrimination."
"This represents an important success for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, since it supported the proposal for a horizontal directive in order to end the hierarchical system of Community protection from discrimination."
"Nevertheless, the new social agenda appears to lack ambitious goals and clarity, and has serious shortcomings."
"For this reason, clear policy measures, a halt to rapidly increasing inequalities, and the improvement of living and working conditions are required."
"(HU) Mr President, the Commissioner summed up his expectations beautifully in his speech, but the documents available to us do not reflect that."
"There is a small, tiny semantic problem: discrimination must not be called the widening of opportunities."
"I have been speaking only about the segregation of Roma children for four years."
"In addition to this, half our children, several million Roma children, are classified as disabled."
"What is this, if not discrimination?"
"Omitting the topic of segregation when creating the Horizontal Directive is an unforgivable crime."
"Commissioner Barrot should be involved in the work too, and Parliament's demands should not be left out either!"
"We want, in at least four resolutions, a Roma integration package with legislation and a budget, and a group to coordinate the Committees in the interests of implementing any future programmes effectively."
"Commissioner Špidla cannot resolve this matter by himself."
"Thank you."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the document on the social package which has just been presented represents a major challenge for European development in the context of the Lisbon strategy, which European decision-makers adopted as the guideline for a worthwhile and unstoppable process aimed at integrating, modernising and developing our common home."
"The package contains measures in the areas of employment, social affairs, education, youth, health, the information society and economic affairs, all fundamental aspects which directly affect the daily lives of us all, as European citizens, and which must therefore be the subject of thorough, coordinated and above all transparent study."
"As a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like to emphasise the importance of and the need for this proposal which, in tackling the areas just mentioned, makes a comprehensive attempt to grasp, examine and resolve topics such as demographic change, globalisation and the importance of the human factor."
"I am pleased that the Commission intends to review Directives 92/85 and 96/39 in terms of maternity leave as this is a move to improve the quality of family life for all those women who, whilst caring for a family, have to face the world of work on a daily basis."
"I would like the Commission to answer a couple of questions in connection with the fight against poverty - and I am not talking here about third world poverty but about poverty within the boundaries of the Community - a problem which looms larger every year, affecting every single member of the European Community."
"In this connection I would like to ask: what specific methodology will the Commission employ in order to resolve a problem which year after year, as I said, is systematically afflicting the European economies and, as a result, impacting directly on the standard of living of millions of European citizens?"
"Secondly, I would like to know - and as a woman I feel directly involved in this matter - what action the Commission intends to take against the discrimination against women which still persists in society, even in 2008, especially in the field of employment and specifically as regards salaries?"
"What specific measures can be put in place to end this imbalance?"
"In conclusion, I would like to thank Commissioner Špidla for his work in drafting this document."
"I would like to thank the Council representatives and once again I would like to stress the importance of this social package in the context of the revised social agenda."
"(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Minister, Commissioner, as well as welcome proposals in the field of anti-discrimination and cross-border health care, the social agenda of the Commission contains the long-awaited proposal on European Works Councils."
"The Commission also opposes the review of the directive on posting, a directive that has come under fire after some very controversial judgments by the European Court of Justice."
"I want to touch briefly on both subjects."
"First of all, the rights of European workers to be informed and consulted."
"We all know what the problem is there."
"Too little compliance (only one of the three firms concerned has a European Works Council), information and advice rights are not sufficiently regulated and there is a lack of facilities."
"I very much regret that the Commission has not proposed a policy of penalties for non-compliance."
"In my view, too, the subsidiary provisions fall short of what is desirable and has been agreed in good models, namely several regular meetings a year, which can easily be arranged with the necessary training and support."
"One meeting a year is not much more than symbolic policy and social consultation in the undertaking is much too important for that."
"Secondly, the Secondment Directive."
"In the first restriction by the European Court in regard to the working conditions in force in a Member State, it still seemed to be about a policy change in European law, initiated by the Court, without the support of the European legislator."
"After the Luxembourg case, it is clear that the Commission too is deliberately bent on dismantling the principles contained in the directive."
"What was once intended as a directive to protect workers against exploitation and unfair competition in the cross-border supply of services has thus, thanks to the Court of Justice and the Commission, become a threat to the obligations applicable in a Member State in regard to the working conditions to be observed."
"The Commission needs to assume its legislative responsibility in this area again and make certain that in future Member States remain able to apply their generally applicable rules on employment law and collective agreements."
"(DE) Mr President, I merely have a list of questions to ask."
"Why so little so late?"
"Why did we declare last September that 2008 was to be the year of Social Europe but not regard social welfare as one of the priorities of the Council Presidency?"
"Why did the Right wage such a lengthy struggle against social rights in the Services Directive if they are portraying themselves today as true advocates of social justice?"
"Why did my committee vote in July against the Hamon report and in favour of the Handzlik report, the exact opposite of what has been stated here today?"
"Why have these things happened?"
"Please be honest and say what you are really doing instead of giving the public the opposite message."
"I simply must ask you to do that; it is really vital."
"But why do you pursue such policies?"
"Purely and simply because you on the Right have espoused the wrong philosophy."
"You assume that people are there to serve the economy."
"We Socialists take the opposite view, namely that the economy is there to serve the people, and we must fashion our policies accordingly."
"(RO) I was hoping these proposals would stimulate the reduction of social gaps between the European citizens."
"Unfortunately, the package only faces us with another gap, the one between good intentions and the necessary instruments for achieving them."
"This also happens where there is a European regulation requiring Member States to take action."
"An example is the wage discrimination against women in the labour market."
"There is legislation in this field, repeated commitments, yet without any improvement over the last eight years."
"Even supposing that employers had understood the economic advantages of correct payment and their legal obligations, difficulties are insurmountable."
"A system of non-discriminatory labour assessment to represent the common criterion for comparing different activities is missing."
"Without it, the principle of equal pay for work of equal value remains an illusion, as well as the reduction of the industry gap."
"Job classification systems are defective, if they exist."
"We already have Court decisions admitting that, by using physical work as a basis, they ignore various abilities required for labour and create discriminations."
"The method of open coordination has praiseworthy social objectives, but even the indicators measuring some of these objectives are missing from the list of common indicators."
"The conclusion is sad: the lack of interest in gender issues is equalled only by the lack of political will for effective common regulations in the labour market."
"(IT) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite all the analyses and studies, including those regarding the proper transposition of the anti-discrimination directives, the key elements are still effectiveness and innovation."
"How is it possible to draft the projected new so-called 'horizontal directive', which at the moment is nothing more than an extension beyond the workplace of protection in a number of areas, when the question of positive action is still being regarded in terms of safeguarding non-prohibited measures rather than seeking new measures?"
"There is a small - but too timid - sign of progress in the call for a renewed general commitment in this field, ending with the call for better application of instruments devoted to the Roma, as if invoking something which we have not managed to achieve."
"Are we just writing rhetoric?"
"In this context, I fear that we are!"
"For example, it seems pointless at this stage putting questions to the Commission and highlighting cases of discrimination or failures on the part of national or sub-national legislation."
"Too often, indeed almost always, the response merely refers to the existence of European protective legislation: fresh water, no progress, silence!"
"Nonetheless, we are debating the cardinal principal of equal treatment and I am referring to cross-border posted workers."
"Perhaps the new social agenda is a good exercise, but the package of proposed topics is more reminiscent of a puzzle, comprising cards not yet stacked at the end of a parliamentary term which has finalised a series of measures aimed at a genuinely innovatory project."
"Talking of discrimination and stereotypes, Minister, please thank your President for the tie."
"(CS) Mr President, in light of the fact that the words 'too little too late' have already been uttered many times when assessing the social package, I shall give my assessment: the mountain has given birth to a mouse."
"My question is: 'what have you been doing for four years?'"
"You have been putting forward socially unacceptable proposals, the culmination being the Working Time Directive so highly vaunted by the Council and the Commission."
"As a result, there is no option but to regard the proposed social package, despite some of its positive aspects, as propaganda aimed at attaching the label 'social' to the European Commission's letterhead."
"Most of the proposals need not be discussed at all, so it is nothing more than a flash in the pan."
"It is quite easy to proclaim that the common market is for the people and not the people for the market and that, if binding rules are to be laid down on the behaviour of companies in the market, then it is necessary to lay down minimum rules on the position of EU employees, a minimum wage set as a percentage of the average wage in all Member States, the same treatment and the same wages for employees working in countries other than their own."
"It is enough to declare that the Union upholds observance of the International Labour Organization conventions on maximum working time, freedom of trade union association and collective bargaining."
"Competition between Member States as to who has the lowest taxes and wages and the least transparency in the position of trade unions will happily continue and the open method of coordination is just another ineffective way of dealing with something that nobody wants to do."
"To those who criticise the French Presidency, I should like to say: 'Wait until the Czech Presidency."
"You ain't seen nothing yet.'"
"A few weeks ago, the President vetoed an act prohibiting discrimination, saying it was superfluous."
"(DE) Mr President, I feel compelled to say that this social agenda leaves me stone-cold."
"Not a single nettle has been firmly grasped."
"This surely cannot be a serious attempt to reform European works councils, since it makes no provision for more meetings or for sanction mechanisms in the event of infringements."
"The absence of any willingness to reform the Posting of Workers Directive is equally unacceptable."
"Commissioner, the lack of a clear position on working hours in a social agenda is further evidence that this Commission does not baulk at the idea of 65-hour working weeks either."
"This no longer bears any relation to the European social model to which my group aspires and which we Socialists are seeking to establish."
"May I also say to the Council that it is intolerable how you are putting management and labour organisations under pressure - to put it politely - over the European works councils."
"My group will not have any part in this charade."
"If Europe's labour force is not to turn its back completely on the European Union, we must afford it better protection from the effects of globalisation and waste no time in paving the way for cross-border collective wage agreements."
"(RO) I would like to raise for discussion some ideas regarding the legislative package in the Social-European agenda."
"I appreciate very much the European Commission's initiatives in this field and those presented in its communication named ""Improving competencies for the 21st century - European cooperation on schools.”"
"In addition to these initiatives, I would like to propose to the European Commission to launch a pilot project for creating a European scholarship for children in economically and geographically disfavoured regions."
"At European level, 19 million children and young people are subject to poverty and 6 million abandon high school every year."
"In Romania, for instance, according to a Eurobarometer study, young people in the rural environment and those in mountain or isolated regions have a 5% chance of attending higher education."
"This percentage is very far from the European Union's 85% objective of young people who have access to secondary university education."
"Member States lack the necessary financial means to remedy this worrying situation themselves."
"Consequently, the European Union should fight by any possible means, such as legislation, funds, European policies, to promote the opportunities and access of all young people to education."
"Mr President, the leader of the ALDE Group, Mr Watson, says that a job is the best social welfare."
"Unfortunately there are too many millions of people in Europe working for less than what they might get if they were drawing social welfare."
"The poor and the low-paid die younger, suffer more physical and mental illness, are hospitalised more, are imprisoned more, are excluded from participating fully in society, are denied full cultural, civil, social, and indeed secure lives, and their children are largely condemned to the same vicious cycle of deprivation - unless, that is, we as politicians pursue social and economic policies which are integrated and interdependent."
"People must be treated as citizens, not as economic units."
"Does this agenda achieve this?"
"Regretfully, no."
"This is not to deny the positive elements - for instance the horizontal directive on discrimination."
"Nor indeed do I deny that Commissioner Špidla has struggled hard in a hostile environment to get this package approved."
"We will work with him to make it better."
"The Commission and the Council have nine months to prove their bona fides on social Europe."
"The people will then give their verdict."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, we are today discussing very important issues of employment, social rights and health protection."
"All of this has a dimension in relation to the family, the basic unit of society."
"It also concerns those with disabilities, retired persons and pensioners, as well as the very painful problem of unemployment."
"Establishing a proper relationship between pay and work, together with dignified social security, is not some sort of favour."
"It is a duty imposed on us by our concern for the future of Europe."
"The funds allocated to social policy by the Member States must be better directed, as must the European Social Fund."
"Our continent is now ageing very quickly."
"But do we see the shortcomings of European policy on the family?"
"What do we have to say about family incomes?"
"Where is our solidarity with the poor?"
"I use the word solidarity advisedly at a time when we are celebrating the 28th anniversary of the establishment of the Solidarity movement and trade union, which contributed to the great changes that have taken place in Europe."
"(RO) I am glad that today we are discussing the relaunching of the social package."
"Europe needs social progress, Europe in general, with its old or new members."
"The united Europe is dealing with the same challenges: demographic ageing, loss of jobs from the perspective of globalization, poverty among children"
"Commissioner Špidla, I welcome your approach of the issue of solidarity between generations."
"We need a new stimulant in this matter, but I equally welcome the reiteration of the idea of solidarity between regions because it is here that we can measure most accurately social cohesion or its absence."
"(SV) Mr President, I apologise for my late arrival."
"I had a meeting in Sweden late last night and have only just arrived."
"I do not know what has been discussed already but let me start by saying that we naturally welcome the social package."
"We think that it is a little bit late and that it could have been launched earlier in the term, but at least we have got it now."
"It is clear that ambitions in the European Parliament are somewhat greater than those in the package, but I would nevertheless like to highlight three positive elements which we can work on."
"I personally work a great deal with the judgments of the European Court of Justice and their consequences."
"I welcome the more open attitude we are now seeing in the Commission, such as the forum which is now to be held."
"I hope it will be a success."
"Another positive thing is the ILO Convention, which is also linked to the judgments of the European Court of Justice, in that the Member States are urged to sign the ILO Convention."
"Thirdly, the social integration programme, which will be presented in October and the fight against poverty, exclusion, etc. I hope that we will be able to work on these issues successfully together."
"They are incredibly important."
"Mr President, if you have a market at European level - which we do, with the single European market - you of course need common rules for that common market so that it works fairly and efficiently, not least in the social field."
"That is why we set employment standards and employment law and rules to protect workers' rights - the Working Time Directive, health and safety legislation, the Parental Leave Directive, information and consultation of workers."
"Yet the British Conservative Party - and I see that there is not a single member of that party present in the Chamber to discuss this at the moment - wants the United Kingdom to opt out completely from the Social Chapter of the Treaty, should they ever come back to power in the United Kingdom."
"Do they think for one moment that the rest of the European Union would accept that one single Member State opts out of the obligations that we have jointly developed at European level to govern our market?"
"Do they really think that sort of unfair competition, by lowering health and safety standards and weakening the rights of workers, would be acceptable?"
"Of course it would not!"
"The British Conservatives are a recipe for disaster for Britain and for Europe."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, an impassioned debate, but a debate on social Europe, and the fact that we are having this debate is proof of a meeting of minds."
"Our debate also shows how hard it is, nowadays, to separate the consideration of social issues at Community level from policy debates at national level."
"It proves too, in a way, that we are making progress on European integration."
"Some people have levelled accusations at the Presidency."
"I shall not go into the detail of those accusations."
"I am not here to argue - like you, I am here to move social Europe forward."
"Is social Europe a priority for the French Presidency?"
"The question has been asked."
"The clear answer is yes, and, as you well know, on this we shall all be judged not by our aspirations at the outset, our initial ambitions, but purely by what we have achieved."
"We know now that there is a greater likelihood of achieving those results, results that are positive, and positive for social Europe."
"I am a firm believer in pragmatism."
"On these various subjects, then, as President Nicolas Sarkozy said in his address to Parliament - works councils, temporary work - we are committed to getting the first one finalised, whilst the second is currently in Parliament's hands, as I said."
"And, I say again, we shall all shortly have to stand up and be counted."
"I will not dwell on questions such as whether a conservative government might be more 'social' than another."
"I would just say that I myself, in France, am Minister for Labour Relations and Solidarity."
"Because if you want to share wealth, you first have to create it."
"And how do you create it?"
"Through labour."
"That is how you create wealth."
"Nor do I want to mention that back then, in 1993, when the famous working time directive was put forward, it was a French Socialist government and a Socialist minister - Mrs Aubry - who defended this directive and its opt-out."
"And what are we doing today about this famous directive?"
"Let us look at it realistically: does it or does it not represent an improvement on the current situation, where we are in a veritable no man's land after 48 hours?"
"Everyone knows it in all honesty."
"Only it is important to say that whilst this directive may not necessarily embody the initial 1993 idea, which was to get rid of the opt-out, it now provides a framework and additional guarantees for today's, not yesterday's situation."
"Can we say that?"
"Certainly we can, because I believe that public debate and political debate should be instructive."
"Either opt-outs continue, and are properly regulated, because we now know from the case-law to date that on-call time is a major issue."
"Or we can be pragmatic, take the view that it represents progress and accept a revision which will resolve some issues and improve the position, even though obviously today's outcome will not necessarily please everyone and I am well placed to appreciate that."
"Then there is the matter of the Court rulings."
"This is not about judging a judgment, far from it."
"But we need to look at today's situation in the light of the Court judgments."
"What is the new legal position?"
"And we need to hear the views of the states primarily affected."
"I have discussed this with my opposite numbers."
"The social partners must also give their views on the subject, and not necessarily separately."
"Together would be far better, so that we can draw our conclusions accordingly."
"As far as this is concerned the Presidency will bring no preconceived ideas to the debate."
"Should the directive be revised?"
"I have heard the question repeatedly and not only in this House."
"The answer to it should, I believe, come after the debate and not necessarily at the start of it."
"Otherwise that means one has preconceived ideas, and I do not."
"On the matter of social services of general interest, it seems to me that all Member States are keen to preserve the organisation of the general service remit that is specific to each individual country."
"But let's face it, there is disagreement as to what should be done at Community level."
"Some take the view that subsidiarity is the only answer, whilst others think there should be a Community legal framework."
"This, clearly, is not going to be decided in a hurry."
"Our proposal for a roadmap with the Commission is an attempt to ensure that these issues are addressed properly in line with the Union's timetable."
"Many other exciting topics have been raised."
"On action against discrimination, the Presidency has promised to move the new directive forward."
"Finalising this, as you know, requires unanimity of the Member States."
"On a number of occasions I have heard the word availability mentioned."
"That is most fitting, because efficacy requires availability."
"We have to be clear about this now."
"Is social Europe able to progress or not?"
"For me the answer is a resounding yes, and we must move social Europe forward."
"Are we not well into 2008?"
"We are, I agree."
"Is it too late?"
"Certainly not!"
"It is never too late."
"Have we the desire to move forward?"
"Obviously we do."
"But the question is this: are we going to move social Europe forward together?"
"Here, ladies and gentlemen, is where we must all stand up and be counted!"
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the depth and passion of the debate has clearly shown that a social Europe is on the march again."
"The debate has touched upon a whole series of detailed problems and I think that there is no need to respond to them individually, since there will be opportunities in future discussions to pursue the arguments and find an appropriate balance."
"Nevertheless, I should like to respond to certain things more generally."
"First of all, this agenda, since it is so wide-ranging, considers a social agenda and social policy to be a manifestation of a complex political approach and to be the consequence of a complex approach in a whole series of policies."
"It is clearly a mainstream concept, in no way a social policy pushed to the side, with a series of undoubtedly interesting and technical aspects, but nonetheless clearly marginalised."
"This agenda has put social policy at the heart of European politics."
"Of course, the question arises as to whether this agenda, and I think this should quite seriously be dismissed, is not simply of technical political interest."
"It is not, since the approach to it was formulated years ago."
"It is also included in a whole range of European Commission documents which have also been discussed by Parliament."
"It is not associated with any significant event, as the Irish referendum was, for example."
"This agenda shows, among other things, that the Commission has been decisive in designing the agenda as a procedure which attempts to use all the instruments available to the European Commission at European level, legislation, the open method of coordination and all other methods."
"It therefore contains not only legislative proposals, but also, of course, proposed communications and proposals for other documents."
"I wish to emphasise that this agenda is realistic within the options that can be influenced by the European Commission."
"The different proposals will undoubtedly be debated in Parliament and they will clearly be amended on many occasions but, nonetheless, they are real proposals which can be discussed."
"The debate also raised the thought, albeit only partially, and I think I should respond to it, that the proposals in the field of health care are some kind of back door into the Bolkestein directive in the field of health care."
"This is not the case."
"These proposals are not designed as the free provision of services, but will facilitate Europeans' access to health care."
"These proposals undoubtedly include a whole series of very delicate aspects and it is clear that they will be discussed seriously and in depth but, nevertheless, their basic trend and consequence will be an improvement in health care for European citizens."
"Another thought which I should like to emphasise is the idea of combating poverty."
"This idea of combating poverty is clearly formulated and the debate has brought out the question: 'by what methods?'"
"The agenda does not assume that there is just one effective method for combating poverty, but aims to attack poverty from different angles."
"Attempting to limit early school-leaving combats poverty."
"Attempting to open up access to life-long learning combats poverty."
"The clearly formulated intention that retirement systems should emphasise equity and social effectiveness also combats poverty."
"The issue of discrimination and the directives concerning anti-discrimination are also ways of combating poverty, since opening up access for people who are disabled, preventing discrimination against people who have grown old in service, and so on also combat poverty."
"The question also arose about equal opportunities for men and women."
"I should like to say that other directives cover equal opportunities for men and women and, in view of this, it was not essential to explicitly include equality between men and women in the proposed directive."
"There was also a debate in relation to ILO conventions."
"I should like to emphasise clearly that this agenda undoubtedly shows how strongly the Commission and Europe are engaged with the concept of decent work on a global level."
"Just like the directive which will implement the agreement between workers and employers in the maritime field, it is a clear indication of how Europe views the different ILO conventions."
"In all the documents, the European states are invited to ratify the entire collection as quickly as possible."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the debate was deep and, at times, tough."
"I think that it is a debate which indicates the significance of European social policy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the next part-session, somewhere in Europe."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (RO) Mr. President, following the conventional statements according to which 2008 shall be the year of relaunching social Europe, the so-called social package represents a set of legislative initiatives whose convergence remains in the phase of intention for the moment."
"Maybe the time has come for us to approach more firmly and diligently a set of matters whose direct impact on the citizens is greater than ever."
"Under these circumstances, we need to undertake the mission of ensuring non-discriminatory living and working conditions for all the Community citizens."
"First of all, in this context, resuming discussions on a Community minimum wage seems not only opportune but also necessary."
"Secondly, the same thing is also valid for creating unitary conditions in all the EU countries regarding the Community labour market."
"It is not right that, even today, the attitude of several EU governments toward the European citizens is differentiated according to their country of origin."
"In the same context, the Commission's initiative to improve the visibility and work methods under the EU Strategy on social integration and protection and to consolidate its interaction with other policies appears to be significant."
"I gladly took note of the Commission's proposal for a horizontal directive on combating discrimination in fields other than employment."
"in writing. - (HU) One of the most important results of the European Commission's renewed social policy agenda must be the restoration of the appropriate rights of European Roma as European citizens and the halting of their social exclusion."
"I am pleased that the document supports this."
"In the areas mentioned by the Agenda, the Roma are in a substantially worse situation than the majority of society in the areas of education, employment, living conditions, discrimination and health."
"Lifelong learning programmes that give Roma suitable skills for employment and self-employment could be a useful tool in the fight against unemployment."
"Anti-discrimination tools must be transplanted into national rights so that those who suffer from discrimination can turn to the courts, and the national authorities and equal opportunities bodies can recognise and impose sanctions for infringements."
"The Structural Funds could be much more effective in reducing the social exclusion of Roma but, in order to achieve this, at least the right of discussion has to be given to Roma NGOs in selecting, planning, implementing and evaluating projects that are financed by the Funds, and programmes to equip Roma NGOs for preparing the successful bids that are necessary must be started up."
"We hope that the Social Policy Agenda will be able to provide suitable answers to these questions."
"I feel it is important that we are able to discuss these topics at the large-scale Roma conference being organised on 16 September, and I hope that the question of social inclusion of the Roma will be put on the agenda of the European Council both separately and as part of the social agenda."
"in writing. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's social package is a long-awaited reform to the building of the Union's social dimension."
"Like many of my colleagues, however, I would like to have seen the Commission adopt a slightly bolder and more ambitious approach to its proposals and reforms."
"In my opinion, the package was especially wanting when it came to safeguarding basic public services."
"The package does, however, contain many good proposals."
"I would especially like to thank the Commission for deciding, after long deliberations, to draw up a horizontal anti-discriminatory directive that covers all grounds for discrimination."
"Citizens who encounter discrimination in different forms and for different reasons should not be treated unequally."
"The horizontal approach is the only real way of guaranteeing equal treatment for all."
"Furthermore, the proposal to strengthen the role of the European Works Councils is very welcome."
"The proposal for a directive on patients' rights in cross-border health care, which received relatively less publicity, will have a tangible impact on the ordinary lives of many Europeans."
"With European borders opening up and increased opportunities in the health care sector, it is especially important to clarify who is responsible for a patient's health and how far that responsibility extends."
"The Commission's proposal for a directive is a welcome clarification of pan-European rules."
"Despite its shortcomings, the package is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope that the Commission will continue its efforts to improve the feelings that European citizens have about social security in the years to come."
"In this connection, I would like to urge the Commission to get on with its plans to draft a directive on extending maternity leave from 14 to 18 weeks."
"May the directive become future practice as quickly as possible."
"I would like it, however, if the Commission's proposal were to focus in particular on extending parental leave and thus improve the rights and opportunities of both parents to stay at home after their child is born."
"in writing. - (ET) Martin Schultz is undoubtedly right to say that the social package could have been stronger."
"The Commission should have produced the package sooner so that we could have dealt with this important matter, not as the elections approach but sooner, when there was time to weigh up all the nuances of this important package carefully, and it is undoubtedly important."
"Among other things, I would like to pick out the Commission communication on the European Globalisation Fund."
"Although it has provided assistance to several thousand people in, for example, Germany, France, Portugal and Finland, the survey for 2007 shows that a fairly large proportion of the Fund was not used."
"Textile workers in Lithuania received compensation from the EGF in August."
"This is a good sign that the new Member States too can successfully seek assistance to help with the changes globalisation requires."
"The Commission will soon investigate the criteria on which decisions to grant assistance are based."
"I would like to stress that in small countries like Estonia many businesses have had to lay off hundreds of people because of globalisation."
"Simplifying the process of applying for EGF assistance would undoubtedly make it possible for assistance for those people to be simplified too."
"in writing. - (RO) The Treaty of Lisbon acknowledges the fact that the Union should rely on a social market economy that provides its citizens with access to decent work and life conditions, education, health and social protection services."
"The Union's population is getting older."
"If, in 2007, citizens over 65 years of age represented 17% of the Union's population, in 2030 this percentage will reach 24.6%."
"The latest Eurostat statistics show that, as of 2015, the number of deaths will exceed the number of births, thus leading to a decrease in the number of European citizens from 521 million in 2015 to 506 million in 2060."
"Under these circumstances, migration seems to remain the main population growth factor in the Union."
"Yet, migratory flows affect Member States differently."
"If, between 1985 and 2007, Ireland recorded a 21.8% population growth, in Bulgaria the population decreased by 14.4% during the same period."
"What are the solutions that the social package provides to these challenges?"
"The Union citizens are waiting for firm actions for the creation of well-paid jobs, the guarantee of access to quality education, health and social protection services."
"The social package represents the insurance policy for the future of the Union and it is essential for its long-term development."
"in writing. - There is no doubt that the European social model needs to be reformed."
"Especially, that the outdated welfare system still dominates in many of the larger Member States."
"Any talk of a European social model seems like a step in the wrong direction."
"No social agenda or social policy document published by the Commission is likely to promote real economic growth or job creation."
"With the US economic crisis swiftly appearing on the shores of our continent, our governments should react to make sure that our citizens feel as little of the negative impact of a recession as possible."
"EU bureaucracy will not stop an economic crisis or a recession."
"Member States should focus on liberalising their economies, lowering taxes and interest rates, and cutting red tape especially for small-businesses."
"Centralised intervention in the economy has always failed."
"The top-down measures proposed by the Commission might not only not help our citizens fend off unemployment but may actually hinder employment and economic growth."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.40 pending voting time and resumed at noon)"
"(BG) President, I would like to inform Parliament that in violation of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities, on July 30 I was arrested and beaten by the police, and I was also threatened that my throat would be slit."
"It is a shame that Parliament still has not voiced any opinion on this crime, which was committed against me. And I want to ask the colleagues who have gathered in this hall: ""What are you waiting for, colleagues, that my throat be slit open in actual fact?"
"That the threats be fulfilled and they kill me?”"
"A cruel injustice was perpetrated against a Member of the European Parliament and you remain silent."
"Thank you."
"Thank you for informing us of that, Mr Stoyanov."
"We will pass that on to the relevant body within the institution."
"1."
"Youth in Action programme (2007-2013) ("
"- Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, with regard to the four reports to be voted on, let me point out on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education that the multiannual programmes in the field of culture, education, youth and citizen participation in community activities are some of the most important activities of the EU and especially of the European Parliament."
"Decisions on the choice and funding of the different activities covered by these programmes ought thus to rely on clear and objective criteria."
"Simplified procedures should be adopted to avoid unnecessary delays for European citizens."
"The four comitology reports, which the European Parliament is being asked to adopt today in plenary, aim to ensure transparent, fast and effective procedures."
"This will simultaneously strengthen the European Parliament's role in this field of procedures."
"The fact that these parliamentary proposals have been accepted by both the Commission and the Council is particularly satisfying and gives hope for future interinstitutional agreement."
"Finally, I would like to thank the Commission, the Council under the Slovenian Presidency, and the current French Presidency for the spirit of cooperation and agreement and for the way they have managed these four Community programmes."

"I therefore thank my fellow Members, the representatives of the Council, the technical staff and everyone involved in this complex and difficult report."
"The framework decision will be very important for criminal justice in the EU."
"It promotes the principle of mutual recognition, ensures that the rights of the defence and guarantees of the accused are strengthened, makes the enforcement of decisions rendered in absentia quicker and more effective, and helps to combat crime in Europe."
"The future framework decision will also help to strengthen the primacy of the law and the rule of law, and promote European integration."

"The debate on the report has been cancelled owing to the debate on the situation in Georgia, which is an urgent and important matter."
"That is why I am speaking today."
"My report is mainly about the protection of the environment, hence I ask for your votes in support of it."
"I note that the Committee on Fisheries has voted unanimously."
"My report contains different proposals, four of which are particularly important."
"The first is the completion of the marine survey plan; second, the long-term plan but also continuing discussions, at which representatives of all professions, especially fishermen, participate."
"Thirdly, there is the possible formation of a central coordinating body, as there has been a lack of coordination between bodies in past years."
"Fourthly, a schedule should be set up because, since 2002, when there were similar talks, some actions have been taken without a defined timescale."
"I suggest that what we decide upon should take place according to a timed schedule."

"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(DE) Mr President, I was unable to give my explanation because of the noise level, and I would like to do that now."
"I voted for the Kaufmann report because of the need to make it clear that the European Judicial Network is a necessity, since it has functioned effectively over the last ten years in conjunction with the system of judicial assistance."
"It is now a matter of making a clear distinction between the Network and Eurojust."
"Both institutions have their justification."
"The aim is that Eurojust and the European Judicial Network should complement each other or cooperate, as appropriate, and thus guarantee security for the Member States."
"(DE) Mr President, with regard to the enforcement of judgments delivered in absentia, it is of no use to us in the European Union if we have excellent police cooperation on the one hand while on the other hand the system of criminal prosecution does not work as well as it could."
"In this respect, I believe our decision has closed a loophole."
"The mutual recognition of judgments by criminal prosecutors will mean that judgments in criminal cases, including those delivered in absentia, can be enforced in other countries."
"That is a vital step in enabling the judicial authorities to assist police forces in their work."
"(DE) Mr President, the aim of the Brejc report is to give us the means to ensure at long last that the Visa Information System is used and checked whenever nationals of non-EU countries enter the Schengen area."
"We know that many persons are illegally resident in the EU because their visas have expired or have been invalidated."
"Through this cooperation between the Schengen system and the Visa Information System, we are creating conditions in which we can eliminate visa abuses in the European Union and ensure that persons entering and leaving the European Union are legally entitled to do so."
"(NL) Mr President, of course I have no objection, like most people I assume, to improvements being made to the Schengen countries Visa Information System, but what we have here in this report is really too ridiculous for words."
"The Visa System was actually to be made more flexible because of waiting times at the borders!"
"Anyone who has ever travelled knows that there just have to be waiting lists and that these are sometimes necessary."
"I wonder what assessment could be made for border guards to decide when there is a danger and when there is not."
"Who knows where terrorist and other risks come from?"
"I also have no problem with us being all the more behind the times in this."
"The Europeanisation of our border controls has been done thoughtlessly, without preparation and under pressure from ideological extremists who consider the security of citizens to be less important than the great ideal of the new European Soviet Union."
"Mr President, I rise - as is becoming traditional on these occasions - to point out that the harmonisation of European policy in the fields of justice and home affairs has only the flimsiest of legal bases."
"Much in the reports on which we have just voted - the Kaufmann, França, Brejc, Weber and Lambert reports - is there to give force to aspects of policy, to initiatives and, in the case of Eurojust, to an entire institution, that have no proper legal mandate."
"It is true that such a mandate would have been provided by the European Constitution or Lisbon Treaty, but it is equally the case - as it seems periodically necessary to remind this Chamber - that the Constitution was rejected three times: by 55% of French voters, by 62% of Dutch voters and by 54% of Irish voters."
"The ability to have a monopoly on penal coercion via a criminal justice system is perhaps the supreme defining attribute of statehood."
"We can define a state as a territory with agreed rules enforced by a common authority."
"If the European Union wishes to give itself that supreme attribute of statehood, it should have the decency to ask its peoples' permission first in referendums."
"Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est!"
"(DE) Mr President, this report is about strengthening Eurojust."
"This is another set of instruments whose ultimate purpose is to intensify police cooperation and make it effective."
"It has become apparent that very many institutions are involved in judicial cooperation within a given country."
"Our proposal for the establishment of a coordination system within and between Member States therefore makes very good sense, simply because it guarantees efficient cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and other forms of organised crime."
"One particularly heartening measure I wish to highlight is that liaison magistrates are to be established in non-EU countries, similar to what we already have in the police framework, so that cooperation with those countries can then be improved accordingly."
"In short, this system will enable us to build another cordon sanitaire to protect the European Union."
"Mr President, may I begin by saying what a great pleasure it is to see you in the chair here in Brussels for a full plenary session."
"One small step for Mr McMillan-Scott; one giant leap, perhaps, for the European Parliament."
"Who knows?"
"Do not hold your breath."
"I rise in relation to the Lambert report - and also in relation to the Bowles report, if you are calling me on that."
"The Lambert report I find difficult to support."
"There are references in it to the idea of distributing illegal immigrants among the vast majority of EU countries, which I think is completely impractical."
"More important from the United Kingdom's point of view is the fact that, uniquely or semi-uniquely (because Cyprus is in the same position) we are an island."
"Therefore I think it is important for the United Kingdom to retain control of its own borders, controlled by the United Kingdom authorities not by the European Union which has large and leaky borders."
"Therefore I think the Lambert report is unacceptable on that basis."
"The Bowles report is unacceptable because, although it has some good intentions, it is effectively blaming tax havens for the high taxation many of us have to endure."
"But the reason why we endure high taxation - certainly in the United Kingdom - is because we have a Labour Government bent and determined to increase the tax take and burden the British people and the British taxpayer with it."
"The essence of high taxation is a national problem and should remain so, and governments nationally should take responsibility for it."
"It should not be a responsibility of the European Union."
"(NL) Mr President, the rapporteur, Mrs Lambert, is right when she says that the Dublin objectives for asylum shopping have never been achieved; quite the reverse, in fact."
"That is true."
"She is also right to say that the system unavoidably places an unreasonably heavy burden on the Member States on the borders of the European Union. That is also true."
"It is therefore a good thing that support for those States is being urged."
"On the other hand, I do think a number of important points are missing from the report and I do not agree at all with most of the assumptions and aims of the rapporteur; on the contrary."
"One example: the assessment by the Commission already stated that tens of thousands of asylum seekers go into hiding because of the Dublin system, and yet the rapporteur argues against detention."
"That cannot be more serious."
"The close cooperation between the European Member States on asylum might pay off, but in that case it is necessary to do away with a whole bunch of politically correct ideas that fill this report."
"(NL) Mr President, it is impossible to summarise all the problems with the Lambert report within one minute, so I shall confine myself to a couple of points."
"As regards the protection of children, the report states that, in the event of uncertainty as to age, children should be given the benefit of the doubt."
"Something like that sounds good, but in fact it is a direct invitation to even more fraud with identity papers."
"The report also states that the definition of a family member is too restrictive, which again is an open invitation to even more abuses."
"In Africa, for instance, more or less everybody is family to everybody and if we have to take that into account we might as well throw all the gates open immediately."
"The report also opposes access to the Eurodac database for police services and the law-enforcement agencies of the Member States because, I quote 'this would also increase the risk of asylum seekers being stigmatised'."
"That is a ridiculous idea, especially since Eurodac could contain a wealth of information in the fight against illegal immigration, international crime and terrorism."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Bowles report includes an examination of the problem of VAT fraud - and rightly so, for it runs to EUR 20 billion a year."
"I support the proposals on this matter."
"It is important to point out, however, that we need a change of system - structural reform - in this area."
"What we have been hearing from the Commission in this context has never been more than a statement of intent to step up intergovernmental cooperation in this matter and to engage in evaluation, research and so on."
"Given the volume of fraud that is taking place, it is high time the Commission abandoned its passive stance and supported the reformist Member States that actually intend to introduce this reverse-charge procedure."
"This is also a call to Mr Kovács to have an overdue rethink on this issue."
"I hope that we shall receive an appropriate proposal before this parliamentary term is over and that the proposals from the Austrian and German Governments will be endorsed."
"Mr President, I voted against the Bowles report."
"There are three points I would like to stress."
"First, the report calls for better tax and fiscal coordination."
"I suppose it to be harmful to tax competition, because tax competition is sound and fruitful."
"Second, the way to eliminate tax fraud is not through a reduction in competition but by the strict elimination of tax exemptions."
"Third, tax fraud in VAT should be eliminated by the unification of VAT rates, which will result in the fast reduction of exemptions and loopholes."
"The Bowles report offers different remedies."
"That is why I voted against."
"(FR) Mr President, as I said yesterday, I am against all types of fiscal fraud, and I asked the Commission and the Council to act expeditiously to remedy the disastrous effects of VAT evasion: losses have been estimated at EUR 20 billion per year, or nearly one fifth of the EU budget."
"I referred to a model developed by RTvat and presented by that organisation to this House which would reduce VAT evasion by approximately EUR 275 million per day and would reduce the administrative burden, particularly for SMEs."
"I think that the Commission should analyse these proposals, because models do exist."
"Naturally, there has to be the political will to adopt them."
"I was nonetheless unable to vote for the report because my Group's amendments - including the amendment stating that healthy tax competition will help to maintain and increase Member States' tax revenues and the amendment which opposes widening the scope of the Savings Tax Directive - were not adopted."
"However, we are clearly opposed to the widening of the Directive's scope to cover all legal entities and all sources of financial revenue."
"In this context, I believe that we must not forget that 'too much tax kills tax', and that those Member States which are in favour of such measures should be very vigilant because people in Macao, Singapore and Hong Kong are already rubbing their hands with glee at the prospect that we are moving in this direction."
"This is why I did not vote in favour of the report because I want this to be clear and precise."
"Mr President, I just wanted a word on the Bowles report, which was on a coordinated strategy to improve the fight against fiscal fraud."
"To read that, one would think it would be very difficult to be against the report or indeed any parts of it."
"The reality is that while I fully support a coordinated approach in the fight against fiscal fraud - and we do need serious examination and coordination in this area - any suggestion of tax approximation and/or a decrease in tax competition throughout the EU of 27 Member States as part of the solution in the fight against fiscal fraud is wholly unacceptable."
"I am not sure if Europe - as in the Commission - realises the damage that is being done in Member States by constant references to centralising, controlling or reducing Member State competence in the tax area in any way."
"It was a huge issue - albeit a non-issue in terms of relevance to the Lisbon Treaty - during the debate on our referendum on 12 June."
"Would that we could, but we could not dissuade those that feared Europe - as in the European institutions' wish to control tax centrally in varying degrees for varying reasons - that the Lisbon Treaty lent any support to that concept."
"Please be very wary of messing in this particular area."
"(NL) Mr President, I did not vote against the Kaufmann report, although I am not at all convinced that the Europeanisation of our judicial systems or the establishment of a European public prosecutor's office are necessarily the right way to improve the working of the police and justice or the punishment of even cross-border crime."
"Quite the opposite."
"However, I am urging very wide-ranging and closer cooperation between all sovereign European security services and in that respect I can largely support a number of recommendations, improvements in the Kaufmann report, improvements to the European Judicial Network."
"Nevertheless, all this must not result in an overpaid and arrogant European justice system that is cut off from the real world, such as we have seen in the past few months, meddling in a way that goes far beyond the necessary cooperation between sovereign Member States."
"For that second reason, therefore, I abstained from the final vote on the Kaufmann report."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the legislative resolution based on the report by Greek Member Katerina Batzeli, approving, at first reading under the codecision procedure, the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision No 1719/2006/EC establishing the Youth in Action programme for the period 2007 to 2013."
"I welcome and support the amendments which have replaced the advisory comitology procedure with an obligation on the Commission to inform the European Parliament and the Member States without delay about any measures taken for the implementation of the decision without the assistance of a committee, in order to allow selection decisions to be implemented more quickly and efficiently."
"in writing. - (IT) I voted in favour of Mrs Batzeli's report and I greatly welcome the substantial increase in the relative funds."
"The 'Youth in Action' programme has been an important instrument in recent years for involving the rising generation of our Union in the great European project: a vital link, therefore, for bringing the new generation closer to Europe and enabling them to take part in several really interesting political and cultural initiatives."
"The European Commission is doing the right thing in pursuing this route: as a young representative of this Parliament, and knowing the commitment and the aims of Mr Figel, I can safely be optimistic about the success of the new programme for 2007-2013."
"in writing. - I was very happy to vote in favour of this report, as I believe the Youth in Action programme is an excellent initiative."
"Schemes such as these will be vital in encouraging engagement between young people and Europe."
"This engagement is sorely needed."
"Time and again I hear from my constituents that the European Union does nothing for them."
"Without funding for civil society programmes, those who believe in the importance of the European project will have a hard time confronting criticism of democratic deficits and unresponsive institutions."
"And this negativity is particularly strong among the young."
"Whenever I visit schools in my constituency I am struck by their cynicism about the EU's role."
"A report such as this therefore represents a timely response to a pressing - and growing - problem."
"But the report has faced opposition from scaremongers who claim it will strengthen the Commission."
"What is clear is that all information provided will need to be objective if it is to be effective."
"Yet I would ask Members to question how strengthening civil society and the role of the young citizen could possibly give the Commission more power."
"in writing. - (SV) Culture is about fundamental long-term issues affecting nations and civilisations."
"For this reason, the June List considers that cultural policy should be run by politicians who are close to their citizens and should therefore predominantly be addressed at national level."
"We consider that cultural programmes have received far too generous appropriations in the EU's budget for a matter which in all essentials should be down to the Member States."
"We are generally in favour of more funds for culture, but we are against more funds being allocated by EU institutions which are far removed from the citizens."
"In the vote on today's four reports by Mrs Batzeli, we only had to reach an opinion on amendments of a more technical nature about the structure of the implementation of the programmes."
"However, we chose to vote against these reports in order to make it clear that we are opposed to such major cultural investments being made at EU level."
"in writing. - I welcome Katerina Batzeli's report on the Youth in Action Programme."
"Grants provided by the programme are a key element in allowing young Europeans to fully benefit from the opportunities the EU offers."
"The report aims to reduce bureaucracy and simplify the decision making involved in the selection of grants."
"I therefore support its recommendations."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the legislative resolution based on the report by Greek Member Katerina Batzeli, approving, at first reading under the codecision procedure, the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision No 1855/2006/EC establishing the Culture Programme (2007-2013)."
"I welcome and support the amendments which have replaced the advisory comitology procedure with an obligation on the Commission to inform the European Parliament and the Member States without delay about any measures taken for the implementation of the decision without the assistance of a committee, in order to allow selection decisions to be implemented more quickly and efficiently."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of this report because it aims at reducing the decision-making time for granting European financing though the Culture Programme 2007-2013."
"The experience of past years has shown that the procedure for granting financing through this mechanism is quite slow and the European cultural operators may have financial problems for this reason."
"Taking into consideration that the cultural institutions and artists requesting these funds generally have a delicate financial state, I welcome any action designed to facilitate access to European funds is welcomed."
"in writing. - Katerina Batzeli's report on the Culture Programme for 2007-2013 streamlines the process by which financial support through the programme is decided."
"Making that process more efficient will benefit programmes such as the European Capitals of Culture."
"I therefore voted in support of the report."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, the reports by Katerina Batzeli put to the vote, which concern the Youth in Action programme (2007-2013), the Culture Programme (2007-2013), the Europe for Citizens' programme (2007-2013) and the Action programme in the field of lifelong learning, show that the procedures followed in the adoption of multi-annual programmes in the field of culture, youth education and active citizenship clearly make the preparation and implementation of those programmes more difficult."
"The question is: does that result from the European Commission's bureaucratic style of operation or from a lack of understanding of the important subject of active citizenship?"
"Culture and education cannot abide bureaucracy."
"Hence the repeated calls from the European Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education for 'a swift, effective and transparent procedure which will, nevertheless, safeguard the right of scrutiny and information in regard to decision-making'."
"Without swift decisions the hoped-for effects will not be felt."
"These facts fully justify voting in favour of the reports, especially as culture in the widest sense is the wealth of nations and the guarantee of their development and endurance."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the legislative resolution based on the report by Greek Member Katerina Batzeli approving, at first reading under the codecision procedure, the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision No 1904/2006/EC establishing for the period 2007 to 2013 the programme 'Europe for Citizens' to promote active European citizenship."
"I welcome and support the amendments which have replaced the advisory comitology procedure with an obligation on the Commission to inform the European Parliament and the Member States without delay about any measures taken for the implementation of the decision without the assistance of a committee, in order to allow selection decisions to be implemented more quickly and efficiently."
"in writing. - (IT) Thank you, Mr President, as with the previous reports, I am convinced about this one and am voting in favour of the work done by my colleague Mrs Batzeli."
"The 'Europe for Citizens' programme has been an important step in recent years in the difficult task of bringing Europe closer to its citizens: all too frequently in the past, Europe has been regarded as distant, a bureaucratic entity cut off from the everyday reality of its citizens."
"Today, since we are holding the plenary in Brussels, by way of exception, we have an opportunity to send a signal which will be greatly welcomed by European citizens: let us start talking about having a single headquarters of the European Parliament in Brussels."
"Our citizens are increasingly perplexed at this monthly 'transfer' which involves ever greater organisational efforts and financial burdens."
"Let us start to discuss this matter without taboos."
"in writing. - I welcome the proposals to cut bureaucracy in the decision-making process for the Europe for Citizens programme."
"More efficient selection of grants for town-twinning and support for civil society will improve the EU's capacity to encourage its citizens to engage with Europe."
"With this in mind, I voted in support of Katerina Batzeli's report on the programme 'Europe for Citizens' 2007-2013 to promote active citizenship."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the legislative resolution based on the report by my Greek fellow Member Katerina Batzeli approving, at first reading under the codecision procedure, the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision No 1720/2006/EC establishing an action programme in the field of lifelong learning."
"I welcome and support the amendments which have replaced the advisory comitology procedure with an obligation on the Commission to inform the European Parliament and the Member States without delay about any measures taken for the implementation of the decision without the assistance of a committee, in order to allow selection decisions to be implemented more quickly and efficiently."
"in writing. - The lifelong learning programme helps finance education schemes like Erasmus."
"It is through such schemes that people across Europe not only experience Europe's cultural richness, but also the wealth of learning opportunities the EU offers."
"I therefore voted in favour of Katerina Batzeli's report on an 'Action programme in the field of lifelong learning'."
"in writing. - (DE) It is counterproductive to encourage our own people to learn on the one hand but come up with 'blue card' plans on the other, as the increase in atypical employment and fiercer competitive pressure have already ensured that good basic and further training is no longer a defence against unemployment."
"There are enough well-qualified people who are rejected by companies simply because they are out to employ the cheapest possible holders of PhD or Masters' degrees in McJobs or no longer wish to offer anything other than atypical employment contracts."
"There is a fundamental need to launch training offensives in order to eliminate the shortage of skilled labour which is used to justify the present state of affairs."
"If that proves impossible, preference should be given to a seasonal-migrant model."
"This will prevent the recurrence of waves of mass immigration."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of Mrs. Katerina Batzeli's report for several reasons."
"It is well-known that education and training are essential priorities for the European Union, in order to achieve the Lisbon objectives."
"The goal of the lifelong learning programme should be the maintaining of a flexible, autonomous society, based on knowledge, with a quantity and quality economic-cultural development, all following a line and in the spirit of a strong(er) social cohesion."
"For this reason, lifelong training should involve all social factors."
"Obviously, like any other programme of such size, it should be clear, coherent, regularly monitored and assessed after each implementation phase, in order to allow (re)adjustments, especially as regards the priorities of implementing the actions."
"Nevertheless, the lifelong learning programmes should also focus on mature people."
"The fact that, most of the time, emphasis is laid on education in the first part of life and, afterwards, the individual's knowledge becomes limited, every citizen should be stimulated and motivated to participate in a form of lifelong learning, which would ensure potential employment on the labour market, no matter what the age."
"This is even more important if we relate to the statistics regarding the ageing labour force and decrease in the active population."
"in writing. - (RO) Today, all of Europe is dealing with a series of essential and dramatic changes for the citizens of all ages."
"The importance of education and training in the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment has been acknowledged and the European Council has repeatedly emphasized the role of education and training in the European Union's long-term competitiveness."
"Today, we can no longer forecast that people will remain for their entire life in the same business sector or in the same place."
"Their professional evolution will follow unpredictable paths and they will need a broad range of general skills in order to adjust."
"In order to prepare them for life and society, schools should guide them toward lifelong learning, a comprehensive European Union programme, which sees people able to learn at all ages, thus remaining lively and active members of society."
"This is why I voted this report completely confident, because we need to develop the programmes designed for these purposes and here I refer in particular to the recent EU Member States."
"in writing. - (RO) The partnership and cooperation agreement (PCA) between the European Communities and the Member States, on the one hand, and the Republic of Uzbekistan, on the other hand, became effective on 1 July 1999, before the European Union's enlargement with the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania."
"The protocol to PCA had to be drawn up in order to allow the new Member States (Romania and Bulgaria) to join this agreement."
"I consider that the Parliament should have more initiatives of this type, taking into consideration the partnerships signed with the other countries in the region as well."
"In relation with the situation in the region, this year, the conclusion of a European Union - Azerbaijan partnership is required in order to provide Europe with the possibility to continue its energy projects."
"Azerbaijan needs to receive special attention from the European Union, also starting from the reality of this country's very balanced policy and availability to contribute to the achievement of the European Union's energy projects."
"in writing. - (FR) Following the referendum held in Montenegro on 21 May 2006 on the country's independence, in which a majority (55.4%) voted in favour of an independent Montenegro, the Montenegrin parliament proclaimed Montenegro fully independent under international law on 3 June 2006."
"Serbia recognised Montenegro's independence on 5 June 2006, and the Serbian parliament adopted a decision defining Serbia as the successor to the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, which was the new name for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia under the terms of the Constitutional Charter of 4 February 2003."
"It is against this background that I voted for the European Parliament legislative resolution approving, under the consultation procedure, the proposal for a Council decision establishing a separate liability of Montenegro and reducing proportionately the liability of Serbia with regard to the long-term loans granted by the Community to the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro (formerly the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia)."
"in writing. - I shall be voting in favour of Helmut Markov's report."
"I believe it is absolutely essential for stability and security in Europe that we do all we can to help both Serbia and Montenegro recover from the economic and social upheaval that took place with the break-up of Yugoslavia and the subsequent disastrous wars."
"I would hope that, in particular, infrastructure and transportation would feature prominently."
"If we are to be realistic in our aspirations for both countries, then this agreement is essential and should be strongly supported."
"It is my hope that at some future date both Serbia and Montenegro can join the European Union."
"This agreement is the first step on the road to that aspiration."
"in writing. - (FR) On the basis of the report by my excellent British fellow Member Neil Parish, I voted for the legislative resolution approving, under the consultation procedure, the proposal for a Council regulation amending the Council Regulation of June 2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products."
"The Council Regulation of 28 June 2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products is supposed to come into force as a mandatory requirement from 1 January 2009."
"The purpose of this proposal is to postpone the compulsory use of the EU logo pending the design of a new logo in order to help to avoid confusing consumers by changing EU logos within a short time period, and creating an additional financial burden for operators, who would have to change their packaging and print-outs within a very short time frame."
"It is therefore proposed to postpone the compulsory use of the EU logo until 30 June 2010."
"in writing. - I back this report from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on organic production and labelling on organic products."
"I am not entirely convinced that it is always better to absolutely maximise organic production and consumption."
"I believe science has improved food productivity and food safety in some important areas."
"My own consumption reflects this belief."
"Nevertheless, those who take a more fundamentalist view are entitled to be reassured that 'organic' really is organic, and not just a label used to extract a price premium from gullible and ill-informed consumers."
"in writing. - (SV) Demand for organically produced food and other goods is high and growing, and in order to meet this demand, consumers must naturally be able to identify these products on the market."
"Therefore labelling is required if the market is to function in this respect."
"However, we have previously voted against EU labelling of organic products, as it is our conviction that market forces, spearheaded by aware European consumers, are capable of performing this task alone."
"If political regulation is required in the area of labelling of organic products, this should be carried out at national level."
"In the vote on this report, however, we were only faced with the question of postponing the compulsory use of the EU logo on organic products."
"We voted in favour of this proposal."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Parish report which accepts the Commission's proposal to delay the introduction of the use of a compulsory EU organic label."
"It should be noted, however, that voluntary use of such a label is not prohibited and any such moves which are of benefit to consumers should be encouraged."
"in writing. - (SV) We voted in favour of the report, as the amendments which Parliament proposes would mean requiring the consent of the European Parliament to conclude agreements."
"We are in favour of a thorough review of the EU's Fisheries Agreements and see this as a positive first step which gives us greater opportunities for influence."
"We take the scientific reports which show that the seas are being exhausted very seriously."
"Therefore we do not see the EU's Fisheries Agreements as a means of combating poverty and encouraging development which is sustainable in the long term."
"We would like to change the EU's fisheries policy such that it leads to rebuilding fish stocks."
"Through changes in the EU's trade and aid policy and various forms of partnership, we also seek to support sustainable development in the countries in which Fisheries Agreements with the EU currently constitute a major source of income."
"in writing. - I supported the Morillon report relating to the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement."
"I consider that fishing nations should control their own fisheries whilst cooperating internationally through regional fisheries organisations."
"The EU has a coastal interest in the Indian Ocean and accordingly must fulfil obligations under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea."
"I look forward, however, to the day when France, and other EU nations, have direct control of their own fishing interests."
"in writing. - (FR) The European Parliament has just given its assent to the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement signed by the European Community in 2006."
"Having fishing interests in the area because of La Réunion, the Community was obliged to cooperate with the other parties involved in the management and conservation of resources in the region under the terms of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea."
"This new regional fisheries organisation establishes a specific institutional framework with, as its cornerstone, the permanent Scientific Committee, whose main task is to conduct a scientific assessment of the fishery resources and the impact of fishing on the marine environment, taking into account the environmental characteristics of the area."
"The Agreement also encourages cooperation in the field of scientific research."
"On the basis of these scientific recommendations, the parties will be in a strong position to draw up conservation and management measures that are best able to meet the challenges facing the area."
"The Agreement marks a genuine step forward in promoting fishery resources and sustainable development."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the European Parliament resolution based on the report by my fellow Member Kyösti Virrankoski on Draft amending budget No 5/2008 (PDAB 5/2008), which covers the revision of the forecast of traditional own resources (TOR, i.e. customs duties, agricultural duties and sugar levies), VAT and GNI bases, and the budgetisation and financing of the UK rebate, which have the effect of changing the distribution between Member States of their own resources contributions to the EU budget."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the legislative resolution based on the report by German Member Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann, approving, under the consultation procedure, the initiative of a number of Member States to strengthen the European Judicial Network."
"The resolution first of all calls on both the Council and the Commission to give priority to any future proposal to amend the text of the initiative by using the urgent procedure, in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty once it comes into force."
"I support the strengthening of the 'data protection' element and the fact that the Judicial Network contact points are to provide the national members of Eurojust with certain information."
"I particularly welcome the reference to the future Framework Decision on the Protection of Personal Data Processed in the Framework of Police and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters."
"in writing. - (FR) Just for once, Brussels wants to take back through the window what the French, Dutch and Irish threw out the door in the 2005 and June 2008 referendums: the establishment of a single European Public Prosecutor's Office."
"The temptation proves too great for our pro-European sorcerer's apprentices."
"Whatever it takes, any objections, rejections and legitimate resistance by the peoples of Europe must be overcome and ignored in order to communitise by force all justice, security and immigration issues."
"Europe is sorely mistaken."
"The requisite cooperation between Member States in judicial, police and even criminal matters must not result in their subjection to a supranational legal order that has been established in spite of all the differences existing between the legal systems and traditions of the Member States."
"We reject this supranational legal order that would go against the very principles and values that we hold dear."
"in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am voting in favour of Mrs Kaufmann's report on the European Judicial Network."
"I concur with its content and its objective, which is to strengthen existing structures and to unify their action."
"The significant changes in recent years in connection with judicial cooperation in criminal matters have made it necessary to introduce and strengthen structures which are able to provide assistance and coordination at European level."
"Despite the fact that the principle of mutual recognition is beginning to be put into practice, there are still many practical difficulties and an increasing number of highly complicated transnational cases where the provision of assistance and support to the competent national authorities is becoming increasingly necessary."
"in writing. - (SV) I am completely opposed to including religion, sexuality, political opinions, etc. as relevant information to be sent between authorities, but in this report this is only mentioned in conjunction with additional safeguards and as an attempt to tighten up existing legislation."
"Therefore I am voting in favour."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the legislative resolution based on the report by Portuguese Member Armando França supporting the initiative by a number of Member States (the Republic of Slovenia, the French Republic, the Czech Republic, the Kingdom of Sweden, the Slovak Republic, the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany) to amend a series of framework decisions (2002/584/JHA on the European arrest warrant, 2005/214/JHA on the mutual recognition of financial penalties, 2006/783/JHA on the principle of mutual recognition of confiscation orders, and 2008./.../JHA on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters) in order to make provision for the enforcement of decisions rendered in absentia."
"I support the proposal for a series of procedural guarantees to strengthen the rights of persons judged in absentia, and the efforts to eliminate different approaches towards 'grounds for non-recognition' of such decisions."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted for Mr França's report on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments in criminal matters because I believe it is important to establish uniform rules for the mutual recognition of decisions rendered in absentia."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on the proposals presented in the report, which I consider to be crucial for harmonising procedural guarantees in all Member States and for reinforcing the protection of fundamental rights, such as the right to a defence and the right to a trial."
"in writing. - I will be supporting this report on mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters."
"I take the view that those convicted of crimes should not be able to hide within the interstices of the European Union."
"Anyone convicted within one Member State should be considered guilty across the Union."
"If we doubt the independence and integrity of courts in any State of the Union, that State should have its membership suspended."
"Otherwise, just as we make no distinction between criminals in Manchester or London, neither should we if it is Madrid or Lisbon."
"in writing. - (NL) I voted against the França report on application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments in criminal matters, because the report is aimed at harmonising criminal justice at European level."
"I believe that criminal justice is a responsibility of Member States and not the EU."
"It should not therefore be harmonised."
"in writing. - (NL) I voted against Mr França's report on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments in criminal matters because the aim of the report is to harmonise criminal law at European level."
"I think that criminal law is the responsibility of the Member States, not the EU."
"I am, of course, in favour of the right for defendants to have proper representation, but there is no need for harmonisation."
"in writing. -? (RO) Mutual recognition is the cornerstone of judicial cooperation at European level and any clarification of the instruments for enforcing this principle is welcome."
"The decision approved today is opportune."
"Nevertheless, I would like to draw attention to another problem, namely the way in which some Member States implement important instruments, such as the European arrest warrant."
"In January 2007, the Romanian authorities issued a European arrest warrant in the name of the Czech citizen František Příplata, sentenced to eight years in prison for incitement to serious crime, in the case of the 2000 assassination of a Romanian trade union leader."
"Yet, the Czech Republic, on whose territory the killer is, enforces the procedure of hand over only for crimes committed as of 1 November 2004."
"Consequently, eight years after the crime was committed, the sentenced person has not yet been extradited and the execution of the sentence has not yet started."
"I believe the Members States that understand enforcing the judicial cooperation instruments in this manner should seriously consider the opportunity of keeping such reserves."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of Armando França's report on the enforcement of the principle of mutual recognition to confiscation orders and of the Framework Decision 2008./.../JHA on the recognition and enforcement of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments in criminal matters imposing punishments or measures involving deprivation of liberty for their enforcement in the European Union."
"There are ever-increasing cases in which dangerous criminals use the freedom of movement and the elimination of borders within the European Union to avoid judgment."
"I support this report unconditionally because it ensures a unitary regulation in the field of decisions rendered ""in absentia"", an extremely necessary regulation in order to avoid the possible blocking of the judicial system by those who run from justice to another European Union country."
"in writing. - (SV) Parliament's amendments focus on increased protection of individuals and thus seek to improve the existing regulatory framework."
"Therefore I am voting in favour."
"in writing. - (PL) I fully support the initiative to amend the legal provisions governing application of the principle of mutual recognition of judgments."
"Every effort must be made to render judicial cooperation between Member States as effective as possible."
"At the same time, we must seek to ensure that all citizen's rights, including the fundamental right to defence in criminal proceedings, are fully preserved."
"In my view the proposed amendments will not only considerably facilitate cooperation between courts but will above all help to reinforce the rights of the citizen with respect to the administration of justice throughout the European Union, especially the right of defence and the right to a retrial."
"in writing. - (SV) This own-initiative report highlights fisheries and aquaculture within the context of Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Europe."
"Ecologically sustainable management of aquatic and fisheries resources is naturally important for protecting the environment in which we live."
"Unfortunately, the report ignores the problems which the fisheries sector in the EU brings with it."
"Therefore we have chosen to abstain."
"Overcapacity in the fishing fleets in the EU is leading to far too large catches."
"This threatens the marine ecosystem and edible fish stocks."
"We would like to see a major reduction in fishing vessels, and fishing quotas which are set on the basis of biologically safe and scientific grounds."
"Of course, the employees affected by the restructuring must be offered labour market training and reasonable financial support in order to be able to take work in other parts of the economy which need labour."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted for the report by my fellow Member Mr Gklavakis on Fisheries and Aquaculture in the context of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) in Europe, and congratulate him on its quality."
"I do so because it stresses the economic and social importance of these activities for coastal regions, and calls for them to receive assistance within the framework of ICZM."
"For this reason too it is essential for the national and regional governments of the outermost regions to prepare integrated ICZM strategies to guarantee the balanced development of their coastal regions."
"I also strongly support the rapporteur's suggestion of using the European Fisheries Fund for the long-term funding of measures within the framework of ICZM, since it supports actions which contribute to the sustainable development of fishing regions in a transversal approach to all maritime activities taking place in those regions."
"Finally, it is important to stress that regional planning has so far been largely land-based and has failed to take into account the impact of coastal development on certain maritime activities."
"This has led to the degradation of marine habitats, which is why a new approach is crucial."
"in writing. - The Gklavakis report rightly recognises the importance of fishing to coastal communities and the retention of cultural traditions."
"All too often, this very human aspect of the fishing industry seems to have been overlooked in the implementation of the CFP."
"The report correctly notes the need for bodies at EU, national and regional levels to cooperate in matters of coastal management, and I consider that, within this context, coastal areas and nations must take the lead role, with the EU acting as a facilitator."
"in writing. - (IT) Fisheries and aquaculture are two of the principal activities underlying the economic and social development of the coastal zones of the European Union."
"It is therefore necessary to manage them in such a way as to ensure sustainable exploitation of fisheries whilst also satisfy the increasing demand for fisheries products."
"To that end, the EU states need to implement a series of measures aimed at protecting coastal zones and promoting a clean marine environment."
"In view of the cross-border nature of many coastal processes, there is a need for cooperation between Member States and between them and neighbouring third countries."
"One such measure concerns the planning of housing developments for tourism purposes."
"For many regions, the tourism industry is an important contributor to local GDP."
"However, I think that we should support 'eco-friendly' tourism, in other words a form of tourism which dovetails with countryside and environment protection policies."
"There is also a need for coordination in terms of industrial activities: just think of the importance of an effective common policy on waste water management for ensuring the compatibility of an important economic activity with the need and duty to preserve the marine environment."
"Inshore, small-scale fishing is a very important source of income for thousands of families and keeps alive a centuries-old tradition which, in my view, Europe should support and preserve."
"in writing. - (IT) I am voting in favour of the Gklavakis report which underlines the need for a European coastal zone strategy with a view to sustainable development."
"An integrated coastal zone management strategy can in fact provide a suitable framework for the sustainable exploitation of these zones and the activities carried out in them."
"I fully endorse the position of the rapporteur when he says that there is a need for long-term planning involving all the sectors concerned."
"I applaud that view and would also like to emphasise that this should just be the start of a greater focus on the sector, and I invite the Commission to implement a meaningful policy in this field."
"in writing. - I abstained on this vote because I am in favour of sustainable fisheries everywhere and I support the coastal communities and fishermen of Ireland."
"The Common Fisheries Policy, while focusing on both of these ends, has led to the opposite: destruction of the marine environment, decrease of fish and impoverishment of the marine environment."
"in writing. (FR) - On the basis of the report by my excellent Slovene fellow Member Mihael Brejc, I voted for the legislative resolution approving, at first reading under the codecision procedure, the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 as regards the use of the Visa Information System (VIS) under the Schengen Borders Code."
"In view of the expectations that Europe's citizens have when it comes to internal security, I wholeheartedly support the amendments to be made to the Schengen Borders Code in order to guarantee the effective use of the Visa Information System (VIS) at our external borders."
"The aim of this proposal for a regulation is to establish common rules for the compulsory use of the VIS (i.e. a systematic search using the number of the visa sticker, combined with finger print checks) at the external borders and thereby to continue to develop an integrated border management system in the European Union."
"Although it would like to be able to boast the opposite, Europe has made no progress in the area of freedom, security and justice."
"Quite the contrary, since the deplorable Schengen Agreement was first implemented, the lifting of internal border controls has led to an explosion in organised crime and all forms of trafficking."
"The European Union, a real sorcerer's apprentice in terms of security, with methods that all too often pose a threat to the security of states and their peoples, has imposed on us this area of insecurity lacking in freedoms and justice."
"The Schengen Borders Code will not help because it is the very foundations of the Schengen Agreement that are inadequate and unacceptable."
"Common security will prevail only if each state regains full sovereignty in the management of its borders and its migration policy."
"The pinnacle of the absurd is reached when this involves transferring even more responsibilities to a Union that is already paralysed."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted for Mihael Brejc's report on the use of the Visa Information System under the Schengen Borders Code."
"The common rules for the external borders of the Schengen area must be amended, and the use of the Visa Information System must be made more efficient and uniform."
"These things must be done very judiciously and carefully, since data privacy and human rights are always paramount and must be respected."
"Blanket checking of fingerprints at the borders with the aid of the Visa Information System will lead to unnecessarily long queues and to lengthy delays at border crossing points, even for people who do not require visas."
"The report now proposes only random searches of the information system."
"Officers on duty at the border will continue to check whether incoming travellers meet all the requirements for entry to the EU, but they can also decide themselves whether to do a VIS search as well."
"This approach will still guarantee a very high level of security but will ensure that people are not kept waiting at border crossings any longer than is strictly necessary."
"in writing. - (DE) Strengthening the Visa Information System (VIS) is undoubtedly a good way to make combating fraud easier in future and - provided that data protection is ensured - is therefore to be welcomed."
"Nonetheless, if the collection of fingerprints and face scans is necessary for the granting of Schengen visas in future, this will lead to quite considerable upheavals in the embassies concerned."
"In the debate in Germany, it has been suggested that some embassies have neither the personnel nor the facilities to cope with this change."
"The possible outsourcing of data storage to external companies, which is also under discussion, gives grave cause for concern, however, and could potentially open the way for future visa scandals."
"The VIS has positive aspects, but overall, it has not been properly thought through, which is why I was unable to vote in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (IT) I am voting in favour of the Brejc report."
"I support the proposal and its aims."
"In certain periods, our borders are crowded with people wanting to enter the Schengen area."
"The proposal does introduce a relaxation of the normal system of controls but it also aims to protect travellers and to spare them long hours of waiting at frontiers to comply with those controls."
"However, the derogation should remain just that and not become the general rule, and I agree that the duration and frequency of the derogation should be limited as far as possible."
"All in all, I welcome the introduction, in that connection, of specific conditions governing the applicability of the derogation."
"in writing. - (PL) I am in favour of amending Regulation No 562/2006 as regards the use of the Visa Information System (VIS) under the Schengen Borders Code."
"I consider it unnecessary and too time-consuming to carry out checks on third-country nationals holding a visa every time they cross the border."
"It causes excessively long waits at border crossings."
"A reduction in the intensity of border checks will not in my opinion affect the level of security in the EU."
"I therefore consider that limiting the checks carried out by the border guard in command to random VIS checks is the right solution."
"in writing. - (RO) Today, I voted in favour of the Brejc report because, for the effciency of external border controls, the use of the VIS (Visa Information System) is of fundamental importance."
"The Visa Information System should be consulted systematically by the border police agents for any person holding a visa in order to ensure border security."
"The expansion of the Schengen zone has eliminated barriers in the European Union."
"Third country citizens are still checked only once at the entry."
"50% of the illegal immigrants enter the EU legally, but exceed the period of stay because there is no visa control system."
"We want Europe to be safer and, at the same time, welcoming for those who come for tourist or business purpose."
"The amendment voted today in the European Parliament is to the advantage of the EU citizens and third-country nationals, who do not need a visa because, in this way, the jams at the land border-crossing points would significantly decrease."
"in writing. - (FR) On the basis of the report by Romanian Member Renate Weber, I voted for the European Parliament legislative resolution supporting the initiative of a number of Member States (Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Sweden) to strengthen Eurojust."
"I support the strengthening of the 'data protection' element of the proposal and the fact that the European Parliament is to receive more information so that it is better able to monitor the tasks and duties of Eurojust, which was set up in 2002 as a European Union body with legal personality whose role is to promote and improve coordination and cooperation between the competent judicial authorities in the Member States."
"It has become clear from Eurojust's experience that its operational efficiency needs to be improved by ensuring that its National Members have equivalent status."
"I also support the emergency cell for coordination, the national coordination systems, the partnerships with the other Community security and protection instruments (Europol, Frontex, OLAF), and the possibility for Eurojust to second liaison magistrates to third countries."
"in writing. - (FR) I welcome the adoption of Mrs Lambert's report on the evaluation of the Dublin system."
"The report rightly recalls that, overall, the objectives of the Dublin system have, to a large extent, been achieved, but that, owing to the lack of precise data, it has not been possible to evaluate the cost of the system."
"Some concerns remain in terms of both the practical application and the effectiveness of the system."
"The report opens the debate on the future of the common European asylum policy which was launched in June 2007 with the publication of a Green Paper."
"The report points out that the following aspects of the system should be clarified or modified: observance of the basic principle of non-refoulement; applicants must receive all relevant information concerning the Dublin system in a language which they understand and they must have access to legal aid throughout the procedure, they must also have the right to a suspensory appeal against any transfer decision; the criteria for determining the age of minors should be harmonised; mechanisms should be devised for blocking transfers to countries which plainly do not uphold applicants' rights."
"in writing. - (FR) Under the pretext of reinforcing the operational capacities of Eurojust in the fight against various forms of crime, this proposal's main objective is to pander to the obsession with political correctness of proponents of the thought police."
"The thinly disguised aim is the monitoring of all remarks under threat of penalty, whether they are made in writing or spoken at meetings."
"Various speakers in this House have already called for the adoption of a framework directive to condemn as criminal offences alleged acts of racism and xenophobia and, with a view to ensuring the speedy transposition of such a directive into national law, to establish a single European Public Prosecutor - the EU's new Torquemada of 'political correctness'."
"Regrettably, the more the European Parliament, an institution which proclaims itself to be the temple of democracy, gains decision-making powers, the more fundamental freedoms - particularly the freedom of research, opinion and expression - are flouted."
"In fact, this totalitarian Europe is far more dangerous than the 'monsters' which it claims to be fighting."
"The primary objective of the proponents of Euro-globalist and immigrationist ideology is to rid themselves of troublesome opponents by adopting repressive European criminal legislation."
"We do not accept this."
"in writing. - The Council's proposal and the related report on the amendment to the Eurojust Regulation give even greater power to this repressive EU mechanism."
"Eurojust's jurisdiction is extended to almost all areas of penal matters and its powers of intervention with national judicial authorities have been strengthened."
"Transmitting information and personal data (including DNA data) from a Member State to Eurojust becomes obligatory and a network of national Eurojust associations is created."
"Eurojust's ties are closer with other repressive mechanisms of the EU (European Judicial Network, Frontex) and of third countries."
"Reinforcing Eurojust bolsters Europol and generally increases files kept on EU employees and foreigners."
"This is helped by updating the Schengen and VIS surveillance systems and by incorporating the Prüm Treaty into Community law."
"Behind the excuses of terrorism and organised crime lies an attempt to arm capital against the intensified popular reaction engendered by EU policy and Member State governments."
"The rampant growth of mechanisms of repression at national and EU level further exposes the reactionary nature of the EU, and more than ever goads the people to resist and overthrow this imperialist structure."
"in writing. - The Maltese Islands are the Southern frontier of the EU."
"Situated in the middle of the Mediterranean, they are receiving a disproportionate number of irregular immigrants."
"The majority file for asylum status."
"Frontex - which was hailed by Government representatives as a solution to curtailing the number of irregular immigrants - has been a complete failure."
"We have been requesting the sharing of the burden, with little or no response."
"Now that this legislature has entered its final year, we are proposing mechanisms for burden-sharing."
"Finally we are acknowledging the need 'to help alleviate the disproportionate load which could fall on certain Member States, in particular the border Member states'."
"The fact that we have acknowledged the need 'for the provision of mechanisms other than financial to correct the adverse effects of the implementation of this system for the smaller Member States at the Union's external borders' is most welcome, as it refers to Malta in everything but name."
"The EU has not lived up to its spirit of solidarity where this issue is concerned."
"It is about time that we cut the rhetoric and get down to the substance."
"The EU must realise that its smallest state cannot continue to absorb the vast number of immigrants seeking refuge and asylum."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the report by British Member Jean Lambert on the Dublin system, and I applaud the work done by my friend Patrick Gaubert, who was the rapporteur for our PPE Group."
"The purpose of the Dublin system is to determine the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application made in the territory of one of the EU Member States, Norway or Iceland."
"Although, generally speaking, the aims of the Dublin system, in particular the establishment of a clear and viable mechanism for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application, have largely been achieved, problems remain with the efficiency of the system and its application in practice, as well as with the cost, which has not been evaluated."
"All of this shows the urgent need for a European immigration and asylum policy, and I welcome the work done by the current President of the Council with responsibility for this field, my friend Brice Hortefeux, the French Minister for Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Mutually-Supportive Development, who has just chaired the European ministerial conference on the right of asylum on 8 and 9 September 2008 in Paris."
"in writing. - (CS) I voted against the report on the evaluation of the Dublin system because I believe that it would not improve the system but, on the contrary, would create an obstacle to its effective operation."
"In particular, I consider it essential to warn against the introduction of an automatic suspensory right of appeal against a decision to transfer an asylum seeker to another Member State."
"In addition, the very qualified stance on the use of detention centres for the transfer of asylum seekers to the State competent to assess the asylum application will definitely not contribute to an improvement in the effectiveness of the system but, on the contrary, will call it into question and make it unclear."
"The report thus actually tends to remove or at least weaken the tools with which Member States can ensure that their decisions are enforceable within the framework of the Dublin system and this should not be approved."
"It is wrong because the undefined humanitarian aspect in assessing asylum applications must not result in Member States' decisions remaining simply paper decisions in the event of non-cooperation on the part of applicants."
"I also cannot identify with the call to introduce European burden-sharing mechanisms, since I am of the view that the existing mechanisms for the financial compensation of the States most affected by asylum applications are quite sufficient and there is no reason to interfere with the sovereignty of Member States in the field of asylum by means of further regulation."
"It is with some irony that we note that, for the first time, a European Parliament report describes the massive influx of immigrants into an EU Member State as a 'burden'."
"Should immigration not be more of an opportunity that is beneficial to all the peoples of Europe?"
"Let there be no doubt about this: the absurdity of the obligation to take in asylum seekers and strict compliance with the principle of non-refoulement are not being called into question."
"The report highlights only the deficiencies of the Dublin system with regard to the determination of which Member State is responsible for processing asylum applications."
"This is self-evident given the ever-increasing migration flows to countries that, for the most part, are located on the southern periphery of the EU."
"Once again, the report offers a fallacious solution to the technical and human problems associated with migration waves."
"The establishment of a common asylum system, which is bound to be ineffective in a constantly enlarging EU with porous borders, is not what is needed."
"Quite the reverse, Member States should be given the right to take their own decisions on migration and the management of their borders."
"The Dublin system has proved in practice to be a mechanism promoting the EU's overall anti-refugee policy."
"The various injustices in its application set out in this report confirm its reactionary nature."
"The EU, which bears a significant share of responsibility for the creation of hundreds of thousands of refugees through its support for unpopular regimes and by stirring up internal strife, wars and imperialist interventions, instead of providing for asylum victims and respecting their rights, has in recent years continually hardened its position towards them."
"One aspect of this is the unacceptable bouncing back and forth of asylum seekers from one EU country to the next."
"This is sanctioned by the Dublin Regulation, and was made a reality by the creation of Frontex for the expulsion of refugees from the EU's borders, by the recent directive on their detention for up to 18 months, by approving the extension of the use of Eurodac for other purposes as well, such as to keep files on them, and by the generally inhumane treatment."
"It is therefore clear that we need to fight hard to repeal this regulation and the EU's anti-refugee policy in general."
"We must respect the right of asylum seekers to flee to whatever country they deem most suitable and ensure that the Member States comply with the 1951 Geneva Convention."
"in writing. - (SV) I voted in favour of Jean Lambert's own-initiative report on the Dublin system, although it contains opinions which I do not share."
"The reason why I voted yes is that I concur with the strong criticism found in the report of the way in which the current EU rules undermine the rights of asylum seekers, for example, by transferring asylum seekers to Member States which are unable to guarantee complete and fair treatment."
"However, I am against total harmonisation of the EU's asylum policy."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of my colleague, Ms Lambert's, report on the evaluation of the Dublin system."
"In particular, I would like to highlight the sections which emphasise that in decisions relating to children, the best interests of the child must be paramount at all times."
"In my own country, Scotland, we have the disgraceful situation at the Dungavel detention centre, where children of asylum seekers are effectively imprisoned."
"Such practices can never be described as being in the best interests of the child, and I support the Scottish Government's efforts to close that institution and return responsibility for immigration to Scottish control."
"in writing. - (DE) It is important that some rules governing asylum procedure are being clarified, including those that determine where responsibility lies for curbing multiple applications."
"Whilst the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs calls for greater protection of children in asylum procedures, more and more unaccompanied children are turning up at the external borders of the EU, seeking to exploit the special protection they enjoy from deportation and refoulement."
"Time and again they risk their lives in search of cunning new escape routes."
"If the rules we have created as safeguards are now developing into incentives for more and more new forms of risk-taking, we shall have to think about new strategies."
"The present report contains some building blocks, but on the whole I believe it does not go far enough, which is why I was unable to endorse it."
"in writing. - I have voted in favour of the Lambert report on the evaluation of the Dublin system."
"The report raises concerns over the system's shortcomings, calling on the Commission to take measures against states that do not ensure full and fair treatment of the asylum applications they receive."
"After the unacceptable draft Directive on non-refoulement, adopted in June, the European Parliament is stressing today that asylum seekers have rights under European legislation and that the Member States have obligations."
"Greece is a systematic offender of asylum seekers' fundamental rights."
"It has unacceptable conditions at reception centres and one of the lowest rates of acceptance of applications."
"Certain Member States have already refused to implement the Dublin Regulation when Greece is the country responsible; more still are talking about following suit."
"We invite the Commission to propose substantial and effective measures to ensure that asylum applications are treated correctly by the Greek authorities."
", in writing. - (RO) Asylum legislation and practices still differ between Member States and the asylum applicants are treated differently from one country to another."
"Unless a satisfactory and uniform level of protection is reached across the entire European Union, the Dublin system will always produce unsatisfactory results, both from the technical and human point of view and the asylum applicants will continue to have solid reasons to address their application to a certain Member State in order to benefit from the most favourable decisions at national level."
"The large number of multiple applications and the small number of transfers performed indicate deficiencies in the Dublin system and the need to create a common European asylum system."
"The implementation of the Dublin Regulation may result in the unequal distribution of responsibility, in case of the people requesting protection, to the detriment of some Member States that are particularly exposed to migratory flows only due to their geographical position."
"According to the Commission's evaluation, in 2005, the 13 Member States situated at the Union's external borders, had to deal with increasing challenges raised by the implementation of the Dublin system and, therefore, the first-country-of-entry criterion, provided under the Dublin system, placed the Member States situated at the external borders in a very difficult situation."
"in writing. - (SV) This own-initiative report focuses on potentially improving and increasing the protection provided for asylum seekers, but I distance myself from the statement in the report that a common asylum system would resolve this problem."
"Despite this, I am voting in favour as the majority of the report is positive for asylum seekers and it is they who are the focus of the report."
"in writing. - (SV) Today the European Parliament adopted a report which clearly and critically points out the weaknesses of the current Dublin system."
"There is no doubt that we need a common migration and asylum policy at EU level in an increasingly borderless Europe."
"The question is merely how this is to be achieved."
"Folkpartiet agrees with the majority of the criticism and consider that it is right to send a sharp signal that a change in a more humanitarian direction should be initiated."
"Therefore I voted in favour, with certain reservations."
"Amendment 5 criticises some countries for systematically depriving asylum seekers of their liberty by placing them in detention."
"I considered that this criticism should remain, particularly since Sweden is one of the countries which has historically been guilty of precisely this."
"However, I do not agree with the proposal of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left to completely prohibit the use of detention, although I do think that it is something that should be applied only as a last resort."
"I abstained on Amendment 6, on introducing a proactive duty to trace family members for organisations such as the Red Cross and Red Crescent."
"Such a duty can only be imposed upon an agency and should not be placed on a civil organisation."
"As neither the original text nor the amendment expressed any other option, I chose to abstain."
"Although Mrs Lambert's report on the evaluation of the Dublin system contains viewpoints and proposals that I do not support, I decided to vote in favour of the report in the final vote."
"I did this first and foremost in order to express my approval of the report's clear criticism of the way in which existing EU regulations undermine the rights of asylum seekers, for example by contributing to the transfer of asylum seekers to Member States that cannot guarantee full and fair processing of their applications."
"in writing. - (NL) The agreements on Dublin II are based on the political fiction that the 27 Member States trust each other when it comes to dealing with asylum applications and that all Member States assume their responsibilities in the same principled way."
"I myself investigated the reception of Chechen refugees in Poland, because a number of Chechen refugees were sent back to Poland from Belgium on the basis of Dublin."
"There were strong protests."
"That was why I made my own investigation."
"In fact you can see the pictures on my website."
"Whilst there is not an adequate and consistent level of protection in all 27 Member States, in my view Dublin II is not much more than a political fiction and it creates gross injustice."
"I saw for myself in Poland that the basic principles of the Dublin rules are not being put into practice."
"The quality of the reception, the reception of children and the failure to provide schooling, the unhygienic conditions refugees have to live in, the lack of health care: all these vary a great deal from one Member State to another."
"The Lambert report identifies the problems, starts from an accurate assessment and offers solutions in a number of areas."
"It deserves our full support."
"in writing. - (PL) One of the consequences of the free movement of persons in the European Union is the growth in cross-border car traffic."
"It raises the need to establish provisions at European level in the field of motor insurance so as to protect accident victims effectively."
"The efficiency of the claims representative system established by the insurance company in the victim's country of permanent residence is exceptionally important for the achievement of this aim."
"It is the claims representative's duty to inform the victim how to pursue his claim against a foreign national, and it would increase consumer confidence if the information package accessible before conclusion of the insurance contract included full information on the rules governing the functioning and application of the claims representative system and its benefits for the victim."
"Another important issue raised by the rapporteur is whether legal expenses insurance should be compulsory in all Member States."
"I support his view that maintenance of the existing voluntary system is the right solution."
"The increase in consumer confidence brought about by a compulsory system would be outweighed by the increase in the cost of the insurance itself and the delays resulting from settlement of cases by the courts."
"It is nevertheless essential that measures be taken immediately with regard to the availability of legal protection insurance, especially in the new Member States."
"in writing. - The Mladenov report gives an appropriate degree of prominence to consumer organisations in the evaluation of motor insurance."
"Consumer bodies do indeed have an important role to play in this area, alongside the EU's institutions, Member States and the insurance industry itself."
"in writing. - I would like to thank Mr Mladenov, our Committee rapporteur."
"This report on aspects of motor vehicle insurance is a good example of how Europe is delivering practical and pragmatic benefits of EU membership for its citizens."
"With 1.2 million road accidents in Europe every year, regrettably some citizens will be victims of a car accident, as a driver, passenger or pedestrian."
"Yet many people are not aware that EU law exists to help resolve insurance claims without having to deal with a foreign insurance company in a foreign language."
"This EU law exists to enable citizens to go home and get the claim settled quickly and easily in their own language."
"The 4th Motor Insurance Directive also ensures assistance for accident victims by setting up information centres in each Member State."
"As the law does not currently provide for compulsory cover for legal costs, citizens should consider the option of taking out legal protection insurance."
"Of course, as the Parliament's rapporteur on mediation, I hope parties will use alternative dispute resolution to find a settlement to conflicts while avoiding the costs and delays of court proceedings."
"It is with concrete, practical measures like this law that we can demonstrate Europe's value to our citizens."
"in writing. - (PL) In 2003-2005 some 17 000 citizens of third countries were sent to another EU Member State to have their application for asylum examined there."
"Of these, 12% were applications from people who had already sought asylum."
"At the present time, the chances of being granted asylum vary considerably from one EU Member State to another."
"This is shown most clearly by the example of the Iraqis."
"In Germany they have a 75% chance of asylum, in Greece barely 2%."
"It would be advantageous for the EU to liquidate the phenomena of 'refugees in orbit', twofold migration and the simultaneous submission of asylum applications in different countries by introducing a system under which one Member State would be responsible for examining asylum applications."
"in writing. - (SV) Fiscal fraud causes major financial losses for Member States and reduces opportunities to maintain and improve the quality of the services that we finance through our taxes."
"However, we abstained from voting in the final vote due to several amendments in which tax competition between Member States was seen as something positive and in which the attitude towards the damaging effects of tax havens on the economies of Member States was toned down."
"We also chose to vote against the wording in the second part of paragraph 3, which gives too positive a picture of tax approximation between Member States."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the European Parliament resolution on the own-initiative report on a coordinated strategy to improve the fight against fiscal fraud, drafted by British Member Sharon Bowles in response to a Commission communication on the subject."
"Fiscal revenue, in other words the total amount of taxes and compulsory social contributions, accounted for 39.3% of the European Union's GDP in 2004, at EUR 4 100 billion."
"There are very few estimates of the amount of taxes that go uncollected because of fiscal fraud, which is estimated at around 2-2.5% of GDP."
"Although taxation is a national responsibility, fiscal fraud is an obstacle to the successful operation of the internal market in that it distorts competition between taxpayers."
"There is no disputing that the fight against tax fraud has a European dimension because of the globalisation of the economy internationally."
"in writing. - (PT) We voted against this final resolution, since the majority in the European Parliament overlooks the true causes of the principal fiscal fraud - the existence of tax havens - although there are some positive proposals that we voted in favour."
"Although the Parliamentary Committee's report does contain some positive proposals, notably explicit references to tax havens and their greater responsibility for fiscal fraud and the erosion of the fiscal base, which decreases public revenue and reduces the State's capacity to put social support policies into practice, several of these positions were rejected or watered down in the plenary vote."
"The political majority in the European Parliament does not genuinely wish to close down the tax havens that shelter large fortunes and huge stock market profits from various more or less unauthorised deals."
"They wish to fuel one of the centres of the scandalous profits of capitalism, even if it means lower revenue for states and fewer possibilities for a response from public policies serving workers and the people."
"in writing. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Bowles' report is typical of this Parliament: it offers solutions to problems that would not exist without the Europe of Brussels, solutions which, moreover, would merely exacerbate these problems or create new ones."
"In this instance, the solutions proposed to improve the fight against fiscal fraud involve the levying of tax in the country of origin and the setting up of a clearing house that would make individual Member States' tax receipts dependent on transfers made by other Member States."
"Others involve charging VAT at the rate of the importing Member State (instead of the current exemption system) or the application of a reverse-charge mechanism, both proposals which, if adopted, would end up imposing insurmountable administrative and fiscal burdens on companies."
"In addition, all tax administrations would be allowed direct access to electronically stored data on tax payers in other Member States."
"The taxation of savings and criminal law in the area of fraud would be standardised."
"A number of reduced VAT rates would be abolished."
"All this clearly shows that the real goal is not so much to fight against fraud, which is a very real and serious problem, but rather to put an end to the fiscal sovereignty of the Member States."
"in writing. - (SV) The fight against fiscal fraud is of course worthy of full support."
"We have therefore voted in favour of the motion for a resolution in its entirety, despite the fact that it contains numerous elements which have not been thought through and are unwarranted."
"Paragraph 3 states that 'in order to be operational, a VAT system based on the ""origin principle” requires tax approximation between countries to avoid tax competition'."
"We will not support such a wording."
"Approximation of the VAT and tax systems of Member States is a very dangerous step away from national self-determination in one of the most fundamental policy areas."
"The European Parliament must not make such sweeping statements on such an important issue."
"Tax competition also has advantages in that countries are able to forge ahead and develop more effective taxes or other solutions to finance public spending, provided that they are free from poorly thought-out EU legislation."
"in writing. - I fully support the fight against fiscal fraud and recognise that there needs to be close cooperation between administrative authorities in each Member State and the Commission in order to achieve this."
"However, I do not support the inference in the explanatory memo that the introduction of the CCCTB is in any way necessary to counter fiscal fraud."
"At this stage the CCCTB is only a technical proposition, there is no communication proposed and as such it is premature to suggest that it could help in the fight against fiscal fraud."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, I am voting in favour of the report <Titre>on a co-ordinated strategy to improve the fight against fiscal fraud."
"Sharon Bowles rightly points out that tax fraud has serious consequences for national budgets."
"It leads to violations of the principle of fair taxation and is liable to distort competition."
"Distortions caused by VAT fraud affect the overall balance of the resource system."
"According to various sources, VAT losses range from EUR 60 to 100 billion per annum across the European Union, which results in an increased need to call on Member States' own resources based on gross national income (GNI)."
"I agree with Sharon Bowles' initiative."
"The problems caused by VAT fraud must be eliminated."
"To guarantee the proper functioning of the Community we must ensure that the resource system operates fairly and transparently."
"in writing. - (DE) After ten years of beating about the bush, we still cannot agree on effective methods with which we can put a stop to VAT fraud - which, after all, involves the evasion of taxes equivalent to between 2 and 2.5% of Europe's economic output."
"The reverse-charge system looks quite nice on paper but still seems too embryonic, which is why most of the calls we have been hearing are still for better cooperation between Member States."
"Particularly in the area of fraud, we have some Member States with a conspicuously high degree of susceptibility to fraud and with lax controls, compounded by the prevalence of an unacceptable laissez-faire attitude to recovery."
"It strikes me that the parliamentary report does not deliver an emphatic message or offer any new solutions, which is why I have abstained."
"in writing. - The UK Conservative delegation regrets that it is unable to support the report by Mrs Bowles."
"We recognise that tax fraud is a serious problem and that it needs to be tackled with great urgency, and in particular that a solution needs to be found to the so called ""carousel"" fraud in respect of VAT."
"Nevertheless, the failure of the report to positively support tax competition and sovereignty; its unrealistic approach towards tax havens; and its lack of recognition of the direct link between high taxation and high levels of tax avoidance and evasion lead us to request that the European Union think very seriously before proposing tax measures that may only serve to create capital flight, discourage inward investment or indeed encourage even more fiscal fraud."
"I am happy to support this report which recognizes that developing a strategy to deal with tax fraud is a matter of necessity."
"Although the implementation of effective policies is, for the greater part, the concern of Member States, cooperation is needed on a European level."
"A disproportionate administrative burden should not be placed on businesses, especially, small and medium sized enterprises and given the context of the Commission's policy, red tape and bureaucracy should be reduced."
"I supported the author's amendment which emphasizes the importance of fair competition in terms of taxation for the European Union's economy."
"I am disappointed that the same author referred to the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) in the explanatory memorandum."
"There has as yet not been sufficient examination of CCCTB to guarantee that such a taxation system would have a positive impact and it is likely that more evidence exists to the contrary."
"This statement is based on poor conjecture and as it is only in the explanatory memorandum we cannot vote on the subject."
"As a result, I would like to take this opportunity to express my disappointment and to make my objections known."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"

"Presentation by the Council of the draft general budget - Budget 2009 (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the presentation by the Council of the draft general budget for 2009."
"I therefore welcome Éric Woerth, Minister for the Budget, Public Accounts and the Civil Service, as the representative of the Council Presidency."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is both an honour and a pleasure for me to speak in your House today for two reasons: firstly, because your Parliament represents the heart of European democracy."
"The French Presidency has a tremendous amount of respect and admiration for the work that you have done in support of European integration, and the best possible proof of our willingness to help Europe move forward together was provided by the French President in his speech in Strasbourg in July."
"It is this same spirit that guides me and is shared by my colleagues in the French Government."
"Secondly, because the draft budget for 2009, which I am presenting to you today, was adopted unanimously by the Council on 17 July."
"This unanimity shows that this draft budget is balanced and that it allows all EU governments to identify with it."
"Our initial contacts have provided a sound basis for the continuation of the budgetary procedure."
"The trialogue and conciliation meetings have taken place in a constructive atmosphere."
"We have already reached agreement on six statements, and I am sure that we shall be able to agree on many other matters of common interest."
"I can assure you that the Council is prepared to continue this high-quality dialogue with a view to securing an agreement on the 2009 budget that is satisfactory to all."
"This agreement should comply with three principles: the first is to ensure the financing of the European Union's policy priorities - and we have established a financial framework for the period from 2007 to 2013 that we must implement in order to achieve our objectives in terms of competitiveness, cohesion and growth."
"The second is to observe the rules of budgetary discipline and sound financial management laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"Expenditure must remain within the limits fixed by this Agreement and sufficient margins must be maintained under the ceilings for the various headings."
"The third principle requires that appropriations be adjusted to take into account actual requirements."
"In particular, we should draw lessons from previous budget outturns so as to be able to determine our real ability to implement sectoral policies."
"Moreover, since the establishment of the financial perspective in 1988, the Community budget has always been subject to an under-utilisation of payment appropriations."
"Budget implementation is improving thanks to the efforts made by Commissioner Dalia Grybauskaité, but uncertainties related to the financial year 2009 clearly remain considerable and there is no evidence, at this point, to suggest that 2009 will be any different from previous years."
"It is also important to protect the interests of European taxpayers - this is all the more true in the current economic climate - and so we must avoid, as far as possible, entering in the budget any appropriations that cannot be utilised."
"The objective of a realistic and balanced budget has consequently been the guiding principle of the Council's work."
"Before presenting the fruits of its labours to you, I should like to say a word on the facility for rapid response to soaring food prices in developing countries."
"Our discussions over the next few weeks will focus on this issue."
"The European Council of 19 and 20 June provided a strong political impetus by welcoming the Commission's intention to come forward with a proposal for a new fund to support agriculture in developing countries."
"However, the European Council mandate is quite explicit in this respect: it is in strict compliance with the current financial perspective that a solution has to be found."
"I am aware that the European Parliament does not currently share this view."
"Nevertheless, the Council will evaluate the proposal adopted by the Commission on 18 July from this perspective."
"Finally, I would remind you that the European Council reaffirmed only yesterday its readiness to support reconstruction efforts in Georgia, including in areas of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, in addition to the EUR 6 million in emergency aid that have already been disbursed."
"The EU will therefore take the initiative of convening an international conference shortly to assist reconstruction in Georgia."
"Yesterday's European Council requested the Council and the Commission to start preparations for this conference."
"I should now like to present to you the main thrust of the 2009 draft budget established by the Council."
"We are proposing a budget of EUR 134 billion in commitment appropriations, which amounts to EUR 469 million less than in the preliminary draft budget."
"The increase in commitment appropriations therefore amounts to 2.8% compared to 2008 and, as a result, the EU's overall commitment capabilities are maintained."
"As for payment appropriations, the Council has made an adjustment limited to EUR 1.7 billion compared to the preliminary draft budget."
"As you requested in previous years, the Council has not been making random across-the-board cuts to all headings."
"This reduction is based instead on a detailed analysis of budget implementation in 2007 and 2008 and on a realistic approach to the potential of Community programmes to be implemented and completed."
"The draft budget therefore amounts to EUR 115 billion in payment appropriations."
"The reduction in the level of payment appropriations in 2009 does not - and I should like to emphasise this point - come as a surprise."
"It had been taken as read when the financial framework for 2007-2013 was adopted."
"If the ceiling on payment appropriations in 2009 is far lower than that in 2008 and 2010, this can be explained, in particular, by movements in appropriations for the cohesion policy, which will be affected in 2009 by the end of the 2000-2006 programming period and by a gradual increase during the 2007-2013 programming period."
"We also have seen no indication that new programmes have been able to get off the ground more quickly."
"On the contrary, the mechanism for the monitoring of the adoption of management and control systems and of major projects shows that they are getting off to a slow start."
"Therefore, out of 433 programmes, there are only two, in Hungary, for which interim payments have been made."
"The level of payment appropriations in our draft budget is therefore realistic and adapted to the needs of the Union."
"A few points should be emphasised heading by heading."
"With regard to the heading 'Competitiveness for growth and employment', the Council attaches great importance to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy."
"It has therefore ensured that adequate financing is provided, particularly for research and technological development programmes, trans-European networks and improving the quality of education and lifelong learning."
"The Council has limited the increase in commitment appropriations on the basis of the analysis of the potential of programmes to be implemented, as I have already said."
"Nevertheless, I should like to emphasise that, in this context, the increase in commitment appropriations is quite considerable for priority programmes."
"For instance, compared to 2008, the Research Framework Programme will receive a 10% increase, the innovation and competitiveness programme a 16% increase and the 'Lifelong Learning Programme', essential for European citizens, will receive a 6% increase."
"These examples clearly illustrate the targeted strategy adopted by the Council."
"Moreover, the Council has reduced payment appropriations (by EUR 471 million) by making cuts on several targeted lines so as to take into account how the appropriations were utilised."
"With regard to heading 1b, 'Cohesion for growth and employment', the Council has accepted the amount of commitment appropriations proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget."
"For payment appropriations, we adopted a balanced approach by introducing, on the one hand, an increase of EUR 50 million for convergence countries and regions and, on the other, a reduction of EUR 300 million in the area of regional competitiveness."
"This means a reasonable overall reduction of EUR 250 million in payment appropriations, and I am delighted that we were able to agree on a joint statement on the Structural and Cohesion Funds as well as on the rural development programmes."
"With regard to the heading 'Conservation and management of natural resources', the Council has adopted a limited reduction of EUR 382 million in commitment appropriations and of EUR 497 million in payment appropriations."
"These concern mainly budget lines related to market intervention and clearance of accounts and, to a reasonable degree, rural development."
"I would also point out that the budget lines related to food programmes, free distribution of fruit and vegetables, school milk and promotion measures have been maintained."
"We have also maintained the amounts proposed by the Commission for environmental policies."
"With regard to heading 3, 'Citizenship, freedom, security and justice', the Council has made a slight increase in the margins available under the ceilings to reach a total of EUR 76 million by making targeted reductions of EUR 20 million in commitment appropriations."
"In this context, I should like to emphasise the importance attached by the French Presidency to immigration policy."
"The amount proposed in the preliminary draft budget for the Frontex Agency has therefore been included."
"With regard to heading 4, 'The EU as a global partner', we have sought to anticipate the needs related to Palestine and Kosovo without waiting for the Commission's letter of amendment, which it should be adopting next week."
"We have therefore set aside additional resources, compared to the preliminary draft budget, of EUR 100 million for Palestine and EUR 60 million for Kosovo."
"Regarding the CFSP, the Council has accepted, as a precautionary measure, the commitment and payment appropriations which were entered in the preliminary draft budget and which are in line with the amounts provided for in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006."
"As for payment appropriations, the reduction made amounts to EUR 393 million, but half of this reduction relates to the reserve for emergency aid and, as you know, the Council considers that it may be possible to finance this reserve by redeploying payment appropriations, as has been seen in recent years."
"Finally, with regard to heading 5, 'Administration', the Council has adopted a controlled increase of 3.8% in administrative appropriations which it deems necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the institutions."
"The margin available under heading 5 therefore amounts to EUR 224 million."
"The Council has, of course, accepted the 250 posts linked to the 2007 enlargement."
"We have also made targeted reductions based on past implementation, rather than making across-the-board cuts, which have become almost a tradition."
"Finally, with regard to decentralised agencies, we have taken account of the life cycle of these agencies."
"We cannot deal with agencies that have already reached cruising speed in the same way as agencies that are still developing their expertise - agencies that are at the development stage - and we have taken into account the surplus generated by some agencies in previous financial years."
"This is the case for Frontex and Eurojust, two agencies that fall within our priorities."
"In conclusion, I therefore feel that the 2009 draft budget represents a balance between the ambitions that we naturally all have for our European Union and sound budgeting for which we are answerable to the citizens."
"This is clearly essential if citizens are to share this confidence in the European idea."
"The view of this House will probably be different, but we are only at the beginning of the budgetary procedure and we still have plenty of time to harmonise our views on the structure of the 2009 budget and to respond to the challenges facing us as a result of the Commission's new proposals."
"I am sure that the three institutions will therefore make every effort so that, between now and conciliation in November - in two months' time - we can reach a comprehensive agreement on all these issues, and I hope that this agreement will be the best possible compromise for both the institutions and European citizens."
"You can obviously count on my total commitment with that in view."
"Thank you very much, Minister."
"You deserved a rather better turnout, but the quality of our Members counts for a great deal."
"Today, of course, we are engaging in an initial discussion, and a former minister who once held your office is also in attendance."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, you just said that we are at the start of the budgetary process."
"As far as Parliament is concerned, that is not the case."
"We had begun the budgetary procedure and discussions on the procedure and on our budget for 2009 at the start of the year."
"We have therefore come a long way already."
"In particular, moreover, we in Parliament are agreed that neither the Commission's preliminary draft budget nor the Council's draft - which, as we know, has pruned back the appropriations for both commitments and payments contained in the Commission's estimates, is particularly inspiring."
"We certainly do not regard it as an ambitious budget that satisfies the demands made of us in the European Union in every possible area of political activity."
"In particular, Parliament has recurring difficulties with the fact that, for all the constant and ubiquitous talk of wanting to tackle climate change, this intention is insufficiently reflected in the budget."
"We in Parliament - as you can see from the overwhelming support the chamber gave the negotiating team from the Committee on Budgets in the July vote - will ensure that the fight against climate change can be stepped up in many parts of the budget and that this can be done with European funds."
"We do not believe that such a wide gap can remain between the appropriations for commitments and those for payments as the 15% proposed by the Commission, which has subsequently been further widened by the Council."
"Instead, we shall ensure that we obtain a budget which is more in tune with the principles of budgetary accuracy and clarity."
"No doubt we shall have the occasional heated discussion this autumn."
"I am very hopeful, however, that we shall arrive at a satisfactory outcome once we have come to an arrangement with each other on certain matters."
"rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, in autumn we embark, as usual, on the decisive phase of the budget procedure, this time for the year 2009."
"Our task is to note and take account of all the changes that have occurred since submission of the preliminary budget proposals."
"The greatest problem and difficulty for me, as rapporteur on the budget of the European Parliament and the other European institutions, is the uncertainty as to the fate of the Lisbon Treaty."
"The budget forecasts for 2009 were based on the most likely outcome, namely entry into force of a treaty that fundamentally enlarges the European Parliament's powers of co-decision."
"Since at the present time there is a question mark over the Treaty, the normal reaction with regard to the budget is to separate the expenditure directly linked with the Lisbon Treaty from the preliminary expenditure for the coming year, and that was the request we put to all the European institutions."
"We have a response from the European Parliament, which is currently being examined."
"It is not yet an official document of Parliament's Bureau, but it meets the requirement to separate expenditure linked to the Lisbon Treaty, which can be taken into account later if the situation changes."
"Obviously the uncertainty as to the fate of the Lisbon Treaty affecting the budget for 2009 does not excuse us from applying the other principles governing establishment of the expenditure plan for 2009."
"We have to take account of the new rules on MEPs' remuneration and the remuneration and employment of assistants."
"We have to cover the costs of the European election campaign and take account of the movements in prices of the various energy sources that occurred in 2008."
"Above all, 2009 is an election year, in which we must strive for rigour and financial discipline."
"An expansion of European bureaucracy - European administration, in other words - is not the best message to send to people whom we are asking to renew the mandates of members of the European Parliament."
"I would like to draw attention to one more matter that concerns me not as the European Parliament's rapporteur but as a member of a community of democratic nations concerned with human rights and the sovereignty of all the nations of Europe."
"We should react, on a budgetary level too, to what has happened in Georgia."
"I believe the European Parliament should take a position on this question at the first reading, since it will be difficult to persuade European taxpayers to continue providing unconditional aid to Russia when it is spending money on wars beyond its borders."
"Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Budgets. - (FI) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, first of all I would like to say how thankful I am that next year's draft budget is now before Parliament."
"At the same time I wish to say how sorry I am that our Committee's chairman, Reimer Böge, cannot be present at the debate, as he has important obligations in his country at the same time."
"For that reason, I will make the speech for the Committee on Budgets for him."
"I want to thank the Council and its Presidency for their constructive cooperation, as at the budgetary conciliation meeting in July we made important, joint declarations which relate to the implementation of the Structural and Cohesion Funds, the European Solidarity Fund, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, and staff expenditure, besides other matters."
"This also bodes well for a positive atmosphere at the conciliation meeting in November."
"Unfortunately, the Council has not been quite as cooperative as regards the financing of the numerous new posts which were discussed and included in the resolutions at the European Council in June, for example."
"The Commission's preliminary draft budget was already very meagre."
"Commitment appropriations stood at EUR 134.4 billion, which is 2.6 billion below the financial perspective, and payment appropriations were even more meagre at EUR 116.7 billion."
"This is the equivalent in payments of just 0.9% of the EU's GDP, which is substantially below the already extremely compromised financial framework, at an average of 1%."
"The Council has cut the budget further by a total of EUR 500 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 1.8 billion in payment appropriations."
"In my opinion, this much reduced budget does not reflect either the EU's or Parliament's priorities."
"It is very dangerous to have made cuts to heading 1, which is vital for sustainable growth and employment."
"The paucity of payment appropriations is a particular threat to structural policy, which is one of Parliament's major priorities."
"Its implementation has already been greatly delayed in any case."
"It is quite clear that heading 1 in the budget needs to be looked at in particular, but so does heading 4, which seems to be chronically underfunded from one year to the next."
"At this very moment there are difficulties with Kosovo and Palestine."
"Finally, I would like to raise two issues."
"The first is the Food Facility Instrument."
"The Commission is proposing approximately EUR 1 billion for the development of food aid and production in developing countries."
"Parliament supports this, but regrets that the Commission has not proposed any suitable instruments."
"The interinstitutional agreement is a good opportunity for this, and the Committee on Budgets is ready and willing to back it on this issue too."
"The European Parliament is also ready to support reconstruction in Georgia."
"The budgetary procedure also provides opportunities for this."
"We hope that when the Commission makes promises on behalf of the European Union at the next Conference of Donors they will be discussed with the budgetary authorities beforehand."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to recall the very good atmosphere of our negotiations which we began in the spring, finalising them before the summer vacation."
"I hope that we will be able to proceed in this manner throughout the whole procedure."
"I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we will have four main blocks of problems in our negotiations."
"The first one concerns the level of the payment appropriations, which have been cut by the Council by EUR 1.8 billion."
"In the evaluation of the Commission's proposal, Parliament thinks it is too modest and the Council thinks it is too ambitious; so I hope that we will be able to find a compromise and a proper budget for Europe by the final stage of our negotiations."
"The second block of problems is concentrated in Heading 4, and here I would like to mention three elements: additional resources for Kosovo and Palestine; the emergency aid reserve, especially as there will be needs requiring a fast response this year and next year; and of course the upcoming donors' conference to help Georgia, and here - at least today - we do not yet have a decision on the table."
"The third block which the Commission sees as a problem concerns administrative expenditure, where as usual the Council approves posts but cuts the financial funding."
"This means that for the Commission, at this stage and with these proposals, it will not be possible to recruit additional staff, although 250 enlargement-related posts have been approved."
"The fourth block concerns the food facility."
"At the Council's prompting, we made a proposal which has not yet at this stage been approved as an instrument by the Parliament."
"So this is the fourth block of our negotiations which I see as problematic."
"So, in general, there are only these four points which may cause difficulties."
"For the rest it is very well prepared and very well calculated, and I think that for the most part we can very rapidly reach agreement."
"If we maintain the spirit of cooperation which we have today, I hope that we will solve all our problems."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, firstly, thank you for this discussion."
"I should like to say to Mrs Haug that this budget clearly is ambitious, even if the levels are not quite the same when you refer to the various headings."
"However, we naturally share the same objective and we obviously need to reconcile our differences of opinion."
"We now have two months in which to do so."
"Secondly, Mr Lewandowski, regarding your comments on the consequences of the Treaty of Lisbon, we share your desire which is actually to consider that the ratification process has not yet been concluded and that it is therefore wise not to enter these costs in the budget."
"I think that we clearly share the same opinion on this issue."
"You mentioned Georgia."
"The European Commissioner has actually referred to this as one of the major issues that we need to resolve, and the Council has expressed its views on the subject."
"We must now endeavour to flesh out the policy areas identified yesterday afternoon."
"Mr Virrankoski, with regard to the preliminary draft budget, you say that it is already extremely tight and that what we are actually doing is tightening it even more."
"That is true."
"However, first we must draw a distinction between commitment appropriations and payment appropriations."
"In the case of commitment appropriations, there is an increase of just under 3% compared to 2008."
"I think that this shows how ambitious we are."
"Regarding payment appropriations, it is true that a reduction of a similar magnitude is planned."
"I tried to explain that we carried out a very detailed analysis and that this is not the result of a random and undiscerning method of reducing payment appropriations."
"It is purely and simply the result of an analysis of the rate of utilisation of appropriations of the various policies."
"I tried to explain this, heading by heading."
"To go back to heading 1 briefly, it is true that there is a reduction, but, at the same time, within that reduction, there is a planned increase of EUR 50 million for convergence countries and regions;"
"I wanted to mention this."
"Under heading 4 - the Commissioner mentioned this as well - there is an increase in appropriations for Palestine and Kosovo, and half of the reduction in appropriations entered in the draft budget relates to the emergency reserve that can be financed, as has been the case so far, through the redeployment of resources."
"Obviously, we have until November to discuss in more detail issues that are specific, clearly defined and subject to certain parameters, and we shall endeavour to find the best possible compromise, a compromise that would, of course, help us forge ahead."
"That was an important interim debate on the budget."
"You were all very quick to refer to the crisis and the war in Georgia."
"As you know, I made a statement to the European Council on that issue yesterday, and I sense that the opinion I expressed yesterday is shared by all sides in the European institutions. Thank you."
"Electronic communications networks and services - European Electronic Communications Market Authority - Common approach to the use of the spectrum released by the digital switchover - Electronic communications networks and services, protection of privacy and consumer protection (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"the report by Catherine Trautmann, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services, Directive 2002/19/EC on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities, and Directive 2002/20/EC on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services - C6-0427/2007 -,"
"the report by Pilar del Castillo Vera, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Electronic Communications Market Authority - C6-0428/2007 -,"
"the report by Patrizia Toia, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on reaping the full benefits of the digital dividend in Europe: a common approach to the use of the spectrum released by the digital switchover, and"
"the report by Malcolm Harbour, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2002/22/EC on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks, Directive 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on consumer-protection cooperation - C6-0420/2007 -."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you only have to look at some figures to see the strategic importance of telecommunications and new information technologies in Europe: telecom technologies alone account for one quarter of European growth and 40% of our productivity gains."
"If you look at a number of studies that have been conducted, you can see that, over the past 12 years, 50% of the growth gap between the US and Europe is linked to disparities in the development of our information and communication technologies."
"Europe therefore needs to invest in this sector on a long-term basis. A speedy revision of the EU's electronic communications regulatory framework is consequently essential to promote competitiveness and growth in the European economy."
"As I said at my hearing before the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, the objective of the French Presidency is to reach a political agreement at the Council of Telecoms Ministers on 27 November, the substance of which will, of course, be based as closely as possible on the positions adopted by the European Parliament."
"To achieve this, the Council has planned to hold some 15 working meetings throughout the second half of 2008."
"I should therefore like to take a few moments to inform you of the position prevailing in the Council on the main issues which are addressed by the three rapporteurs, Mrs Trautmann, Mrs del Castillo and Mr Harbour."
"My colleague, Éric Besson, will deal with Mrs Toia's report on the issue of the digital dividend."
"I should like to commend the quite considerable amount of work that has been done by the three rapporteurs on issues which I shall discuss in a moment."
"In my opinion, the work that they have done helps clarify the situation and provides a new basis for entering into discussions with the Council, and I should like to emphasise that there is a broad consensus between our two institutions, Parliament and the Council."
"Firstly, I should like to congratulate Catherine Trautmann for the work that she has done so far as rapporteur on the Directive amending the Framework Directives on 'access' and 'authorisation'."
"I should like to commend her willingness to take into account the challenge raised by the deployment of next-generation networks, a concern which is shared by all stakeholders in this sector and by the Member States."
"Mrs Trautmann, your report emphasises the need to continue to promote competition, especially infrastructure-based competition; that is the view of the Council."
"Your report suggests greater use of the geographical segmentation of the market in order to remove ex ante regulatory obligations where competition is effective."
"This second issue is being debated in the Council."
"I should now like to turn to the regulation of the markets, in particular the proposed extension of the Commission's right to veto remedies proposed by regulators."
"Mrs Trautmann emphasises in her report that the Commission should play the role of an arbitrator rather than of a judge; she is therefore proposing a coregulation mechanism whereby a matter may be referred to the reformed regulator group, for example, when a remedy proposed by a regulator is disputed by the Commission."
"Parliament's rapporteur is therefore seeking a compromise between the status quo and the right of veto which was originally proposed by the Commission and which, as you know, has met some opposition from the Member States."
"This constitutes real progress compared to the original text on what is a highly sensitive issue for the Council, which does not seem quite willing, at this moment in time, to give so much power to the Commission."
"Another issue that has been the subject of heated debate is functional separation."
"Mrs Trautmann's report proposes the retention of the imposition of functional separation as an exceptional remedy for national regulatory authorities (NRAs)."
"This exceptional remedy would be more restricted in terms of its implementation, since it would require both the prior agreement of the Commission and a favourable opinion from the Body of European Regulators in Telecommunications (BERT)."
"The approach adopted by the rapporteur generally seems to be consistent with the compromise emerging in the Council in this respect, namely the retention of the imposition of this remedy, without its use, however, being allowed to become widespread."
"Another major issue in these negotiations is the management of radio frequencies."
"Your rapporteur is, like the Council, in favour of a gradual approach to changes in spectrum management that strikes a balance between the principles of neutrality put forward by the Commission and the complexity of the management of this scarce resource."
"The report finally adopted by the Industry Committee also introduces a new element by advocating the creation of a Radio Spectrum Policy Committee (RSPC) responsible for advising the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on radio spectrum policy issues."
"This Committee would be assigned the task of establishing a strategic legislative programme on the use of radio spectrum."
"On this issue, I believe that the Council has taken into account the legitimate request from the European Parliament for it to be more involved in the formulation of broad guidelines for the management of radio frequencies, but, as you know, the Council also wants to avoid a situation where there are too many bodies responsible for this resource and to preserve the responsiveness required by these markets and by radio frequencies as a strategic resource for innovation."
"I wish to commend the quality of the report by Pilar del Castillo on the establishment of the European Electronic Communications Market Authority;"
"I would point out that it touches on a highly sensitive issue, one that is also the subject of a broad consensus between Parliament and the Council."
"The report, Mrs del Castillo, concludes that the European Authority, in the form originally proposed, is not the right solution to strengthen cooperation between regulators and promote the harmonisation of practices; this is also the Council's position."
"You are opposed to the creation of a European super-regulator and you are proposing the establishment of a body - BERT - which would be closer to the regulators, which would enjoy greater independence from the European Commission and which would have a much simpler structure and governance than those originally proposed."
"The Council is aware of all of these arguments but, as you know, a majority of Member States do still have some reservations about the idea of establishing a Community body."
"Over the next few weeks, the Council must therefore try to strike a balance between two options: the institutionalisation of a private-law body comprising European regulators or the establishment of a Community body whose independence must be guaranteed."
"My final comments relate to the report by Malcolm Harbour, whom I wish to thank for the quality of his work;"
"I especially welcome the fact that it takes into account fundamental consumer rights."
"Parliament, like the Council, supports the measures proposed by the Commission aimed at strengthening consumer protection, an issue that has come to the fore recently given the increased impact of communications services on the daily lives of our citizens."
"In particular, Mr Harbour's report proposes that the information to be included in contracts should be specified, that the measures to be taken by Member States for disabled users should be strengthened and that lead times should be reduced for number portability in order to improve competition."
"The Council broadly endorses all these measures."
"I think that the issue of the protection of privacy, which was dealt with under the enhanced cooperation procedure with Mr Alvaro in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, is also an important matter that needs to be addressed and I am delighted, for example, that unsolicited communications by SMS have been taken into account."
"As regards the specific issue of copyright, Mr Harbour's report proposes the retention of the obligation on network providers of electronic communications services to provide subscribers with all useful information on the unlawful uses of networks and services."
"It also proposes to encourage cooperation between all stakeholders in order to promote the dissemination of legal offers."
"These appear to be balanced measures, but we shall need to take into account that this is a highly sensitive issue, both for your House and for the Council."
"To conclude what I have to say on those areas for which I am responsible, Mr President, before handing over to my colleague, Éric Besson, on the issue of the digital dividend, we feel that Parliament and the Council are very much in agreement on these issues, although it is true that there are slight differences of opinion regarding the level of detail to be included in this Directive."
"We shall naturally do our utmost to continue working closely with Parliament and the Commission so that compromises may be reached between the three institutions as quickly as possible."
"Thank you, Mr Chatel."
"Luc Chatel is the Minister of State for Industry and Consumer Affairs."
"We break new ground today by hearing a second representative of the Council, namely Mr Éric Besson, Minister of State to the Prime Minister."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as my colleague, Luc Chatel, has just said, it falls to me to speak to you about the very important issue of the digital dividend."
"On 12 June 2008, the Council adopted conclusions on the Commission Communication entitled 'Reaping the full benefits of the digital dividend in Europe: a common approach to the use of the spectrum released by the digital switchover.'"
"The switch-off of analogue radio broadcasting will free up spectrum in the UHF band, which is particularly appealing due to the propagation properties of UHF radio waves."
"The switchover to digital broadcasting therefore offers an unprecedented opportunity of which we must reap the full benefits."
"That is the purpose of Mrs Toia's report on which you will be expressing an opinion, and, at this point, I should like to commend the quality of the work that she has done."
"As Mrs Toia has shown in her report, the combined value of the electronic communications services markets that depend on the use of the radio-wave spectrum in the EU amounts to more than EUR 250 billion, or about 2.2% of the EU's annual gross domestic product."
"Good spectrum management can significantly contribute to the Lisbon goals of competitiveness and economic growth and satisfy a wide range of the social, cultural and economic needs of European citizens."
"In practical terms, wise and judicious use of the digital dividend will help reduce the digital divide, especially in underprivileged, remote or rural areas."
"As your rapporteur rightly points out, radio spectrum released by the digital switchover needs to be reallocated as soon as possible."
"I can tell you now that the Council essentially agrees with the rapporteur's view that a coordinated approach to the use of spectrum at European level will ensure the optimal use of the digital dividend."
"The identification of a harmonised sub-band for new electronic communications services will enable operators and equipment manufacturers to benefit from a market of sufficient size."
"This is a strategic issue for the industrial and political development of Europe."
"If Europe succeeds in coordinating action on the digital dividend, as it did for GSM, it will be presented with a historic opportunity of relaunching, over the next 20 years, a major policy for the benefit of its industry and consumers."
"However, as emphasised by Ministers last June, the Council considers that we should respect the principle to ensure flexibility of usage of the digital dividend notwithstanding constraints necessary to avoid harmful interference or to promote general interest objectives such as large availability of the service or media pluralism and cultural and linguistic diversity."
"National discussions on spectrum allocation must proceed with all speed, but, if the Community approach is to be successful, it must remain consistent with the national decisions currently being taken on the reuse of frequencies."
"I should like to conclude by saying that the Council therefore calls on the Commission - and I know that it has already done so - to initiate the studies and consultations necessary to define a coherent basis for the coordinated usage of spectrum."
"The Commission is also called on to support and assist the Member States in achieving this goal."
"The Council is therefore looking forward with great interest to the Commission's report to be submitted by December 2008 on the results of this process and on any further steps required."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteurs, Catherine Trautmann, Pilar del Castillo Vera, Patrizia Toia and Malcolm Harbour, for very difficult work and very constructive proposals."
"I would like to thank Parliament generally, because the work has been very hard, and I know it has involved a very thorough and extensive preparation - hearings with the stakeholders and the consideration of literally of hundreds of amendments - and I know that you have also been working against the clock, but it is often in such circumstances that the best results are achieved, and that certainly applies here."
"No matter how adequate the existing regulatory framework is in many respects, everybody agrees that there is a real need to improve it."
"Why?"
"We have to reinforce the protection of consumers by ensuring that they can exercise a properly informed choice between a variety of competing products and services."
"We have to ensure that when Member States manage their national spectrum - which is a very precious resource, as has already been said - they realise social and economic benefits because their management is efficient, transparent and flexible and because there is better coordination at EU level."
"We have to make sure that our regulatory system will facilitate and not hinder investments in next-generation networks so that Europe remains competitive in the 21st century."
"Finally - and this underlies all our endeavours - we must reinforce the internal market."
"This is not about paying lip service but about equipping the EU with an efficient competitive single market that brings economy of scale not only to the electronic communications sector but also to the citizens and to the wider economy."
"It is this economy at large which benefits and which has to be reinforced."
"Let us take advantage of our European continent: let us get rid of the barriers that lead to the fragmentation and to less economic and social efficiency."
"All of these four fundamental subjects - consumer protection, spectrum, investment and the internal market - are very important, and Parliament has understood that."
"I must congratulate Parliament for identifying the underlying problems and having made the right diagnosis for putting forward real solutions."
"Let me now pass to the internal-market mechanisms."
"That is where the stakes are highest and where the discussion ahead with the Council still promises to be very difficult."
"I say this in spite of the recognition by the ministers themselves at the end of the Slovenian presidency that we need to improve the consistency of the internal market for electronic communications."
"Recognition is all very well, but what are the solutions?"
"Parliament has rightly seen that there is just one debate - not two - when it comes to the body and to the mechanisms for improving the functioning of the internal market, in particular the Article 7 mechanisms for notification of national market reviews."
"Those are the two sides of the same internal market coin - they belong together."
"We all know that the existing arrangements for cooperation between national regulators within the Community framework - i.e. the European Regulators Group (ERG) - have to be improved if they are to be useful."
"That is why the Commission welcomes the amendments that build on the Commission's proposal for a more transparent, accountable and effective form of cooperation."
"Above all, the Commission welcomes Parliament's proposals for a Community body."
"Such a Community body, with all it entails, has to be fit for purpose: it has to operate in such a way that it is efficient, fair and reliable, and also above the suspicion that it is perhaps closer to some regulators than to others."
"That is why, if we are to be coherent, we must also be coherent with the financing."
"National financing, in whatever proportion, will call a body's credibility into question and will open the door to administrative and legal uncertainty."
"We know from experience that hybrid financing creates problems, so we have to avoid creating such problems."
"In this respect, I would like to warn Parliament to be on its guard against what I call the Belgian football club approach, which I must explain to you."
"You know that the ERG was created by the Commission as an adviser to the Commission."
"Recently, the national regulators established a private body law under Belgian law to act as a secretariat to the International Regulators Group - the IRG."
"The IRG operates outside the Community framework - it has a membership beyond the 27 Member States - and in practice nobody understands where the IRG begins and where the ERG ends."
"The Commission wanted to end this confusion by establishing a clearly defined and accountable authority."
"We certainly do not want a Belgian private body, alien to the Community approach and the guarantees it provides, to become involved in European decision-making."
"That is why there is still a need for further consideration on a number of legal and institutional issues concerning the establishment of the body, in particular its governance structure."
"We have to find the right means to safeguard the independence of the national regulators in a way that guarantees a Community-based approach."
"But, above all, I must stress the fact that the body is a means to an end and not the end in itself."
"The body is nothing more than an instrument in order to improve regulatory consistency."
"That is why the other side of the internal market coin is so important and that is why the European Parliament is absolutely right to reinforce the Article 7 consistency procedure for notifying national market reviews in which, by the way, the body will play its part."
"Parliament's new arbitration mechanism in Article 7a shows that the Commission and Parliament stand together in seeing the need for operational consistency mechanisms that will make a real difference."
"Parliament's solution is to enable the Commission to step in to require a national regulator to change its regulatory approach if, after a peer review by the body, a problem has been identified."
"We have to discuss further details of Parliament's approach so as to respect the institutional balance laid down in the Treaty, but what I find absolutely right is the logic of the approach taken, which is to find a balance between the interests of subsidiarity and those of the internal market, and then to draw clear operational conclusions."
"Thanks to a peer review carried out through the body, there is a means to benefit from the pooled experience of the national regulators, alongside their sensitivity to what are legitimate local differences."
"It surely makes sense that when the body advises that there is an internal market problem, in conjunction with the concerns raised by the Commission as the guardian of the Treaty, then there should be consequences."
"In the interests of the internal market and of legal (and 'legal' also means business) certainty, there must be a power for the Commission to require the notifying national regulator to change its approach in such a case, because we cannot accept that, having been through the very lengthy Article 7 review process the notifying national regulator can say 'thank you very much for your point of view, but I prefer my approach', and to simply act as if nothing had happened."
"That is why I congratulate Parliament, which is right to say that the whole process cannot simply end in a whimper."
"Industry, consumers and taxpayers will not appreciate it if we build sophisticated and time-consuming regulatory systems which are not capable of making a difference."
"That is why the system needs to have a backstop, namely that ultimately there can be a binding decision of the Commission."
"I mentioned earlier the importance of creating a regulatory framework friendly to new investments."
"That is why the Commission, in its proposal, not only maintained but reinforced the competition-based approach to regulation as competitive markets drive new investment."
"That is also why the Commission is grateful to the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for trying to make the telecom rules more investment-friendly, especially as regards the large investments that are needed to modernise the old copper wires by putting fast optical fibre network into place."
"These outdated local loops - and that is the vast majority of European households and small businesses which depend on being connected to the internet - represent the choke point of the high-speed internet, the point where the information superhighway slows down to a crawl, and that is why I applaud Parliament's move to encourage infrastructure competition on these next-generation access networks by proactively promoting the sharing of the ducts that house the new fibres, and the risk-sharing of new facilities."
"These efforts are welcome and are in line with the recommendation that I am currently preparing to give guidance for national regulators on these issues."
"But the upgrading of the choke points in the high-speed internet must not become a new and enduring bottleneck for competition in the future, and we have plenty of evidence that the transition to fibre will make the business case for alternative investors much more difficult, because unbundling of fibre is currently neither technically nor economically possible, which means that alternative operators must invest in their own fibre or use a bitstream service of the incumbent."
"We have to face the facts: in many geographical zones, where infrastructure competition proves not to be feasible, appropriate regulation will continue to be the only way to keep competition alive."
"Competition brings lower prices, better quality of services and more choice, so that consumers are the real winners."
"But I do not kid myself. I can see that Parliament shares these concerns."
"Choice needs to be real; consumers need to be empowered to make the best out of competition, and to be empowered means they need to be informed."
"That is why the enhanced ability to switch your supplier is so important."
"I welcome Parliament's support on the need to ensure that number portability is completed within one day."
"If it can happen in Australia within two hours, then one day should be entirely feasible in Europe."
"I also welcome the clarity that Parliament has added with the changes on enhanced consumer information, so that consumers really know what service they are getting from their providers and can make useful comparisons."
"This enhanced transparency also serves to support the open architecture of the internet, which we underline; which we want; which we defend."
"If there are any restrictions on accessing the internet, it is imperative that the consumers are clearly informed of what those restrictions are, and I am glad to see that both the Commission and Parliament stand in agreement on these points."
"However, what I find more difficult is to understand why Parliament has changed the text in such a way that subscribers are not similarly empowered and informed when it comes to the privacy of their personal data."
"I know that Parliament takes the protection of consumers and of citizens' fundamental rights very seriously, and that is why I am so surprised that the breach notification requirements in the Commission's proposals are diluted by the changes now on the table."
"The default position should be that subscribers know of a breach of security concerning their personal data so that they can take precautions, and it cannot be left to the service provider to determine whether such a breach is likely to cause a subscriber harm - it is the subscriber and his own data which have to be protected."
"How, for example, can a provider know how sensitive that information is in an individual case?"
"I would, therefore, urge Parliament to reconsider its position on this issue."
"Finally, concerning spectrum: I had no need to persuade Parliament of the importance of this subject."
"That is why the Commission welcomes the politicisation of the debate surrounding the spectrum issue."
"This debate goes far beyond the technical level."
"Even if it will continue to owe a great deal to the hard work and solutions produced by the Radio Spectrum Committee, much has been achieved by the radio spectrum decision."
"We should preserve this."
"But Parliament is right: more progress depends on integrating a political layer to this process, so that the stakes can be properly debated."
"A more efficient - and that means a more coordinated - approach among Member States brings about the prospect of a win-win scenario, whereby the achievement of social and cultural goals is enhanced alongside the great benefit for Europe's economy."
"Important progress in maximising the digital dividend and other questions related to this can only be assured with the strategy and important political decisions agreed both by Parliament and the Council."
"So the Commission supports Parliament's legitimate goal of greater involvement in setting spectrum policy and accepts in principle the changes Parliament is proposing."
"Of course, the Council will have its say."
"I wish to signal that the Commission will stand by Parliament in this debate and will help the Council to arrive at an agreement with Parliament."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, for the reform of the regulatory framework that we are discussing to be justifiable, it has to bring about tangible improvements, both for consumers in terms of prices, access and connection speed and for companies in terms of the prospect of fair competition, new investment and competitiveness."
"The large number of stakeholders involved means that there are divergent, even contradictory, interests at play."
"For my part, from a very early stage, I made a point of listening to views on all sides and also of sending a timely and reliable message to companies and consumers in order to build or rebuild their trust."
"Electronic communications are a real opportunity for European growth."
"The sector accounts for 3% of European GDP."
"We still need to be able to reap the full benefits of this potential in the EU in terms of investment and the development of services."
"This requires competition, but not competition alone."
"Steps need to be taken to create conditions for responsible and sustainable development; in other words, to build an ecosystem for the sort of knowledge economy that we all want to see."
"We must now consider ICT as a resource."
"It is therefore a matter of both public and private concern that requires us to support flexible rules and the responsibility of all stakeholders through cooperation between regulators and the Commission, in the same way that operators and customers cooperate on the basis of a contractual agreement."
"There are four key areas that I want to see strengthened: firstly, customer service, whether in terms of access - through the more widespread territorial deployment of networks - fair prices or quality; secondly, sustained industrial activity with a view to stimulating job creation and innovation, since technological progress is also effective in bringing down prices; thirdly, the competitiveness of small and large companies in order to guarantee sustainable competition in the EU Member States and the necessary investment, especially in fibre optics, that will enable us to compete more effectively in a global market; and, finally, legal certainty - the need to ensure the reliability of the system by giving responsibility to those involved and encouraging mutual cooperation, especially among regulators but also between regulators and the Commission."
"I was pleased to note that, on this basis, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy accepted my compromise proposals - often by a large majority - and I should like to thank my colleagues for making themselves so readily available, despite deadlines that were, at times, rather tight but which meant that we have been able to keep to the timetable with a view to achieving the objective of amending this Regulation before the end of the current parliamentary term."
"This is the result of a collective effort."
"I personally feel that the sector has generally responded positively to these guidelines, and I hope that our partners in the Council will do likewise."
"I have listened carefully to Mr Chatel and Mr Besson and their views, as well as to Commissioner Reding, and I should like to thank them for their informed and generally positive opinions."
"To come back to the points that are still under discussion, I should like to talk about the issue of remedies."
"Without any encroachment on the powers of national regulators, a consensus has emerged on the need for a more consistent application of remedies at EU level."
"However, there has been unanimous - or almost unanimous - rejection of the Commission proposal that it should have the right to veto remedies."
"Under the mechanism provided for in my report, each body has its rightful place: the Commission may raise doubts about a remedy but cannot completely reject it unless BERT also delivers a negative opinion."
"Conversely, for functional separation to be imposed as a remedy, this would require the agreement of both the Commission and BERT."
"With a restriction of this nature, such separation remains a tangible threat but one which cannot be imposed lightly."
"As regards radio spectrum, our proposals are directed towards more flexible management of this scarce resource but in a moderate and proportionate manner, whilst, at the same time, introducing measures aimed at optimising spectrum management."
"For us, the first building block is a genuine European spectrum policy that could be presented, once the package has been adopted, at a major conference to be held early in the next parliamentary term."
"As regards new networks, these were absent from the Commission proposal, or poorly addressed, at a time when Europe is already involved in this technological revolution."
"We felt that it was essential immediately to provide the Member States and regulators with the guidelines and tools that they need to encourage investment and manage, where necessary, the deployment of these networks. For this reason, our proposals were validated by a panel of recognised experts just before the summer holidays."
"A final issue has arisen rather late in the day: the protection of intellectual property rights."
"It is unfortunate that this debate has come to the fore at this stage in the review of the telecom package;"
"I think that it would be out of place to discuss mechanisms for ensuring full respect for intellectual property rights here."
"I just want to say that I hope that we shall be able to complete the review of this Package without undue pressure and without being disrupted by this issue, albeit an important one, given that creative content is the subject of a Commission communication."
"I shall deal with the remaining points in the two minutes that I have to conclude."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, I would like to begin by emphasising what Mr Chatel said: the electronic communications sector is responsible for 25% of European growth and 40% of productivity."
"In short, these numbers confirm the Lisbon Agenda statements on the need to develop a European economy based on knowledge, where the great driver of development is, in fact, electronic communications."
"The Commission has demonstrated this knowledge and awareness by proposing a set of measures which redefine the regulatory framework which was adopted in 2002."
"Several markets have been deregulated and there are still some important regulations pending whose aim is to give full forward thrust to the competitiveness of the internal market."
"I shall, however, focus of course on Parliament's position."
"A position, Mr Chatel, representative of the Council, Mrs Viviane Reding, representative of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, which has a common denominator, a factor which makes Parliament's position, in my opinion, an extraordinarily consistent, coherent and powerful one."
"And the common denominator in the reports drawn up by Parliament and approved by the appropriate committees, is simply the concept of shared responsibility."
"The report by Mrs Trautmann is based on shared responsibility."
"The proposal to establish a body of national regulators is based on shared responsibility."
"We have heard in both cases that shared responsibility is the tool still needed today in the electronic telecommunications market in Europe, and everything that has been proposed stems from that concept of shared responsibility, whether it relates to interplay in shared regulation between the Commission and the board of national regulators, known as BERT, or to the organisation and funding of BERT."
"As time is pressing and the debates have already been lengthy and will continue to be in the future, I must now refer solely to BERT."
"This is a proposal which fits in which the concept of shared responsibility and developing an essentially successful market which still requires a few props up front in order to adjust fully to the rules of competition, a board based on cooperation between the Commission and the Member States in the form of the regulatory bodies."
"Against that background, and in view of the current situation, the board's duties are better defined, as are its structure, responsibility, accountability and funding."
"And to that end I should like to say, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Chatel, that it is essential to maintain cohesiveness and consistency."
"The co-funding that I have proposed and advocate for the board is compatible with the concept of shared responsibility which forms the backbone of any proposal made by Parliament, both in Mrs Trautmann's report and in my own."
"What would not, by contrast, be consistent and cohesive would be for a funding mechanism strictly based on Community funding to slip in through the back door; it would not be consistent with the remainder of the proposal and would therefore bring about an enormous dysfunction with the concept and rationale behind the reform which Parliament is proposing."
"I am convinced that both Parliament and the Commission, as well as the Council, are seeking to achieve the same objectives, we have proved as much, and I call for the equilibrium and good understanding we have so far had to continue so that we can pursue that course."
"The sector we are debating is worth it."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the telecommunications world any medium which allows the transmission of voice, data and images is a precious resource."
"This is why the idea that in a few years' time there will be a significant, not to say massive, quantity of radio spectrum available, in other words new frequencies available for new uses, is a huge social and cultural opportunity as well as an economic and commercial one: in fact, someone has even quantified the commercial value of the digital dividend already."
"We therefore need a suitable European policy, capable of exploiting this resource to the maximum, and turning Europe into a driver and not just an assembler of national policies."
"As we all know, in other parts of the world, such as Japan and the USA, this resource is already being used to great effect, thereby giving businesses in those regions a competitive edge."
"We have therefore got some time to make up - or at any rate use rapidly - and even if the digital switchover is completed in 2012 - a date which should be absolutely and comprehensively respected - we need to focus now, without delay, on reforming the radio spectrum and on the digital dividend."
"The radio spectrum is a natural and hence a public resource."
"Its value must therefore be exploited, for economic purposes certainly, but it also has a social value which must be exploited for the benefit of the general public, for example by guaranteeing wide accessibility for all citizens, including the disadvantaged, by bringing broadband services to the most remote areas of our country and thus eliminating the digital divide which is still a feature of so many parts of Europe, and I am not just thinking of rural areas but also of urban and industrial areas."
"I was saying that time presses for the digital dividend and I think that we need to use this last part of the parliamentary term to make some progress together, Member States and Europe alike."
"To the Commission and the Council I would say: move forward together in the direction of a more positive response to the need for harmonisation, a response which, as we have all been saying, will enable us to make optimal and more effective use of the digital dividend."
"We are hoping for strong coordination at European level and an ability to speak with one voice in the international negotiations, which have opened, I believe, in Geneva."
"Our report makes various points and I will just single out one or two: the need for a win-win strategy, as the Commissioner was saying, in other words an allocation of resources which satisfies audiovisual and media operators - who are already present in the field to ensure cultural pluralism and to defend cultural identities - and also answers the needs of and provides adequate space for telecommunications sectors, which need to develop new services and a broad range of technologies to respond to new requirements from modern consumers."
"This means that media and telecommunications can operate together, in the spirit of colleagues, and on a level playing field."
"However, there is a third party who I would like to see being a winner as well as the others: namely those users, even unlicensed users, who are represented by charitable bodies, local entities, small community networks and general interest associations."
"Another point, with which I will conclude, Mr President, is one on which, as the Council representatives also said, there are differing views, in Parliament and between the various Member States, and that concerns the level of collaboration between the various authorities in this field."
"I believe that on the one hand - and here Parliament is in agreement - we must respect the responsibility of Member States in terms of allocating frequencies, but we must also assess together the vital need for harmonisation, because we should all be aware that if we fail to harmonise, if we fail to coordinate and fail to take common decisions, the economic and social value of the spectrum will be diminished."
"In my mind, I think of the successful and happy outcome of the GSM."
"Therefore, on the basis of cost/benefit analyses carried out in various countries, as part of national projects, regarding the dividend sought by our report, on the basis of the broadest possible debate to be held in the Member States, involving both operators and the general public, I believe that in the end, with a big dose of political will at European level, we must all come to recognise the added value of a Europe-wide management of this resource which will, I believe, offer a challenge to Europe both socially and economically."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, it is a privilege for me to be back here as rapporteur for the second time, because I was rapporteur for this directive in 2001."
"It has also been a privilege to work with my colleagues, Mrs Trautmann and Mrs del Castillo, because this has been a team effort."
"This is a package."
"As the Commissioner said, it has been a major achievement."
"That is why we want to reform and improve consumers' rights, so that they are well informed and able to take advantage of the offers that are available and able to encourage innovation."
"We need a structure that will work, of course, and I would remind the Commissioner that it was this Parliament that argued for the Commission's role under Article 7."
"We supported that role, against the Council at the time."
"Nobody is more aware than this Parliament of the importance of getting the balance right, but, in looking at the team position, I would almost say that it is time for the regulators not just to accept responsibility, at a national level, for implementing the regulation consistently, but also to take on a share of that Community policymaking work."
"In my view, whatever we end up with will only work if they have a stake in that body - I will leave you to decide what I mean by that!"
"I want to pay tribute to all members of the team that worked with me on improving this directive."
"I thank both the Minister and the Commissioner for the kind remarks they have made about the improvements we have put forward."
"It is a combination of work on users' rights and on the E-Privacy Directive."
"In this Parliament, responsibility for data protection and the residual expertise lies with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"In my view, it was a mistake to package the two together, but I think we have managed it successfully."
"My colleague Alexander Alvaro will respond on those aspects, and the Commissioner should thank him for actually putting in the details of how data-breach notification works, because it was entirely unacceptable for the Commission to send us a proposal in which all the implementing details were delegated to a committee."
"Those are big political decisions."
"I agree with you that we still have a bit of work to do, but you should certainly thank him in the first place for doing that job for you."
"As far as my side is concerned, I am disappointed that the whole of the universal service aspect is coming later."
"We are doing this in two bites."
"We are awaiting your report, which will come shortly."
"I have made the most of the users' rights aspects, but we still have work to do."
"By that I mean that we want those empowered, well-informed consumers to make their choices on the basis of maximum clear information on price, on what is in the service, on whether there are any restrictions, and on whether the cost of a handset is included if they take a longer contract."
"We want them to be able to shop easily and to be able to transfer their number quickly, and I am glad you support us on that point."
"We also want them to be able to study the length of the contract and for the length of contract not to be used as a restriction when they try to move."
"We also want to look at consumers' entitlements."
"They are entitled to data security."
"They are entitled to secure and available networks."
"They are entitled to networks where operators are not blocking anti-competitively a particular content or service."
"We agree with your idea of having a new quality of service obligation, and think we have improved on that."
"This is a very important entitlement."
"Consumers are entitled to good quality universal emergency services and to caller location services."
"Disabled users in particular are entitled to those services as well, and to better services."
"However, I feel that consumers are also entitled to be informed about some of the problems they might encounter, be this potential for infringing copyright, potential for unauthorised use or potential, for example, for buying things that could damage their health, like counterfeit medicines."
"Why should we not demand that electronic service providers carry public service messages in the same way that television channels do at the moment?"
"That is what we are talking about, colleagues."
"We are not talking about this as a mechanism for enforcing copyright, which is the responsibility of national governments, but we are talking about making life easier and better for consumers."
"We have a bit of work to do, Commissioner, but I am pleased to say that I have agreement on a large packet of compromises and I am confident that they will be adopted."
"I look forward to working with the French presidency to meet the ambitious timetable, because Europe needs us to meet that timetable."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (DE) Madam President, the interest of the Committee on Budgets in the legislation on electronic communication, the so-called telecom package, is naturally focused on the part involving expenditure from the European budget."
"In other words, we are interested in the agency - the European Electronic Communications Market Authority proposed by the Commission and renamed the Body of European Regulators in Telecommunications (BERT) by our colleagues in the specialised committee."
"To put it plainly, as things stand, we do not have enough money under subheading 1a for this agency in either form."
"For this reason, we very much welcome the fact that the lead committee has taken our amendments on board in its report and is proposing a structure that puts less strain on our budget."
"We must all work together, however, to ensure that we make BERT a European body and that we in the European Parliament retain control of it."
"I must also remind the House that, under Article 47 of the Interinstitutional Agreement, Parliament and the Council must reach agreement on the funding of BERT."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (DE) Madam President, as draftsman of the opinion on the first part - better lawmaking - in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I refer the House to my written opinion, but there are three points to which I attach particular importance."
"The first is the promotion and development of fibre-optic networks, known as next-generation networks."
"In order to promote these networks, consideration must be given to risk-sharing for the funding of new facilities and to sharing of ducts."
"Besides the telecommunications companies, other public enterprises must also be involved in duct-sharing."
"My second point - and this has already been touched upon - is that the Commission's centralisation drive, pursued by means of the authority, the right of veto and comitology procedure, must be firmly resisted."
"Thirdly, the precise distribution of frequencies should not be laid down until numerous preliminary questions have been answered."
"Does responsibility lie with the EU?"
"For which aspects is it competent?"
"What is the real extent of the digital dividend?"
"And what is the impact of specific distribution models?"
"Secondary services such as wireless microphone systems must not be endangered, for such systems are responsible for major transmissions of events such as the Olympic Games."
"For that reason the results of the current studies by specialised bodies must be taken into account in the political decision-making process on the distribution of the frequency spectrum."
"I hope that we shall then jointly achieve European added value for all stakeholders."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - Madam President, Europe's ability to be the leader in the field of telecoms and mobile internet is dependent on our ability to open up to new innovations and new services."
"From that perspective, it would be dangerous to try and defend old structures and old players."
"We need to open up, and that is why it is so important to use the digital dividend in a way that frees up the whole of the spectrum for new services and new opportunities, while at the same time defending old broadcasters and their services of today."
"The possibility of developing different services in all parts of the spectrum must be freed up."
"Where infrastructure competition is not there already, we must ensure that there is real competition via a functional separation."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (DE) Madam President, allow me, in the space of sixty seconds, to make a few brief remarks on behalf of my honourable colleague Bernard Rapkay."
"Particularly for us Socialists, the creation of a smooth-functioning internal market in telecommunication services is a very high priority."
"We welcome the active role of the Commission in this domain."
"In particular, consumers must be protected against the obvious abuses of power on the part of the large operators."
"There is clearly still plenty of room for fee reductions."
"The Commission's initiatives on roaming show that interventions in price-setting are necessary in a market economy too."
"We prefer to see the visible hand of the Commission than feel the invisible hand of the market, which is often the hand of a pickpocket in consumers' purses and wallets."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (FR) I shall conclude, Madam President, by thanking all the rapporteurs and especially Catherine Trautmann, who has done a tremendous job, as a result of which we can expect a very large majority tomorrow."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (NL) Madam President, the package in itself contains sound proposals for protecting consumer rights and privacy, but unfortunately it lacks coherence and so creates legal uncertainty both for businesses and for consumers, because the scope is completely unclear."
"I have the feeling that the Commission has let itself be led more by the internal institutional structures and the legal basis than by the real facts, because what are we actually talking about exactly?"
"Is it about telephone systems?"
"Surely that is completely out of date!"
"Or is it about mobile phones?"
"What is Skype then?"
"What are telephone payment services?"
"Are they telecoms too?"
"What about RFID networks?"
"It is not clear."
"Why are there rules for reporting breaches for telecom and Internet providers but not, for instance, for banks, insurance companies and social services, which often use the same data?"
"What if the personal data collected by a firm are used by someone else, such as government departments, the police, the judicial authorities, as laid down in the data protection directive?"
"Who is responsible for those data then?"
"What use is that to a citizen?"
"Where can I turn to as a citizen?"
"Finally, I think we have to start looking urgently with the United States at transatlantic and international standards in this area."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (FI) Madam President, Ministers, Commissioners, and Mrs Trautmann in particular, now is the time to think in actual terms of human rights in the information society, which we are improving, with democracy and good business practice as the main objectives."
"Improvement is therefore necessary, and we are also improving the protection of privacy and security, as in the case of junk mail."
"We insist on the principle of right of access playing a role and we are legislating on access to services, which is no insignificant matter: charges need to be low and broadband for everyone, for example, is a civil right."
"We have now strengthened the status of the elderly and disabled in particular, and I think that is a humane and proper goal."
"Secondly, the networks need to be competitive and we have to stop operators from preventing competition."
"Instead, competition needs to be given a boost, and data terminal equipment on which you can only listen to one operator should not be allowed to be made."
"That would be as crazy as having a radio which only played one station."
"Broadcasters should now and always be guaranteed their own frequencies, because they never have the money to take part in auctions."
"That is actually a firm basis for the information society, and we must always preserve it."
"We nevertheless need room for 3G, and that is being organised."
"We also need to ensure there is room for new technologies and innovation."
"I have one more thing to say."
"The fairer and more technically advanced Europe is, the better we will do both as a democratic force in the information society and as a community which fulfils the Lisbon objectives, which at present feel a long way off."
"It is up to us: this is a legislative package which is a step in the right direction."
"Rapporteur for opinion of the IMCO Committee. - (RO) Mrs. President, dear colleagues, Mrs. Commissioner, dear Ministers, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs involved in the work with the Telecom package."
"I think Mrs. Trautmann's report represents a balanced position and I support the compromise amendments proposed."
"I am also glad that certain amendments were accepted, in particular those regarding the harmonization of the spectrum, as well as certain measures related to the global telecommunication services."
"The European economic growth, as well as the consumer welfare, depends on a dynamic and competitive telecommunication sector."
"Competitive markets have broadband available, the new comers on the market have brought increased speed and innovating services."
"The framework directive in the telecommunication package should focus on increasing investments; we also have to take into account next-generation networks and consumer options have to be more diversified, leading to lower costs and better services to their advantage."
"In conclusion, I would like to express my confidence in the changes we intend to bring to the Telecom package, which shall be to the benefit of consumers, providing them with a broad range, lower costs and more diversified services."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (HU) Thank you, Madam President."
"We can safely say that the Union can be credited with successes in the electronic communications sector over the last decade."
"Together with this, there are still some cross-border problems and inequalities with regard to access to broadband, the spread of the digital society and services."
"If we really want a 'common' market, the conditions for it must be created."
"As a result of the debates held over the last few months, we voted in favour of creating BERT, which would simplify cooperation by the national regulatory authorities and would guarantee actual participation."
"We still think that BERT should be accountable to and transparent to the European institutions."
"However, a condition for this is Community funding; cofinancing by the Member States would apparently ensure greater independence and efficiency, but this is not the case: we would pull this organisation out from under the control of the European Union and the European Parliament."
"We cannot contribute to this."
"We must continue to fight, with the Commission, to protect the interests of consumers, so that they should only have to bear the costs of the ever-expanding, new technologies where this is necessary, and so that, similarly to roaming, consumers cannot be swindled through invoicing either. Thank you."
"Madam President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education, let me point out that it is extremely important to treat the intellectual rights of originators as equal fundamental rights."
"All of us, especially legislators, should bear in mind that if intellectual creativity is not protected and if, in the name of protecting personal data, the legal rights of originators are infringed, then the artistic content made available to users will also be restricted."
"Piracy and the illegal distribution of music and films on the Internet are an indisputable reality."
"The downside of technology, however, is that the injured party is the originators."
"Whether we like it or not, they are the source of the material on offer."
"On behalf of the Committee on Culture, I thus call on all Members in all committees and political groups to protect European creativity, thus safeguarding artistic content provided via new media."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - (NL) Madam President, Commissioner Reding has once again shown her decisiveness with the telecom package."
"As regards the Commission proposal on the digital dividend, for the Committee on Culture and Education I worked with Mrs Toia very constructively."
"On behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, I should also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Mrs Niebler, for her excellent cooperation."
"The Committee on Culture and Education sees radio and television as vital media for disseminating culture and language."
"With the switchover from analogue to digital television, there is room available on the spectrum at the moment."
"Mobile phone and broadband Internet providers are very interested in those frequencies."
"The Committee on Culture and Education is not opposed to technological innovation, but it wants the rights of the present users, public and commercial, to be protected."
"The cultural and linguistic diversity of broadcasts must continue to be fully guaranteed and the interests of consumers and their investment in television equipment must be safeguarded."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - Mr President, it is important to underline that the telecom evolution is not only a technological and economic process, but also a social and cultural event."
"We should maintain and sanction the leading role of Europe in this process."
"Two aspects should be taken into consideration: general and democratic access to electronic communications services, which means that everyone should have the right to access such services, and also the principle that culture and educational heritage should be transmitted and respected."
"The Committee on Culture has tried to strike a balance between these interests."
"As the draftsperson in the Committee on Culture on the Body of European Regulators in Telecom (BERT), I only focused on the aspects which come under the responsibility of the Committee on Culture."
"The BERT should be open to contacts not only with industry and the consumer groups, but with culture interest groups as well, as they can provide useful and reliable information on cultural aspects."
"I think if we use the telecom evolution properly, the whole process can contribute to making Europe the world's leading knowledge society - which is our main goal."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - (FR) Madam President, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their work."
"The Committee on Culture and Education has, from the outset, taken this whole issue very seriously because we can no longer legislate on the electronic network or on radio spectrum whilst ignoring the real nature of the content being distributed."
"This cannot be done on the basis of purely technical or even economic criteria which do not take into account the objectives of cultural policy or the safeguarding of diversity."
"The reality of a digital world requires us to work together with television broadcasters and electronic service providers and to legislate for an internal market in telecommunications which has become inseparable from the audiovisual market."
"We also need a balanced response to the problem of illegal content on the Internet which will compel each of us to face up to our own responsibilities in a struggle that must concern us all if our children and our culture as we know it are to be protected."
"I therefore support all these texts in their current form and I hope that our debate and the final vote will not be contaminated by ill-informed external pressure."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (PL) Madam President, European framework legislation on telecommunications was adopted in the 1990s, effectively freeing national markets from state monopolies."
"It resulted in a significant fall in the prices of calls offered by competing operators."
"Recent years have seen revolutionary changes in communication technology: cell phones and the development of the Internet and wireless networks have diametrically changed the face of telecommunication."
"EU law must reflect these changes, including the social implications."
"Some 15% of Europeans are disabled, and by 2020 the elderly will constitute 25% of society."
"It is precisely these people with special needs who should be provided with easier access to telecommunication services."
"It is necessary to ensure cost-free access to a common alarm number, 112, for people throughout the Union, including users of Internet telephony, and to other electronic voice communication services."
"Furthermore, customers must have the right to be fully informed both of the legal obligations arising from the use of a given service, for example with respect to author's rights, and of the legally imposed restrictions."
"Above all, the key to better consumer protection is precise definition of the responsibilities of national regulatory bodies with respect to the day-to-day exercise of consumers' rights."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (ES) Madam President, the rapporteur, Mrs Trautmann, has said that intellectual property issues should not be part of this debate."
"I agree with her because I believe that protection of intellectual property, like the protection of privacy and other legal concepts, have already been defined in other legal frameworks."
"However, it should be pointed out now that the protection of intellectual property is still important as regards content updates."
"Telecommunications have been described as super-highways where one can move freely; but if someone commits a crime on the motorway, the police step in."
"You cannot steal a car, drive it on the motorway and, when the police step in, say there is free movement on the motorway."
"I believe that it is important from Parliament's point of view for us to restate the importance of protecting intellectual property, to restate protection for private life, to restate even the right people have to privacy, a right which at the moment is being violated by major telecommunications companies."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - (DE) Madam President, if you granted me the same speaking time as the three previous speakers, that would suit me fine."
"I should observe in passing, however, that I was under the impression that I would have two and a half minutes."
"So as not to waste any of that time, let me thank Malcolm Harbour, Catherine Trautmann and Pilar del Castillo Vera for our truly outstanding cooperation, to which Malcolm has already referred."
"We tackled this issue without friction in a spirit of mutual trust and in particularly close cooperation."
"It is, unfortunately, too late now to correct the structural defect of having the two directives lumped together."
"Nevertheless, let me say in the brief time at my disposal that I am very pleased that the Commission addressed the general issue of data privacy, albeit rather superficially."
"The fact is, Commissioner, that you would probably not give me your credit-card details, your telephone number and your address, even if I asked nicely."
"The problem, when you are on the Net, is that much of this information may well be there already, in places you cannot imagine and where you would not like it to be."
"To that extent I am pleased that I was able, in cooperation with other groups and Members, to help ensure that the right of consumers to have their personal details treated confidentially and their personal systems protected will be incorporated into this package."
"I see that time is running out, but I do hope we shall have more opportunities to discuss this or that issue more thoroughly."
"May I therefore say thank you again for our constructive cooperation, and perhaps we shall manage to advance the development of data privacy in Europe for the benefit of consumers."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, let me also begin with a word of thanks to our rapporteurs Mrs Trautmann, Mr Harbour, Mrs del Castillo and Mrs Toia and to all the shadow rapporteurs both for the good work performed by everyone and for their fruitful cooperation with those who were less closely involved with this dossier."
"The last legal framework for market liberalisation dates from 2002."
"The importance of the market has already been emphasised today."
"After all, if I may remind you of a statistic, a turnover of more than EUR 300 billion has been achieved by the telecommunications sector in Europe alone."
"Thousands of jobs depend on this market, and so it is important that we continue to develop the legal framework which has stood the test since 2002 in such a way that new chapters can be added to this European success story."
"To this end, of course, we must first and foremost adapt our legal framework to take account of new technological developments."
"In the brief time that I, too, have been allocated, let me highlight two points that are of particular importance to me personally."
"The first is investment in high-tech infrastructure in Europe."
"We in Europe face the formidable challenge of investing as much as possible as quickly as possible in these new high-speed broadband networks."
"That is one of the keys to a competitive Europe."
"We must create the legal conditions in which these investments will bear fruit."
"On the other hand, we must not create new monopolies and closed markets."
"In committee, we ensured that the risk involved in creating the new networks would be fairly distributed and that regulators would have to take this risk-sharing into consideration in future."
"In addition, we devoted a great deal of attention to the subject of frequency policy."
"We favour a more flexible frequency policy in Europe."
"I believe a good way can be found to share out the digital dividend so as to take account of broadcasters' legitimate interests while providing as much flexibility as possible for new services too."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I only wish to deal with two points."
"I should like to begin with an area in which we still have one or two matters to clear up with Pilar del Castillo Vera."
"I refer to the question of how the independence and autonomy of the future small agency can be guaranteed and which is the most appropriate way to fund it."
"There are highly diverse views on this point."
"I would very much like to learn from the Council how its debates on this subject are shaping up, and how the Council would like to see the creation of the secretariat or BERT - or whatever name is adopted - being guaranteed and how it envisages the funding method."
"In this respect, I believe the Commissioner was perfectly correct in stating that we want a European structure and have no wish to create structures that do not dovetail with the European legal system."
"There are, as you know, two funding methods under discussion."
"The first is the mixed financing suggested by the rapporteur and the second is the proposal I made, which my group supports, that we take the funding from the Community budget."
"Be that as it may, it would be interesting to hear how the Council - which has, of course, had heated discussions on this point - and indeed the national regulators now stand on the funding issue."
"My second question, which is also addressed to the Council, concerns the funding of the new networks."
"Here too, we have adopted various amendments, including one I tabled in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which went into a little more detail on the possible form of a risk-sharing system if companies make the requisite investments and competitors are to have access to the networks right from the start."
"As far as I have heard, the Council thinks differently and does not wish to go into such detail or give companies a guarantee that any kind of risk-sharing can take place."
"I should be grateful for your comments on these points."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the slowdown of production and economic growth in Europe is also being felt by the telecommunications sector which is currently undergoing various crises."
"It is a sector which demands investment, which is driven by research and innovation, and which also needs a fair amount of time in which to make its own choices."
"I therefore think that we need to provide all possible support and that our review package regarding the regulatory framework can boost the revitalisation of this sector by providing a stable, solid and effective legal framework."
"This I believe is the purpose of our work in Parliament and in the ITRE Committee."
"We have worked with this aim in mind: to provide a framework, as Mrs Trautmann was saying, which is less complex, clearer and more effective than the previous one, in the conviction that sometimes we do not need more rules or more laws, but instead reliable and effective instruments to apply the existing rules and sometimes even dismantle the current framework."
"We have worked hard to create an open, competitive market, trying to resolve the eternal dichotomy between old, not to say historic and formerly monopolistic, operators, and new operators, by saying that there can be room for everyone in a balanced framework as long as there is business acumen and design expertise, and if the resources are available."
"Finally, I think we stressed - and I in particular feel that this is a crucial point - that in a more flexible and deregulated framework the role of regulation, of the various responsibilities, of the chain of responsibility, is vital; and I concur with the Commissioner's point just now that it is important for the various bodies in charge of the essential task of regulation to have clearly defined roles and areas of responsibility."
"One last point, which has been mentioned by several colleagues in addition to the rapporteur, whose work we have all praised, and that is the role of the consumer: the consumer is often relegated to the background, but we want to bring him to the fore and put him in the spotlight because he, I would say, together with business, is the real driving force in the marketplace."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"I would like to start by thanking all the rapporteurs on the electronic communications package for their work, starting with the organisation of hearings and ending with the preparation of the reports."
"I would also like to thank Commissioner Reding for her reliable and active work in the sphere of electronic communications, both on roaming and also on this package."
"At the same time, I am not convinced that the amendments made by the various committees to the drafts submitted by the Commission will result in the better use of resources, competition within the single EU market and efficiency for consumers."
"I will give you just a few reasons why."
"Firstly, it is possible that the joint structure formed of the national regulators, BERT, will be a more democratic regulatory structure than the authority proposed by the Commission, but it may be that BERT will function in accordance with worse cooperative principles and will weaken the Commission's capacity to take regulatory decisions."
"To take a second example, the functional distribution of the telecommunications businesses, separating access to the networks from other retail products, was a courageous proposal by the Commission."
"It seems, though, that this separation requirement as an exceptional measure, to be imposed by the national regulator, will in fact never be used in many markets."
"It is no secret that in the smaller EU states the power of regulators to adopt such exceptional measures against large companies will be very limited, and so I am not convinced that in this case Parliament is making progress in terms of strengthening the single European market compared with the European Commission's proposal."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, to the many thank-yous we have heard I should like to add a very special one of my own."
"I was responsible for the framework directive in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and it is thanks to the political instincts of Catherine Trautmann in media matters and her ability to work in a very structured and systematic manner that we in Parliament have perhaps been able to prevent the pursuit of a misguided media policy through the report on the framework directive."
"We shall see."
"Commissioner, in my view, Parliament has made crucial changes to the draft framework directive as regards competition law but also, and more especially, on frequency-trading."
"I found that your initial proposals for the framework directive were purely market-focused and vastly overestimated the digital dividend."
"Thankfully, these proposals did not appeal to the members of the Committee on Culture and Education or, subsequently, to the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"On the contrary, my fellow Members put public cultural and political interests and the general public good at the heart of their deliberations, and I believe this is reflected most clearly in the following elements of the Trautmann report:"
"Radio frequencies are defined as a public good and will also remain the responsibility of the Member States."
"Priority will be given to broadcasting in particular but also to opinion-forming services."
"Your attempt to force broadcasting onto the defensive has failed, Commissioner."
"It will be easier to introduce pan-European services - that is a good thing, as I am sure you will agree."
"The Member States will also have primary responsibility for further harmonisation of frequencies."
"If there are difficulties, decisions will not be taken by the Commission alone - Parliament will also be involved."
"BERT will play a major role."
"It goes without saying, as far as I am concerned, that its funding must be European."
"I hope we shall manage to ensure that it is."
"Besides the framework directive and the point about frequencies, I would also like to say something about two other reports, beginning with the Harbour report."
"In your report, Mr Harbour, there really are some very good provisions for consumers and consumer interests."
"Greater consideration will be given in future to the interests of people with disabilities, for example."
"I also believe that you even contribute to media pluralism through your proposed rules on mandatory services."
"My group does not agree, however, with the attempt that is made in the report to regulate copyright too."
"We do not like that at all."
"Neither the French model - and this is addressed to the Council Presidency too - nor the 'three strikes' model has our support - on the contrary."
"This attempt does not allay any of our concerns about copyright or about the protection of privacy on the Internet."
"Let me conclude with a few words on the Alvaro report."
"You have spoken with great conviction once again, Mr Alvaro, about data privacy."
"I find, as you have suggested in your speeches, that there is no consistent line yet on matters such as the protection of IP addresses."
"Our experience of the telecoms scandal and the trade in addresses through call centres has shown that IP addresses must be given maximum protection, and I hope that we shall reach agreement to that effect within the next fortnight."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Madam President, I hope that many of our citizens are following this debate and becoming involved before the vote as it involves such major changes, especially regarding internet services."
"The European United Left has three main areas that we would like particularly to highlight:"
"Firstly, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is against the proposal to establish a new European authority in this area."
"It will be more expensive and more complicated."
"It is unnecessary to set up yet another European authority."
"Secondly, greater emphasis must be placed on geographical differences and different infrastructure when it comes to electronic services."
"We must emphasise that access for consumers must be equal so that no more gulfs are built into our societies."
"There must not be any differences in access to electronic services between those who live in cities and regions with a strong economy and those who live in regions with a weak economy and sparsely populated areas."
"When it is not society or the state but private players who are to take over such important investments in infrastructure, there is a clear risk that not all citizens will have the same access at the same cost."
"Thirdly, the GUE/NGL Group reacts against the major influence exerted by different industrial lobby groups."
"The telecom package should not affect copyright, but the lobbyists have nevertheless gained a hearing especially for this in the proposal."
"The proposals of the lobby groups which have been accepted by all groups apart from the European United Left - which was the only group to vote against in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection - open up opportunities for controlling downloads and free access, for example to websites such as MySpace and YouTube."
"The amendments came in late through the back door and without there having been any great debate among the citizens over these major changes."
"In Sweden, for example, we have had a wide-ranging debate about file sharing."
"I am working against the decision to prohibit file sharing at national level and am doing so at EU level too."
"The risk of now taking a decision at EU level is greater than that of national decisions as the lobby groups have had a major influence and effect in the EU system and because many citizens lack sufficient information when we are debating these issues at EU level."
"I hope that there will be a powerful surge of opinion from citizens to guarantee freedom of speech and access to internet services."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Madam President, Sisyphus is my middle name."
"I have been elected by 15% of the Swedish people to oppose here in the European Parliament the EU becoming involved in ever more new areas and thus continuing to centralise and bureaucratise European society."
"This is a sisyphean task."
"Telecoms is one of the areas where the EU has an important function to perform, and I view with satisfaction the proposed telecom package, which is about greater competition and greater protection of privacy, but it seems unavoidable that we will also get centralisation and bureaucratisation."
"In this respect, there are two elements to which I am opposed."
"Firstly, it is proposed that spectrum which is freed up by digitalisation should be allocated according to EU rules."
"Secondly, a new European Electronic Communications Market Authority is proposed."
"I urge the chamber to reject both these proposals."
"Freed spectrum must be allocated by the Member States, and the natural solution is to develop the bodies of the European telecommunications supervisory authorities which already exist."
"(BG) Mr. President, colleagues, I wonder at the things that were said today, in this hall, and no one underscored the point of preserving the confidence of information."
"I call upon you that when so important a matter is discussed we in no way follow the example of the United States."
"You know that under the pretext called ""fight against terrorism and piracy” the supra-national oligraphy is trying to put as many citizens as possible under a total, unconditional and unaccoutable before civic society control."
"The confidentiality of our personal information has to be preserved at any cost."
"I repeat - at any cost!"
"Currently, all telephone calls in Bulgaria are controlled."
"As of next year, those in power in my country want there to be full and unconditional access to all log-files and exchanged electronic messages from every single computer."
"This is not done out of helplessness. In Bulgaria, as in Europe, there are quite enough well-trained and capable specialists who can fight any kind of computer crime."
"This is being done, I repeat again, with the objective of total control over the citizens."
"The right to freedom also guarantees our right to human dignity."
"Anyone who tries to deprive us of our dignity should be reproached and exposed, not provided with media comfort to get away with such intentions in this manner."
"Some time ago, an apathetic discussion on the matter of citizens' rights in the electronic world was held in Bulgaria."
"The only conclusion that was made at the time was that no matter what the citizens want, they live with what is imposed on them."
"I am absolutely firm in guaranteeing all citizens of Bulgaria that Attack party, even at the begining of its government next year, will repeal any encroachment on correspondence and monitoring in Internet."
"In conclusion I would like to say that if our right of private correspondence is restricted once this will remain so forever."
"Even if terrorists begin to use pigeons for correspondence."
"Anyone who substitutes freedom for security does not deserve either freeom or security. Thank you."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner Reding, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by congratulating the Commission."
"We have now reached the second stage in the process of reducing roaming fees for voice telephony."
"I believe that this regulation has proved to be very effective in practice."
"Nevertheless, at the end of the holiday period our consumers will again be hit by alarmingly high bills, because too little progress has been made, if truth be told, in the SMS market and in particular with regard to data roaming."
"For this reason I call on the Commission to act in this matter and create a single European market for European consumers."
"We cannot but observe that this part of the European internal market is not yet in working order and that there is an urgent need to establish a single market in this sphere, especially through the gradual introduction of a common flexible frequency-allocation plan."
"Efficient management of this scarce resource is especially important."
"The digital dividend is a historic opportunity, and it will also be important for the television corporations to be able to transmit their programmes to third-generation mobiles so that we can obtain a common European media area."
"The digital dividend also creates new opportunities in the realm of European communications."
"I would also like to emphasise the importance of implementing the decisions of the World Radio Conference on the basis of this approach, and I call on the Commission - since there is no provision for BERT to deal with these issues - to set up its own authority or group to examine these matters and enact authoritative guidelines for cooperation."
"I also believe that BERT should be fully financed from Community funds, because we quite simply need an authority or institution that is committed to the European internal market and because national regulators should be granted more rights in the other Member States."
"(RO) Dear colleagues, the development of the information society relies upon the electronic communication networks and services."
"The transition from analog to digital television by 2012 will release a significant range of frequencies at European level, thus enabling the development of new technologies and innovating solutions to stimulate the European competitiveness in this sector."
"In order to fully benefit from the digital dividend in Europe, the European Parliament supports its common, flexible and balanced approach, which enables, on the one hand, the broadcasters to continue to provide and expand their services and, on the other hand, the electronic communication operators to use this resource for providing new services related to important social and economic usages and emphasizes the fact that the digital dividend should be allocated in compliance with the principle of technological neutrality."
"The use of the digital dividend may help the achievement of the Lisbon Strategy objectives by supplying improved interoperable social services, such as e-governing, e-health, e-learning, in particular for the people living in disfavoured, isolated or even rural areas."
"Acknowledging the Member States' right to decide on the use of the digital dividend, we consider that a coordinated Community approach shall significantly improve the digital dividend value and is the most efficient way to avoid harmful interferences between Member States and between Member States and third countries, and to guarantee that the spectrum users benefit from all the internal market advantages."
"Consumer confidence in the information society services depends on the quality of the electronic communication services, their security and the personal data protection."
"It is essential that the national regulatory authorities consult all suppliers of electronic communication services before they adopt specific measures in the field of electronic communication network security and integrity."
"I also consider that Member States should establish measures to promote the creation of a market for products and services accessible on a large scale, which shall integrate facilities meant for disabled users."
"(DE) Madam President, this gives me an unexpected opportunity to respond to Mrs Harms' contribution, which I shall do with the greatest of pleasure, for the distinction between suggestions and facts, I believe, is certainly discernible in the report."
"We have essentially incorporated a judgment of the Federal Constitutional Court that created a new fundamental right."
"The right to the confidentiality and integrity of IT systems was the first thing to be enshrined in this legislative act."
"We have thus acted faster than any Member State, particularly my own."
"Publicly accessible private networks have also been included, services like Facebook, Bebo, etc., that have hitherto lain completely outside the scope of directive."
"What about cookies, similar software or other applications that transmit user data back to home base, as it were, without the consumer's prior consent - will they become a thing of the past?"
"Consumers have given their prior consent, in principle, in respect of everything in their computers, mobiles and other applications belonging to, or even accessible to, third parties."
"In future, location information can only be captured anonymously or with the prior consent of the consumer."
"Unsolicited marketing, irritating text messages, stupid e-mails and the like - the directive will rule out all of these things."
"Notification of the data-protection authorities will be mandatory in future whenever any authority searches for anyone's personal data."
"Last but not least, we have created a clearer framework for the notification requirement in the event of security breaches and the loss of data than has existed to date."
"Since we were talking about suggestions before, I do not wish to omit that we are considering how to deal with IP addresses, because IP addresses - and we must not confuse these things - are not the data that are being traded, which are personal data, credit-card details, etc., and even if they were traded - just to explain this briefly - an IP address is not necessarily a personal characteristic, at least not when your fridge transmits a message to your computer."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"(GA) Mr President, it is absolutely necessary that wherever people live, be it in parishes, big or small, in the countryside or in towns or cities, they have access to broadband and to modern technology."
"Companies which base themselves in certain areas rely on a fast internet service."
"Unless broadband service is available in certain areas investment and companies cannot be enticed to set up there."
"It is absolutely necessary that governments concern themselves with the inequality that exists between rural and urban areas in terms of digital services and broadband in order to ensure competitiveness and investments for those areas."
"This is especially obvious in Ireland where there is inequality because of the existence of a private company, Eircom, which controls the internet service and as a result there is a terrible disparity between rural and urban areas."
"I would like the Commissioner to investigate the situation, because to all appearances, neither the national regulator nor the government seems able to do so."
"(ES) Clearly there is only a faint shadow left of the ambitious project which the European Commission presented a year ago."
"This is a shame for many reasons, as consumers need independent European management, not a club of national regulators strongly influenced by national champions."
"The Greens are against making the European Electronic Communications Market Authority just a club for regulators funded by them, lacking transparency and without sufficient controls or the right of veto on the part of the European Commission."
"The independence of the new body is questionable."
"It is also a shame that because of pressure from the large telecommunications companies, access to major telecommunications infrastructures is not provided to new, innovative undertakings and there has to be a duplication of infrastructure."
"The Greens advocate neutrality in technology and the unbundling of operations to do away with the dominant positions of the state telecoms giants."
"However, the European Parliament has been too timid and influenced by lobbies and has overlooked the interests of new, more innovative undertakings which are providing most wireless services in Europe and offer advantages to consumers."
"I regret to say that overall we have allowed an opportunity to give much greater European added value to the telecommunications market to slip through our grasp."
"Of particular concern to us are some dangerous proposals in the Harbour report which clearly infringe the principle of neutrality of the Net as a means of communication, infringe users' privacy, threaten freedom on the Internet and, above all, clearly exceed the legal scope of the telecommunications package in terms of content, in terms of what is lawful or unlawful, legal or illegal in intellectual property, and in terms of information filters."
"This package is about the infrastructure of the market, about consumers, and not how to turn Internet service providers into digital policemen."
"(DA) Mr President, in its current form, the telecommunications package contains many good measures."
"Ordinary consumers will gain easier access, and it will be cheaper in line with increases in transparency within the market."
"However, the package also contains some very unfortunate aspects that the previous speaker considered."
"The question of defining what constitutes lawful and unlawful content on websites opens the door to surveillance, registration and control with regard to all our communication and transactions over the Internet, to an extent that there are countries we would not normally consider to be democratically worthy!"
"We cannot allow registration, just as we cannot allow service providers to arbitrarily close traffic that someone considers to be harmful."
"This would be much the same as us employing an army of inspectors at Europe's post offices to remove letters that they consider to make harmful reading for the recipient."
"Who will have the authority to read my love letters?"
"We must ensure that future legislation does not become an electronic straitjacket, but a framework within which the culture, societal debate and interactive life of the future can unfold."
"(PL) Madam President, may I begin by congratulating Commissioner Reding."
"A year after the regulations on roaming we have the next package, which is very important for consumers in particular."
"I would also congratulate the rapporteurs."
"No fewer than four reports had to be coordinated, and the coordination seems to have been very successful."
"The protection of consumers referred to in the regulations discussed in Malcolm Harbour's report is very closely connected with proper allocation of the digital dividend, which consumers are awaiting."
"It will be important - as Commissioner Reding proposed - to optimise use of the spectrum through coordination on a European scale."
"Television and mobile telephony are proposed as the main beneficiaries of the digital dividend, but I want to stress the importance of wireless Internet."
"In many parts of Europe that is the only possible means of access to the Internet for millions of citizens, especially in rural and remote areas."
"So if the economic growth of the sector we are discussing is particularly strong, then a significant portion of the resulting dividend should be allocated to broadband wireless Internet."
"Research into optimisation and allocation of dividend is another important issue."
"It could be carried out by the Joint Research Centre, and I would ask the Commissioner whether this is really being considered."
"These, then, are the three most important requirements: consumers must be able to choose, the regulations must promote investment and competitiveness, and the internal market must be strengthened."
"In my view, this calls for lobbying not only in Parliament's domain but also with respect to the Council, i.e. in every member State."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, thank you for allowing me to speak at this point;"
"I must apologise for having to leave shortly to return to Paris."
"My colleague, Luc Chatel, will answer many of the questions that have been raised during this debate."
"Allow me just to say a few words in response to Mr Harbour's comments on the lack of debate on the scope of the universal service."
"I should first like to express my agreement with the rapporteur on the fact that broadband access is a major challenge facing our societies, whether in terms of access to knowledge or essential services."
"As Mr Harbour said, broadband access is not covered by the current scope of the universal service."
"The French Presidency simply wishes to open the debate on how to ensure broadband access across the whole of Europe."
"After listening to the views of the various Member States, it becomes apparent that several potential scenarios are conceivable."
"The first option would be to extend the scope of the Universal Service Directive to include broadband services; the second would involve freedom of choice and would enable only those Member States to include broadband access in their universal service which wished to do so; and, finally, an intermediate option would make the inclusion of broadband within the scope of universal service compulsory in those Member States where broadband has reached a sufficient level of maturity."
"We have therefore all been given the opportunity, under the French Presidency, to open this debate and to try to reconcile our positions; this is what the Commission likewise hopes to achieve."
"I should just like to say a few words to Mrs Harms: it is not our intention to pit the development of the Internet against copyright protection."
"In an era of convergence, we need to develop both the channel and the content by improving the networks at the same time as encouraging the creation of content and providing support to authors."
"As you pointed out, France sets great store by copyright; however, the French Presidency is not seeking to impose the model that we shall be developing in France based on preventive action and graduated response, known in our country as the Creation and Internet Law."
"We are acutely aware, as you said, of the need to protect both privacy and personal data."
"We feel that this is in no way incompatible with any other concerns that we might have."
"(FR) Madam President, Ministers, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after months of discussions, which have not yet been concluded, I think I can say that, as a result of the work done by Mr Harbour and the shadow rapporteur, we have reached compromises that have consumers' best interests at heart."
"Accordingly, it is essential to encourage better competition by implementing a number of measures to require telecom companies to offer contracts of acceptable duration and to give effect to number portability within one day for subscribers wishing to change to a different service provider."
"In terms of protection, the general rules on consumer protection must apply to the telecom sector; cost-control mechanisms have been envisaged as well as improvements to out-of-court settlement procedures in the event of a dispute."
"Another very important issue is access to emergency services and the provision of caller location information, which must be made available in a reliable manner, regardless of the technology used."
"Protection of privacy has also been a priority, as has child protection: access providers must provide customers with free parental control software."
"All these developments had to be secured for the benefit of as many people as possible."
"Many measures therefore apply to equal access for users with disabilities and people on low incomes; the needs of SMEs have also been taken into account."
"The report also emphasises the need to extend the scope of universal service, particularly to include broadband; it is very positive that the French Presidency has made this issue one of its priorities."
"I should now like to turn to the question of content and copyright which has tended to overshadow the rest of the improvements in the text."
"Our aim has always been to provide consumers with general information on infringements of copyright, in line with the Commission's original proposal."
"We shall be working right up to the final vote to improve the wording of the compromises by ensuring that the principle of neutrality in providing access to content is upheld."
"Some amendments adopted in the Privacy Directive, however, are really causing problems and we shall make sure that they are deleted."
"I should like, once again, to thank my colleagues, and I am looking forward to more specific proposals from the Presidency in order to make further improvements to this text before the next part-session."
"Mr President, the telecom package is an important step forward in modernising and harmonising telecommunications in Europe."
"I worked on the citizens' rights directive and, together with the rapporteur, Mr Harbour, we did a lot of work and we reached consensus on many issues."
"This directive will ensure better protection of consumer rights in electronic communications."
"Number portability, and privacy protection and security in telecommunications are other examples of improvements brought by this directive."
"We had a very delicate discussion on network neutrality."
"My opinion is that extreme network neutrality, as we experienced in some amendments, will make networks more congested, slower, less efficient and more expensive."
"Network management is necessary to run efficient and intelligent networks and to maximise the overall user experience and value."
"I am very satisfied that we agreed on amendments regarding the emergency number 112 and, after the directive has been adopted, Member States will make further efforts to inform and educate the public on the use of 112."
"The 112 number will be made accessible from the entire EU territory and Member States will have to ensure the implementation of caller location."
"In addition, access to emergency services through 112 may be blocked in case of repeated misuse by the user and 112 will be more accessible to people with disabilities."
"I also hope that the amendment regarding the establishment of an EU-wide early warning system will be adopted."
"This amendment does not require an agency in Brussels to be set up but the definition of common standards about the warning system to be done jointly by the relevant authorities of the Member States."
"Of course, the warning would be launched at the local level, but on the basis of common standards that would ensure that all potentially affected citizens of the EU could get and understand this message and act in a way that will save their lives."
"I am very sure that the telecom package will support the efforts of companies in improving their performance and investment in new technologies and at the same time will consolidate the consumer rights of European citizens."
"(PL) Madam President, European society and the world at large are increasingly dependent on electronic communications."
"They are the economy's nervous system."
"They are used in education, administration, health care, the media, and in lifelong learning."
"Alongside the tremendous benefits, electronic communications also involve a number of direct threats to citizens, institutions and businesses."
"The expectations of citizens, who are less intensive users of the system, include wide access to services at the lowest possible prices, e.g. for roaming calls between EU Member States, and elimination of the threats to users of electronic communications referred to in Malcolm Harbour's report and elsewhere."
"We must meet these expectations on the basis of modern technology and competitiveness, and with the financial support of the European Union, especially in rural and mountainous areas."
"With a view to the interaction and interconnection of these requirements and regulatory mechanisms, as well as to visibility, we should consider whether it might be advisable to combine the provisions we are discussing in a single directive."
"May I thank all the rapporteurs for the work they have put in."
"Madam President, channels of communications are vitally important to our lives today."
"The availability of broadband needs to be ensured, particularly for those in remote areas and those who are challenged, such as the visually impaired."
"While we enjoy the freedom which the internet affords, we must recognise that with freedom come responsibilities."
"I am a committed proponent of net neutrality."
"As the world becomes more globalised it is crucial that people have the ability to communicate freely."
"However, this freedom, which is of great value, must be used with respect."
"It must be recognised that without this respect the internet harbours the potential for abuse."
"We have taken action on some of the worst abuses on the internet, such as paedophilia."
"However, other abuses also need to be tackled."
"Internet service providers must play their part in preventing their platform being used for destructive forces like libel, hate and exploitation."
"I would say to the Commissioner that we need to do everything in our power to protect freedom and, at the same time, to promote responsibility on the internet."
"(FR) Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this work has been outstanding."
"The result that has been achieved by our committees is a balanced one, and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you were quite right to want to take it fully into account."
"I should just like to congratulate my colleagues, Catherine Trautmann, Pilar del Castillo and Malcolm Harbour, on their work."
"That being the case, I have no problem telling Mrs Trautmann that I do not agree with her view that we should exclude completely any reference to intellectual property rights."
"Over and above the platforms and channels that we are discussing, especially in her report, what is of importance to us all is what these platforms and channels allow us to access, in other words, content."
"Mr Guardans, Mr Medina and Mr Mavrommatis have made that point very well indeed, and I agree with them."
"In the Commission text, two references had been made to this issue; it would have been better to have retained them."
"The debate is now focused on a reference made to the 2001 and 2004 Directives on copyright and on cooperation among the various stakeholders."
"To what end?"
"To promote legal offers - in other words, content that will enable our industry and our cultural diversity to prosper."
"The criticisms that have been levelled at these texts - some of which I have heard repeated even here in this Chamber - have, for example, raised the spectre of the Olivennes Agreement."
"However, the model that we should follow is the Memorandum of Understanding that was adopted on 24 July by the UK Government, OFCOM and the various stakeholders."
"As far as I am aware, they do not support bureaucracy or Internet dictatorship."
"The point is not to prevent laws from being enforced in the Member States, to ensure reconciliation with fundamental rights, and not to prevent new technologies and the new economy from acting for the benefit of our cultural diversity, our cutting-edge industries and the intelligence and talents of European citizens, for these are our most important weapons and our greatest assets in global competition."
"(DE) Madam President, like Mrs Vergnaud, I welcome that one part of Mr Harbour's report which relates to consumer protection and which contains numerous very good decisions."
"Universal access to these services is a very important principle, and that cannot be emphasised enough."
"I can assure you once again, Mr Harbour, that this part of the report also has the full backing of my group."
"There are, however, parts that require revision."
"You are quite right, Mrs Reding."
"In your introductory remarks, you expressed surprise that the European Parliament should seek to dilute the protection of personal data."
"May I say to you that this is not the opinion of Parliament, for Parliament is not due to vote for another two weeks, and only then shall we see what position it takes on these matters."
"Until then, we shall be sorting out all the things that are still in a bit of a mess."
"I promise you that there will be no dilution of data privacy from our group."
"If no satisfactory agreements materialise in Parliament on data protection, network access and network neutrality, my group will be unable to vote in favour of the package, and then we shall have to see how we move on from there."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to congratulate you on your dedication, and, of course, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs and especially Mrs Trautmann, who has worked extremely hard to reach this consensus, which she wanted to be neutral and to have no sectoral distinction."
"However, as regards rights to use spectrum, it should be noted that investment and depreciation cycles differ from one sector to the next."
"However, the provisions of the text on the allocation and harmonisation of frequencies and licences place satellite operators in a situation of legal uncertainty given the specific nature of their sector."
"The new Article 8a, proposed by the rapporteur, does provide certain guarantees, but the wording of this clause must be tightened up in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and ITU rules."
"A number of questions also remain open regarding the substance and scope of the Commission's negotiating mandate."
"Regarding Mr Harbour's report, I should like to raise the issue of the definition of 'publicly available telephone service', as laid down in Article 1, point 2b. This definition should apply only to two-way services, in accordance with the definition given in the Privacy Directive."
"Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and games consoles are in no way comparable to traditional telephony services."
"Their assimilation as such would create a regulatory framework that inhibits innovation and provides uninformed users with tools that they do not see as being intended for certain uses, for example, the possibility of making an emergency call from a games console which can establish one-way communication."
"It is therefore important to limit the definition to two-way services."
"Regarding copyright, I should like to endorse the comments made by all my colleagues who have raised this issue."
"(ES) First I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on the good work they have done."
"This reform achieves the objectives set and adjusts to new times and new challenges, both for businesses and for consumers."
"Allow me to dwell, however, on one particular point in the Harbour report."
"It is true that the rapporteur has done a magnificent job but I believe that we should not tackle the group of final amendments on the content of the Net here, in this directive, because in short what those amendments do is allow intermediate service providers to filter and block content on the Net and therefore, ultimately, consumers will lose their anonymity."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this stance runs counter to Article 12 of the Electronic Commerce Directive, which already states that intermediate service providers must act as neutral intermediaries when they transmit electronic information."
"In a State governed by the rule of law, we cannot do things to the Net which we would not do to other forms of communication."
"Therefore I ask Mr Harbour to withdraw those amendments so as to restore the balance between copyright and the rights of Internet users."
"(SK) I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report."
"Work on legislative packages is never easy and I welcome its cogency."
"I too should like to emphasise that the main objective of this package is to produce better communications services in the use of mobile telephones and broadband internet or cable television connections for consumers."
"I think that, thanks to our rapporteur, Malcolm Harbour, consumers will be better and more quickly informed."
"If consumers decide to change providers, comparable offerings are often unavailable and the process of number transfer still takes far too long."
"I therefore welcome Malcolm Harbour's report, on the basis of which providers must supply consumers with transparent and above all comparable prices and changing providers while retaining existing numbers will be possible in just one day."
"Despite the fact that I would never wish anyone to have to dial 112 for an emergency, it should be emphasised that, on the basis of this directive, the emergency services will have access to information on the caller's location, allowing them to provide assistance more quickly and effectively."
"The switch to digital transmission will release spectrum, which should be able in future to provide for broadband internet connections in even the most remote corners of the EU."
"Commissioner, I believe that the Commission will ensure the most effective use of this 'digital dividend' in the interests of every consumer."
"(EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we live in a world where everyone, governments, private companies and criminals alike, seek the greatest possible access to our electronic data, in the most unrestricted way possible."
"For this reason, any changes to the e-Privacy Directive must do exactly what its title implies: ensure the greatest possible protection of our personal data and private lives."
"I am therefore opposed to any attempt at weakening the definition of a piece of personal data relating to European citizens, because since it is personal, it is protected by law."
"The exceptions sought, especially for IP addresses, covertly contravene existing European legislation."
"Furthermore, I do not think that Internet service providers should be allowed to judge for themselves which breaches of their network security harm their users and which do not."
"They should not decide for themselves when to inform users and the authorities about even blatant acts of neglect."
"I respect the role and contribution of private companies, but the economic interests of the Internet giants must not be allowed to dictate the laws adopted by Europe to protect the fundamental rights of its citizens."
"(DE) Madam President, many thanks to all the rapporteurs for their work, which was truly excellent."
"Let me, however, deal with two specific points."
"The European Union is not only an economic community but is also pledged to uphold common values, and that is why the protection of private data is a vital concern."
"At the same time, however, technical progress and the protection of cultural and creative works must not be regarded as conflicting aims."
"Both will be key factors in our future competitiveness."
"That is why I, along with many other Members who have addressed the House today, am appealing earnestly for a strengthening of the position of holders of rights, in other words those who want to have their copyrights protected."
"No one else needs this protection, hence the introduction of models for cooperation with Internet service providers."
"A step in this direction reflects technological convergence as well as convergence in the reinforcement of copyright."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, when managing and allocating the radio spectrum we must ensure full and effective access for all citizens to this public asset."
"The proposals in the reports by Mrs Trautmann and Mrs Toia on the radio spectrum and digital dividend place the issue on a firm footing from the outset."
"They point first and foremost to the social, cultural and democratic significance, and to the new opportunities offered by the digital dividend we ought to be offering European citizens."
"The debate on the digital dividend should not boil down to a black-and-white choice between commercialisation and social benefit."
"Mapping out a significant strategy at national level, allowing each Member State to set public interest objectives and fulfil and coordinate them - these are the entirely achievable actions we can take at Community level."
"However, the new approach taken by the Commission for greater harmonisation at EU level with regard to how to allocate the radio spectrum on the basis of common administration criteria, such as the principle of neutrality of services and the extension of the principle of a general licence, seems to ignore the public nature of the radio spectrum and to favour the commercial aspect."
"For this reason, I consider that we must disagree and that we must continue with the proposals put forward by our rapporteurs."
"(RO) Thanks to the report under consideration, there is an opportunity to stimulate, by making the best of the digital dividend, the larger scale use of broadband technologies in rural, isolated or disfavoured regions, taking into account that there are still many places where digital technology is entirely absent or access to digital services is not possible due to the absence of infrastructure."
"I support the acceleration of the drafting, by the Member States remaining behind, including Romania, of national strategies regarding the digital dividend, which shall implement measures designed to enable a faster and easier access of citizens to interoperable social services, in particular to those enabling access to educational, professional training and health systems."
"We draw attention to the carefulness necessary to ensure the best possible transparency as regards the reassignment of frequencies released and the investments in next-generation infrastructures, so that all the European Union countries could have access to them."
"Madam President, I want to take the opportunity as Chair of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) to thank Mr Harbour and the shadows for producing what I hope this Parliament will consider a balanced and workable proposal on universal services."
"I want to draw the attention of this House to one provision - an amendment I made and backed by the committee - to make the introduction of the 116000 missing child hotline a legal obligation on all Member States."
"The Commissioner will be aware that a recent report has shown that, a full 18 months after its introduction in 2007, only seven Member States have assigned the missing child hotline."
"The voluntary approach is clearly not working."
"Across Europe every year approximately 130 000 children go missing."
"These statistics show that this is an area where Europe can help, must act and must identify, track down and recover missing children."
"Therefore I urge the European Commission and the Member States to support this provision, to speed up the implementation of the missing child hotline and give a major boost to Europe's efforts for an EU-wide missing children amber alert system."
"(FR) Madam Speaker, I should like to commend Mrs Trautmann, Mrs del Castillo, Mrs Toia and Mr Harbour for a job well done."
"How do we reap the full benefits of the digital dividend?"
"That is the question."
"It is certainly the case that digital broadcasting is releasing and will be releasing frequencies."
"I deliberately use both the present and future tenses of the verb 'to release' in order to emphasise the fact that this change is not going to come in a flash, with a snap of the fingers; this is something that many players seem to have forgotten when arguing their case."
"In addition, the amount of investment is likely to frighten off many investors before they can even think about recouping this EUR 250 billion providential windfall."
"The distribution of these constraints must therefore be factored into our policies."
"I should like to use this rather short speaking time to emphasise the compelling need to establish a European frequency policy in which Parliament will be involved as a major player: as such, it will need to be aware of the limitations imposed by the physics of electromagnetic waves, be mindful of the need for frequency spectrum management and show due regard for the role to be played by standardisation bodies in making optimal use of this scarce resource, whilst always bearing in mind the general interest of our fellow Europeans."
"I should also like to remind the Commissioner that the roll-out of fibre-optic networks, to paraphrase Jean Cocteau, certainly needs grand declarations of love but it also needs tangible acts of love, accompanied by European funding included in the budget in order to carry them out, to build these broadband networks and to prevent the digital divide in Europe."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, at the end of this debate, I should like to start by thanking you, ladies and gentlemen - I found that both the quality of your deliberations and your commitment to this subject highlight the importance of telecommunications in current European debates."
"In Europe today, we are seeking economically strategic issues that are of relevance to our fellow citizens."
"Telecommunications clearly illustrate a major strategic challenge - you have noted their potential impact on European growth - but, at the same time, they concern issues that affect the daily lives of our citizens; this is precisely the kind of issue that Europe needs."
"After all, it is telecommunications that to a certain extent give Europe a human face."
"I should like to commend the very broad consensus that I observed during this debate between Parliament and the Council, particularly on improving spectrum management, enhancing consumer protection and restricting the use of functional separation in order to prevent it from becoming widespread, which is an issue that has been raised several times."
"I note, however, that our institutions will need to continue working on a number of issues in order to reach a compromise."
"I am referring, of course, to the introduction of the Commission's right to veto remedies and also to the legal form and the financing of the alternative to the European Regulatory Authority, since its role and remit appear to be shared by Parliament and the Council."
"I should like briefly to come back to three issues: the first concerns precisely this question as to how this new body, which has been mentioned by several speakers, is to be financed."
"As you are aware, ladies and gentlemen, the Member States have not yet adopted a clear stance on this issue and, needless to say, the method of financing will depend primarily on the legal form and remit of that body."
"As you know - I mentioned this earlier - a majority of Member States still have some reservations about the idea of establishing an additional body."
"The Council will therefore have to strike a balance between the various options that have been mentioned this afternoon."
"With regard to next-generation networks, another issue that was raised, I believe that, as Mrs Trautmann quite rightly pointed out, in order to promote new networks - next-generation networks - the primary concern is to continue to promote competition, particularly competition in infrastructure, which provides an incentive for investors and encourages risk-sharing between the various operators."
"As you are aware, discussions are currently taking place in the Council."
"There is, however, an urgent need to address these issues which require further action and more short-term measures."
"As you know, the Commission has published a draft Recommendation on this issue; perhaps the Commissioner would be good enough to elaborate on this."
"The third issue that I wanted to address, which was likewise mentioned by several speakers, is, of course, the issue of the protection of personal data and, more generally, issues related to content, rather than the channel used to convey content."
"Éric Besson already said a few words on this subject;"
"I believe that the objective of the French Presidency is not to pit one issue against another or to impose a specific model, but I did appreciate the comments made by a number of speakers this afternoon who said that, whereas we are clearly building this future economy, this future source of growth, for the benefit of the European economy, we must also do so to enable our culture and our cultural players to increase their presence in the global arena."
"Therefore, I do not think that we can separate the two issues, although I know that other interested parties are also holding important debates on the subject."
"We have to bear in mind that any efforts to modernise this infrastructure must also be aimed at promoting the dissemination of our content and the protection of copyright with a view to preserving the creative process in the European Union."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the comments I wished to make in order to wind up this debate."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, what do we want to achieve?"
"We want to ensure that all citizens, wherever they live and wherever they travel, enjoy fast access to multiple, safe and affordable services."
"We want all citizens to have access to a wealth of content that reflects European cultural diversity."
"We want strategically important companies to contribute to economic growth and job creation by developing new infrastructure and a wide variety of content."
"We want the establishment of an unfettered single market, enabling the continent of Europe to lead the way in terms of connectivity, communications and new technologies, but we also hope that Europe will play a leading role in the protection of consumer rights and citizens' privacy."
"That is what we all here want to achieve, and I think that the many and varied views that have been expressed by this Parliament are directed along these lines and are calling for the adoption of balanced decisions in order to make it possible to reach a consensus."
"Of course, none of this would have been possible without the work of the rapporteurs."
"I should like to pay tribute to them because they have often managed to square the circle."
"This is a remarkable feat that has been achieved by our rapporteurs but also by Parliament's committees and by the coordinators."
"In the coming weeks, we must all - whether it be the Commission, the Council or Parliament - try to bring this project to life, a project that is capable of moving our continent forward and generating a consensus between the Council and the European Parliament."
"As for myself and my colleagues at the Commission, we shall play the role of honest brokers in order to make this possible."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, at the end of this debate, I should like to thank the Council and the Commissioner for listening so carefully to what we had to say; this has enabled them to see that there is quite considerable consensus, a great deal of agreement, in our Parliament on the telecom package."
"Nothing could be more common in our everyday lives than a mobile phone, a television set or the ability to communicate."
"The Single Act established the mobility of persons and goods as a fundamental right, a fundamental freedom."
"As Mr Paasilinna said earlier, communications are also a fundamental right and a means of giving Europe a soul, sustaining its existence and connecting its citizens."
"We must therefore have the necessary ambition to make a success of this telecom package."
"I therefore urge the Council not to proceed with a compromise or with a willingness to compromise that might unbalance the various points on which we have managed to reach agreement."
"Between us, and with the help of my colleagues, Malcolm Harbour, Pilar del Castillo, Alexander Alvaro and others - it would be impossible to mention them all - we feel that we have already achieved a great deal on the basis of common sense and shared determination."
"In response to the remarks directed towards me earlier by Mr Toubon, I should also like to say that I cannot be criticised for not wishing to take into account the need to support the creative process in Europe."
"I believe that it is a powerful driving force for innovation, both in terms of the diversity and the intellectual value that it brings, which is absolutely critical in this day and age."
"However, we must also take into account the freedom that must be guaranteed in our texts - we have adopted extremely important texts on the protection of personal data, and we are the only ones to have done so in the world today."
"We must reconcile these two aspects."
"There is no conflict between the two: the objective is the same, namely to protect both creative freedom and the freedom of each individual."
"It is in this spirit that we shall continue to work to improve our proposals."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, in this final speech I wish to thank the Council for its understanding approach, which has again been in evidence today."
"I would also like to thank the Commission very much, especially the Commissioner, for the awareness she has always shown in what I would term her fireproof advocacy of a more competitive electronic communications market and consumer protection."
"I also wish to express my thanks above all to my colleagues who, here today as on so many days in the past, have shown the extent to which they are aware of the importance of this sector to European economic growth and, therefore, to the employment and welfare of all European citizens."
"I would now just like to ask the Council, in this final stage and until the end of the current Presidency, to give this telecoms package at least the same priority as that given to energy - I know energy is very important but this package is no less important - so that we can move forward from the balancing point we have reached, as referred to just now by my colleague Mrs Trautmann."
"Parliament is offering a number of proposals which, in my view, are generally fairly well balanced, and will produce a satisfactory outcome to negotiations with the Council and the Commission."
"Thank you very much. We have high expectations of the Presidency in that regard."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and would just like to draw attention to two points."
"Someone in this House said that we have adopted a positive approach and I think that this is a trait which characterises all our work, in the agreements that we have reached and in those still to come."
"A positive approach means that we have taken a realistic look at the interests at stake, at the value of the industries, at the work performed by workers in this sector and therefore at its significance in the European economy as a whole, but also at the role of the citizen, the consumer, starting with the least advantaged, who are set to benefit from the digital switchover if they are helped to make this transition: I know that some countries, including France, are running information and support campaigns in this connection, but if not followed up these citizens might well have difficulties."
"We therefore approached the matter from the consumer, or user, point of view; we looked at the possibility of having new services, even telecommunications services, which are better suited to new requirements, to the need to be better informed, more integrated into the great information network scenario."
"I think that when Europe adopts this sort of approach, and the market too as far as the consumer is concerned, then Europe comes closer to its citizens; and I think that the roaming costs initiative gave Europe a positive image in the eyes of many citizens and young people, who perhaps did not fully understand the role it could play in specific decisions affecting their life, their finances and indeed their personal budgets."
"The second point concerns a balanced approach."
"I think this is an approach which balances the many interests at stake, even the conflicting ones cited by Mrs Trautmann, and also the many sectors concerned: and here I am thinking of the digital dividend."
"To have said that there is space for the various operators from the telecommunications to the audiovisual sector in a context which saw a meeting between representatives of the Committee on Culture and the ITRE Committee means, I think, that we have tried to adopt a balanced approach, and hopefully have succeeded."
"Finally, I would like to see a strong European approach."
"To me it would be completely incomprehensible if the proper subsidiarity authorities, the inalienable powers of the Member States, were to prevent the exploitation of that added value which Europe absolutely must manage to exploit."
"I would like to call on the Commission and the Council to play up this ability to coordinate, harmonise and, in my view, act as Europe's political guide."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I find myself in the uncharacteristic position of having the last word in this major debate so I will perhaps make a few broad-ranging remarks at the end."
"But first of all I would like, regarding my own report, to thank the many colleagues who have contributed and have reinforced the determination of our committee to make and carry forward those improvements."
"I would like to assure my colleagues that over the next couple of weeks we will be working to make those further improvements, particularly around the areas of data protection, on which we had a very successful meeting this morning: I think we can reach an agreement there."
"On the question of data-breach notification, it is perhaps not surprising that we still have work to do because that was an entirely fresh piece of work that we did."
"I cordially invite the Commission, who have already been involved, to help us complete the drafting because, after all, it was not in their original proposal."
"The other point I want to make is addressed to Mrs Harms, as she is the only representative of the Green Party here."
"I was absolutely astounded to hear from her colleague, David Hammerstein Mintz - who I get on very well with - that he considers my report to be dangerous to net neutrality."
"We have spent a lot of time crafting a new proposal to actually allow regulators to intervene if they see net neutrality being trespassed upon."
"Yet Mr Hammerstein Mintz comes to this Chamber, without talking to me beforehand and without submitting any alternative, and tells me my report is dangerous."
"All I would say to Mrs Harms is that if the Green Group continue with this sort of scaremongering and demonising of our report, it will be dangerous for consumers because it will endanger everything else."
"I cordially invite them to come round our table and to say why our report is dangerous."
"Let us see if we can satisfy their concerns."
"Many of you may well even be receiving daily e-mails."
"I had one telling me that this report is a danger to net neutrality."
"All I can say to you is that our intention is entirely the opposite."
"In conclusion, we now all have a huge responsibility to help the French presidency reach agreement."
"I want to emphasise that point."
"There is a lot of uncertainty out in the real world, among the people who are poised to make the big investments - the next-generation networks - who want this package settled as soon as possible."
"We can help do that by working together as we have done successfully."
"It is a really big responsibility."
"I pledge from my side - and I know my colleagues will come with me on this - that we will spare no effort in working with the French Presidency."
"I want to pay particular tribute to Mr Chatel and Mr Besson for their deep engagement to this whole process and their real knowledge of the issues."
"Together I am sure we can get this package through in the quickest possible time."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the next part-session."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (NL) The new telecoms law that we are discussing today has far-reaching consequences for all of us Internet and telecom users."
"Our Internet privacy is to be better protected."
"Personal information stored on the computer or sent on the Internet (including your surfing profile!) cannot be used (misused) unless you have given your express consent beforehand."
"Cooperation between the content industry (mainly music and film) and telecom operators is encouraged in order to deal with the problem of piracy (illegal downloads)."
"It is important for consumers to be well informed on what can and cannot be done on the Net, but access to the Internet must in no circumstances be denied."
"It will be easier for people to take telephone numbers with them when changing operators."
"It should not take more than a day to transfer a number, subject to measures to prevent abuse."
"It is to be hoped that we can quickly reach agreement on this and that subscribers can enjoy the benefits of these improvements as soon as possible."
"in writing. - (GA) In today's highly connected, globalised world personal privacy and data protection should be priorities for all of us."
"Privacy should not be compromised as happened in the case of the Harbour Report."
"It is not the business of a national or European body to monitor, in an intrusive way, the use people make of the internet."
"The European Parliament must act to undo some of the more regressive elements of this Directive."
"As things stand, the connection that companies and state bodies have with the private use people make of the internet could increase through this Directive."
"The protection of intellectual property rights cannot be used as an excuse to allow irresponsible bodies access to personal and private data."
"in writing. - (HU) Approving the package of legislation on the agenda is an important step forward in letting broadband communication technologies gain ground."
"It is crucial for these to spread so that, in line with our intentions, Europe can really become one of the most competitive regions."
"We now only have to make increased efforts for effective telecommunications regulation because the development of this sector can make a great contribution to increasing employment."
"The opening of the telecommunications market has gathered pace since the second half of the 1990s, noticeably improving the level of services."
"However, we feel that there is still a considerable amount of work to do in the areas of strengthening competition and consequently breaking down consumer prices."
"In addition to all this, the emergence of new technologies makes a review of the current legislation topical."
"We feel it is a very happy development that a prominent pillar of the new framework regulation is a review of frequency distribution practices up to now."
"In our opinion, the principle of technological neutrality must prevail in this matter, in the interests of increasing competitiveness."
"It is also an important result that there will also be a new framework for cooperation by the national regulatory authorities in the future."
"We should welcome the fact that the new regulation also has a legislative effect on consumer protection that is by no means negligible."
"It creates more transparent conditions for setting prices and reinforces the freedom to change providers."
"We feel that the importance of the framework regulation that is to be adopted lies in the fact that it will increase market competition without overlooking an appropriate level of consumer protection."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0457/08)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Council."
"Subject: Policy on the supply of agricultural products"
"In view of the fact that fear of a food shortage has caused alarm at international level (thus prompting certain countries to restrict or impose special taxes on agricultural products intended for export), is the Council now considering the possibility that the common foreign and security policy should focus on the security of the supply of those products and encompass specific agreements with the main countries which supply them?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, Mr Medina Ortega, at its meeting of 19 and 20 June this year, the European Council acknowledged that the recent escalation in food prices is a source of anxiety both in the European Union, where the crisis mainly affects low-income households, and internationally with particular reference to the developing countries."
"The reasons behind this phenomenon are complex."
"The first is the growth in global demand, especially among the main emerging economies."
"The second is related to rising production and transport costs, caused in part by the rise in oil prices."
"The third is linked to the way the financial markets work, to the speculation on international markets and local food markets."
"Lastly, some major producing countries have had bad harvests because of poor climate conditions."
"The General Affairs and External Relations Council next month will consider these questions again, looking firstly at the need to improve food security in coordination with the United Nations, and secondly at the international financial institutions and the G8."
"The IMF and the World Bank have scheduled meetings and I am very pleased that Mr Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, has set up a high-level team to consider the food crisis."
"The European Union will play a full part in implementing the declaration made at the high-level FAO Conference held in Rome on 5 June this year."
"Obviously, we will also have to draw on the upcoming United Nations and World Bank meetings, in order to develop and deepen activities aimed at boosting food production in the affected developing countries."
"As you can see, the main policies that are concerned in this food crisis and can help resolve it are agricultural policy, development policy and trade policy."
"The CFSP to which Mr Medina Ortega referred can make a contribution here, but only marginally, in the context of the political dialogue it is conducting with third countries aimed at encouraging them to formulate better agricultural policies; that would improve food security in the developing countries and strengthen regional integration in the most seriously affected areas."
"(ES) Thank you very much for your reply."
"I see that the Council is indeed concerned about this matter."
"I would like to point out that hunger has been a constant feature of European history, for example the famous potato famine in Ireland which led to the depopulation of the island; many other parts of Europe were also depopulated by famine, for example Ukraine."
"We are living in a time when we have been given a reminder of what can happen; we are discussing a community of 500 million people who for the most part consume foods from abroad."
"Does the Council not believe that the time has come to draft an overall policy for comprehensive food security and for that food security policy to be one of the general policies of the European Union so as to ensure that this type of mass famine does not recur in the future?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr Medina Ortega is quite right."
"I think that during our review of the common agricultural policy, at the meetings we will be holding on development policy and the exchanges of view and summits we will be organising with the developing countries, the Council will indeed focus closely on the question of food supplies and food security."
"They are two separate issues although they must indeed be looked at together."
"In any case, one of the French Presidency's ambitions, looking in particular towards the October European Council, is to raise these issues and to look at them together."
"Rather than the bizarre notion, proffered in the question, of looking at food security under the common foreign and security policy, would it not be better to return to food security as an original prime objective of the CAP, as President Sarkozy promised in his notable speech at the Paris Agricultural Show in February?"
"He set food security, and the EU contributing more to food production in the world, as his top objectives in revamping the CAP."
"What progress can the French Minister report towards the attainment of those objectives?"
"(DE) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, we have here a paradigm shift from overproduction in Europe to fear for the security of our food supplies."
"Do you believe that the WTO negotiations that are now being conducted under French chairmanship have any chance of reaching a satisfactory conclusion by December?"
"Do you believe that the world market could be a golden opportunity for our agricultural sector?"
"We have seen, of course, that prices have risen very sharply and that these prices naturally offer entirely new income opportunities for our own farmers in countries like France, Britain and, above all, the new Member States, and they would also create great income prospects elsewhere, especially in the LDCs, the poorest of the poor countries."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) In reply to Mr Allister let me say that I do indeed believe that food security must be a prime objective of our review of the common agricultural policy."
"It is one of the objectives we want to highlight when we review the common agricultural policy."
"When we undertake that global review we must, therefore, try to look not only at quantitative CAP objectives but also consider more qualitative aspects, so as to ensure that all our fellow citizens, wherever they may live, have access to high-quality food products."
"In regard to Mr Rübig's question, let me point out that today we are indeed benefiting from high world prices, which is an opportunity for European exports."
"Given global demand as a whole, we may also turn out to be importers in various areas or find out that we are not producing enough."
"During the multilateral trade negotiations Europe did what it had to do and, as you know, made a number of concessions in regard to reforms, in the framework of the CAP agreements."
"It turns out, to our regret, that other countries are responsible for the blockages."
"It is true that the Doha Round on development should pay more attention to the aspects of food security and balanced global food production than it is doing at present."
"Subject: European Youth Pact"
"All areas of policy, in particular facilities for education and lifelong learning, employment and mobility, social integration, health and the possibility of independence and support for initiatives concerning entrepreneurship and voluntary work, concern young people in the European Union."
"Will the Council, therefore, say how it intends to implement the European Youth Pact (7619/05) and to invest in policies which have an impact on young people?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, you rightly point out that a whole range of policy areas concern young people."
"Thank you for doing so."
"Youth policy is cross-sectoral by its nature."
"It is precisely the purpose of the European Youth Pact that the European Council adopted in 2005 to mainstream the dimension of youth into various policies, in line with the Lisbon Strategy."
"Our objectives are simple, namely to improve the educational potential in Europe, training, youth mobility and the vocational integration and social inclusion of young people."
"We know that together we must make that pact even more effective and that we need concrete results."
"To help us achieve that, as from 2009 the Commission will be drafting a three-yearly report on youth."
"That report will provide an in-depth analysis of the situation of young people in Europe and thereby help us to highlight their concerns."
"The EU certainly has major responsibilities here, but today, under the Treaties, Member State action is even more vital and we must ensure that within the EU we focus on best practice, whether at national, local or regional level."
"We must promote all forms of synergy between the actors involved, such as enterprises, schools, associations, employment bodies, youth workers, researchers, families and also the social partners."
"In that context, the Presidency of the Council is particularly concerned with promoting cross-border mobility for young people."
"This issue will come up at the Council of 20 and 21 November, which will consider the report on mobility by a high-level group of experts headed by Mrs Maria João Rodriguez."
"We want to see Erasmus, which has proved a great success, expanded."
"We know that cannot be done overnight, but we hope Erasmus will become more democratic, more broadly based."
"We also want to promote Leonardo-type apprenticeship programmes at European level."
"Under the French Presidency we are looking to organise a major event focusing on developing the mobility of apprentices."
"Similarly, under the French Presidency we want to make the health of young people one of our youth policy priorities, to obtain a better idea of health issues specific to young people, whether relating to hygiene or to combating addiction - to tobacco, alcohol and, of course, drugs."
"In 2009, the Council will play an active part in the general process of evaluating European cooperation in the field of youth."
"Given that this will be a long-term process, it is important to ensure continuity of action between the various presidencies, which is why we have worked with the presidencies to come, the Czech and Swedish Presidencies, to ensure the continuity of this policy that is so crucial to the next generation of Europeans."
"(EL) Madam President, I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply and wish the French Presidency all the best in attaining its goals."
"Following the conclusion of the Pact there was certainly also an agreement by the Council on the quantitative attainment of targets: a 10% reduction in school absenteeism and a clearly defined quantitative reduction in youth unemployment over a specific period of time after graduation."
"To what extent have these been attained at a time when statistics tell us that youth unemployment is still very high?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) It is true that youth unemployment remains very high, although on average the situation within the Union has improved over recent years."
"I think we must focus on three areas of action."
"First, we must ensure that we genuinely adapt training more closely to market requirements, especially to the needs of the employment market, and that training systems are more closely aligned to the competition strategy pursued under Lisbon."
"The second is to establish a dialogue with the employers, with the social partners, to promote greater social responsibility on the part of enterprises and the social integration of young people."
"In that respect all enterprises based in Europe, especially the biggest ones, have a major responsibility."
"Thirdly, I believe that in the field of education we must also aim to create networks of excellence and promote mobility between our countries, just as we must promote the mutual recognition of diplomas and qualifications, so as to make the European labour market more fluid."
"(DE) Madam President, Minister, I would like to refer to a specific circumstance that I consider to be very important in the context of this issue."
"In all the EU-wide surveys that have been conducted, it keeps emerging that it is young people who have the greatest enthusiasm for this European Union."
"Young people are also the group who most often believe that they can benefit from the Union, in contrast to its fiercest opponents, who are mostly elderly, intransigent, disillusioned men."
"It would interest me to learn whether, in the framework of this pact and perhaps in other frameworks too, you have projects that could further stimulate this interest, this favourable response to Europe, among young people."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, Mr Leichtfried, perhaps I can present my views in a rather less polarised manner."
"I do indeed believe that young people are enthusiastic about Europe and it is true we must draw on that, which is not to say that members of another generation, those who built Europe, are less enthusiastic."
"Unfortunately you have people for and people against at European level."
"Opinion polls also show - as we saw again recently - that the opponents may sometimes be more radical, and we must do more in-depth work in this regard."
"On the planned pact to mobilise young people and make the concept of Europe more concrete, I believe very strongly that we must promote the cross-border mobility of our young people and that - thanks to these programmes, which will receive more funding, although I know this will take several years and is a long-term project - when we review the framework of our common policies we must look at programmes aimed at further improving the mobility of our young people and children, be they students, apprentices or young employees on work experience or vocational training schemes."
"I believe that is how we will really make the concept of Europe more concrete, ensure that their enthusiasm bears fruit and produce the new generation of Europeans you and I both hope to see."
"Subject: EU overseas territorial anomalies"
"Does the Presidency deem it anomalous to have a country in South America considered to be a part of the European Union when at the same time we are stalling entry negotiations with Croatia, Turkey and other European States, who clearly have a stronger geographical claim?"
"In the current post-Irish referendum climate, how does Council envisage processing applications such as these?"
"Has this ever been discussed in Council?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr Evans, I am glad you are here because I am not quite sure what this question means."
"Perhaps I have not understood it properly and you will be able to clarify it."
"There are, in South America, certain outermost regions that form an integral part of the European Union and are, by that token, eligible for specific policies."
"There is not, however, any South American state as such that is a member of the European Union - I am being very cautious here for perhaps I did not understand all the nuances of the question."
"As for Turkey and Croatia, there has been notable progress since we opened negotiations with those countries."
"In the case of Turkey, for example, the screening process, which is the first formal step for each chapter, has been completed for 23 chapters; eight chapters have been opened to negotiation, and for one of them the process is provisionally closed."
"Our presidency believes it will be able to open two further chapters."
"In the case of Croatia, the screening has concluded."
"Twenty-one chapters were opened, of which three are provisionally closed."
"There was an accession conference on 25 July this year and the first, rather sensitive chapter on the movement of goods was opened and Chapter 20, on enterprise and industrial policy, was closed."
"As you know, progress with the negotiations depends mainly on the results achieved by the candidate countries."
"The progress made in meeting the criteria for opening and closing chapters, as well as the requirements set out in the framework of the negotiations, including the revised accession partnerships, are crucial in this respect and we obviously refer to the Commission's judgment."
"Let me repeat, Mr Evans, that if my reply has been a bit off-centre, I would be very happy if you could tell me exactly what you meant by your question."
"I will give a bit of clarification and put my question more broadly."
"The President-in-Office has answered some of the points that I raised and I thank him for that."
"He is right."
"My position is that I think it is an anomaly that we allow countries like French Guiana to be a full part of the European Union with all the benefits and advantages entailed - not just French territories, but Martinique and Guadeloupe come to mind."
"And yet within Europe - and the President-in-Office has referred to the negotiation process that is taking place with Croatia and perhaps with Turkey - we put up resistance; there are countries in the European Union which are not happy about that."
"But then there are other anomalies closer at hand - the Channel Islands, Jersey and Guernsey, which are not in the European Union, exempt from legislation."
"They are tax havens where rich people are allowed to avoid paying everything that everyone else does."
"Is this position, or are these anomalies, discussed in Council?"
"Can the President-in-Office defend the situation where French Guiana is part of the European Union, and does he think this will continue, not just in the short term but in the long term?"
"Could he look into his crystal ball and give me a bit of insight into the way the European Union is going in a global sense?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Thank you, Mr Evans."
"Indeed, I feared I had understood the meaning of your question correctly and that I would not have to hear the clarification you have given."
"More seriously though, firstly, the outermost regions, all those that we call overseas, form part of the European Union, an important part, wherever those territories my be located and whether they have ties with France, Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom or wherever."
"You referred to existing overseas départements."
"Those départements have been French since the 17th century."
"Their inhabitants have been French citizens since 1848 - so that is nothing new - and all that has been taken into account from the outset, since the constituent Treaty establishing the original European Community and then the European Union."
"Another point you emphasise - but here I think it is a question of extending Europe's influences overseas - concerns the type of policy to be pursued."
"I believe it is important for us to make efforts there, not because a territory is French but because, let me repeat, it is also a question of influence."
"The other point you made, which is something that concerns the Council - and I here I will name no names - touches on a difficult subject, namely how to prevent offshore havens, whether overseas or on or near our continent."
"It is true that is a problem."
"Some work has been done at the Ecofin Council."
"A number of proposals were put forward and we are always trying to combat tax havens effectively, both at EU level and under international agreements to which the EU is a party."
"(LT) I would like to ask a not particularly serious question: should we be considering changing our name to the European and South American Union?"
"Moreover, following the possible accession of Turkey, should Asia be incorporated as well?"
"On a more serious note, though, EU citizens nevertheless possess very little knowledge of these overseas territories."
"Would it be possible for the EU information campaign to provide more information on these issues so that these countries feel closer and more familiar, especially to young citizens of the EU?"
"It would then enable them to have better understanding of these territories, and questions like this would not be asked."
"My thanks to the Council."
"I may have missed it, but I did not hear the Minister's response to the second part of Mr Evans's question in relation to the post-Irish referendum climate at Council."
"First of all, could he indicate exactly what the post-Irish referendum climate at Council is, and whether it is impacting on the processing of the applications from Croatia, Turkey and the other European states which are named?"
"In other words, what is the position now; post the Irish referendum, at the Council table in relation to these applications?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) In reply, first, to Mr Paleckis, I believe he is quite right."
"It is true that efforts are being made to educate and inform European citizens more about these remote but European regions."
"I see that they appear on euro notes, which is at least some progress."
"We need to go further, however, in terms of information and communication."
"I would say to Mrs Doyle that the question she raised is a very wide-ranging one."
"We must therefore concentrate on the ongoing negotiations."
"As far as the Council is concerned, those negotiations are based on the proposals put forward by the Commission on the basis of the screening reports, which is the entirely usual basis."
"We also made it clear that we were prepared to deepen relations with a number of other countries, in particular the Balkan countries, and that given the efforts that have been made, we would like to have closer relations not only with Croatia but also with Serbia and with other countries such as Bosnia and Montenegro."
"Then there is the question of partnerships."
"There will be an important summit between the European Union and Ukraine on 9 September."
"In the current context of the conflict between Russia and Georgia we will also try to develop the partnership with Ukraine and, as you know, yesterday we noted the need to strengthen relations with Georgia."
"That is my update on ongoing relations."
"Then there is the problem of the situation regarding the Lisbon Treaty."
"If we do not have the Lisbon Treaty, a number of Member States including mine - to take off my Union president's hat - have said that in effect the current treaty was a treaty of 27 and that in order to enlarge we did indeed need the Lisbon Treaty."
"I am telling you honestly, Mrs Doyle, that is the Council's position at present."
"Subject: Border Adjustment Measures (BAMs) on less carbon-efficient imports"
"Could the Council please outline its views on Border Adjustment Measures (BAMs) on less carbon-efficient imports from third countries in the post-2012 trading period of the EU ETS?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) The European Council considered your very important question at its meeting in March this year, when it pointed out that in a highly competitive global context there is a risk of carbon leakage in certain sectors, such as highly energy-intensive industries, which are particularly exposed to international competition."
"It is a real problem, which needs to be analysed and resolved in a new directive setting up a system of quota exchanges in the Community."
"The best way to tackle the question of carbon leakage and ensure that the Community system of exchanging emission quotas remains effective is still by concluding an international agreement, Mrs Doyle."
"It is clear, however, that we must also be prepared to act if we do not get an international agreement and we are currently discussing the most appropriate measures to keep our industry competitive while also ensuring that the EU plays an exemplary part in combating greenhouse gases."
"We believe it is important to do so in a way that will make sure that industries of all kinds have adequate visibility in relation to their investments, especially at a time when the economic climate has worsened and we are facing a slow-down of international growth, with all the signs suggesting that the situation will be the same next year."
"In the proposal for a directive, the Commission undertakes, in the light of the outcome of the international negotiations, to submit an analytical report accompanied by appropriate proposals for tackling the problems that may arise from the risks of carbon leakage."
"There are two possible options: to adjust the proportion of free quotas and/or to integrate importers of products manufactured by energy-intensive industrial sectors into the Community system, while making sure that system is compatible with the WTO rules."
"The Presidency of the Council hopes, of course, that the Council and this House will be able to clarify these matters, so as to ensure that Europe has an industrial base that is its own and is competitive and that we know as soon as possible what mechanisms will be applicable, before 2011."
"I accept that border adjustment measures must be part of our toolkit, but on the shelf, used as a carrot and not as a stick in facing any international negotiations where, in good faith, we tried to arrive at an international agreement to combat climate change."
"Could the Minister please comment on Article 20 of the WTO which allows for such a contingency, that is, a ban where conservation of exhaustible 'natural resources' are threatened?"
"Will carbon dioxide reduction goals come within that definition as clean air has heretofore?"
"I would like the Minister to develop his thoughts on this."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, Mrs Doyle, I believe, firstly, that as you rightly say we must use the various possible measures as a carrot rather than a stick, to ensure that there is no exemption from the obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"Secondly, we must find the right balance in relation to the demands of the industries, which are not always fair in that respect."
"In relation to Article 20 of the WTO, we believe this measure does indeed respond to the legitimate objective of conserving exhaustible natural resources."
"According to the experts' report we have received, it therefore complies with the rules of international trade law."
"I should like to welcome the Minister to this part-session here in Brussels, rather than in Strasbourg, and say how much I look forward to seeing the French presidency at future part-sessions here in Brussels, rather than in Strasbourg."
"As a follow-up to that, would he accept that one of the best ways to tackle global poverty is to encourage entrepreneurs in poor countries to start businesses and to create wealth through trade?"
"Given his apparent interest in border adjustment measures - which are really import taxes - how does he respond to the criticism that border adjustment measures are anti-development measures and really a European imperialist protectionist measure to keep out exports from developing countries and to keep poor people in poverty?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, in my capacity as President I shall remain calm in the fact of these absolutely unjustified and uncalled-for attacks, because we are certainly not alone in doing business in poor countries!"
"On a more serious note, I believe the mechanisms we are considering - and here I am also replying to what Mrs Doyle said a moment ago - are not a stick to be used against the developing countries."
"Looking at it very objectively, however, in the context of finding a balance between competitiveness and combating greenhouse gases, we really must establish a good balance in relation to our major partners."
"One of those major partners is the United States, which, as far as I know, does not have the same commitments today as we do in this area."
"Another is Japan, which also has fewer commitments and is making fewer efforts."
"Then there is Russia, of which I keep being told that it does not have the same values and that we must also know how to speak to it in realistic terms and that it is an emerging big power."
"There is Brazil, there is India and of course there is China, which is a member of the World Trade Organization."
"So I really do not see why we should stop being realistic and should be naive."
"We must wage an exemplary war against global warming."
"Europe is leading in that field and must continue to do so and keep its advantage in international negotiations such as Copenhagen next year."
"In that context, however, it has no need whatsoever to feel ashamed of defending its interests against powers that are at least as rich as we are."
"As was pointed out by other speakers during earlier questions, we have our pockets of poverty in Europe too."
"Subject: High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Accra (Ghana) in September"
"The High-Level forum on Aid Effectiveness in Accra, which is due to take place this September, presents a real opportunity for donors and partner governments to make further commitments that can be timetabled and monitored to make aid work better for the poor."
"How can the Council and Member States commit more ambitiously to the targets of the Paris Declaration of 2005?"
"Can the Council and Member States guarantee that not only will governments attempt to improve the efficiency of aid delivery through this declaration, but that the effectiveness of aid - in terms of how it brings about real improvements in the lives of the poor - will also be addressed?"
"Can the Council give an updated response to Parliament's Resolution (P6_TA(2008)0237) on the follow-up to the Paris Declaration of 2005 on Aid Effectiveness?"
"Now that we are at the halfway mark, how does the Council propose to make governments accountable for meeting their MDG commitments, given the fact that there has been a drop in EU aid figures from 0.41% of GNI in 2006 to 0.38% in 2007, a decrease of about 1.5 billion euros?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr Burke, your question concerns three aspects that are closely bound up with cooperation and development: aid effectiveness, the Millennium Development Goals and the volume of aid."
"It is a very topical question, with the third High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Accra meeting as from today and with less than a month to go before the high-level meeting on the Millennium Development Goals, to be held in New York on 25 September."
"Another major event will be the Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development, to be held in Doha from 29 November to 2 December, which will review the implementation of the Monterrey Consensus."
"The Council is hard at work in relation to all those conferences and has adopted a number of conclusions since June this year."
"On aid effectiveness, the Council acknowledges that despite some progress much remains to be done."
"We need to identify the sectors or projects where the Union can make a difference and bring added value in relation to the other donors."
"No doubt we must also use the national systems and make the recipients of the aid more aware of their responsibilities."
"That is the objective we have set ourselves for the Accra conference and we hope to see an ambitious strategic declaration in the context of the Accra action plan, setting out strong, precise and measurable objectives with a timetable for their implementation, to make our partners more aware of the importance of improving aid effectiveness."
"The second point concerns the Millennium Development Goals."
"All the partners, both donor countries and recipient countries, have a common responsibility to achieve these on a basis of sustainable development and must respect their commitments."
"The Council adopted the EU Agenda for Action on the MDGs in June this year and we have set out a number of intermediate goals with a view to achieving them."
"Lastly, on the volume of aid, it is true that we are concerned at the fall in the collective volume of official development aid, which fell from EUR 47.7 billion in 2006 to EUR 46 billion in 2007."
"Yet despite that drop, Europe remains the biggest donor, especially in Africa, and we hope the drop will only be temporary."
"If the statistics provided by the individual Member States are correct, we should have a very large volume of development aid in 2008 and should be able to attain our Millennium Goals for 2010 and 2015."
"That is why the Council has asked the Member States to establish rolling indicative timetables to show how they aim to achieve their ODA targets."
"Concerning cooperation within developing countries, I came across one case where the EU was giving EUR 1.2 million to a project in Ethiopia, and found that 17% VAT was being applied by the Ethiopian Government."
"I wonder, therefore, whether we have made any progress in dealing with developing countries that are receiving development aid."
"I also wonder whether we have had any indications from Member States at this stage as to what provisions they are making in their 2009 budgets for aid contributions in 2009."
"Will there be a reduction owing to the economic downturn in many countries, and is the presidency being proactive with Member States to ensure that this is not the case?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr Higgins, the three multinational battalions that make up the EUFOR forces in eastern Chad and the Central African Republic are now fully operational."
"The force, which is made up of some 3 200 troops, can now conduct all the missions assigned to it by the Council."
"Let me remind you that Albania, Croatia and Russia, which will soon be deploying four helicopters in the field, also form part of that force."
"Ukraine has opened negotiations but has taken no further action to date."
"As you know, your compatriot, General Patrick Nash, is the commander of the operation and the Presidency of the Council wants to pay special tribute to his professionalism."
"Following the joint EU/UN evaluation mission conducted in Chad and the Central African Republic from 18 to 24 June, Javier Solana reported back and made recommendations on the UN's follow-up of the operation."
"The Council approved Mr Solana's report on 25 June this year and the Secretary-General of the United Nations will draw on it for his report, which will be debated by the Security Council in the near future."
"I want to emphasise that ever since its deployment, EUFOR has acted in an impartial, independent and neutral manner."
"It has helped improve security in eastern Chad and the north-east of the Central African Republic, by deploying within the space of a few months, far from the European bases and in a very hostile environment, a force that is significant and dissuasive by its very presence, patrolling the entire area to help make it more secure, providing escorts for humanitarian organisations at their request, helping open supply routes, protecting sites on request or offering alternative solutions to help them carry out their tasks."
"Lastly, it has also helped ensure that the local police can be more active and broaden their usual field of action."
"EUFOR acts within the terms of its mandate and its activities were observed during the rebel attacks on Goz Beida and Biltine in mid-June this year, when it evacuated, sheltered and safeguarded some 300 humanitarian personnel who had requested this and it also prevented the looting of the market in the Goz Beida area."
"The Irish troops that were securing a site for displaced people reacted very effectively to direct firing."
"In July, during the confrontations between Dadjo and Mouro communities in Kerfi, EUFOR deployed a reinforced company to secure the area and evacuate around 30 humanitarian personnel."
"I want to stress that EUFOR coordinates very closely with the UN task force MINURCAT, which operates in the Central African Republic and Chad, and, as I said, it also coordinates very closely with humanitarian organisations."
"(GA) When the rainy season ends will war not ensue between government forces and rebel forces?"
"Would the Council be able to tell us which of the other towns are ready to participate in the mission in terms of troops, equipment and as well as money?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) EUFOR was not involved in the clashes between the government and the rebels, so it is scrupulously carrying out its mission in an entirely impartial manner and keeping entirely clear of the confrontations arising from the domestic problems between the government and the rebels."
"It is carrying out its mandate in a neutral manner, not interfering in the internal affairs of Chad and the Central African Republic and basically aiming to help improve security in eastern Chad and in the north-east of the Central African Republic."
"Each time it intervened in the confrontations and the incidents to which I have referred, it did so because humanitarian missions were at risk."
"It intervened in order to protect those missions."
"I was in Chad in March of this year three weeks after the rebel offensive."
"I spent six days there meeting different groups, and one of the things that came across to me was the need to bring representatives of the rebel groups to the table."
"I am just wondering if any progress has been made on that, either by the UN or by the European Union in the sense that, at the moment, I understand that there are between 7 000 to 10 000 people under 18 years of age carrying arms."
"If any progress is to be made, then the rebel groups have to be brought to the table by someone."
"I am just wondering whether any progress has been made on that."
"I just wanted to ask the Minister briefly about his views on the future of this mission."
"It is, I believe, supposed to end next March."
"Does he foresee the mission continuing under the UFOR flag for perhaps a further six months after that, or perhaps continuing under the UN flag?"
"Does he envisage any possibility that the mission might end next March?"
"As I said, I would just like his views on the future of the mission."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) In reply to Mr Burke and Mrs Harkin, I believe we have every reason to be proud of that mission."
"Let me remind you that it is the largest-scale mission ever deployed."
"In reply to Mrs Harkin, we are urging the need for a speedy transition to the United Nations to ensure that eventually MINURCAT can take over from the EUFOR mission."
"The EU special representative on the ground, Ambassador Torben Brylle, is in contact with the rebel groups."
"It would be a lie to say that all is well."
"I believe that this mission is absolutely essential, that it really does all it can for displaced people, for people who are suffering."
"We are faced with a real humanitarian tragedy, but it is also true that the mission still lacks resources - as we keep pointing out and lamenting - and that the Council is very keen to strengthen those resources before the United Nations takes over."
"In any case it will be a long-term enterprise."
"In reply to Mrs Harkin, let me say that we would therefore prefer a transition to an extension."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 19.05 and resumed at 21.00.)"
"Follow-up to a request for the defence of immunity: see Minutes"
"Special Report from the European Ombudsman following the draft recommendation to the European Commission in complaint 3453/2005/GG (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Proinsias De Rossa, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the Special Report from the European Ombudsman to the European Parliament following the draft recommendation to the European Commission in complaint 3453/2005/GG."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I am pleased to be here tonight, although I would have preferred it to have been a bit earlier."
"Nevertheless it is important that this report be debated in Parliament."
"This report concerns a complaint of maladministration against the Commission."
"The case has been referred to the European Parliament by way of a special report from the European Ombudsman."
"Referring a special report to the European Parliament is the last substantive step the Ombudsman may take in seeking a satisfactory response on behalf of a citizen."
"It is therefore a rare occasion on which reports of this kind are taken here."
"My report, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, endorses the Ombudsman's conclusion that the failure of the Commission to deal with the petitioner's complaint within what was objectively established by the Ombudsman as several years' unjustified delay constitutes an instance of maladministration."
"I would emphasise here that this report does not deal with the content of European law but with the manner in which the Commission failed to deal with a complaint, and I therefore want to indicate that I am not accepting the single amendment which has been tabled by the GUE/NGL Group to this report, which seeks to introduce elements relating to the law itself."
"In the original complaint to the Commission in 2001, the complainant, a doctor working in Germany, requested that the Commission open infringement proceedings against Germany, arguing that that country infringed Council Directive 93/104/EC, commonly known as the 'Working Time Directive'."
"The case was that Germany's transposition of that Directive insofar as the activity of doctors and hospitals was concerned, in particular as regards time spent on call by these doctors, was in breach of the Directive."
"In the complainant's view, this resulted in a considerable risk for both staff and patients."
"The Ombudsman found with regard to that compliant that the 15 months it had taken the Commission before it started to deal with the complaint was a case of maladministration."
"In the mean time, new German legislation seeking to properly transpose the Directive was put in place, and the Commission informed the complainant that it needed time to examine this new legislation in order to consider its compatibility with Community law and whether or not it had dealt effectively with the complaint that had been made."
"Then, in 2004, it informed the complainant that it had adopted new proposals to amend the original Directive, and it would examine the complaint in the light of those proposals."
"One year later, in 2005, the complainant again had to turn to the Ombudsman to the effect that the Commission was ignoring the Ombudsman's earlier findings."
"There is no evidence, since that proposal was prepared in 2004, that the Commission has taken any further steps in order to proceed with its investigation of the doctor's complaint."
"Instead of taking one of two possible decisions - either to initiate formal infringement proceedings or to close the case - the Commission abstained from taking any further action as regards its investigation."
"Indeed, the fact that the Directive was due for amendment (which, incidentally, has still not occurred - and this is now 2008) is in no way relevant to the complaint."
"Community law does not envisage the possibility of disregarding existing laws and judgments on the grounds that new rules are being considered and may be introduced."
"My report further asks the Commission to provide a list naming the Member States whose legislation is not in line with all the provisions of the Working Time Directive and specifying the action it is taking with regard to this."
"It urges the Commission to take prompt action in accordance with its prerogatives in all cases and in all Member States where the transposition of implementation, or implementation of the existing directives, does not comply with the law laid down by the legislative branch, and indeed the European Court of Justice."
"I recommend this report to the House."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for allowing me to put my views on the Member's speech and to put my views more generally on the case under discussion."
"The complaint relating to the Working Time Directive is connected with the judgments of the Court of Justice in the SIMAP and Jaeger cases concerning on-call working time, as has already been said."
"This is a matter which the Directive does not expressly address."
"Furthermore, according to many Member States, the interpretation made by the Court of Justice gave rise to fundamental problems and had a far-reaching impact on the financing and organisation of public health care and emergency services."
"In an attempt to tackle the problems caused by these judgments, the Commission undertook extensive consultation in 2004."
"It came to the conclusion that an appropriate solution was to propose an amendment which would clarify the application of the Directive in the field of on-call working time and time off in lieu."
"This amendment was presented by the Commission in 2004."
"In view of the exceptional importance of these matters for public health care services, the Commission decided in 2004 that it would not institute proceedings for infringement of the law in cases where the law would be changed by the proposed amendment."
"The Commission acknowledges that, in this case, the time taken was unusually long, but I have given the reasons."
"In view of the fact that the existing acquis remains in force until such time as the proposed amendment enters into force, the Commission left it open as to how to handle this actual complaint, and also other complaints relating to this matter."
"Furthermore, in justifiable cases, it instituted proceedings for the infringement of the law in connection with complaints relating to the Working Time Directive, but not falling under the jurisdiction of the amendment."
"The Commission is also carefully monitoring and analysing resulting amendments to the national regulations in all Member States and the reactions of legislators, national courts and representatives of workers and employers to the decisions of the Court of Justice."
"This is very important, since the questions included in the actual complaint to which the report refers are in actual fact topical for more than one Member State."
"The Commission will shortly submit to Parliament, in about two months time, a detailed report on the implementation of the Working Time Directive, providing complex and up-to-date information on compliance with the acquis, including the SIMAP-Jaeger judgments, in all 27 Member States."
"The report will also include reactions to several proposals in the existing report."
"As regards the conclusions relating to the handling of proceedings for infringement of the law in general, the Commission is of the opinion that, in view of the specific context of the complaint under the terms of the Working Time Directive, relating to changes to on-call working time, it is not appropriate to deduce general conclusions on the handling of proceedings for infringement of the law which the Commission normally conducts."
"The period of one year for decisions on complaints received by the Commission is usually appropriate, but is laid down expressly as a general principle which need not apply in all cases."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I am speaking on my own behalf but also on behalf of the 34 Members on the Employment Committee who voted last May in favour of the own-initiative report we drafted for this debate."
"We all agree with the report and appreciate and value what Mr De Rossa, who has our full support, has done."
"We wish to state in a few short seconds that we are concerned not only about the background to the time spent on call by doctors and the Working Time Directive but because we are facing a situation of concern to us: European citizens do not receive a reply when they seek information from the Commission."
"Secondly, we are concerned because the Commission would appear to be aware that there is a legislative lacuna when it initiates procedures to amend directives."
"Although the time I have is very brief, I must tell the Commissioner that regardless of what we or the Commission might think about case-law or the law in force, it is under an obligation to implement the Treaties and move ahead, and that it has no authority to hold any rule or anything which may affect the Community acquis in abeyance."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank Mr De Rossa for his report."
"I listened very carefully to the Commission's response, and I would like to repeat that this report is about how the Commission dealt with a complaint."
"While the subject matter was obviously very controversial and topical, what we are talking about here tonight in this debate is how the Commission deals with complaints."
"We support the Ombudsman's conclusions in relation to the inordinate delay, as acknowledged by the Commission this evening in this House."
"Let me just say that, on the point of complaints, people get in touch with the Commission because they have a problem and expect some sort of response - perhaps not an immediate one, but certainly nothing that takes months and years."
"I would bring to your attention an issue concerning Equitable Life, where we had some light-touch regulation and not great clarity about how Community law was actually being implemented - and we have seen the dire consequences of that particular issue."
"Lastly, there is a current complaint with the Commission about the application of Irish planning law."
"While the Commission was very active and supportive initially, I fear that there is now a silence."
"I would like some progress on that issue."
"Mr President, although this report has no legislative content, it is especially important for the interpretation and development of European law."
"For this reason, I congratulate the Ombudsman on the initiative to draft the special report, and also my colleague Mr De Rossa for supporting the position that the Commission's discretionary power in handling complaints does not allow for arbitrary interpretations, especially against citizens."
"The trust we would like European citizens to have in the Union is based both on the introduction of legislation to protect their rights and above all on their correct implementation."
"The Commission ought to honour its role as custodian of the Treaties and not allow the Council's decisions to be obstructed when reviewing European law, thus hindering the implementation of existing laws."
"Moreover, the EU ought to have an immediate effect wherever procedures allow it to."
"The Commission is obliged to demonstrate the States' reluctance or inability to apply European legislation."
"Thus, on the one hand, citizens will learn to check to what extent their national authorities adhere to their European obligations while, on the other hand, governments will at long last have to be answerable for these commitments."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr De Rossa, on his excellent report."
"As a member of the Committee on Petitions, I am always very conscious of the fact that for many EU citizens we are the face of the EU."
"When I say 'we' I mean the Committee on Petitions itself, and the Commission, which also evaluates petitions."
"In this particular instance, the complainant was effectively ignored and the Ombudsman's verdict was that this constituted maladministration."
"I am pleased to see that the rapporteur and the Committee on Petitions agree with his position."
"European citizens have a right to expect that the Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, will ensure that European legislation is implemented in a timely and effective manner."
"They have the right to expect a timely response as well as an effective one, and while the Commission has discretion as to how to proceed in a certain case - i.e. whether or not to instigate infringement proceedings - it does not have the discretion to fail to adopt a position within a reasonable amount of time, which was the case in this matter."
"With regard to Amendment 1, this is a matter that needs to be dealt with, but separately from this report."
"Finally, just a personal comment on the work of the Committee on Petitions: sending in a petition is, for many citizens, their only contact with the EU institutions."
"It is crucial that this system works in an effective and transparent manner."
"The Commission is part of the process, but so too is Parliament."
"We must ensure that sufficient resources are available to the committee to carry out its work in an effective and timely manner."
"To fully understand this issue, we need to put ourselves in the shoes of the petitioner and see it from their perspective."
"As an individual or a small group they are taking on the system."
"If the system does not respond in an effective manner they see it as a bureaucratic nightmare, and this alienates the petitioner and probably everybody they speak to about the matter."
"For the sake of the public and of the EU, that is something we must not do."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I am speaking today on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations, but also as chairman of the Committee on Petitions."
"I am pleased that all those who have spoken on this item so far are members of that Committee, as indeed is the President chairing today's proceedings."
"So we are very well acquainted with these issues."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the reason for today's report by Proinsias De Rossa, whom I congratulate on an excellent document, is a report from the European Ombudsman, with whom we, as the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions, work together on a permanent basis. Our collaboration with the European Ombudsman is highly satisfactory."
"All of us come into daily contact with his work, since the Committee on Petitions is the body which Parliament has made responsible for relations with the Ombudsman."
"All of us speaking on this item are aware that the length of proceedings is a nightmare for the European institutions, and therefore obviously also a nightmare for the citizens of Europe."
"We must accordingly call on the European Commission to make every effort to carry out all the duties imposed on it more rapidly."
"I would stress the crucial point in Proinsias De Rossa's report, namely the first paragraph, which states that 'the European Parliament endorses the European Ombudsman's recommendation to the Commission.'"
"Parliament endorses the Ombudsman's recommendation, as it usually does, because, as usual, we consider his demands and arguments well-founded."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by addressing the Commissioner."
"This morning, Commissioner, you tried to tell us what a fine programme the Commission had in store for the people of Europe, one that would provide them with good jobs and show the social face of the EU."
"But when it comes to taking concrete action, the Commission cops out."
"The present case concerns a complaint made by a German doctor and the action taken in response to it."
"It was quite simply about at least reviewing compliance with the existing minimum standards governing working hours in the European Union."
"The Commission could not even manage that."
"Your reaction has been far removed from what one would expect of a guardian of the Treaties."
"You say nothing for years, and then you even relax the standards."
"That is what the public perceive as a betrayal of their rights."
"With this silence and the amendments to the Working Time Directive you have inflicted massive damage on the project of European union."
"That has to be made clear."
"(PL) Mr President, complaints submitted by citizens are an important source of information about infringements of Community law."
"The case in hand, which has been dragging on for seven years, concerns the German Government's failure to implement properly the directive on certain aspects of the organisation of working time (that is Directive 2003/88, which revoked and replaced Directive 93/104)."
"In the Ombudsman's opinion, the lack of an effective response on the part of the European Commission constitutes maladministration."
"The unjustified period of time, sometimes amounting to several years, which the Commission takes to prepare its response in cases of negligence on the part of Member States gives cause for concern, as do the numerous cases of Member States' failure to comply with judgments of the Court of Justice."
"Such practices undermine faith in the consistent application of Community law, discredit the aims of the European Union, and diminish citizens' confidence in the EU institutions."
"The manner in which citizens' complaints are examined must conform to the principles of good administration."
"Complaints must be examined efficiently and in the shortest possible time."
"(PL) Mr President, complaints concerning the organisation of working time are matters of urgency."
"Consider what may happen if working time rules are breached in the case of doctors: that could lead to a surgeon having to perform a complicated operation after being duty for 23 hours."
"There is a whole series of professions in which improper organisation of working time can endanger life."
"It is therefore of exceptional importance that complaints be acted on within a reasonable time."
"Mr President, I have two points."
"Firstly, I should like to endorse what Ms Harkin said in relation to resources."
"Perhaps there is a problem within the Commission in terms of resources: if there is, we should hear that."
"Secondly, it takes a very strong-minded citizen to persist with a complaint that is being ignored, and I fear for the many who do not have the time, resources or, perhaps, the ability to keep pushing against the system."
"How many of those fall by the wayside - or, indeed, is there ever a record kept?"
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to emphasise just a few fundamental points which, in my opinion, still need to be addressed."
"In this case, we are dealing with one complaint."
"This complaint does not constitute a general rule, since reacting in a timely manner to citizens' initiatives is fundamental and one of the most important obligations."
"I think that, on looking closely at the extent of the agenda, it becomes obvious that the Commission proceeds rigorously in these cases."
"This case was exceptional in that its consequences could have affected several individual Member States as a whole."
"Therefore, in 2004 the Commission used its discretionary right and proceeded as it did."
"At this moment in time, I think that time has clearly shown that it was not quite the best decision, but it is a decision which was within the discretionary options open to the Commission."
"I should like to say that cases of infringement involving a failure to observe the law in matters relating to the Working Time Directive are conducted at the normal tempo, since, as I have already said, whatever the very serious grounds for the decision were, time has shown that it was not the best decision."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to thank everyone who has stayed back tonight and participated in this debate, and also the Commissioner for his response to the debate."
"His acknowledgement that there were, in fact, exceptional delays, and that it was not, perhaps, appropriate that that delay should occur, is welcome."
"Nevertheless, there is still a difference of opinion between the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman on the Commission's interpretation of its right not to deal with a complaint when it considers that it should not."
"We are of the view that this discretion does not extend to an eight-year delay, which is what we are talking about here."
"I welcome the fact that the Commissioner has announced the publication of a report within two months which will outline the compliance of all of the Member States, including as regards the particular complaint that we are dealing with here tonight."
"I believe that earlier action by the Commission could well have driven earlier change in the Working Time Directive, and might perhaps have resulted in forestalling, at an earlier date, the risks which patients and, indeed, doctors and nurses in the health service in our hospitals have run over these years, where they have been working and on call for anything up to 100 hours a week."
"I think the dispute on this issue highlights the weakness of the current infringement procedures, and the manner in which political considerations as well as resource considerations can come into play on sensitive issues, which should be dealt with in accordance with the law rather than in accordance with political sensitivities."
"Finally, it has to be said that normally complaints of this kind are dealt with between the Ombudsman and the agency, the Commission or indeed the Council, against whom complaints have been made."
"It is very rare that we have to deal with this matter in this House."
"It is a rare occasion that this House is asked to endorse the decision of the Ombudsman against the Commission."
"It is a cause of deep regret for me that we have to do this but, unfortunately, that is the case."
"Therefore, I would like the Commissioner at some point to indicate, concede and acknowledge that he has accepted that the delay was not acceptable;"
"I would also like to hear from him a commitment that some procedures will be put in place to ensure that complaints will never again be allow to run to this length of time."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)."
"Equality between women and men - 2008 (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Iratxe García Pérez, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on Equality between women and men - 2008."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin my speech by expressing my thanks to the Commission for its 2008 report on equality between men and women, which takes a comprehensive approach both to policies to mainstream the gender dimension and towards specific positive discrimination measures."
"Although, admittedly, we should point out that the Commission's report has work matters at its core, it takes no account of many other issues and difficult situations which women encounter and we have therefore tried to incorporate them into this Parliament report."
"I also wish to thank all my colleagues who have by their efforts helped improve the report as initially presented."
"There is common agreement that despite the progress that has been made, there is still much to be done."
"In that regard complacency is likely to be our worst enemy."
"If we are unaware of the challenges and the work which is yet to be done it will be difficult for us to make headway on equality issues."
"The outlook of this report is based on the principle of gender mainstreaming, and the report raises various matters which have a bearing on that principle."
"They are all important and we can not ignore any of them: incorporating women into the labour market, domestic violence, women in education, balancing family life with work, and vulnerable groups such as immigrant women or the disabled."
"All these aspects must be borne in mind and merit exhaustive study and analysis, but I would like in the time available to me to focus on the aspects which I regard as most important."
"Domestic violence is the greatest social scourge of our time, not only in Europe but worldwide."
"A social injustice in which women, purely because they are women, experience violence at the hands of men because chauvinistic values are still fairly deep-rooted in our society."
"Accordingly it is necessary to encourage laws in Member Status to combat this social plague."
"We have a very good example in Spain, where a few years ago the Law against Domestic Violence was incorporated into the national legal order; it recognises the rights of mistreated women and implements a comprehensive policy ranging from prevention, to treatment and reintegration of the women affected."
"As far as women and the labour market are concerned, we should be aware that we are a long way still from achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Women's employment has risen but unemployment figures for women are still much higher than those for men, and we must therefore take political measures, both through the European Commission and the Member States, which encourage women to join the labour market on the same terms as men."
"Another fact of life which we cannot skate over is the difference in wages; this has stood at 15% since 2003."
"Greater measures which have the agreement of business and the unions are needed."
"Also in this report we propose that the Community institutions and the Member States should declare 22 February as International Equal Pay Day."
"A woman would need to work 52 more days a year to earn the same wage as a man."
"On finding a work/life balance, we must change the fact that currently 85% of informal carers are women."
"We need more public services whose role is to provide childcare and care for dependants."
"Similarly, as regards participation by women in public life, we should encourage initiatives to increase participation through social organisations, unions and political parties."
"Electoral quotas were a decisive step which must continue as we strive for equality in democracy."
"There are other key aspects such as access to education, the overturning of social stereotypes, the issues and difficulties facing women in rural communities, which we cannot ignore."
"We must join forces to that end."
"We must work closely with organisations and make the fundamental European Union principle of equality between men and women a reality, because by so doing we will be moving towards a Europe with more law and greater social justice."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the report and motion for a resolution on equality between women and men in the European Union."
"Acceptance of the report emphasises Parliament's undertaking with regard to equality between women and men and confirms Parliament's support for the Commission's approach."
"I should like to thank above all the rapporteur, Mrs Garcia Pérez, for the support that she expressed for the steps taken by the European Commission in this field."
"Equality between women and men is one of the fundamental values of the European Union."
"It also represents an area in which Europe has often moved ahead of social developments."
"In recent years it also has commenced important and ambitious initiatives."
"Acceptance of the plan to achieve equal status between women and men emphasises the Commission's willingness to use all means to bring Europe closer to real equality between women and men in all areas."
"Furthermore, the Commission notes that Parliament's motion for a resolution emphasises certain topics which are included in the plan's priorities."
"This involves in particular the position of women in the labour market, the work-life balance, a balanced accession to leading positions and also the fight to stop violence against women."
"This approach complies with the Commission's policy in this field and includes topics which were emphasised in the report for 2008."
"Although the progress made in the field of equality between women and men is obvious, we are still faced with important tasks."
"We must continue with our efforts and strengthen the legal base."
"The Commission shares the rapporteur's view that a central role is played in the achievement of equality between women and men by the work-life balance."
"We are well aware that it is mostly women who take responsibility for the family and the home."
"This is why women, more often than men, have to interrupt their studies and careers, very often not returning to them."
"In order to increase female employment, therefore, it is vital to have access to high-quality and affordable childcare."
"The Commission will be presenting a report on developments in this field in the weeks to come."
"Furthermore, in 2006 and 2007 the Commission consulted representatives of workers and employers on the topic of work-life balance."
"In July 2008, they indicated their intention to negotiate on parental leave."
"The Commission is not at the moment submitting any proposals on this topic."
"The Commission intends in the near future to present a package of initiatives relating to the work-life balance, in particular a report on childcare, a draft directive amending the Directive on maternity leave and a draft directive amending the 1986 Directive on 'assisting spouses'."
"The current situation of assisting spouses in agriculture and also in other sectors where there are family businesses is unacceptable."
"It is not acceptable for people working regularly for family businesses in some countries not to have any right to social security and to find themselves in a position of great need in the event of divorce, death of the breadwinner or financial difficulty."
"A policy of equality is of fundamental importance in preventing and combating violence committed against the opposite sex, since this is based on the imbalance of strength between men and women."
"Effective measures against violence based on gender, on the other hand, make a contribution to protecting women's rights in society and supporting equality."
"Violence against women is unacceptable."
"Rape, sexual abuse of girls, trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual or labour exploitation, domestic violence, workplace harassment, and also traditional or disfiguring practices - such as, for example, mutilation of the sex organs - impair the health, freedom, dignity and physical and emotional inviolability of women."
"Our interventions must be thorough and exceptionally effective, in particular in cases where violence against women is committed by international organised crime, as in the case of people trafficking."
"For this reason, the Commission considers that, as part of its working programme for 2009, it will revise and rewrite the legislation relating to people trafficking, exploitation and sexual abuse of children, which is a terrible crime committed mainly against girls."
"In conclusion, I should like to say that equality policy plays a fundamental role in changing thinking and behaviour."
"It is therefore key in ensuring not only legal equality but also real equality between women and men."
"The Commission therefore welcomes the support given to it by the European Parliament through this motion for a resolution."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - Mr President, first of all I would like to say that this is a very comprehensive report and highlights many of the issues that must be dealt with in order to ensure equality between women and men."
"I am particularly pleased to see that the issue of violence against women is dealt with, because for too many people violence against women is seen as a women's issue, whereas in fact it is a societal issue, and until it is dealt with as a societal issue we cannot hope to eliminate it."
"Furthermore, I agree with the rapporteur and her statement about the feminisation of poverty and about the groups that are particularly at risk, as well as the central issue of ensuring equal access to pensions and social welfare payments."
"In this context, I would like to have seen paragraph 14 from my opinion taken on board, where I make this case specifically for carers."
"Given that by 2030 the ratio of active to inactive people will be 2:1, the role of family carers will become much more significant, and given that there are already 100 million carers in the EU - men and women but predominantly women - without proper access to social welfare payments or pensions, we need to ensure that this generation of carers does not become the next generation of poorer, older people adding to the feminisation of poverty."
"Finally a personal comment on paragraph 9 which does not reflect the views of the Employment Committee: I believe that the text should be qualified by stating the need to respect national legislative processes when considering the issue of abortion."
"There is a protocol to the Treaty of Maastricht which ensures that EU law will not override Article 40.3.3 of the Irish Constitution on the protection of the unborn."
"During the Lisbon debate in Ireland, many citizens said to me that the EU was intent on pushing to have abortion available in Ireland."
"Even though I said that this was not the case, many still argued that Parliament was pushing the agenda, and that is why I believe our intention needs to be clear."
"The issue is not one's view on abortion."
"Mine, I suspect, may be different to that of the rapporteur, but that is not the point."
"The issue is one of subsidiarity, and citizens, whatever their position on abortion, need to be able to rely on that."
"I believe all of us in this Parliament should respect that as well."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - (ES) Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the apt approach she took when drafting this report on equality between men and women."
"As rapporteur for the Cultural Committee I would like to highlight the main contributions our committee made, which were obviously related to areas within our purview such as education, culture, sport and communication."
"First, we proposed promoting equal behaviour in schools, and removing the gender stereotypes which are still too widespread in some media; taking measures to change the segregation of labour in the different stages of the schools system so that there is equal involvement of teachers of both sexes at each stage; eliminating any discrimination in terms of salary on grounds of sex in the fields of education, culture and sport and communication; and encouraging greater participation by women in the management bodies of those sectors where women are in the minority."
"As the rapporteur has already said, there is still a long way to go."
"I am reminded of a couple of lines by Machado, who said, 'Traveller, there is no way ahead, you make your way by walking' because, my friends, we will achieve equality even as we fight for it."
"Mr President, on behalf of my political group I congratulate the committee on its report."
"Congratulations are also due to my fellow Member for expressing Parliament's view in her report, even though on certain points we suggested amendments to improve it and to show, through Parliament's report, that we recognise what has happened on the basis of the roadmap for equality, and on the basis of the pact for gender equality."
"We have had considerable quantitative success."
"We still have to improve on how well we implement the measures."
"We must ensure effective implementation and extended legal protection through the appointment of a competent body for complaints in each Member State by laying down sanctions based on the proportionality principle."
"We also want the subsidiarity and free-choice principles to be maintained."
"As far as work in the family combined with professional life is concerned, we do not want just working women to be covered."
"Cover should extend to the unemployed, those who decide to be involved solely with their households, those in the liberal professions and those who are self-employed in family businesses."
"We want to reinforce maternity and family leave."
"We believe that the communication we are awaiting from the Commission will cover us at this point with a good proposal."
"Since women study and work more, they deserve to be paid for all types of service provision."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) Thank you."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's regular assessments, which give us a clear picture of the actual situation, are extremely important on the path towards creating gender equality."
"Commissioner Špidla's commitment to this matter is well known."
"The first report on gender equality was prepared five years ago, and we are right to expect results now."
"According to the 2008 report on equality between women and men, there has been some progress, but unfortunately it also mentions some frozen areas where there has not been any perceptible movement."
"The wage gap between men and women has stagnated at 15% over the last five years, and my colleague mentioned that this means 54 days, or up to 22 February."
"The ratio of women to men is still unfavourable in decision-making, and the image of women suggested by the media is disadvantageous."
"The biggest problem is that there has been no significant progress in precisely the area of employment and related issues, yet these really are crucial, partly because of the challenges to the demography of the EU and partly because of economic growth and ensuring equality."
"These main priorities resolutely demand increased involvement of women in the labour market."
"A quantitative success of the Lisbon Strategy is the 12 million new jobs that have been created, of which 7.5 million have been filled by women, but this does not mean an improvement in quality."
"Compulsory part-time work, the planned 65-hour working week, the horizontal and vertical labour markets and segregation will unfortunately lead to the compatibility of work and private life remaining an intractable question that will continue to grow due to the lack of child-care institutions."
"I consider it necessary that Member States prepare further coordinated strategies and methods, and implement them effectively in practice, and also that they provide real political support."
"I would like to congratulate my colleague on her work; she has presented an excellent report."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I would obviously like first to thank my friend and colleague Iratxe García for the work she has done for this report, which I view as an important and complete piece of work."
"I would also like to highlight at least four of the points raised in the report and mentioned by the rapporteur in her speech which are also important to my group."
"First, the need for European institutions to take a step forward in view of the current wave of chauvinistic violence, and to do so both in terms of legislation and to establish a clear legal basis to enable all forms of violence against women to be combated; this should include, for example, recognition of the right of asylum on grounds of gender-based persecution."
"Secondly, with a view to ensuring greater participation by women in decision-making, it is necessary for all institutions and political parties to study this issue and take specific measures on it, and we do not rule out electoral quotas here."
"Thirdly, it is important to acknowledge once and for all that in order to ensure total emancipation of women, women must be the ones who take the decisions on their sexual and reproductive health rights."
"Fourthly, and expressing regret at the lack of progress in the wage differences between women and men in recent years, the notorious 'pay gap', it is crucial for the Commission and the Member States to assess the strategies and actions which, in concert with social stakeholders, should enable that situation to be corrected."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report and I support it in full."
"I will also support the amendments on the labour market tabled by Mrs Figueiredo."
"I have only one minute's speaking time now, so I won't bring up any special policy issues."
"I merely want to say one thing which I think worth pointing out."
"The rapporteur lists different measures which need to be taken in order to achieve equality between women and men."
"When she does this, it results in a total of 45 items."
"I repeat: 45 items!"
"In the EU and its Member States which have long claimed to prioritise equal rights between men and women, this report shows 45 different areas which need to be changed."
"There is no need to say more, other than that I say yes to the report and, above all, yes to concrete action now!"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, an important element in the report, in my view, is the call to make it easier for employees to return to work after a career break for maternity or parental leave and to remove the disparities in remuneration and education."
"It is nevertheless hard to accept the direct causal connection made between life problems affecting many people and the fact of being a women."
"Treating social life as a battle of the sexes, with the creation of a new enemy on the previous model of the class struggle, gives those who advocate it the right to unlimited interference in every sphere of human existence, including the functioning of the family."
"The problem in Europe is not the struggle between men and women."
"It is the lack of respect for rights and moral principles, manifested especially by unrestrained greed and selfishness."
"As a woman I would prefer that equal rights did not result in equality with men in every respect, but rather led to arrangements that protect women and alleviate their burdens."
"No longer being treated as an impersonal workforce, they could then make a creative contribution in many areas of the economy."
"(SK) This 2008 report on equality between women and men summarises a European Parliament report which has already been adopted and which created a great stimulus that needs to be applied in practice."
"I view it as a reflection of the work of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and I should therefore first of all like to thank Mrs García Pérez for producing it."
"In order to meet the Lisbon targets, it is essential to make the fullest possible use of the potential of women on the labour market."
"It is also important for women to have the best possible access to postgraduate studies and life-long learning and also access to new technologies and the information society in order to be able to be competitive in the labour market."
"I greatly admire the women heading large companies and also small family firms and creating new job opportunities."
"Alongside her daily tasks as a wife and mother, a businesswoman also takes on management tasks in her company, assuming responsibility not only for the success of her family but also for the success of her company."
"As a society, we do not always give sufficient recognition to the importance of this task for society."
"Women in leading positions are forced to overcome many additional obstacles associated in particular with their family responsibilities."
"Harmonisation of family and working life is one of the main prerequisites for increasing female employment."
"It is therefore essential to propose measures to motivate fathers to take parental leave, dividing maternity leave between both parents."
"Many women are aware today that they will not attain important positions on the basis of social support programmes, but only on the basis of their own abilities."
"Chancellor Angela Merkel is an obvious example that we women also have our own firm position in world politics."
"When we look at the history books, we read a lot about men's heroics."
"Women only appear in the background."
"I am convinced that it is our responsibility to put the spotlight on the anonymous hoards of women involved in our society, without whom the world could not move forward."
"(RO) Dear colleagues, there are issues people talk about a lot, but little is done."
"In the debate on the social package, we talked about the lack of instruments required to make the principle of equal pay for work of equal value applicable and to reduce the pay gap between men and women."
"Without them, our commitments are only words and the legislation is useless."
"There are also issues for which very little or nothing is done but that we do not even talk about."
"People do not really talk about the 100,000 women trafficked every year, except here, late in the evening; probably because they are goods, not citizens."
"Most of them are trafficked for prostitution."
"We request firmer integrated actions against trafficking networks, as well as concerted actions to discourage the demand for prostitution."
"Without demand, there is no reason for trafficking to exist."
"People also do not talk about the situation of women working as housekeepers in the domestic environment; they are invisible."
"Without any social rights or with minimum rights, they face the same risk of abuse as women do in their own families, including the risk of exploitation."
"For those who work in foreign countries, the non-exercise of political rights adds to the fragility of their social and economic situation."
"Correct regulation of their situation is not only a present matter of justice, but it could prevent the maintenance of the high poverty rate among older women in the future."
"Another subject we cannot talk about is the women in my country's government, because they simply do not exist."
"Dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, we consider it is time to go from making statements about what we should do to doing what we should do."
"(PT) Mr President, evidence shows that discrimination against women persists and ultimately affects women workers, whose wages are on average over 15% lower than men's."
"In some countries, including Portugal, this figure rises to over 25%, a situation that has actually become aggravated in recent years."
"We therefore call for the upgrading of employment, decent wages, compliance with social, health and safety standards and a reduction in the working day without loss of pay."
"This could help to create more jobs with rights for women and ensure better reconciliation of work and family life."
"The adoption of measures to combat the labour precariousness that affects women in particular and to enhance collective bargaining in defending male and female workers must be encouraged."
"The adoption of public measures and actions to improve women's access to sexual and reproductive health services and to raise their awareness of their rights and the public services available to them must also be encouraged, while respecting their dignity."
"Mr President, there is enormous discrimination against women in the United Kingdom, sadly."
"I know my own committee - the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - have their heart in the right place."
"However, most of the discrimination comes because the employment laws are so onerous for small businesses recruiting young women that they simply discriminate in a covert way."
"I think it is the classic law of unintended consequence."
"You make a law here, you make a law there, and what actually happens is that nothing happens, which actually reinforces the position."
"I do not mean to sound ungallant, but when I look round my committee - the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - I see that their mindset is deeply locked in the 1970s - they have not moved on."
"I am afraid that life is not like that any more, and when I hear people talk about the emancipation of women, I am sorry, but as an Englishman, that happened a very long time ago."
"I do not know what problems other countries have, but please do not lay all this on the United Kingdom, where we do not have the problem, because, although, again, I say your heart is in the right place (the law of unintended consequences), you are making a real bollocks of it."
"Mr President, it may be a useful coincidence that I am speaking after Godfrey Bloom, who seems to inhabit somewhere deep within the 19th century."
"He is, indeed, the man famous for saying, not so very long ago, that women should clean behind the fridge and that that was one of their major roles in life."
"If it is me who has not moved on, then I am proud, because I do not wish to be associated in any way, particularly as an Englishwoman, with comments such as those."
"What I do want to say is that this excellent report has raised very many important issues, and I thank the rapporteur for that."
"I also thank the Commissioner for the comments he made."
"One particular point I wish to pick up on is the whole question of trafficking."
"As a representative from London - and, indeed, a woman representative from London - I have had a particular interest in this subject, because London is one of the places very much affected by trafficking in women."
"Member States are currently being asked to sign the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking."
"Although some of the Member States have signed this, there are others - 15, in fact - that have not yet signed, and indeed there are two that do not seem prepared to do so."
"I would therefore ask that all EU Member States ratify this convention against trafficking, and that everyone here, including all the members of the Committee on Women's Rights, take it upon themselves to go back to their governments and push them to do even more work than they may already be doing about the whole vile and evil trade of trafficking in women."
"(CS) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the report presented by Mrs Pérez and the European Commission."
"The statistics showing that female employment has increased in recent years to a level of 57.2% sound good, but, as the report states, a whole range of problems remain."
"Women still occupy only one-third of the leading positions in private companies and in other areas, including politics."
"A large proportion of new jobs are not covered by long-term contracts of employment and so future prospects are uncertain."
"These are the kinds of jobs which often go to women."
"They are still regarded as people whose main responsibility is care of the family, with earnings from work representing just a supplement to the family budget."
"This is why women are still worse paid than men for the same work and with the same qualifications."
"These stereotypes continue to represent one of the instruments of discrimination against women on the labour markets."
"I find the willingness of employers to give women allowances to help them with childcare and thus facilitate their further professional and career development to be very unsatisfactory."
"(RO) We talk about the need to combat violence against women, encourage women's participation in civic activities and an aspect that falls under the activity of the Committee on culture - discrepancies between women's and men's education."
"Although women obtain better results than men in the field of education, there is still a pay inequality between genders in the labour market."
"Personally, as a member of the Committee on Culture and Education, I submitted an amendment to the opinion drafted by CULT regarding this report."
"I consider it to be essential to eliminate from the mass-media the images presenting women in degrading situations, taking into account the impact that the media of mass communication have on public perceptions and attitudes."
"Ensuring equality between women and men in all the fields of action of the European Union's policies is still a current issue in Western society."
"(SK) The report begins with a paragraph stating that equality between women and men is a fundamental principle of the European Union, a principle which has been in place for more than 50 years."
"The second part of the report, however, continues with 46 paragraphs containing recommendations, invitations or requests for this principle to be observed."
"There are also fundamental recommendations such as equal access to funds, education, health care or remuneration."
"There is a request to combat violence against women, a request to combat trafficking in women and much more."
"Such reports are certainly important and I congratulate the rapporteur."
"On the other hand, however, it talks about the inadequate implementation of documents already adopted."
"It points to inadequate control and sanctions."
"It also points, however, to the insincerity of politicians who outwardly declare support for equality between women and men but, in practice, do not observe it, and this is why expectations are not as we would wish."
"(PL) Mr President, when we analyse the resolution on equality between women and men, it is difficult not to support it."
"I refer in particular to the points concerning violence against women and the need for education from the earliest years about discrimination against them."
"We are well aware that a proper upbringing and education is the best way to root out discrimination and violence against women."
"EU citizens are fairly uninformed about trafficking in women and largely unaware of the existence in our times of this dreadful, brutal trade, which is unacceptable in a civilised world."
"I therefore believe significant resources should be allocated to an information campaign."
"It must be pointed out, however, that despite all the difficult problems we are discussing, there has been significant progress towards equality between women and men in recent years, and it is especially noticeable in rural areas."
"(RO) Mr. President, equality between men and women should be a basic principle of the European society."
"The latest Eurobarometer survey indicates the fact that women in the rural environment are not involved in making decisions in the communities they belong to, have no stable job and most of them undertake only household responsibilities, this percentage reaching 98% in some areas."
"Nevertheless, over 50% of women want to have access to the European labour market, as well as to obtain a qualification that would facilitate their employment in public administration, agriculture, social assistance or education."
"Also, an important percentage of women want to benefit from the facilities available at European level for starting a business."
"Consequently, I believe that the initiatives of women from the rural environment to get actively involved in society, to permanently improve and participate in the economic development of the region they come from should be supported."
"Elimination of discrimination requires a joint European effort."
"Programmes such as the European Social Fund and Progress in partnership with local governments and authorities should allocate larger funds to support women in the rural environment."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the discussion."
"Generally speaking, when looking at the developments, it can be said that there has been significant progress, but ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that there is still a long way to go."
"This is why the Commission is trying to pursue complex negotiations, using all the tools available to us."
"I have referred, for example, to the legislative proposals already prepared and to the intention to tighten the penalties for people trafficking."
"I should also like to say that the endeavours to achieve equality are of course based on a deep ethical foundation and, even if we were to find no reasons based on social balance, stability of the social systems or economics, it would still be right and necessary to proceed consistently."
"However, I should like to say that real equality of opportunity is the foremost priority of the European Union and no society which cannot achieve equality of opportunity has any long-term future in global competition."
"It is not only fair and ethically undeniable, but it is also beneficial."
"I think that it is absolutely fundamental for this reason too that we move ahead, not being satisfied with the developments which may in some respects be interpreted as progress, but where very many things, on the other hand, may still be regarded as only modest results."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, I welcome the words of all my colleagues who have spoken on this item because I believe that it allows us to establish that despite varying emphases and some differences, the common objective is shared by each and every one of us."
"I would also like to tell the Commissioner that I am very pleased with his speech and with his contribution during this debate."
"Each and every one of us would sign up to his speech in full."
"Therefore I would like to say how pleased I am, but would add that what is needed now is a genuine political willingness to implement all the initiatives which are currently on the table."
"He will therefore have this Parliament on his side if he continues to emphasise the importance of this issue and persists in his efforts to implement all these initiatives."
"I would just like to note one aspect: the importance of men's role in the fight for equality between men and women."
"Involving men in this task is essential."
"The fact that today male colleagues have participated in this debate may, I believe, be a reflection of the fact that men must also stand beside women in the fight for equality."
"I will close by mentioning one of the issues raised in this debate, by a colleague who said that women have been saying the same old things since the 19th century."
"I would like to point out to him that women in my country in the 19th century were demanding the right to vote: they could not even vote."
"There is therefore, a clear difference."
"Much progress has been made, that much we cannot deny."
"We must thank all those women, all those organisations who have worked in the fight for equality."
"This, however, cannot mean denying the obvious: there is still a long way to go, we still have a lot of work ahead."
"By all of us persisting, men and women, we should achieve genuine equality between men and women."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (PL) Ladies and Gentlemen, many topics have been touched on in this debate."
"I stress the issue of maternal and parental leave."
"Europe is confronted with a demographic problem resulting not only from the economic problems affecting our continent but also from the failure to provide young mothers with proper support."
"It is immensely important for a woman who has had a baby to be provided with support that gives her and her child the necessary security and ensures that she is not prevented from returning to professional or social life."
"Mothers must be protected in such a way that they can return to their place of work in due course and take care of their families properly, and we must place great emphasis on making sure these arrangements are treated equally seriously throughout Europe."
"in writing. - (RO) Although it is one of the European Union's good students as regards the legislative framework and the number of governmental initiatives and programmes for reducing gender inequality, Romania has shortcomings regarding important aspects that accentuate and perpetuate inequality between women and men."
"As regards the access of women to management positions, Romania ranks among the last countries in Europe."
"Out of the 331 Members of Parliament, only 37 are women, just above 11% of the total."
"Nevertheless, the percentage of women in Romania's local administration is even lower."
"Sweden has almost an equal number of women and men Members of Parliament."
"Also, in Romania, almost a third of women work part-time, as compared with only 7.7% of men, for a remuneration on average 15 percent lower than that of men."
"This situation is closely related to the persistence of gender stereotypes, which makes most of the household duties fall to the responsibility of women."
"Unfortunately, gender inequality and the related prejudices are present not only in the family environment, but also in the education environment of Romanians."
"Studies show that school activities in Romania tend to form gender differentiated mentalities, as well as the social-economic orientation activities organized by the teaching staff."
"Therefore, I emphasize the importance of including the issues regarding the importance of education in reducing gender inequality in the report."
"in writing. - (FR) Equality between men and women is a fundamental principle of the European Union. Yet the figures in the 2008 report show that there is still no equality."
"Indeed, the pay gap has remained at 15% since 2003."
"In light of that situation, I believe we must strengthen European legislation, for example by compelling employers to carry out wage and salary audits, with a view to reducing that gap in pay."
"It is also important to look at the special situation of women living in rural areas, who are never declared as 'working' on the official labour market."
"Because they have no definite professional status, those women, who certainly work since they help their husband within the family farm, encounter a great many financial and legal difficulties in regard to access to retirement pensions or social security."
"I will support any measure that will improve the situation of those women."
"Lastly, I welcome the proposed measures to improve women's access to sexual and reproductive health services."
"Such access is indeed a vital condition for the exercise of their freedom."
"in writing. - (RO) I would like to congratulate the Rapporteur and emphasize the importance of the content of this report for the achievement of the economic growth objectives undertaken in the context of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Both the European Union and the Member States should provide a better model for society."
"Despite the progress achieved, inequality between men and women persists and this is why we have to take action."
"I would like to draw attention to a problem that very many women are dealing with every day and in relation to which very few of them receive a favourable sentence, namely sexual harassment."
"According to a national study conducted in Romania, in 90% of the cases, the victims of sexual harassment were women and 1 out of 9 people in the urban environment have dealt with a sexual harassment situation."
"In over 55% of the cases, the aggressor was the victim's professional superior."
"I think a reassessment of the strategies and actions in this field is required in order to increase women's living and professional standards and Member States should accelerate the enforcement of Community legislation on equality between women and men with regard to the labour market, including as regards sexual harassment."
"in writing. - (RO) Time has come to give up stereotypes and act firmly in order to provide real equal chances to women and men."
"Over the last ten years, progress has been unquestionable as regards the increase of women representation in European top politics, but still insufficient."
"On the contrary, remuneration discrepancies have remained relatively constant in recent years."
"European companies still contribute to the fundamental exclusion and firm and more courageous decisions are required, together with a much more efficient media campaign for this purpose."
"The general participation of women in the decision-making process is subject to obvious distortions in Romania, as well, which is the only country where not a single woman holds the position of Minister and, in Parliament, women represent only 9%."
"The Romanian society has the duty to fight mentalities, gender discriminations in all its daily forms."
"I have confidence in the positive effects of using electoral quotas to represent women."
"We can find best practice models in Nordic countries, and not only there."
"No matter if we opt for an electoral system based upon proportional representation by guaranteeing the gender parity of candidates, as well as the equal visibility in the media (Belgium) or for distributive quotas established by law (Finland, Sweden, Spain, France), I believe the situation of women who want this type of involvement in the political, economic and social life could be improved in Romania."
"European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission, by Giles Chichester and Angelika Niebler, on the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - B6-0159/2008)."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in 2004 the European Network and Information Security Agency, known by the acronym ENISA, was founded."
"Its task is essentially to improve network and information security in the European Union and to promote closer cooperation among the Member States."
"ENISA's mandate is unquestionably complex."
"Computer viruses, spam mail, phishing and Trojans are real threats in a world of virtual data."
"Hacking threatens private and public networks."
"The damage done to our modern communication society is immense."
"Security is the Achilles' heel of our computer systems."
"This is where we are vulnerable and endangered; when I put it that way, you will understand how important this agency is to us."
"On the other hand, this agency does not have a large staff, but it still has this mammoth task to perform."
"This raises the legitimate question whether ENISA can actually perform its tasks in the way in which it currently operates."
"We have very often discussed, both in the chamber and in other bodies here, how ENISA might perhaps be further developed."
"The latest proposal from the Commission was that ENISA be merged with the planned European Authority for Telecommunications Markets."
"That proposal was not embraced by Parliament or by the Council."
"Instead, Parliament and the Council decided before the summer recess that ENISA's mandate should be extended for three years."
"The ultimate purpose of our question to the Commission is to ensure that this debate is structured over the next three years."
"By asking the question, we also want to grasp the nettle and challenge the Commission to state its position on the points we regard as critical."
"In its present form, can ENISA perform the tasks that are expected of it?"
"Is the Commission thinking about replacing ENISA with another organisation?"
"Is it absolutely essential that these tasks be performed by an EU agency?"
"In the Commission's view, what general changes to ENISA's structure should be considered?"
"I look forward to the Commissioner's reply."
"I am keen to find out how far advanced the deliberations are in the corridors of the Commission."
"We in Parliament, of course, shall subsequently be called upon to form our own opinion on the future shape of ENISA."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the honourable Members will know that in accordance with the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the ENISA Agency, the mandate of ENISA automatically expires on 13 March 2009."
"However, the Commission believes it is essential to ensure the continuity of network and information security activities."
"That was a view shared by Parliament and by the Council in the debates on the proposal for an amending regulation extending the mandate of ENISA."
"Therefore, the measure extending the mandate of ENISA for a further three years is justified."
"It is true that the evaluation of ENISA launched by the Commission in 2006 identified a number of problems, but it also identified positive aspects of the Agency's achievement in the light of the limited means at its disposal."
"The Commission responded to the concerns identified by bringing forward a proposal for a regulation establishing the Telecoms Authority."
"We note today that the Council and Parliament agree that ENISA should be kept separate from a new body to be put in place as an alternative to the Telecoms Authority, and the Commission still sees the need for an efficient body able to monitor security and integrity issues."
"That is why it is important to continue the work of ENISA."
"However, I also strongly believe that network security challenges will require a strong, coordinated European response."
"Recent cyber-attacks in Estonia and also in Georgia - the serious cyber-attack there during the summer seems to have gone unnoticed - have shown that one country on its own can be very vulnerable indeed."
"I therefore call on the European Parliament and the Council to open, early in 2009, an intense debate on Europe's approach to network security and on how to deal with cyber-attacks, and to include the future of ENISA in those reflections."
"During the debate on the prolongation of the ENISA regulation, calls were made both in Parliament and in the Council for a debate on the goals of a possible modernised network and information policy, and on the most adequate means to achieve them."
"It was explicitly stated that the prolongation of ENISA should not prejudice the outcome of that debate."
"In order to facilitate such a debate, the Commission services will, in the second half of 2008, develop a questionnaire to be submitted to public online consultation on the possible objectives of a modernised NIS policy at EU level, and on the means to achieve those objectives."
"This will, of course, be done in consultation with ENISA and its management board."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the European Parliament and the Council have approved the extension of ENISA's operation until the end of 2012."
"This three-year extension will enable further debate on the future of ENISA and the wider question of increased security of networks and information in Europe."
"In my view, the revision procedure ought to begin immediately."
"It should transform the body from a temporary foundation into a permanent one; above all, this must be accompanied by a simultaneous increase in staff and an updating of the extremely important Articles 2 and 3 in its Rules of Procedure."
"This solution will allow the body to get to work as soon as possible under an upgraded and improved mandate."
"Let me remind you here - and this is the Commission's view, too - that only a European agency can guarantee the security of networks and information."
"I should also like to point out that today the overwhelming majority of partners agree that ENISA is the most able and qualified body to develop a new, dynamic European policy for the security of networks and information."
"In the past, ENISA was harshly criticised."
"I must remind you, however, that the evaluation report in 2007 was able to evaluate ENISA only in its first year of operation; as a result, the evaluation is no longer reliable or, of course, timely."
"Recent evaluation studies by independent bodies have restored the truth."
"It is essential for appropriate resources to be made available so that the body can operate more effectively."
"Finally, let me tell you that the Greek Government wishes to support a viable solution: it has undertaken to cover the maintenance expenses of an ENISA office in Athens in order to facilitate the body's work and operations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the facts behind today's debate on the oral question by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on ENISA are certainly very different from when this question was submitted."
"For a start, the Council and the European Parliament have agreed to the extension of the body's operating regulation until 2012."
"At the same time, the European Commission's proposal to establish a European authority for the purchase of electronic communications has been treated with circumspection by the Council and the European Parliament."
"Instead, the Council and the European Parliament are in fact proposing the BERT recommendation, with fundamental responsibility for better implementation of the regulatory framework for telecommunications services, without getting involved in issues of network security or integrity."
"However, these issues are indeed exceptionally important, as you, Commissioner, rightly pointed out a little while ago and in your statement earlier today."
"You stressed that the recent attacks on Estonian cyberspace and that of other countries show how vital it is that we come up with a convincing and coordinated European response immediately."
"Now, this is precisely the role ENISA can and must play, once it is operating under an upgraded and improved mandate with clearly defined duties and aims and, of course, once it has the requisite means and human resources available to it."
"This time I hope that the Commission will contribute significantly and genuinely here by assisting ENISA in its work to reinforce the security and integrity of networks."
"This is vital to boost the confidence of companies and, of course, European citizens in European networks."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, network security - it sounds like a specialised field of knowledge, but the security of networks is influencing more and more aspects of our daily lives: mobile communications, the Internet, which is squeezing its way, rather like an octopus, into more and more areas of everyday activity, ambient intelligence - the computer intelligence that is built into our environments, be it to assist elderly people or to control complex work processes."
"All of this shows us that we are becoming more and more dependent on such advanced forms of technology."
"They rule our lives and the growth of our economy."
"How dependent we have become was recently demonstrated in Estonia."
"You mentioned, Commissioner, that Georgia was affected too."
"People are less aware of that case, but if we had needed a more spectacular example than Estonia, we got it there."
"We saw how a modern, network-driven economy suddenly became dependent on that factor, on that technology, how it was attacked and how its security really did come under very serious threat."
"That is also the reason why the Commission, in which Commissioner Liikaanen held the portfolio at that time, rightly recognised the need for a network-security agency."
"This is why we were taken by surprise when ENISA was evaluated after only a year, before it was fully and properly resourced, and the agency's very existence was called into question."
"That certainly shocked us at the time, and I am therefore delighted that we are conducting this debate here."
"Why did we call this agency into question after only a year?"
"How do you intend, do we intend, to fashion ENISA's mandate in such a way that it can operate like an agency that deals on equal terms with the agencies that exist in the United States, Japan and China?"
"I should like to thank you for your recognition, following the second evaluation, of ENISA's achievements."
"Nevertheless, day after day we Members of Parliament discuss this culture shift, this climate change that affects our economies, that forces us to give up our economic dependence on fossil fuels and switch to other energy sources."
"Every day we put our heart and soul into these efforts here."
"We all know that changing our systems is the only option."
"To that end we need intelligent solutions, and we need network security, for security is paramount."
"This is why I am grateful that we are holding this debate as a building block in the construction of a more robustly resourced ENISA and of greater network security."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, in conclusion I would like to say that there is unanimous support in the Council, and broad support in the European Parliament, for extending the duration of ENISA for three years."
"Both arms of the legislature agreed to reach a first-reading agreement as soon as possible, in time before the automatic expiry of the current regulation."
"As I understand it, the Council plans to adopt the amending regulation as an 'A' point at a forthcoming Council meeting."
"The problem would then be resolved and, after the Commission has presented a paper on the basic problems underlying the cyber-attacks, Parliament can then take that on board and start a real debate on the future of our responses in that area."
"The debate is closed."
"How marketing and advertising affect equality between women and men (debate)"
"The next item on the agenda is the report (2008/2038 (INI)) by Eva-Britt Svensson, on behalf of the Committee on Gender Equality, on how marketing and advertising affect equality between women and men."
"rapporteur. - (SV) Mr President, I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and especially the shadow rapporteur for excellent and constructive contributions to the report."
"The Presidency of the Council has highlighted the importance of combating gender stereotypes."
"This is one of the six priority areas of the Presidency."
"Therefore I consider that it is important for us here in the Parliament too to give our views on the problem of gender stereotypes and how they affect equality between women and men."
"In order to avoid any misunderstandings, I would particularly like to state and be very clear that in the report I am definitely not recommending any new legislation in this area, neither at EU nor at national level."
"The measures I propose refer to national, self-regulating bodies which already exist and which represent producers, advertisers and consumers."
"These bodies should work to increase awareness of the importance of gender-stereotyped advertising."
"The Member States should also ensure that there are bodies to which the general public can turn with complaints."
"I also think that the European Institute for Gender Equality which is being set up should carry out research into how equality is affected by this type of advertising."
"We need to know more."
"So why is this important?"
"It is important because advertising is everywhere, in our homes, in public spaces, in newspapers, in the media, etc. Of course we are affected, whether we are aware of it or not."
"Companies would not invest billions in advertising if it did not have any effect."
"Advertising and marketing today are not just about trying to sell goods or products, but about selling a whole lifestyle, a form of culture."
"We have to behave in a certain way and act in a certain way to live up to expectations of different norms."
"It is particularly important to combat this phenomenon where it affects young people who are seeking an adult identity, future education paths, etc. I want all people to be able to choose without consciously or unconsciously being influenced by various gender-stereotyped norms."
"Today it is impossible for an advertiser to make an advert for a product which increases environmental problems or hastens climate change."
"I have a vision that in the future it will be just as impossible to sell products which have a gender-discriminatory or gender-stereotyped message."
"I am also convinced that with increased awareness of the importance of advertising, consumers, both men and women, will start to refuse to buy products which use this kind of advertising."
"I am also just as convinced that consumers will favour companies, producers, which have a conscious advertising policy and which do not permit gender-stereotyped advertising."
"This will be an important success factor for companies and advertisers who demonstrate their responsibility by influencing and contributing towards greater equality."
"After all, this is the goal we all say that we share."
"This is one factor among very many, but it is an important one."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the EP and the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson, for addressing a very delicate issue on how marketing and advertising affects equality between men and women."
"Advertising plays an important role in the financing of the media."
"It reduces the cover price of magazines and newspapers and ensures that much audiovisual content is available free to consumers."
"This is important for freedom of expression and diversity, a question which is often debated in this House."
"What we have seen over the years is an accumulation of bans or controls on advertising - cigarettes, alcohol, fatty food - and soon there will be new rules for how car manufacturers advertise CO2 emissions."
"Advertising is a soft target because it is much easier to regulate it than to address the underlying problems, which are often more complex - though the report which we are discussing tonight favours further controls on advertising, this time from the subjective area of gender politics."
"As Media Commissioner, I recognise the underlying policy concerns, but I also wonder what will be the impact of these concerns if they are carried out on a whole industry and on the general public."
"As it has become more difficult to advertise because there is less money and because of all the bans, advertisers have reduced the role of advertising in their marketing expenditure."
"There are other ways to market products without advertising them in the media: product promotion for instance."
"That is very bad for media pluralism, because most of all the written press - the newspapers and the magazines - do not get enough income in order to continue to be published."
"The report does not take into account the positive aspects that support the objectives of the report in order to protect citizens."
"Let me give you some examples."
"Article 3 of the Audiovisual Media Service Directive contains strong wording on human dignity and non-discrimination in relation to audiovisual advertising."
"The Commission, I can assure you, will ensure that Member States' transposition of this Directive reflect what the legislator wanted."
"Neither does the report underline the valuable role that self-regulation has played."
"Let me give you an example here, too."
"You should be aware that it has been responded to well in cases of, and I quote: 'objectionable stereotyping', and I will give you a very concrete example."
"The fashion industry has stopped its 'porno-chic' campaigns, which stigmatised women as pure sex objects."
"So there are legislative measures in order to solve the problems."
"We should have, in this respect, a very realistic approach."
"Advertising is a short-form medium, glimpsed on a page or in a 30-second video spot."
"What the report calls 'stereotyping' may be just a quick way to link a product to a particular group of consumers."
"It can also reflect poor creative work."
"There is, on the other hand, good advertising and bad advertising, and as Media Commissioner I have to accept that the freedom of expression also includes the right to fail - even to fail badly - even if we do not like it."
"If I asked the plenary here to take a decision on that, I think that the right to fail would not be hampered."
"As the report acknowledges, there is no conclusive research that links stereotyping with gender inequality."
"Policy-making requires a strong evidence base, not just strongly-held views, and that is what we are basing our policy proposals on and why the Commission supports the positive recommendations made in the EP report."
"Best-practice exchange, for instance, among the regulators is something that we always encourage."
"Education, research and further debates should certainly continue."
"I would like to underline that for nine years now, as Media Commissioner, I have been pleading for courses in schools on media literacy."
"I believe that this would be the most important thing: if we could awaken the critical appraisal of youngsters in order to read advertisements, to reject the bad advertisements, something which is really not relevant to our society."
"I would like to concentrate on best practice, for instance I like the Spanish example of awards for advertising that handle gender issues well."
"That is the right way to proceed, and that is why we should accentuate the positive and see whether we can make further progress, because it is worthwhile fighting for this."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE. - (ES) Mr President, true freedom ends where the freedom of others begins, and the freer the media are, the freer a society is; the loss of freedom begins precisely in censorship of advertising and continues into editorial content."
"Therefore, the European People's Party has submitted amendments to this report to correct a number of totalitarian aberrations which run counter to the principle of a free society."
"European marketing and advertising already exercise self-regulation and there is sufficient legislation in the Member States."
"Marketing and advertising are not only in the realm of the media, they form part of our daily lives and, fortunately, there are excellent professionals working in those fields who, for the most part, are aware of the sway they hold over social balance."
"Therefore, the European People's Party will vote against the amendments and paragraphs presented by the communists as they cast aspersions of widespread chauvinism and sexism among workers in the sector, and that is a fallacy."
"In the European People's Party we believe in equality between men and women, but we believe it must be advocated without giving anyone else a bad name."
"We believe that childhood and youth must be protected and that children and young people must be brought up by their families and society as a whole."
"Brought up with values which help them to be better people."
"I believe that the sectarian use of equality, which is the aim of this report, is a serious mistake and the EPP will not, of course, allow it."
"We very much hope that our amendments will be adopted so that we can support the report."
"Otherwise I shall abstain from the final vote out of respect for the subsidiarity of Member States and for respect for professionals in the marketing and advertising business."
"I do not believe that criticising national laws and overstepping the powers of this Parliament will be good for us because it will reduce our credibility in the future."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is not as anodyne as the late hour at which it is being debated might suggest and I want to thank Mrs Svensson for the work she has done and for her cooperation."
"Marketing and advertising are ubiquitous in our society and contribute to the creation of social constructs that sometimes have adverse effects, in the form of discrimination or the retreat into simplistic gender stereotypes."
"Advertising is certainly also a source of creativity and such representations are sometimes used intentionally for humorous purposes."
"But advertisers must not forget that they have an important educational role to play, that we must develop the critical faculty of young people, with a view to eliminating all forms of discrimination resulting from what are at times degrading images based on gender that could put the dignity of the individual at risk."
"The purpose of this report is not to question editorial or creative freedom but to encourage the actors in this sector to improve existing self-regulation systems, to cooperate with the competent authorities to improve the codes of good practice and to be aware of their responsibilities in relation not only to gender equality but also to physical and mental health, which is sometimes threatened by pressures arising from criteria of beauty that are set as the desirable norm."
"That is why I ask Members to reject the many amendments seeking to delete parts of the text, since it would then lose all its substance."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I do recognise the problem described by the rapporteur."
"I imagine a reconnaissance mission coming from the planet Mars."
"They come to earth and by way of preparation they just look at advertising to get a picture of the people on earth."
"Then they come here and see to their surprise that women are not just interested in cleaning products and do not just sit waiting all day until their husbands come home from work, women are independent and intelligent and earn their own money and so are also consumers, and besides that there are other kinds of families on earth that you never see in the adverts, such as single-parent families and gay couples with children, and immigrant families, and, for instance, people in wheelchairs or with speech impediments."
"You never see them in the adverts."
"I certainly agree with the rapporteur as far as that goes."
"Having said that, though, I agree with the comments by Commissioner Reding and also my EPP colleague. There is still something like freedom of expression."
"Therefore I do not believe we should interfere in any way with the content of adverts."
"Best practice is a better idea."
"Of course I cannot name any brands here, but I am thinking of an Italian fashion label that has been breaking taboos for 20 years now, and of other products too."
"Apart from that the report is much too broad, because the title says 'marketing and advertising', when it also concerns school books, TV, the Internet, video games and much else besides."
"Quite honestly I think the EU should stay out of this."
"There is also something about adverts for sexual services."
"That is completely beside the point."
"Taste and morality can vary and I do not think we can impose them uniformly from the EU."
"Finally, if you look at the picture that has been drawn of women in advertising in the past 50 years, I note with satisfaction that women are much cleverer than we think."
"They do not let the adverts stop them from simply becoming independent."
"Finally, if we really want to do something, I have two concrete proposals."
"Firstly, if we do not like the advertising, we consumers go on strike, and secondly, I suggest that at least one woman should be appointed to one of the top four posts in the European Union."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I wish to draw attention to the existence, both on television, including public television, and on billboards, of advertisements whose content or form degrades the persons appearing in them."
"Those in question are usually, but not always, women."
"Depriving them of their dignity, treating them as objects, depicting them as being on a lower intellectual level or as capable of arousing interest solely in the sexual sphere, leads to a lack of self-esteem in unprepared persons exposed to such material."
"It reduces their efforts to achieve life plans and limits their ambitions."
"Such advertising affects young people above all, which can make its impact more severe."
"It is one of the many results of omnipresent consumerism."
"For many people, profit - even if earned by indecent means - is more important than treating human beings as subjects with an intrinsic value that has to be protected."
"It is therefore important that advertising of this kind be restricted by legislation."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, equality between women and men is one of the values and goals of the European Union."
"The EU intends to establish that equality in every area of activity."
"It is unthinkable that the realm of advertising should be excluded."
"I therefore welcome the report by Mrs Svensson, who has addressed this important issue and presented a balanced report."
"You have my sincere thanks."
"Advertising affects us subconsciously."
"One major effect is the way it creates gender stereotypes."
"Discrimination in advertising runs counter to the aim of equality."
"The EU is not doing enough to eliminate sexism and discrimination in the media."
"We must therefore make it clear that Europe is a Europe of values."
"We do not want any misogynist advertising, any advertisements that degrade women into objects or revel in crude clichés about women."
"The same applies, of course, to adverts about men."
"I would be delighted if, on the contrary, advertising helped to shake up our well-worn role perceptions, our images of men and women."
"Regrettably, however, the advertising industry has drawn up battle lines against something that should actually be taken for granted, namely respect, and particularly respect for women."
"I fail to comprehend why the advertising industry is raising such a storm in a teacup."
"I call it a storm precisely because it seems to have caught the ear, unfortunately, of many female Members of this House."
"For all that, we can surely agree, in fact, on the following basic principles: we need to be more awake to discrimination in the media, and we also need national monitoring authorities with which complaints can be lodged."
"Something similar already exists, by the way, in many Member States."
"This is why I cannot understand what all the fuss is about."
"I had even wished that we would go further in this report."
"For this reason I hope that we can indeed agree to support what is now on the table, for we need this report as a basis, and we should not water it down any further."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, despite the report's many positive aspects in drawing attention to the negative influence of media, marketing and advertising that caricature and objectify human beings, discriminate against them and deprive them of their dignity, I must nevertheless protest at some of its arguments, which are manipulative and aimed at the creation of a modern egalitarian society devoid of ethical models."
"It is true that various hormonal and psychological therapies make it possible to experiment on people, but such experimentation causes serious trauma and should be banned, just as experiments on animals are restricted."
"Both masculinity and femininity, the dual form of the human somatic constitution, are personality-forming elements."
"It is impossible to change roles, since they are inscribed in human nature."
"Drawing attention to the influence of advertising is all well and good, but it would be better to postulate ethical-legal control based on prior acceptance of a universal value system, founded, best of all, on divine law."
"(SK) Sometimes we are not even aware that the consequences of advertising policy have far-reaching effects on the retention of stereotypes, which means an almost insurmountable obstacle to the changes needed to achieve the defined targets, including the Lisbon targets."
"Despite this, however, we can also state that advertising as such has its great positives."
"We should realise that advertising policy, especially in relation to men and women, is putting a brake on the process of harmonisation of working and family life, since it very often presents a picture of a woman who is happily and smilingly on top of all her, sometimes conflicting, tasks arising out of her different social roles, very often performed under considerable time pressure."
"The problem is not just the maintenance of outdated stereotypes of the male and female roles, but also the further reinforcement of them, since the experts warn that advertising not only reinforces but also creates expectations."
"One of the most astonishing indications of this is the number of girls suffering from anorexia."
"Since marketing and advertising use or misuse existing stereotypes, it is pointless for the European Council to adopt resolutions combating stereotypes since they will be completely ineffective."
"The solution, however, will definitely not be some specific European code of conduct."
"The problem with marketing and advertising cannot be ascribed to the media as such."
"It is a pity that the report, in attempting to solve the problem, chooses a path which will either be impracticable or not achieve the target."
"(BG) President, Commissioner, colleagues, I find the report very important and very necessary."
"The environment that surrounds us all the time is of exceptional importance for the formation of attitudes, conduct and approach to problems, equality included."
"Marketing, advertisement, media, Internet and television can provoke seriously both a positive and a very negative attitude towards the idea of gender equality."
"Without restricting the freedom in the activity of media, organizations and institutions dealing with marketing and advertisement, without imposing censorship, we should consider the negative consequences, denounce the presentation of women in an unfavourable light, as subjects provoking violence, sexism, or their being shown as a combination of ""hot” female images and even hotter, tempting alcoholic drinks."
"Isn't this humiliating?"
"Since we consider equality a partnership, we think that the tolerance of marketing and advertisement to this problems is equally valid for men."
"Advertisement and marketing should create a way to understanding equality, should reflect ethical models of equality of man and woman, not distort the philosophy of equality with the objective of profit."
"Thus marketing and advertisement should create an environment for social understanding, for social prospects."
"The report underscores the need of spreading in the media the principles of gender equality by programmes and materials intended for different age groups, popularization of good practices of respect, appreciation of the difference between the sexes, of non-discrimination."
"This will form a culture of equality and will create equality."
"(SK) Advertising is an integral part of our life and it has an indisputable effect on the public's behaviour and the formation of public opinion."
"In the report, the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson, makes points with which I agree."
"These are mainly points indicating the need to protect children and youths from negative advertising."
"Advertising the sale of sexual services and prostitution corrupts children from a tender age."
"I have a different view from that of the rapporteur as to how the defined target can be achieved."
"It is difficult at the European level for us to interfere with media freedom and not adhere to the principle of subsidiarity."
"I do not think that we will succeed in adopting a European ethical code in the field of marketing and advertising."
"Our anxiety about the young generation must be addressed mainly by parents and teachers."
"I am convinced that the main responsibility lies with parents and teachers who are in a position to teach children to use television and new technology sensibly and responsibly."
"(PL) The resolution puts too much emphasis on the issue of inequality between men and women and on gender stereotyping."
"Negative stereotyping needs to be mentioned, and gender inequality is a major element in bad advertising, but it is not the only one."
"In the first place, many psychological experiments show how children - especially children, but adults too - learn aggression, negative attitudes and negative behaviour from television and the other media."
"Following on from what Commissioner Reding had to say about education at school, what I, as a psychologist, find important is that research shows people are convinced that television and advertising, in particular, do not influence them as much as they do in reality."
"Marketing and advertising in the media manoeuvre between information, promotion and manipulation."
"The problem lies in distinguishing between them."
"Where free advertising does not comply with moral, social and psychological principles, it is harmful."
"That is probably the most important point."
"(RO) I would like to propose some practical means by which we could approach the issue of the negative influence of publicity on gender equality in Europe."
"From the point of view of the applicable European legislation, a key issue is the principle of the country of origin."
"This is also applicable to publicity, so that a production accepted by a national broadcasting board in a Member State must be accepted for broadcasting in all other Member States."
"We have recently dealt with clear examples of gender discrimination, promoted by publicity productions that could not be suspended from broadcasting in the European Union countries."
"Thus, I consider that measures of exception from the country of origin principle should be introduced, when it is found that the European pact for gender equality has been infringed by offensive media productions."
"Since we are discussing a field falling under Community competence, namely trade in audiovisual services, I believe fines to be enforced by the European Commission to producers promoting discriminatory imagines through publicity should be introduced."
"(EL) Mr President, we are in favour of both the market economy and competitiveness."
"On the basis, then, of healthy competition, we want the truth to be told; products ought to compete on the basis of genuine facts."
"Freedom does not mean unaccountability, nor is advertising a ploy allowing anyone to show off their products."
"We were speaking this morning about tackling discrimination, and it is very strange that those who support the abolition of discrimination do not want to protect human dignity by applying self-regulation to advertising."
"I congratulate the Commissioner because she has often shown through her proposals that she is taking measures to protect minors and safeguard values with the help of the media and especially modern technologies."
"(DE) Mr President, I support the view that parents and legal guardians bear great responsibility in the way they deal with children."
"Today, the business world sees and treats children as important consumers."
"This is why it is necessary to make them aware from a very young age of the power of advertising and its potential adverse effects."
"I do not believe, however, in the idea that we should regulate it uniformly throughout Europe."
"As the Commissioner also said, in the education system we must try to show children a path from a very young age, making them aware of both the opportunities and risks that are inherent in advertising."
"rapporteur. - (SV) Thank you for the debate."
"I would like to clarify one thing - the report is from the European United Left, nothing else."
"With regard to the amendments, I would like to remind you that 53 amendments from the different political groups were adopted by the committee, including four amendments tabled by Mrs Herranz García."
"Freedom of expression was referred to."
"It goes without saying that freedom of expression is sacrosanct."
"There is nothing in the report about any new legislation, either at EU level or in the Member States."
"That is a matter for individual countries."
"What we are doing in the report is focusing on the bodies which already exist, self-regulating and joint bodies in which producers, advertisers and consumers find the best methods together."
"The Commission says that more conclusive research is needed into how equality is affected."
"I agree with that and that is why this has been highlighted in the report."
"We need more research."
"We need to arouse critical thought!"
"This is precisely what the report is about!"
"Increasing awareness and thus also critical thought!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 3 September at 11.30 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (HU) The fight against stereotypes is one of the six priority areas of the Equality Roadmap for 2006-2010."
"This is a matter of principle, the practical impact of which is extremely far-reaching and thorough, since stereotypes create a scandalous situation for women and form a significant barrier to their success - whether it be in their job-hunting, their workplace, their career progression, their participation in decision-making or in balancing their work and private life."
"Stereotypes establish and maintain inequalities in every area of life, thus causing untold damage to the whole of society and significantly reducing the effectiveness of efforts to create equality."
"I feel that well-planned, coordinated action and campaigns against stereotypes are needed, important elements of which include the social consciousness that starts in childhood, education and the application of proper practices."
"The marketing and advertisements that appear in the media have an important role in forming the image that is created of women - the disadvantageous image contributes significantly to maintaining the scandalous situation, and at the same time this trend can be turned around by showing the reality, opportunities and skills in a realistic way."
"We therefore have to work on preparing these possible tools and measures, through which we can promote positive change."
"Similarly, it is vital that the existing legislation is applied appropriately."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, Eva-Britt Svensson's report on how marketing and advertising affect equality between women and men is one of those documents aiming at intervention in matters that are not of the highest importance in view of the problems currently facing the European Union."
"In some respects the report is simply not serious."
"For the rapporteur, gender stereotyping is a greater problem than the brutalisation of media content, especially with regard to children."
"Given the existing advertising codes in force in the media, the claim that advertisements arouse hatred on gender lines is an overstatement."
"The report does not mention the growing problem of gender discrimination among EU citizens of the Muslim faith."
"I fear that, with regard to equality between women and men, the Muslim press is not monitored."
"That is a very serious problem for EU Member States to resolve."
"The proper relations obtaining in the field of equal treatment of men and women in traditional, historical European society do not require intervention at the present time."
"Individual cases of degenerate behaviour in this area can be combated by means of the existing legislation."
"Cloning of animals for food supply (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question - to the Commission by Neil Parish, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the cloning of animals for food supply."
"author. - Mr President, I should like very much to welcome Commissioner Vassiliou here this evening to listen to our oral question, especially at this late hour."
"When we deal with cloning, it is not only a case of food safety, but also we in Europe believe that, under the common agricultural policy, we are producing food to a very high standard and also to a very high welfare standard."
"The problems with cloning concern not only the welfare of animals but also consumer confidence in food that may come from cloned animals."
"You only have to look across the Atlantic Ocean to the United States of America to see how to stop cloned animals from entering the food chain."
"For instance, if a cloned bull is worth EUR 1 000 at the end of its life to go into the food chain, then the people who have bred that bull have to put up a bond, which may be worth EUR 3 000, and when they destroy that animal and make sure that it does not go into the food chain, they get the bond back."
"It is quite a simple way of keeping cloned animals out of the food chain."
"I think we have to take this matter very seriously and I would urge the Commissioner to look at this again."
"I will go through some of the problems with cloning, especially from a welfare point of view."
"Cloning entails serious health and welfare problems for clones and their surrogate dams; animal health problems come from invasive techniques required to produce a clone; there is the suffering of surrogate dams which carry cloned foetuses, and high levels of ill health and mortality in early life for cloned animals."
"The OIE Scientific and Technical Review identified that only 6% of cloned embryos resulted in healthy, long-term surviving clones."
"The EFSA report also points out an increased proportion of pregnancy failure and disorders in surrogate dams of cloned embryos."
"These disorders and the large size of clones make caesareans more frequent in cattle carrying clones than in conventional pregnancy."
"Mortality and morbidity is higher in clones than in sexually-produced animals; the welfare of both surrogate dam and clone can be affected."
"On the ethics side, the European Group on Ethics has doubts as to whether cloning animals for food supply is ethically justified."
"It also does not see convincing arguments to justify the production of food from clones and their offspring."
"If you look into the figures of what has happened when animals are cloned, cloned calves are often 25% heavier than normal, leading to a painful birth; 25% of cows pregnant with clones at day 120 of gestation develop hydroallantois."
"Reports in 2003 show only 13% of embryos planted in surrogate dams result in calves delivered at full term; only 5% of all cloned embryos transferred into recipient cows have survived."
"EFSA's opinion cites a study where out of 2 170 cattle receiving embryos only 106 live births occurred - 4.9% - and only 82 survived more than two days."
"We also have to consider the problems that occur not only on the animal welfare side but also in the gene pool of animals - and this is a farming aspect also."
"Take the Holstein Friesian - it is thought that there are only about 50 strains of the Holstein Friesian."
"If we start cloning bulls and the heifer from a cloned bull is then put back on to the offspring, so the same father is used, then we will create an even tighter gene pool."
"There are then problems with disease and with genetics being carried over to those offspring."
"Therefore, we need to make sure there is hybrid vigour."
"The industry itself cannot explain why a cloned animal has the cell of the parent - an older cell."
"Therefore, again, there is the risk of producing an animal that is not as strong and as healthy."
"Therefore, I call on the Commission to submit proposals prohibiting the cloning of animals for the food supply and the placing of cloned animals on the market in meat and dairy products."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I want to thank Mr Parish for raising this question, because it is a question to which the Commission has given a lot of consideration and considers important, and it is indeed something which preoccupies us."
"The European Commission - as Mr Parish said - has asked EFSA to provide an opinion on food safety, animal health, animal welfare and the environmental implications of the use of live animal clones."
"The final opinion was adopted on 15 July this year, and the Commission is now evaluating the necessary steps to be taken."
"This opinion refers to uncertainties in the risk assessment due to the limited number of studies available."
"It also refers to the fact that the health and welfare of a significant proportion of clones have been found to be adversely affected, often severely, with a fatal outcome."
"The Commission is aware that, even though the efficiency of animal cloning has improved in recent years, adverse health affects on animal health and welfare still occur today."
"There are indications that mortality and morbidity rates in clones after birth are higher than in sexually-reproduced animals."
"However, most surviving clones are normal and healthy, as determined by psychological measurements as well as by behaviour and clinical examinations."
"The Commission closely follows the scientific developments in this area."
"In 2004 the Commission also financed a pan-European research project called Cloning in Public, addressing ethical, legal and other societal aspects of farm animal cloning."
"The project was coordinated by the Danish Centre for Bioethics and Risk Assessment and aimed to promote public debate on the issue of biotechnology."
"As far as the involvement of the public is concerned, in autumn 2007 the Commission launched a public consultation on the ethics of animal cloning for food supply, and in September 2007 it organised an open round table on the same topic with representatives from academia, industry, NGOs, civil society, international organisations, industry etc. In order to increase public participation, the round table was also broadcast on the internet, and its proceedings have been published."
"Last but not least, the Commission has recently launched a Eurobarometer survey on consumers' attitudes to cloning for food production."
"Its purpose is to ask the public about their opinion and their awareness regarding cloning and food derived from the offspring of cloned animals."
"The results will be made available very shortly."
"The Commission takes ethical considerations fully into account when dealing with sensitive issues such as cloning."
"The Commission has given its attention to the ethics of animal cloning since 1997, when the group of advisers to the European Commission on the ethical implications of biotechnology issued an opinion on the ethics of cloning."
"Due to the state of the art of technology at that time, the opinion did not address the use of cloning for food purposes."
"It is for this reason that the Commission asked the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies, the independent advisory body to the Commission in this field, to give an opinion on the ethical aspects of animal cloning for food supply."
"Their opinion was published in January this year."
"Considering the current level of suffering and health problems of surrogate dams and animal clones, the European Group on Ethics expressed doubts as to whether cloning animals for food supply is ethically justified."
"It advocated that at the moment there are no convincing arguments to justify the production of food from clones and their offspring."
"The Commission is currently examining the concerns expressed by the Group."
"Under international rules, restrictions to imports of products must be based on legitimate concerns, not be discriminatory, and be proportionate to the objective pursued."
"According to global trade rules, imports of food products from third countries might be suspended if they present a serious threat to animal or public health."
"On the basis of the studies conducted and the opinion of EFSA, the Commission will consider whether restrictions must be imposed."
"I am sure this will be done very shortly."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, today's discussion is absolutely essential as a means of drawing attention to the dangers inherent in cloning."
"I am very grateful to Neil Parish for having put this oral question to the Commission."
"One thing is quite clear, namely that animal health equates with food safety."
"As we know, there are various types of cloning processes: therapeutic and reproductive cloning as well as DNA cloning."
"What we are discussing today is reproductive cloning."
"Reproductive cloning means creating a genetically identical copy of something: a plant, an animal and perhaps one day - if we feel the need to overstep all boundaries - even a human being."
"When cloning is used in animal breeding for food production, however, there are problems."
"The first of these to which I wish to refer is the high loss rate."
"We know from the Americans that only a very few clones survive."
"Consequently, cloning for food production is not financially viable."
"From the very beginning, the clone has the genetic age of the original. That is to say if the original is a six-year-old cow, the clone will be a calf whose genes are six years old."
"In the cloning process the cloning genome is inevitably damaged."
"This makes the clone susceptible to diseases and parasites."
"When cloning occurs over several generations, Commissioner, there is a cumulative depletion of the genetic diversity on which species depend for their survival because it enables them to adapt to changes in their natural surroundings."
"Lastly, the question arises whether mankind can presume to intervene in the most natural biological processes, even if it is done with the best intentions."
"It seems to me that there is no need to alter something which has worked for millions of years."
"Human being have too short a lifespan, in any case, to experience the effects of their actions over long periods of time."
"I hope we shall not find ourselves in the same dilemma as Goethe's sorcerer's apprentice, who could not rid himself of the spirits he had conjured up."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) Mr President, I completely agree with Mr Parish's proposal: two types of zero tolerance are needed here."
"Firstly, cloned animals should not enter the food chain in any way; we are all agreed on that."
"We also agree completely, and we would ask the Commission to ensure, that cloned animals from Argentina, Brazil or elsewhere outside the Union should not be imported or brought into the European Union in any way."
"This is the double zero tolerance which I believe is the essence of Mr Parish's proposal."
"Mrs Schierhuber and Mr Parish have both said that there is still a huge amount of risk, that there are no real, appropriate controls or monitoring, and there are inadequate test samples, inadequate trials, and any trials relate only to pigs and cattle, so there is a huge amount of risk."
"In fact, it could be summarised by saying that they should not enter the food chain, and it would naturally be absurd and idiotic to obstruct genetic engineering and bioengineering research."
"Research is one thing, but the food chain is another thing, and thirdly lengthy, reliable checks that are independent of organisations in the sector are needed, as well as independent monitoring for more and longer periods. Thank you for your attention."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, from experience with other issues that tackle food safety, as well as raising adequate questions linked to the relations between humans as the dominant species and the animals, we know that public perception depends very much on specific knowledge of the matter."
"Consumers are increasingly sensitive with regard to the suffering of, and injuries to, farm animals."
"Therefore, they have to be properly informed about the risks posed by the cloning of animals."
"An educational campaign is needed, explaining to them what an incredibly wasteful process cloning has been so far."
"It was expected that EFSA would not find clear safety concerns related to food products from clones of farm animals, compared with conventionally-bred animals."
"However, EFSA also underlined in its recent report that the practice has major repercussions on the health and welfare of animals."
"The issue raises societal problems, which advise us strongly to ban animal cloning for food, as well as the import of cloned animals and their offspring."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, our civilisation lives from the exploitation of animals and will certainly long continue to do so."
"We kill animals to satisfy many needs, but we also set ourselves certain standards."
"We Europeans, at least, impose limits on the suffering of animals and support their wellbeing."
"Our legislation prescribes that an animal is not an object."
"Cloning animals is a controversial scientific achievement."
"Cloning animals for economic purposes, on the other hand, is an ethical abuse."
"It is not animal husbandry but animal production."
"It is based not even on the principle of the production line, but that of the photocopier."
"We should reject it on moral grounds in the name of respect for animals, but also in the name of our own humanity."
"It is only one step from treating animals as objects to treating human beings as objects."
"It is already only a short step from cloning animals to cloning people."
"On behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations, I support the resolution."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE. - (ES) Mr President, I wonder what we are hoping to achieve by a moratorium on cloning animals for food supply?"
"What do we hope to achieve by applying the precautionary principle and preventing the import of cloned animals?"
"What do we hope to achieve by ceasing to treat animals as mere objects and inflicting unnecessary suffering on them?"
"Dolly the Sheep died ill and malformed."
"The Dolly the Sheep experiment was a failure."
"However, it would appear that we have not learned from it."
"Cloning can reduce genetic diversity; it can generate greater vulnerability to animal diseases; it can generate a situation where sentient beings, our animal cousins, which can feel and experience pain, undergo greater suffering."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, I want to thank Mr Parish most sincerely and I can fully support his comments."
"It has been proved that cloning causes suffering to animals, and the EFSA came to the same conclusion."
"If we allow animals to be cloned for food production, we come up against the following problems, in addition to animal suffering and ethical objections: it is very questionable whether consumers actually want to eat cloned meat at all, it is not certain how safe it will be and, finally, the public debate about cloned food has not even really started yet."
"I therefore really object to the fact that the Commission even dares to propose allowing cloning to be covered by the definition in the new foodstuffs regulation."
"By doing so, it is indirectly showing that it can support animal cloning for food production."
"I am therefore urging the Commission, in this report too, to reconsider its position."
"In view of all the objections, I also call on the Commission to put forward proposals for a total ban on animal cloning without delay."
"Mr President, it is right and natural to want to improve stock quality by breeding from our best animals."
"Artificial insemination and embryo transfer provide for that."
"Cloning, however, is quite different: it is, as the United Kingdom Food Standards Agency has observed, a quantum leap way beyond giving Mother Nature a helping hand."
"Quite apart from other ethical issues and the danger of copycat science in the human field, animal welfare is a real concern."
"The premature ageing and health deficiencies seen in high-profile cloning cases that have made the headlines, such as that of Dolly the sheep, are good reminders of those welfare issues."
"Devoting more money to tackling animal disease would serve us better than experimenting with nature."
"From a consumer perspective, there is also a food quality issue, since cloned herds would all share the same vulnerability to the same strains of disease, whereas genetic diversity is one of our best protections against rampant outbreaks of disease."
"In fact, whichever way I look at this subject, I can find nothing to convince me that animal cloning is right, necessary or in the public interest."
"(PL) Mr President, if the protection of biodiversity is a priority of the European Commission, then there should be no talk of cloning."
"I would like to hear the arguments in favour of cloning animals for food."
"Are we to be guided solely by economic considerations?"
"What about the ethical, social and health issues?"
"Before we decide to allow such food to be sold on the EU market, we must have our citizens' permission for such a step."
"I myself am not sure I would be able to swallow a pork chop from a cloned pig or milk from a cloned cow."
"Instead of genetically modified food and food from cloned animals, we should be thinking more about action in favour of a return to natural foods that are ecological, healthy and contain no chemicals."
"Let us leave cloning in the realm of research."
"In my opinion, the road from the laboratory to the knife and fork of the European consumer is still long, because there are still too many question marks."
"And because there are so many questions still unanswered, I am convinced we should not act hastily in this matter."
"Nor should the Commission act against the opinion of Europe's citizens."
"Even if food products derived from cloned animals were allowed on the EU market, I am convinced that, if they were clearly marked and people had to take a conscious decision to buy them, they would not find too many takers among EU consumers."
"If we introduce products derived from cloned sheep, poultry, goats or cattle, we shall destroy the image of the European agricultural model, which sets such great store by protection of the environment and the wellbeing of animals."
"(PL) Mr President, I also fully support Neil Parish's proposal for a ban on the use of cloned animals for food production."
"However, for some considerable time now I have been watching the Commission strive to impose legal arrangements on Member States that will lead to the introduction of genetically modified foodstuffs for mass distribution, and in future perhaps also meat from cloned animals."
"In many countries, including Poland, local authorities have passed resolutions demanding that whole regions, and even a whole country, be kept free from GMOs."
"Under pressure from industrial lobbies, the Commission is ignoring these resolutions and pressing for the introduction of genetically modified foodstuffs on the market."
"EU Member States owe the public a clear answer: are they in favour of healthy, natural foods or genetically modified and cloned foodstuffs?"
"We must not be hypocritical about this."
"Let me also ask the Commissioner how she intends to protect the public against the unwitting purchase of food that may in future come from cloned animals?"
"Such food will not be specially labelled, since exporters will attempt to smuggle it into the European market."
"Mr President, I am going to be the different voice in this argument, because, through the ages, man has manipulated the breeding of animals and enhanced their productivity to meet his needs."
"There is a clear continuum: natural service to artificial insemination, to embryo transfer, to embryo splitting, in vitro fertilisation, blastomere nuclear transfer, foetal nuclear transfer and now somatic cell nuclear transfer."
"Every new development has been seen as too far, and each time the technique has been improved and perfected, the benefits have come through and the anticipated problems have faded away."
"Now the farmers' unions are beginning to foresee benefits to animal health and welfare through the use of cloning."
"The Food and Safety Agency says: 'There is no indication that differences exist in terms of food safety between food products from healthy cattle and pig clones and their progeny, compared with those from healthy, conventionally-bred animals.'"
"Nor does it see any environmental risks - and there are benefits: safeguarding high-value animals and their genetics, conserving and even reintroducing endangered breeds, eliminating dangerous pathogens and their transfer internationally, improving productivity and competitivity, and encouraging research and development in Europe rather than elsewhere."
"So why do we Europeans repeatedly fall into the knee-jerk trap of distrusting any new development and of rushing to ban new things?"
"Look at what happened with GMOs."
"So let us discuss and debate, and base our arguments on science and facts."
"I urge the Commission to follow developments carefully, encourage research, clarify the science, defend the facts; but do not ban."
"Let us drop this inaccurate, illogical and misguided resolution."
"Mr President, lest Mr Purvis think he is alone, let me try and walk a middle line."
"This is a very worthy debate and it is a shame it is being held at this late hour."
"I listened to the first part in my office and it was riveting - which can be rare for a European Parliament debate - because it is practical."
"I would like to mention a number of points."
"What concerns me in the debate now is the link between genetically-modified foods and the cloning of animals."
"I am not among those calling for a ban on GMOs, because in Ireland we use a large volume of genetically-modified animal feed ingredients and need to continue doing that. The concerns on cloning, well voiced by the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Mr Parish, are on the welfare side, and clearly there is concern that animals suffer."
"That is an issue that needs to be looked at."
"Calling for a ban on cloned animals in food production may not address that issue if the research stage of that process is concerned."
"Therefore, while my immediate reaction as a Member of the Committee on Agriculture was to support this resolution - I am glad we raised this issue and applaud the Committee and its Chair for doing so - my gut instinct now is that Mr Purvis is perhaps on the right track, and that an outright ban might be a step too far."
"I await the Commission's very considered opinion."
"Mr President, let me first of all welcome the opportunity of holding this debate."
"I think it has been very timely."
"This is a subject that gives great concern."
"What I do not like is that we in Europe do not have sufficient control to ensure that cloned animals do not enter or reach the food chain."
"I understand the need to allow animal breeding and development, and I understand fully what Mr Purvis is saying - and I have no wish to bring to an end the ability of science to develop in any way, shape, size or form - but I strongly believe that we must set in place clear criteria and controls."
"I share Mr Parish's concern about the welfare of the animals."
"I do have great concerns about animal welfare, because a very high percentage of cloned animals suffer at a very early age."
"Let me repeat: I do not oppose, or wish to stand in the way of, futuristic developments."
"In the past we have made many mistakes."
"Let us not do so on this delicate subject."
"Let us protect the food chain from cloned animals."
"I am opposed to them in the food chain."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the opinion of the European Parliament on this new technology and its consequences is of course of the utmost importance for me and I welcome the views of the honourable Members."
"In particular, I wish to say that EFSA's opinion gives us new food for thought, and many factors need to be taken into account."
"I agree that novel food is not the right tool to deal with the question of food from cloned animals and this is something that can be discussed during our deliberations on the proposal for novel food."
"I wish, however, to make a clarification here because I heard a number of speakers speaking about cloning and genetic modification as if they were one and the same thing."
"No: genetic modification and cloning are two separate techniques."
"Expert opinion states that cloning does not alter genetic material and clones are merely genetic copies of animals."
"In finalising my comments, I wish to assure you that in any future actions the Commission will carefully examine all factors at play."
"The debate is closed."
"I have received the proposal for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 3 September at 11.30 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - Even if strict conditions are respected and EFSA concludes that cloned meat is equivalent to conventional meat, animal cloning for food supply is, to many people, a risky and morally unacceptable practice."
"The current level of suffering and health problems in cloned animals reinforces that claim."
"If conventional methods work, then why should we encourage a technique that causes so many animals to suffer and die?"
"It neither improves breeding, nor food safety nor the security of provision."
"It clearly provides no obvious benefit to the consumer."
"Furthermore, European consumers have, on several occasions, expressed their wish not to have food products from clones or the offspring thereof on their table."
"It is a legitimate call and sends a clear signal, so why are we even considering cloning for food supply in the first place?"
"People want to have control over what they eat and they are concerned that cloning will ultimately be forced on them."
"If we do not wish to further alienate the public from the European project, I believe we had better listen to their will and enforce it."
"Therefore, I call for no cloning of animals for food supply."
"in writing. - (SK) I was amazed when reading the text of this resolution."
"I should first of all like to say that I shall vote for it, but I have a few comments:"
"Paragraph B: 'whereas cloning processes show low rates of survival for transferred embryos and cloned animals, with many cloned animals dying in the early stages of life ...'"
"What would the future for humanity be if man took the same remarkable degree of care and if we stopped freezing human embryos?"
"Paragraph C: '... mortality and morbidity levels in cloned animals are higher than in sexually produced animals and late pregnancy losses and disorders are likely to affect the welfare of surrogate mothers'."
"What would the future for humanity be if the whole of society gave such support to mothers of families as we give to the protection of surrogate animal mothers?"
"Paragraph D: '... given current levels of suffering and health problems of surrogate dams and cloned animals, the European Group on Ethics ... questions whether cloning animals ... is ethically justified ...'"
"What would the future for humanity be if this Group took into consideration the suffering of women who become surrogate mothers in order to improve their financial situation or the stress suffered by women following repeated unsuccessful artificial fertilisation attempts or consistently forbade the use of human embryos for research purposes because it is morally impermissible."
"Lucky animals, because this resolution also shows that they are in some cases better protected than man."

"Once again, we are dealing with chemicals and the protection of people and the environment from their potentially dangerous effects."
"Chemicals are not purely a European problem, or a European monopoly."
"They are produced, traded and used throughout the world, and the risks associated with the use of chemicals are the same irrespective of location."
"Therefore, it stands to reason that we have endeavoured to achieve a worldwide system to describe and label these hazards."
"The legislation we are going to adopt today creates the basis for globally uniform environmental, health and safety information relating to potentially dangerous chemicals."
"Health and environmental protection will become transparent and comparable worldwide only when harmonised standards of measurement are used to determine and label the dangers posed by chemicals."
"We must not underestimate the economic advantages either."
"European enterprises will save money because they will not need to evaluate chemical hazard procedures that apply in different countries according to different criteria and different systems."
"Professional users of chemicals and consumers throughout the world will also benefit from this harmonisation."
"People who use chemicals will no longer have to become familiar with several different systems in order to know what level of threat a chemical may pose."
"The compromise presented by the rapporteur is balanced and takes particular account of issues such as workability and the clarity of the provisions."
"Although the amendments proposed by co-legislators are numerous, they do not alter the underlying principles or the basic structure of the original proposal by the Commission in any significant way."
"Therefore, the Commission is able to go along with these proposals."
"Even when we were preparing the proposal, the Commission was concerned to leave the current very high level of protection of human health and the environment untouched."
"I am very pleased that Parliament and the Council share our basic view on this."
"The close, constructive cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission greatly benefitted the negotiation process and, as I have already said, this means that we can accept all the compromises that Mrs Sartori has suggested."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I have already reminded the Commissioner, in recent months we have repeatedly addressed the issue of the classification, labelling and packaging of chemical substances and mixtures, a system better known by its abbreviation 'GHS', for which I am rapporteur."
"For this reason, instead of discussing the technical details of the dossier again, I would like to begin by thanking my colleagues and the shadow rapporteurs whom I worked with to create a constructive and extremely satisfying dialogue based on extensive collaboration and transparency."
"I would particularly like to thank everyone for the support and faith shown in me."
"This gave me enough backing for a successful outcome to the negotiations with the Council and the Commission."
"I would also like to thank the draftsmen of the opinions of the relevant committees - Mrs Laperrouze, for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and Mr Schwab, for the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection - who were involved on the basis of an enhanced cooperation procedure."
"The opinions adopted by these two committees in fact supplemented and enhanced the proposal, making it more efficient and easier for end users: by these I mean consumers, businesses, trade associations, supervisory authorities and Member States."
"I would like to mention the excellent work carried out by parliamentary officials and members of the groups who assisted us, as well as representatives from the Commission and the Council."
"Over the last few months we have all worked towards trying to minimise the number of amendments and to reach a consensus on particular compromises."
"After two months of tripartite technical discussions with the other institutions, we have achieved a satisfying compromise package with the Council, approved by COREPER on 27 June and which, if today's vote is successful, will allow us to conclude at first reading."
"With this new legislation, we need, on the one hand, to maintain the commitments we have assumed at international level - and thus ensure that the UN GHS is consistent with our own legislation in terms of content - and on the other, we must meet the existing deadlines imposed by our own legislation in REACH."
"With this new regulation, we will at the same time succeed in both offering better protection to users of these substances and in making our firms more competitive and efficient."
"Under these new rules, which are identical all over the world, countries will not be allowed to consider the same product more harmful or less harmful than in other countries."
"So far this has not been the case."
"Not only is this illogical, given that the same substance presents the same risks no matter where it is, but it is also extremely risky when these products are exported by one country to another and end up being used by people who have no notion of the dangers of the product they are using."
"I believe, therefore, that for users and workers in this sector, particularly in the extremely high number of small and medium-sized enterprises, our proposal can be an effective response not only for all of our citizens and all Europeans, but for people all around the world."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate Mrs Sartori, our rapporteur, and the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups."
"I think the work we have done, though not easy with a text of 2 000 pages, has brought real progress."
"I will speak first of all on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, for which I was draftsman of the opinion, and then I will speak on behalf of my political group."
"The Committee on Industry has adopted various amendments, and I am briefly going to mention the main ones."
"The situation of SMEs had to be taken into account: they expressed their interest in this matter during the preparatory consultation by the Commission."
"Out of 360 companies, 45%, employing fewer than 250 employees, responded to this online consultation held by the Commission between 21 August and 21 October 2006."
"Our Committee was keen to highlight the fact that apart from providing necessary information, the purpose of the GHS is also the protection of consumers and the environment."
"Our Committee called upon the Member States to introduce a procedure that helps all suppliers, particularly SMEs, in certain sectors of production, to determine the correct classification, labelling and packaging of these substances and mixtures."
"Our Committee was also keen on consistency with REACH and therefore tabled amendments concerning tonnage."
"Lastly, out of more than just a desire to avoid the duplication of legislation on packaging, our Committee wanted to anticipate the possibility of disputes over the interpretation of the Regulation's requirements, in this case between the supplier and a Member State and the need for a procedure to ensure classification is harmonised."
"I now come to my role as shadow rapporteur for the ALDE, and will outline some of the guiding principles of our approach."
"Of course we welcome this initiative."
"A global approach is totally consistent with the objective of protecting health and the environment more effectively while allowing for trade in products."
"Since it is a global system, it is important that the future regulation does not introduce constraints on European firms that do not apply to their international competitors."
"It would be desirable for the proposal to be consistent with REACH as regards both timeframes and a tonnage-based approach, and where the annexes are concerned, not least Annex VI."
"As regards the information affixed to finished products, given that the European Commission has chosen to include post-manufacturing, the guiding principle has to be the quality and relevance of information and not the quantity."
"Our group felt it was important to recognise the existence and value of other sources of information, particularly NGOs and industry, but also the importance of tools for communication such as the internet."
"The confidentiality of some information must also be protected."
"Lastly, this legislation must not generate an increase in animal testing."
"Because of the tight schedule, but also the complexity of the annexes, I recall that MEPs decided not to amend them."
"The aim of this was also to facilitate the negotiations."
"This was a major concession by Parliament."
"However, we have noticed in this case that one of these annexes raises a serious problem of immediate conformity and implementation for the industries concerned."
"Annex VI is a list of substances with harmonised classifications at European level."
"A similar list already exists, however, and the industry uses this existing list to classify and label mixtures."
"But when the transfer took place, modifications were made to this list and it will have to be applied as soon the GHS comes into force, though in the case of technical adaptations, the timeframe for this is at least 18 months."
"Many SMEs are concerned about this change."
"It is essential that we reach agreement in the first reading with the Council, and stop publishing provisions as soon as possible to give the industry and users time to adapt to the new system and make it operational by the end of 2008."
"Consequently, I am asking the Commission to put forward a solution that gives the industry sufficient time to bring itself into conformity with the regulation's requirements, without having a disproportionate impact."
"Following the trialogue, apart from the problem with the Annex, the text being put to the vote seems like a good one to me."
"I would just like to highlight a few salient points."
"We have talked a great deal about PBTs."
"They are not covered by the United Nations GHS."
"Parliament has secured agreement from the European Commission to push for their classification at United Nations level."
"Parliament has also secured the removal of the division of the 'eye irritation' category into sub-categories, which would undoubtedly have led to an increase in the number of tests on animals without adding any real value."
"We can also report that tests on humans for the sole purpose of this regulation are banned, and that the UN's GHS is a dynamic process; a mechanism has been found to enable changes to the UN GHS to be taken into account by the European GHS."
"Confidentiality is protected in a balanced way."
"Consistency with REACH is guaranteed and Parliament has accepted a zero threshold for inventory and notification, though originally we wanted a threshold of one tonne for certain categories of products."
"This zero threshold was accepted because substances and mixtures exclusively for R&D purposes are excluded from the scope of application."
"I think we have done a good job and I am hoping for a good vote and for the GHS to be applied properly."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to say that it gave the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection great satisfaction to see the compromise presented by Mrs Sartori on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"We believe that, with this solution, we have found a very good compromise and a very good solution, both for the chemical companies in the European internal market - most of which operate globally - and for consumers, and that we have also achieved a very good compromise for consumers with sensitivities."
"This was possible only because of the amicable, unwavering cooperation between the rapporteurs."
"I would particularly like to thank Mrs Sartori for the way she led the negotiations - including in trialogue - as in the end, there is no doubt that this was critical to achieving a solution that met everyone's expectations."
"I am happy with the result because I believe, from the point of view of the internal market, and of enterprises - particularly chemicals enterprises, whose experience of the European level in terms of REACH has not been 100% positive - that the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS), as a universal guideline set up by the United Nations, can be implemented on the European internal market in a very non-bureaucratic way and with a practical orientation."
"This will bring direct competitive advantages on the internal European market for enterprises that are active on this market, because harmonised labelling is a significant step forward compared to the existing regulation, which still varies in some peripheral areas."
"Commissioner, in the trialogue discussions, we also briefly discussed the fact that legislation on the transport of these consumer goods has still not been harmonised and that it would therefore be worth considering whether we should shift our focus to legislation on the transport of chemicals in the coming months."
"Secondly, not opening the annexes was the right thing to do - and here I would like to support Mrs Laperrouze of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, with whom we also enjoyed excellent cooperation - because this move enabled us to prevent the discussion becoming like the one regarding REACH."
"Even though it meant that certain individual points that we would have liked to improve were missed out, with the wisdom of hindsight, it was indeed the right path to take."
"Nevertheless, I would like to lend my express support to Mrs Laperrouze's desire to create a transitional deadline in Annex 6 for the substances that were amended in that annex, because when we started the consultation, we could not predict that they would not be covered by the solution we decided on."
"Commissioner, I would very much appreciate it if you would comment briefly on this in your answer."
"Users of chemical consumer goods are not, as a rule, conversant with the composition of these goods."
"When discussing the GHS, we therefore placed particular importance on implementing it in a way that would be practical for consumers."
"Although it was not possible to consider each individual case in detail, we found a solution - at least for the most common consumer goods, such as washing powder and detergents - that makes consumers aware of the quantities of chemicals these products contain, while also enabling people to use them in the future in the same way as they have done in the past."
"Perhaps I can give you an example: it used to be possible to use washing-up liquid only in large bottles containing several litres."
"Increasingly environmentally friendly technology in the manufacture and use of these products has enabled the quantity of washing-up liquid required to be reduced further and further, so that now, the largest containers found in kitchens are just 300 ml or 500 ml."
"No doubt the concentration of the chemicals in these products has increased but for consumers, this is compatible with the present GHS solution because we know that people use these products every day, so we did not need to overclassify them."
"That covers all the points relevant to the internal market. Thank you for your attention."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in a situation such as this one, where we are all in agreement, our debate risks becoming repetitive."
"For my part, I would just like to make three very brief political points, since I fully agree with what my fellow Members have said."
"The first point naturally is recognition for the perseverance that our rapporteur has shown since the start."
"From the very first meetings, she has demonstrated a political determination to close the dossier at first reading, and in fact she has almost forced us to do so, by twisting our arms."
"However, we were all convinced that this was necessary if we were to introduce legislation swiftly to obtain an immediate classification of all substances and make a real step towards tougher standards to protect consumer health and - I agree on this point - the health of workers who use these substances in many different sectors, particularly in the more difficult context of a small business."
"Secondly, we have avoided the increasing danger of reopening old discussions that had been shelved with the adoption of REACH, something that I was particularly keen to see."
"At an international level, I believe that even the fact that REACH is increasingly being used as a benchmark at international level by other countries, which are using it as a model to adapt their own legislation, is extremely satisfying."
"In any case, the provisions relating to the classification of substances that we are about to vote on must be adapted and integrated so that they correspond to the principal regulation on the classification, labelling, and packaging of substances and mixtures without adding any new elements."
"Ultimately this means, as all my fellow Members will know, that the GHS is not the last word on the subject of the classification and labelling of substances."
"There has been much discussion of PDT."
"We must not forget that this is an ongoing process. For now we are implementing what we already have, and classifying substances on which the UN has already carried out a risk analysis."
"As soon as we have new risk categories and the results of new studies, the GHS will be updated accordingly, so this is an ongoing process."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, the environment and public health affect every citizen and this legislation is directly connected with both."
"The Parliament voted in favour of the REACH system which is now in place and which protects people's health and the environment from the danger of chemicals."
"The aim of REACH is to ensure that manufacturers and importers register, classify and authorize chemicals."
"An essential part of the system is providing the public with information by labelling these chemicals."
"I can only praise this legislation and the Commissioner for giving the EU system equal ranking with the UNGHS (UN Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling)."
"The public will be informed about the dangers of chemicals through pictograms which shall indicate the risks concerning explosions, fire, cancer and poison."
"There will be advantages for industry as countries all over the world accept the GHS system. And the public will have more confidence in chemicals which have signs and clear and definite labelling."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) We talk a great deal about taking the initiative on climate change but, if we really had a holistic approach to the environment, we would have directly copied UN legislation here too."
"Now we are removing acute toxicity category five."
"Why are we doing this?"
"Well, for the bizarre reason that otherwise there would be an increase in the number of substances which would have to be classified and labelled."
"Thus the reason has nothing to do with any kind of environmental logic or health logic."
"No, we do not want to copy category five because it would mean increasing the number of substances, despite the fact that the point of the whole thing is to have a common global standard which would make things easier for trade and, in this case, also for the environment and information to consumers."
"I fought for reintroducing acute toxicity category five, but unfortunately I did not succeed."
"Another thing which we were behind and actually succeeded in getting through together with the Council was preventing the proposal for a reduced classification threshold of 10 kg."
"I would like to thank the Council for standing their ground."
"The Commission also had a positive input."
"If the proposal had gone through, REACH would have been undermined."
"REACH was about evaluating chemicals, finding out whether they are dangerous and registering them."
"However, REACH evaluates and registers only the 30 000 most commonly used chemicals, those with the highest volume."
"The other 70 000 chemicals we use would be dealt with under this legislation."
"For this reason it is very good that we retained it and that no lower limit was imposed for when chemicals are to be classified."
"If the proposal had gone through, REACH would not have had a complement in the GHS."
"I am very glad that this was not the case and therefore I can support this."
"I am also pleased that we succeeded in preventing an unnecessary division into categories for animal testing, e.g. eye irritation tests."
"With these two victories under our belt, I can vote in favour of this report."
"However, I would really like to emphasise that, although we have not succeeded in including the very hazardous PBT chemicals or a priority list for evaluation here and now, at least we have gained a text that says we will promote this at UN level and that it will be included in the UN system."
"Now I would really like to see the Commission working hard to achieve this aim, because it is very important."
"Otherwise our chemicals policy will have failed completely."
"It is very important that these substances are now quickly incorporated in the UN system, as we did not manage to take the first step here."
"So what happens for consumers?"
"They won't be as well informed as they could have been about the danger of chemicals, and that is disappointing."
"But they will at least get a decent standard and basic protection to protect themselves from hazardous chemicals."
"So in the end it was a compromise which no one is satisfied with, and maybe that is what usually happens."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, chemicals are a natural and important part of our environment."
"Even though we often do not think about it, we use chemicals every day."
"The modern world could not function without them."
"They keep our food fresh, our bodies clean, they help our plants to grow, they fuel our cars."
"Properly used and properly handled, chemicals make it possible for us to live longer, healthier lives."
"This proposed regulation, which complements REACH and aligns the EU system for classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures with the UN Globally Harmonised System, is a reasonable and balanced proposal."
"If we want to utilise the benefits of chemicals at a reasonable cost then we have to accept that there will be risks."
"We need therefore to strike a balance between risks and benefits and control the risks of chemicals through careful labelling, science-based regulation and innovative technologies."
"We also need to strike a balance between properly implementing the European Union's international obligations signed up to at the United Nations Economic and Social Council at the World Summit on Sustainable Development which was held in Johannesburg in September 2002, while at the same time avoiding unnecessary burdens on business through impractical and over-demanding labelling."
"To this effect, I tabled several amendments to the proposal."
"I feel it is particularly important to ensure that classification of products does not lead to confusion among consumers or health care providers."
"Too much information is equal to no information."
"This is why I tabled an amendment on the packaging of products, for example, with awkward shapes or that are so small that it is technically impossible to attach a label."
"In these cases, hazard labelling information should be supplied in some other appropriate manner such as tie-on tags."
"I would like to thank particularly the rapporteur, Mrs Sartori, for supporting my amendments and for the excellent work she has done on this report."
"While existing regulations on identifying and communicating the hazardous properties of chemicals are similar in many respects, some differences are significant enough to result in different classification, different labelling and safety data sheets (SDS)."
"The Globally Harmonised System (GHS) will hopefully merge these different classifications in an effective way."
"The benefits of chemical use far outweigh the risks and this is especially so since the introduction of the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals legislation known as REACH."
"We must all be aware that chemicals, through the different steps from their production to their handling, transport and use can pose potential risks to human health and the environment."
"In this context, the UN-EU GHS agreement is expected to be an improvement in human health and environmental protection and will also offer greater clarity to enterprises, particularly those involved in international trade."
"The potential but manageable risks involved with chemicals underline the need for our legislation on a globally harmonised approach to packaging and labelling of chemicals, and it is in this respect I am pleased that the Council and Parliament agreed to a text on 27 June, and I congratulate again our rapporteur on the work done on this complex but very important file."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Those who work in chemicals manufacturing will be particularly severely affected."
"According to a Finnish study, around 32 million EU citizens are exposed to carcinogenic chemicals in their workplace every day."
"It is our duty to ban the most dangerous chemicals and exercise control over all chemicals in general."
"This was the very purpose of the chemicals legislation REACH which we decided on last year."
"The result of REACH can be debated."
"I myself thought that the final result was watered down and lobbied to pieces by industry, but at least it is there, the world's most wide-ranging chemicals legislation."
"The GHS, the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals, continues and complements REACH."
"The GHS aims to pass information about chemicals on to workers and consumers."
"The aim is to classify and label the thousands of substances and mixtures which surround us."
"The GHS is in fact a UN Convention which we must now implement at EU level."
"Once the GHS has been passed - unfortunately not until 2010 for substances and as late as 2015 for mixtures - all chemicals will be easy to identify."
"It is about better information for the millions of workers who come into contact with chemicals every day, for consumers who must be able to know what they are buying."
"Labelling will also help to improve public health in general and the environment."
"Industry will be able to enjoy more consistent legislation which will facilitate international trade."
"This is a major step forward and that is why we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left support this compromise."
"However, it is a pity that we did not go as far as we could have done."
"Chemicals which are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic, PBTs, will not be labelled."
"Instead this compromise means that the question of PBTs will be dealt with at UN level."
"This is a serious flaw in the agreement."
"Why not decide that PBT chemicals are to have the same status as all the others and also be labelled."
"Now we have to hope that other countries exert pressure on the question of PBTs."
"I also believe that this will be the case in the long term."
"Despite this, this is a decent compromise which will lead to millions of Europeans, workers and consumers, receiving more information about the tens of thousands of chemicals around us."
"This is a major and important decision for everyone suffering from cancer, allergies or skin diseases as a result of chemicals."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, with the REACH Regulation now beginning to take its terrible toll on productive industry, especially on smaller businesses, and the numbers of animal experiments rising sharply, here in the form of come some more instructions from the world-government zealots of UNESCO on how to classify, label and package the results of its previous idea."
"Being equally thirsty for anti-democratic global domination, the commercial and political elite which constitutes the European Union hastens to implement these instructions, just as they did to implement REACH."
"They made a barrage of assurances of their good intentions which may for the moment protect or delude their so-called stakeholders, but which will not satisfy the great number of the unemployed which these measures are already beginning to produce."
"A crumb of recognition for public opinion falls from the master's table in the form of Amendments 10, 12, 39 and 42, to place reducing animal experimentation in certain circumstances before adherence to the letter of the legislation."
"I understand that this is due to pressure from the influential environmental groups upon which the EU depends for so much of its support, and placing the welfare of non-human primates above that of humans, as expressed in Amendment 40, is surely going too far to placate them, but finding anything deserving of a positive vote in the oppressive and obsessive process of EU legislation is a rarity worthy of note."
"For the rest, there is no reason why sensible standards of safety should not be adopted voluntarily by democratic nation states with independent judiciaries and free public access to judicial systems."
"Supranational edicts may appear to be an easy option, but the centralised unaccountable power they contribute, directive by unmandated directive, is not just their sting in the tail but their principal awful effect."
"The claim put forward in recital 7 to the effect that this legislation will provide a competitive advantage to industry and, as Amendment 1 adds, in particular to small and medium-sized enterprises, is simply ludicrous."
"As always, the EU's big business overlords will benefit from the failure of their smaller competitors."
"They will become even larger fish in a smaller pond or flee abroad, and far from kowtowing to the EU and its ridiculous restrictions, traders overseas will trade much more profitably with each other than they will with us."
"The boom is over."
"The recession has begun and under the burden of EU regulation such as, our economies are sinking like stones."
"Each traveller on this gravy train can tell his electorate whatever he likes in their own language without fear that they will overhear what his colleagues in other states are telling their electors."
"There is no general EU electorate and there cannot be one until perhaps in a century or two everyone speaks one language, and until that time comes EU democracy will be a joke, and a dark and dangerous joke at that."
"But your privileges are enormous."
"Why should you care about this or the crazy counterproductive laws you continually rubber stamp?"
"And why should I care, because I am retiring at the end of this month?"
"When I read Amendment 28 it made me realise why I have had enough of all this nonsense."
"It says: 'Preparation means a mixture or solution composed of two or more substances."
"Mixture and preparation are synonyms'."
"Well, however would we survive without this supernanny state explaining such things to us, and how on earth have I survived to the ripe old age of 68 when I spent my infant years chewing the leaded paint off the wooden frame of my cot?"
"I suppose it gave my antibodies something to do in the days when we actually had antibodies."
"Each leaden edict brings the collapse of the EU closer."
"I rejoice in that, but I deplore the damage which you are inflicting on 27 former democracies, year by disastrous year."
"Madam President, it makes clear sense to me that, since chemicals are manufactured and traded globally, the description of hazards on their packaging should not differ between countries, as that is both prejudicial to consumers and a disadvantage to those who accurately describe the hazard."
"However, I note that at present the 'globally-harmonised' system is not very global."
"It is more sporadic than global."
"I wonder whether other countries will follow the EU's example in embracing this UN system, and what the impact might be for businesses in Europe if they do not."
"In implementing these measures we need to strike a balance."
"Firstly, it is crucial for there to be no over-classification of products, which would confuse consumers and health-care providers."
"Secondly, we need to implement these international obligations without placing unnecessary burdens on our businesses."
"A number of companies have raised concerns over the cost of implementation."
"There will be high IT and training outlays and repackaging costs, which we must not underestimate, especially in the case of small business."
"I would echo the concern that SMEs could fall victim, especially if they trade overseas, in which case these costs may well be more than they can bear."
"(FI) Madam President, the debate on the very recent European Chemicals Regulation, REACH, is still in our memories."
"It was one of the toughest legislative packages this term."
"The regulation on the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures we are now dealing with is partly based on, and complements, the REACH Regulation that has just entered into force."
"That is why it gave rise to a lot of questions beforehand."
"The Commission's desire for an agreement at first reading initially seemed a bit too ambitious, given that Parliament had previously indicated its interest in legislation on chemicals."
"I can therefore only admire the creditable work and leadership of my colleague, Mrs Sartori, with respect to this technical report, and how she managed to avoid the temptation of revising the regulation too much and, for example, incorporating new paragraphs and classifications of substances in the annexes, which would have slowed down and even prevented the regulation's entry into force."
"The report which we worked through on the committees is likely to achieve the targets set for the regulation, especially regarding the harmonisation and simplification of legislation."
"GHS and REACH complement one another and do not just facilitate the work of the producers and distributors of chemicals."
"Instead, clear and safe labelling will mean a return to consumer confidence in them."
"When the work of the Committee began, people were worried that the GHS Regulation would mean that a large number of detergents, for example, would have to be classified as corrosive in the same way."
"This way, for example, agents for unblocking pipes and washing-up liquids would have the same classification and package labelling, with the result that consumers would not be able to distinguish between hazardous products and milder detergents."
"Now, however, the classifications of substances reflect their actual potential danger as well as can be expected."
"The aim of this system, based as it is on a UN agreement, is that the same criteria should apply to the classification and labelling of chemicals and the regulations on the transportation, sales and use of chemicals all over the world."
"Under the agreement it would be fully operative by 2008. We still have a few months left to go."
"Madam President, the global harmonisation of the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures is to be welcomed, and the European Union should play a leading role in protecting our citizens against dangerous chemicals."
"The whole initiative comes from the United Nations, and is therefore a global project."
"The globally harmonised system is a promising sign of global cooperation in environmental issues."
"That is why I support the adoption of the compromise on the Sartori report."
"I have tabled more than 20 amendments in order to ensure the appropriate labelling and safe use of chemicals."
"Seventeen of those amendments were approved by the ENVI Committee."
"However, the same Environmental Committee also adopted several amendments from the rapporteur which would weaken consumers' rights regarding information on the hazards of the chemicals in products."
"The Socialist Group and I voted against those proposals because the interests of consumers are vital to us."
"I am satisfied that the new compromise does not include these anti-consumer amendments, and I therefore propose to accept it."
"I am not totally happy with the compromise, but we cannot delay putting the GHS into our legislation."
"Let us accept, as a basic principle, that companies should not invoke business confidentiality when they place hazardous chemicals on the market."
"Concerning hazards, consumers must have the right to have all necessary information."
"Of course, the devil is in the details, so we will see how the GHS will work in practice, how hazard signs will be indicated on the products by industry, and whether consumers understand the signs and warnings."
"The information should be clear and easily understandable."
"Altogether, I hope that GHS will be a good tool to present the outcome of REACH to the public, so that chemicals are trusted much more by consumers, which will help our industry as well."
"My assistant Gergely Simon, who has done much work on this and other dossiers, will leave Parliament in the near future."
"I would like to thank him for his contribution to our common goal, which is a chemically safer Europe."
"(DE) Madam President, we all know that chemicals are produced and traded throughout the world, and the dangers and risks are global too."
"Therefore, we need guidelines in the form of clear classifications and labels, which apply globally."
"I would have liked the European Union to be the engine driving very clear labelling and strong consumer protection, but I have heard many speakers here that say that, rather than being the engine, the EU should be sitting in the brake van."
"I can live with this political agreement, but I am not very happy with it."
"Yes, we managed an important step towards greater safety for people and the environment."
"I am also pleased that, despite the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in connection with threshold values for labelling, which was all too industry-friendly - the volumes of data used for the classification should have been included on the label - we managed to limit the damage in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission."
"I am glad that there are no longer any tonnage-based threshold values for the requirement to label and also no more accepted loopholes for industry, and that the proposed classification system redirects the focus towards alternatives to experiments on animals."
"However, I would have liked to see the labelling of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances improved, and a new 'acute toxicity' category created, because that is extremely topical and a matter on which we ought to have shown willingness to take action."
"I believe that we have sent out an important signal for greater safety for people and the environment today, but we cannot rest on our laurels."
"Obviously this topic is going to keep us busy in the future, as there is plenty of room for improvement."
"(FR) Madam President, there are already global accounting regulations, global food standards in the Codex Alimentarius, global tax standards and UN model double taxation conventions."
"Now we are going to get global standards for the labelling, classification, packaging and tonnage of chemical substances."
"The 2002 global legislation of the UN Social and Economic Council, the general harmonised system, is being transposed into Community law."
"There is certainly some value for everyone in global harmonisation - for consumers, users, SMEs - but beyond these 2 000 pages and procedures, annexes and lists, the regulation shows that European standardisation is not enough to deal with globalised problems."
"Global problems need global solutions, which means that the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, is right: between UN level and global level, the European level is increasingly out of date, obsolete and, ultimately, useless."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, it is no longer tolerable for differing national legislation on trade, in particular in hazardous substances, to be in force within the single European market."
"Unification of the classification and labelling of hazardous chemicals and mixtures is good news for consumers, since the proposed harmonisation improves the protection of their health and the environment."
"It is also good news for the competitiveness of European industry that this complex regulation relating to the transportation, supply and use of hazardous substances will apply not only in the European Union, but also in other countries around the world thanks to UN recommendations."
"The regulation ties in with REACH, but it also introduces hazard classes and categories."
"Labels will contain instructions for handling and compulsory graphic symbols and pictograms which will be intelligible to people anywhere in the world."
"New requirements for packaging and fastenings will provide protection against vessels being opened by children and also provide for markings for the blind."
"Critics warn of the high costs of re-labelling, the creation of 'safety data sheets' and the introduction of new packaging technologies."
"I am, however, convinced that these short-term expenses will be lower than the long-term savings in costs associated with the repeal of the present differing labelling of products depending on the destination."
"The implementation time, which is staggered over the period 2010 to 2015, is also sufficiently considerate for industry."
"I greatly appreciate that Amalia Sartori has managed to reach an excellent compromise within Parliament and also with the Council."
"After many months of discussions on the provisions of the Commission's proposal, she has managed to achieve a great improvement and balance and therefore I urge that we adopt the proposal tomorrow at first reading."
"It is an example of the splendid work carried out by the parliamentary rapporteurs with the Council and Commission teams."
"(PL) Madam President, today we are discussing a very important regulation that arose from a debate, and later a UN decision."
"In this debate, which was crowned by the adoption by the Economic and Social Council of a globally harmonised system of chemical classification and labelling, all Member States, and not just the UN, played a very active and significant part, particularly the European Union, and also the Commission."
"This means that the system that was hammered out there is our system too."
"It is therefore good that today we are adapting our regulations on the use of chemicals to conform to this system, while at the same time we are ensuring and wish to ensure that our citizens - EU citizens - are protected and that our environment too is protected from the consequences of the use of hazardous substances, because the aim of this harmonisation, classification and labelling of hazardous substances is meant to be an improvement to the level of health protection, and also to the state of the environment."
"Chemistry affects people the same way the world over."
"When you buy a product, you do not have to know what is in it."
"You should know, however, that you are buying a safe product."
"You should be able to trust the manufacturer and the product acquired."
"Here our role lies in labelling, which still differs to a great extent."
"A product labelled as hazardous in one state is toxic in another, and harmful in a third."
"It is unthinkable that the economy and trade in chemical substances should function in this way."
"This is why I am pleased to welcome our report and discussion today."
"I believe we are engaged in something very important."
"I would like to draw attention to one final matter, namely the consequences linked to the need to provide information on labelling."
"I am talking about information that all those who manage waste need to know."
"Chemical product waste, which is and will continue to be a matter of enormous importance in our environment, must also be included in this section, which closes the whole cycle of chemical product and substance management and, subsequently, of hazardous product waste disposal."
"Let us give European citizens a good product, and let us give them a sense of chemical security."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Sartori's excellent work looks like the best legislative outcome for updating and therefore ensuring better regulation of certain aspects of chemical processing."
"The report is praiseworthy not only because it satisfies the UN's harmonisation programme; it seems coherent, addressing the needs of producers and consumers, as well as the environment of course, in so far as this is objectively possible."
"As usual, some of my fellow Members are not completely satisfied. I get the impression that this is due to an ideological radicalisation in the face of technological and scientific progress that all too often, on the pretext of environmental protection, tries to coerce us."
"Coincidentally, for completely different reasons to those mentioned, countries outside the European Union, not least China, are putting the economy first by allowing chemicals to be manufactured, transported and stored under conditions that are in serious breach of everything that we quite rightly want to protect here."
"The Sartori report is a fundamental step forward, harmonising the classification of substances and the labelling and packaging standards of hazardous substances and mixtures."
"Doubtless this will help improve safety and prevent risks to the health and safety of consumers and workers and the environment."
"It is currently possible for countries to classify the same substance very differently, according to different classification systems in force, and these differences can be so great as to present a risk."
"Substances that in Europe are classified as hazardous may, in countries such as China for example, not carry any warnings on their labels."
"Not only does this situation create an unfair competitive advantage, but it is a serious threat to consumers everywhere and this, ladies and gentlemen, although you often criticise it, is unfortunately especially true in a global market."
"(SV) Madam President, before I started working on environmental issues, I have to admit that my knowledge of chemicals was relatively limited."
"However, the more I have learned, the more sceptical I have become about our use of such a large amount of chemicals in society today."
"Not very long ago I read, for example, that consumption of chemicals used in cleaning in ordinary households has increased dramatically in my country, Sweden."
"No one knows the true effect this is having on our health."
"What we do know is that already many children, not only in Sweden, are now taken to casualty every year because they have swallowed household chemicals which are acutely toxic, despite the fact that the chemicals today bear a warning label which says that this is the case."
"Thanks to our decision later today, this warning will now unfortunately disappear from many products."
"Together with some colleagues, I tried to change this and ensure that this labelling of common household products would remain."
"This will now not be the case."
"I deeply regret this, as it means that important consumer information will be lost."
"Nevertheless, I welcome the fact that the EU is now getting harmonised classification, labelling and packaging legislation to complement REACH, and that it has been drawn up on the basis of the voluntary international system which already exists."
"This makes things easier for consumers and companies alike."
"Once we have reached this decision today, it will be of the utmost importance for all nationally responsible authorities to take responsibility for getting information about the new labelling system out not only to companies but also, more widely, to different consumer groups."
"I would therefore like to take the opportunity to urge the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen to follow up how, and how successfully, this is actually carried out so that we know whether the consumers of Europe understand what the labelling means from now on."
"(RO) Madam President, this proposal for a regulation, together with the other two, the regulation on detergents and the decision to amend the downstream legislation, represent the harmonisation of the European and the world legislation on classification, labelling and packaging of chemicals."
"Their enforcement shall have beneficial effects on human health, environmental protection and chemical industry and the development of trade under conditions of safety and the information of consumers is very important."
"The GHS implementation must be correlated with the enforcement of REACH Directive for producers, approximately 27,000 in the European Union, of which 95% are SMEs, and with the development of trade with non-EU countries, namely 25% of the European Union's volume."
"I request the Commission not to give up the proposal for enforcing the new regulation, during the entire product management cycle, including when the product becomes waste."
"I congratulate the Rapporteur on her work."
"(HU) Thank you very much, Madam President."
"Firstly, I would like to congratulate the Commission and the rapporteurs, because they have managed to bring about a constructive debate on the UN proposal and the REACH plan that we adopted previously, and this has resulted in progress."
"The greatest benefit is standardised labelling, from the perspective of the Committee on Internal Market, consumers and companies."
"Let us not forget that chemical substances will not be safer because of the labelling!"
"Safer use and better choices by consumers create greater safety, so we must establish that this draft legislation is a step forward in this respect and should be welcomed."
"Finally, I would like to say and to draw your attention to the fact that we have joined forces behind the UN as the European Union, and we must now do everything, in collaboration with the UN, to ensure that the rest of the world also adopts it."
"I propose this so that we may find followers for our legislation on the chemicals industry in the rest of the world, at the Transatlantic Economic Council and in other international fora. Thank you very much for your attention."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Sartori, together with her shadow rapporteurs and the Council and the Commission for reaching an agreement on the GHS package at first reading."
"We have managed to achieve the target that had been set for us, which was to get the new system up and running quickly and in line with the REACH Regulation, while at the same time ensuring a high level of protection of human health and the environment, as well as meeting the commercial needs of firms, which can now target foreign markets more easily."
"Once the GHS is in operation, firms will be able to operate based on a single classification system for substances, harmonised at international level, and which, among other things, will allow easier access to legislation on substances via the European Chemicals Agency."
"With this regulation, which applies international criteria for the classification and labelling of hazardous substances and mixtures in the European Union, we will ensure that our firms are ready to open up to the global market."
"There will also undoubtedly be benefits for the consumer, who will be able to recognise hazardous substances such as toxic and corrosive substances and irritants more easily."
"The GHS labelling system, with its uniform pictograms, that are easy to understand, will help identify the risks of substances contained in everyday products such as detergents and soaps."
"In addition, the GHS, which for many substances requires special safety devices to seal packaging, will help protect our children from dangerous accidents in the home due to the accidental ingestion of toxic or corrosive substances."
"Of course, the GHS will require a certain amount of effort from firms, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, which should have confidence in the new system."
"The system will in fact introduce seven new risk categories and a new classification for the transport system."
"This is why we are particularly pleased with the agreement reached with the Council, which also took into account the support, information and running-in requirements, particularly for SMEs."
"The agreement also took account of the consensus of all parliamentary groups on the need to minimise animal testing and any duplication of these tests as far as possible."
"For all of these reasons, my group will be voting in favour of the package tabled."
"(SV) I would just like to reply to what my fellow Member Mr Booth said here about the environmental movement wanting to protect people but not animals."
"He seems to have misunderstood this."
"It is a question of classification."
"The texts to which Mr Booth refers state that you must not manipulate a chemical mixture solely for the purposes of classification in order to come in under a certain threshold, that you must not be allowed to do lots of animal tests just to avoid labelling."
"This would lead to us seeing chemical mixtures which contain dangerous substances, but of different kinds, and which therefore do not exactly reach the threshold for labelling."
"In these cases the aim would thus be to carry out animal testing solely in order to get out of labelling."
"It is for this reason that we need these texts."
"Here animal health and human health are going hand in hand."
"Animal testing is avoided but people gain proper information about the chemicals so that they can take the correct action to protect themselves against them."
"Mr Booth has really misunderstood this!"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this vigorous, lively debate has shown that we are dealing with an important and far-reaching subject."
"I think we can say today that taking this step concludes the intensive legislative work carried out in relation to the chemicals industry and the manufacture and use of chemicals in Europe - work that has taken many years."
"I would like to make this very clear, thinking about the very useful image that Mrs Breyer used. Who is sitting in the engine, and who is sitting in the brake van?"
"One thing is certain: as far as legislation on chemicals is concerned, the European Union is the engine for the whole world."
"Nowhere else are there regulations such as we have introduced, and nowhere else are demands being made of the chemicals industry such as we are making."
"Therefore, the Commission strongly believes that, in connection with the horizontal legislation for this sector, we now need a few years in which to put into effect what we have already decided, and that we should not immediately embark on any other major projects."
"It is with good reason that the REACH legislation provides for review periods, and we should observe the periods decided on by the legislator very closely."
"This means that the Commission will always present the reports and suggestions on time."
"As far as major horizontal initiatives are concerned, let me repeat that the Commission does not intend to make any further proposals within the foreseeable future."
"I can also reassure you about the global effectiveness of this system."
"All the information available to me shows that all around the world, all those involved are indeed working hard to implement the system decided upon by the United Nations."
"We are definitely at the forefront when it comes to actual implementation."
"I think many major countries have been waiting for exactly what has happened here today, because they want to base their own legislation and their own implementation on what we do in the European Union."
"I expect that we will now see these procedures being brought to completion in many other countries."
"Mr Schwab raised a very interesting question - that of whether we should have transitional deadlines for the conservation threshold values in Annex 6 that have been deleted as a consequence of the compromise between the parties."
"I can only say that the Commission does not have a problem with transitional deadlines."
"Personally, I believe they are essential and appropriate, but this omission in the law has not come about by chance."
"It is part of an overall compromise and, taking all the circumstances into account, I do not think it would have been proper for the Commission to allow the question of transitional deadlines for a few products to cause the compromise to fail."
"However, we will make sure that what the legislators wanted is achieved in an appropriate form."
"I share the concerns of those who have voiced their misgivings about animal testing."
"I very much hope that this legislation does not lead to an increase in the number of tests on animals."
"It is important that testing on primates is absolutely prohibited in connection with this legislation."
"I want to say again, emphatically, that the Commission will put all its energy into restricting animal testing as much as possible."
"For me, this means that we must keep increasing our efforts to find recognised alternative methods to replace animal testing."
"Everyone who has concerns about this will find me on their side."
"In conclusion, let me say that I believe that we have a piece of legislation before us that represents a 'win-win' situation for everyone involved."
"I am very grateful to everyone who contributed to it."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely satisfied with the debate that we have had."
"I would like to thank all of my fellow Members who have contributed today and I would also like to thank them for their words of support for the work that I carried out, which was only possible with their help, and with the help of the shadow rapporteurs and draftsmen of the opinions of the Committees on Industry, Research and Energy and the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"It seems that the vast majority of Members who spoke are satisfied with the results that we achieved."
"I welcome the view of the person who said that even the GHS is an ongoing process, and moreover it is a working method that we have established."
"In these situations it is precisely that and we are aware that the world will continue to change and develop and that is the reason why in this regulation, as in REACH and other regulations, we were careful to provide a very specific and precise regulatory framework and to leave room for future modification based on these criteria, although the criteria themselves are predetermined."
"This is what I understood from the Commissioner who spoke just before me on the possibility of endorsing part of the debate that has taken place."
"We are conscious of the fact that we are today ratifying a regulation that enjoys broad support, which will help bring benefits for consumers and workers in this sector, who represent the vast majority of the population."
"We know that these are rules that will be used as a framework and as an unquestionable and unassailable point of reference."
"Again, this is a constantly changing world, and with reference to these rules that will be handled by the Commission."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"The proposal for a decision enforcing the Globally Harmonised System of Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Chemicals (GHS) represents an important step in the protection of the environment, the consumers, who will have more power to choose, as well as of companies that want to enter the international market."
"The harmonised use of labels and the uniform description of dangers generated by chemicals ensure greater confidence of consumers in such products, also facilitating international trade, since industry shall be able to enforce the same labels for all the regions where it exports."
"Moreover, the harmonised system of classification of substances is an essential factor for ensuring the free movement of goods in the internal market."
"Nevertheless, we have to make sure that this regulation does not increase the number of tests on vertebrate animals for the purpose of harmonising the classification criteria, but that they shall be performed only if there are no alternative solutions guaranteeing the same quality."
"The Globally Harmonised System of Classification should allow the use of methods not involving tests on animals, even if their validation supposes a long and costly bureaucratic process."
"Since tests on animals have never been validated officially, the authentication of alternative tests seems a burden, but research in this field should be encouraged."
"in writing. - (DE) Increasingly frequently in the modern world, consumers come into contact with different substances, and sometimes also hazardous substances."
"When using some products, including those used daily by many, information about the substances they contain is vital if they are to be used safely and in a way that does not endanger health."
"The Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS), developed in 2002 at UN level with active participation by the EU, is to be implemented this year by all Member States."
"One of the main advantages of this system is the use of universal hazard pictograms."
"Consumers and traders can thus see at a glance whether a product contains certain substances that can also be dangerous."
"In addition, the GHS introduces standardised definitions, such as LD50 (lethal dose 50), that clearly indicate the hazard associated with the substance."
"The Community, and we in the European Parliament, have made it our goal to restrict animal testing for the purposes of assessing substances as much as we possibly can."
"Furthermore, the definitions have been stated more precisely and clearer guidelines worked out for the authorities in the Member States."
"Successful implementation of the GHS represents an important milestone in making the European internal market a reality and will also be of benefit in terms of international trade."
"Type-approval of hydrogen powered motor vehicles (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Anja Weisgerber, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on type-approval of hydrogen powered motor vehicles and amending Directive 2007/46/EC - C6-0342/2007 -."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, once again, we are talking about the car of the future - a topic that the European Parliament has already dealt with intensively this week in another connection."
"Today we are discussing a technical opportunity that may be able to help us solve the environmental problems caused by vehicles."
"Let me repeat: it is something that may be able to help us."
"We do not know whether its potential can be implemented on a large scale, but we should make the most of the opportunity."
"That is what this is all about."
"We all agree that sustainable mobility will be one of the key challenges that we will have to tackle in the years to come."
"We do not want to restrict the right of European citizens to individual mobility."
"On the other hand, there can be no doubt that this right to individual mobility - plainly speaking, the right to drive cars, to own and use a car - must be exercised in such a way that it does not destroy our environment, and that means that we need cars that do not harm the environment."
"A comment in passing: it is not just because of the state of the environment that this is essential and urgent; it is also becoming increasingly important in economic terms."
"The traditional internal combustion engine is out of date because fuel consumption is so high. We must do everything possible to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels wherever it occurs."
"Against this background, the question arises of whether we can facilitate the development of hydrogen powered vehicles."
"That is the idea that led to the suggestion made by the Commission, namely type-approval of hydrogen powered vehicles."
"I should like first to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Weisgerber, for her constructive, successful work on this proposal."
"I am delighted that, thanks to her work, agreement at first reading was possible."
"At this stage, we do not know which technology is best for sustainable mobility."
"If you read the newspapers and watch television, you are confronted with a different conclusion every day."
"While some talk of fuel cells, others enthuse about the electric car, and still others mention innovative high-performance batteries."
"There are many options to compete with hydrogen power; electric engines and fuel cells at the very least."
"Our task is to stipulate the necessary safety regulations for promising technologies while maintaining strict technological neutrality."
"Obviously, hydrogen is one of these technologies."
"Hydrogen can replace conventional fuel and make a sizeable reduction in the harmful effects of road traffic on the environment."
"However, I would like to add, in brackets, that all these considerations make sense only if we can produce hydrogen in an environmentally friendly way."
"If hydrogen is produced using dirty energy, then all we are doing is shifting the problem."
"The proposed regulation will integrate hydrogen powered vehicles into the European type-approval system."
"That way, hydrogen powered vehicles will be treated like traditional vehicles, in that a single permit will be sufficient for the entire European Union."
"This permit process is less cumbersome and much more affordable."
"Manufacturers can take care of all the formalities at a single point of contact, thus making considerable savings."
"This makes European industry more competitive and means less administrative hassle."
"Hydrogen has different properties to conventional fuels such as petrol and diesel, so the proposal makes a priority of determining the necessary safety requirements."
"In particular, we must ensure that storage of hydrogen in the vehicle is absolutely safe."
"This regulation will make all hydrogen powered vehicles put on EU roads as safe as conventionally powered vehicles."
"Hopefully this will also increase the public's faith in unfamiliar new technologies."
"The proposal also introduces a system for identifying the vehicles, so that they are easily recognised by rescue services."
"Close cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission has had a positive effect on the outcome of the negotiations, so that I can only agree with all the proposed modifications your rapporteur, Mrs Weisgerber, has made."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fossil fuels are finite."
"Demand is increasing, pushing prices up - we see that every day at the petrol station."
"The expectation that oil, natural gas and coal will run out in the future is one reason for the rising prices."
"Therefore, we need to start immediately to investigate technologies that could replace fossil fuels in the future."
"One of these alternatives - and the Commissioner quite rightly emphasised that it is only one, but it is an alternative - is hydrogen technology."
"Naturally, hydrogen vehicles are not yet ready for the market, but a variety of projects are under way to change that."
"The EU 'highways' project has just been completed, with an encouraging report."
"EU research ministers set up a long-term public-private partnership in February with the aim of getting hydrogen and fuel-cell technology ready for the market between 2015 and 2025."
"It is planned to invest a total of approximately EUR 940 million in this research programme in the next few years, with public authorities and private investors contributing half each."
"We see that the stage is set for hydrogen vehicles to be ready for the market."
"The fact that the price of fuel cells is still high cannot be used as an argument against hydrogen technology, as that is the way with all technologies of the future."
"The first 0.5 megapixel digital camera was developed many years ago for space travel and cost around EUR 10 million, but nowadays, almost everyone has a digital camera."
"The present regulation will, in the future, provide harmonised technical regulations for the approval of hydrogen powered vehicles throughout Europe for the first time."
"Unified criteria are essential if this technology is to be promoted and a high level of safety and environmental protection maintained."
"Hydrogen powered vehicles are not included in the EC type-approval system at present, so Member States can issue one-off permits for this type of vehicle."
"This is done in some Member States, but in others it is completely unknown."
"With permits being issued in this way, there is a risk that each Member State will set its own permit conditions and the internal market will be disrupted."
"This would lead to high costs for manufacturers as well as to safety risks."
"Hydrogen is one of the energy vectors of the future."
"Therefore, our task, which we are fulfilling by adopting this regulation, is to establish the political framework conditions for the use of this technology of the future by creating unified approval criteria."
"I am glad that, across the parties, we have managed to achieve agreement at first reading, and that the cooperation with the Council and the Commission was so good."
"My thanks for the excellent cooperation go therefore to the shadow rapporteurs; I would also like to mention Mr Bulfon and Mr Manders by name."
"That is what made agreement at first reading possible."
"Our focus was on the issue of labelling hydrogen powered vehicles."
"Hydrogen powered vehicles are just as safe as passenger cars powered by diesel or petrol."
"Under the regulation, they will have to pass safety tests that are just as strict as those for all other vehicles."
"However, it makes sense for rescue services to know if they are dealing with a hydrogen vehicle when they arrive at the scene of an accident, so that they can take certain details into account."
"This should not mean that hydrogen powered vehicles are viewed adversely because, as I have already said, they are just as safe as vehicles that run on other fuels."
"That is a very important point that I want to get across today."
"We therefore suggest that hydrogen vehicles should bear discreet labels on the components that contain hydrogen."
"Working with the Commission and the Council, we made further improvements to the Commission's text and substituted 'identification' for the word 'label', because in the long term, this label should and could be replaced by electronic identification that involves an intelligent emergency call system called 'eCall'."
"Other questions also arose."
"At the end, perhaps, I will return briefly to the question of hydrogen filling station infrastructure but for now, I am looking forward to the lively discussion and am eager to hear what you have to say."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (SL) I would like to thank my colleague Dr Weisgerber for her excellent report and express my satisfaction that we have reached such a high degree of consensus with the Council so quickly."
"This regulation puts us convincingly on the side of the new energy and environment policies, which will certainly have a positive effect on public health too."
"I agree with the Commissioner that we have to take full advantage of this opportunity."
"This regulation is one of the opening moves; it is part of the answer to contemporary energy and environmental challenges, where hydrogen plays one of the key roles."
"We do not mean just hydrogen alone, but hydrogen as well, and not just individual Member States, but the entire European Union."
"It is very important to engage correct dynamics to provide the entire implementation context."
"In this we should also take into account everything that our citizens are considering, starting with the infrastructure."
"The dynamism of development, and especially the problem of the rapid development of new technologies, is very important in this exceptionally demanding energy situation."
"I see very significant possibilities for the new technologies, in the sense that they enable the decentralised production of hydrogen to take place; also, if solar technology is involved, it is actually possible to disperse production of, and reduce dependency on, the currently known energy sources."
"It is my opinion that the Commission could successfully promote and accelerate development in this direction."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I want to warmly thank Anja Weisgerber as the rapporteur on behalf of the committee and, of course, as a member of my own group who, once again, I think, has shown her mastery of complex, technical dossiers, having also worked very effectively on a number of the emission dossiers as rapporteur for the opinion."
"But I am delighted now that she has her own report, and I congratulate her on the very thorough way that she has approached this important task."
"I know how much work is involved, having been the rapporteur myself on the overall Type Approval Directive."
"I also want to thank Günter Verheugen and his team in the Commission for moving very quickly and in a timely way to give us this important proposal, which will effectively incorporate into the master Type Approval Directive the specific requirements for hydrogen vehicles."
"I think, by the way, that shows the important of finally having now achieved this common type approval framework for motor vehicles, that we have the flexibility to be able to respond and include these new developments in it."
"In that connection, I just want to emphasise what a number of colleagues have said already, but particularly from my perspective, having worked with the Commission as a Member of this Parliament on the Cars 21 group, which was formed to put in place a competitive automotive regulatory strategy for the 21st century - that is what Cars 21 meant - and this is clearly a 21st-century proposal."
"But the important thing is that it gives the manufacturing industry - but not just the big manufacturers, the many companies who are involved in developing the systems and components that will help move forward the hydrogen-powered vehicles - it will give them a clear legislative framework within which to work now."
"They do not have to wait for it."
"That is a huge benefit, and it means that we will have one framework for Europe - one framework - and that means that, if you then comply with those requirements, you can sell your vehicle everywhere else."
"But, actually, this is not enough, and I am pleased that Anja has included in her report a specific request to the Commission to say, 'We want to make hydrogen vehicle safety requirements global requirements."
"Across the world people are working on hydrogen vehicle standards."
"It is absolutely the right time to put that into the global vehicle working party, because we should start as we mean to go on and have that set of global standards for hydrogen vehicles."
"At the same time, we want Europe to be a leader in developing those technologies, and we can achieve both with the foundation of this proposal."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, an EU-wide, unified permit procedure for hydrogen powered vehicles would overcome at least one of the barriers to the development of environmentally friendly forms of mobility."
"There are already several promising projects in the area of local public transport, which mean that series production of hydrogen powered passenger cars is not far away at all."
"However, we have to ask how the hydrogen will be obtained."
"Whether the final result, in terms of CO2, is favourable depends very much on how hydrogen will be produced in the future."
"It is no use if manufacturing it produces more CO2 than is saved by hydrogen power."
"At the same time, however, we must ensure that the appropriate filling station infrastructure is created and built, because even hydrogen powered cars have to be filled up."
"This is a challenge for the Member States, particularly."
"The clear guidelines in this report create a legal framework that facilitates the further development of this promising technology and many other innovations."
"The president of this Chamber, Mr Pöttering, has reported on hydrogen powered vehicles from his own experience."
"It would be worth considering using his experience to adapt Parliament's fleet accordingly - at least it is a suggestion worthy of consideration."
"Finally, I would like to thank Mrs Weisgerber most sincerely for her warm cooperation in the assembly and production of this report."
"in the name of the ALDE group. - (BG) The inclusion of hydrogen-driven vehicles in the overall normative framework of the European Community is of exceptional importance, because the currently existing statutory procedures on type approval do not guarantee that vehicles of identical quality can be released on the entire market of the European Union."
"The adoption of an European Union regulation would guarantee that all hydrogen-driven vehicles released on the market are manufactured, tested and identified in accordance with a common standard and that their safety level is at least the same as that of conventional motor vehicles."
"The common regulation would also guarantee alignment of the efforts to introduce hydrogen as a fuel in an energy sustainable manner so that the common environmental balance from the introduction of hydrogen as a fuel in the case of motor vehicles would be positive."
"The all-European regulation should also provide common requirements in respect to the monitoring of these motor vehicles and the necessary infrastructure - the fueling stations."
"The adoption of a regulation of the European Union would also guarantee application of the common standards in respect to the production and exploitation of hydrogen-driven vehicles manufactured in third countries - the United States, the Asian Economic Community - and would help defend the interests of Europe."
"Let me point out that at the lack of action at European Union level member-states would adopt differing standards in respect to hydrogen-driven vehicles, which will lead to an unfavourable situation concerning the common market, saving on costs as a result of large-scale production and delay in the development of the vehicles."
"At the moment when one, only one approval will suffice for each type of vehicle so that it could be released on the European Union market, EU member-states should open up for hydrogen-driven vehicles."
"Approval will accelerate the introduction of this environment-friendly technology powering vehicles, which in turn will allow the environmental benefits from using hydrogen-driven vehicles to appear sooner."
"Last, but not least, investment in the production of hydrogen-driven vehicles, of the materials for their manufacture and the means of their monitoring would receive additional impetus, which would contribute to the faster introduction of the hydrogen technology in European Union countries."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the introduction of hydrogen powered vehicles will have an impact on environmental and health protection and on the greenhouse effect, and is of political and economic significance given the shortage of traditional hydrocarbon fuels."
"The main step that needs to be taken so that they can be introduced is to establish a directive on type-approval of hydrogen powered motor vehicles."
"I have two comments to make concerning the draft directive and amendments."
"Firstly, the draft excludes the need to check the instructions for servicing and use when type-approval is being performed."
"Hydrogen fuel, with its very high energy value, is a particularly hazardous product, and vehicle users will be dealing with it for the first time."
"Secondly, the setting in the draft of a review date of one year from its establishment in order to give consideration to conclusions arising from its functioning and established international norms in this area."
"The Union for Europe of the Nations Group supports the introduction of the directive."
"I thank Mrs Weisgerber for a businesslike report."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, on reading the explanatory statement for the regulation under discussion, I was unpleasantly surprised."
"On the one hand, hydrogen allows for the storage of energy and, on the other hand, it practically eliminates a significant proportion of emissions."
"The Directive, however, provides for categorisation according to traditional systems."
"Put more simply, this involves the use of hydrogen through combustion."
"Apart from the problem of combustion of a methane-hydrogen mixture, something which I know about since my dissertation concerned combustion, it would be necessary for normal engines to also use urea to achieve clean combustion products in accordance with EURO 5 to 6 for the elimination of nitrogen oxides."
"One of the objectives of the European Union is to expand the use of hydrogen in transportation in the near future and there should be dramatic growth by 2020."
"It is true that the technical problems associated with the storage and handling of hydrogen require clear, unified regulations, including the labelling of systems working with hydrogen."
"I fully agree with the rapporteur on this."
"I should also like to point out that many countries prohibit parking vehicles with pressure vessels in enclosed spaces, especially underground car parks."
"Simple labelling is essential for this too."
"Hydrogen fuel cells are one of the promising experimental vehicle drive systems."
"Many cities in the European Union have long been operating buses using this energy source."
"I believe that the regulation under discussion will provide for the unification of the basic requirements for hydrogen powered motor vehicle equipment."
"I hope that it will provide a better framework for the further rapid development and operational verification of the different components of hydrogen vehicle systems."
"It should considerably speed up the practical usage of hydrogen cells in particular but hydrogen must not be widely used in 'traditional systems', in other words combustion engines, as this makes no sense to me."
"With this proviso, I warmly recommend approval of the document on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Weisgerber's report is a perfect example of they way European politics adapts to changing markets and moves quickly to create proactive standards and legal bases for technological innovations."
"The Council intends to deal with standardisation in a few months and draw conclusions on that."
"In that discussion, the questions of how quickly standards respond to technological progress, how quickly legislators respond to technological progress and how quickly standards adjust to economic reality will once again play a role."
"I believe that this report on type-approval of hydrogen powered vehicles will make Europe the trailblazer of a unified regulatory platform for the development of hydrogen powered vehicles."
"It is a valid point that it has still not been determined whether, in the end, the use of hydrogen as a fuel for vehicles will conform to the principle of sustainability and be ecologically sustainable, but nor can it be excluded yet."
"Therefore, I believe that, with this report, we are creating a good foundation for further research for the leading research institutes in the European internal market and particularly for the leading enterprises."
"This is particularly important given the background of the discussion on CO2 policy for vehicles and the desire to achieve greater diversity amongst the various technologies in order, ultimately, to establish with certainty which vehicle and which engine technology is best for the environment and for people."
"From the point of view of the internal market, I think we should particularly welcome this report, because a truly integrated internal market can be achieved only by harmonising type-approval of hydrogen powered vehicles in the different Member States to make the most of the synergy effects of this market."
"As was pointed out earlier on, any worldwide type-approval should naturally also be founded on this basis."
"We hope we will get it all sorted out."
"Wishing you every success!"
"Madam President, I would like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Weisgerber, and the shadows for producing this report and negotiating a very good agreement with the Council and the Commission, while preserving Parliament's priorities."
"At a time when petrol prices in Europe have doubled and citizens in Europe and people around the world are ever more concerned about the effects of climate change, it is clear that we need new hope for future fuels."
"This European-wide law on hydrogen-powered cars can pave the way for full-scale production of these cars and provide European drivers with real alternatives in the not too distant future."
"Sales of alternative-fuel vehicles, for example, in the United Kingdom alone have grown from just a few hundred in the year 2000 to over 16 000 last year."
"Sales of electric cars and other alternatives have soared, but hydrogen cars are only on the cusp of large-scale production."
"I believe that this new law will boost the development of these vehicles, while ensuring they are reliable and safe."
"With the help of the law, mass production is now predicted to start in Europe by 2015, with around 5% of total EU road stock set to be hydrogen-powered by 2025."
"The environmental benefits of hydrogen cars will depend on the energy source used to produce the hydrogen."
"They can directly tackle air pollution caused by petrol and will reduce our dependence on oil, but they will only help tackle global warming if hydrogen is produced in a sustainable way."
"That is why I strongly back Mrs Weisgerber's negotiated amendments to ensure hydrogen fuel is produced sustainably and, as far as possible, from renewable energy."
"It is important to stress that hydrogen-powered cars can be just as safe as those that run on petrol and, in the event of an accident, emergency crews need to know what they are dealing with."
"That is why Mrs Weisgerber has ensured that vehicles will be readily identifiable by emergency services."
"This legislation does what only the European Union can do in a strong internal market. It ensures a European-sized market for goods with common rules and high safety requirements."
"It is this market that is capable of producing the hydrogen cars of the future and I believe this law today, when we vote for it, is crucial to achieving that goal."
"(LT) The Commission proposal on type-approval of hydrogen powered motor vehicles is very important for solving the problems related to the search for alternative vehicle fuels, environmental protection, climate change and people's health."
"I would like to draw your attention to a few issues that are of great importance in the development of hydrogen powered vehicles."
"Firstly, the main problem of hydrogen powered vehicles lies not in the vehicle manufacturing process itself, but in refuelling."
"So far there are only about 40 hydrogen filling stations in the whole of Europe."
"There are two such filling stations in France, for example, and one in Spain, while there are none at all in the new Member States that joined the European Union in 2004 and 2007."
"In the United States, only California has a significant number."
"That is why I agree with the speaker that it is necessary to create a standardised hydrogen filling station network across the whole of the EU as soon as possible."
"Without appropriate infrastructure, hydrogen powered vehicles will remain unitary."
"Secondly, hydrogen is merely an energy carrier, not an energy source, and that is why it is important that hydrogen fuel is produced in a stable and environmentally friendly way."
"We need to be more active in carrying out scientific research that would lead to avoidance of the use of fossil fuels and suggest alternative methods of splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen."
"One such method could be photolysis, although thorough scientific research still needs to be carried out here."
"Furthermore, pollution-free hydrogen production would allow it to be used in areas outside transport."
"Thirdly, I agree with the Commissions proposal to use mixtures of natural gas and hydrogen, but only as a transition fuel and only in countries that have a well-developed natural gas infrastructure."
"I would also like to emphasise that the United States and Canada are leading the way in the field of development and manufacture of hydrogen powered vehicles, while Japan is catching up, and we ourselves should not fall further behind."
"(PL) Madam President, a future with hydrogen powered cars is an exciting prospect."
"Although much time has yet to pass before this technology is widely applied, it is nevertheless of exceptional importance that the regulations on their type-approval are harmonised now."
"The principal objective of the regulation we are looking at today is to introduce EU criteria for the type-approval of hydrogen powered vehicles in order to ensure the proper functioning of the market."
"The different type-approval criteria in individual Member States are currently hampering the functioning of this market, causing an unnecessary rise in production costs, threatening safety and - something we must not forget - constituting a significant barrier to the development of hydrogen technology in the EU."
"In particular, we must not allow this point to pass us by because hopes for the substitution of oil in the transport sector lie specifically with hydrogen, along with biofuels and electricity."
"Perhaps the most important thing, however, is that the process of hydrogen combustion gives rise not to carbon dioxide, a substance that is still harmful to the environment, but to water, with the obvious consequence being to cut down on air pollution and reduce CO2 emissions, something to which we are devoting a great deal of effort, not least within the forum of the European Parliament."
