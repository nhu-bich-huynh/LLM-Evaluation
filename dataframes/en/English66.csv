"Text"
"To paraphrase Mr Juncker, the European Council was not a failure of the Presidency, but a failure of Europe."
"It was a huge disappointment."
"The citizens expected a strong message, but received a response that was devoid of quality, of ambition and of a rallying idea."
"The Union thus missed out on a unique opportunity to convey an image of strong, unified leadership."
"European leaders were not equal to the task that history had set them."
"National interests prevailed over the Union’s values and selfishness spoke louder than solidarity."
"Let us now take this opportunity to look for answers to the citizens’ questions, such as: What is Europe’s role in the world?"
"How do we increase productivity and competitiveness in a globalised world?"
"How do we reduce unemployment?"
"How do we implement social cohesion?"
"What social model should we follow?"
"Europe may be at a crossroads, but history teaches us that it is at times of crisis that the best transformations can be effected."
"Let us hope that we prove capable of transforming difficulties into opportunities."
"The world has changed and the citizens’ concerns and needs have changed."
"The EU must keep up and must begin by forging a new relationship with the citizens."
"Change does not mean changing something so that everything remains the same, as one of Lampedusa’s characters suggested – that would be a confidence trick."
"Europe can live without a Constitutional Treaty, but it is doubtful whether it could live without agreement on the Financial Perspective."
"Europe must be a political Union, an area of cohesion and solidarity, and not merely a free trade area."
"This is the challenge facing the forthcoming Presidency, which I hope is capable of giving us a pleasant surprise."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I rise to put the case for proactive reflection rather than turning round and going back."
"We are glad that Europe can again breathe with two lungs."
"In the Council, there appear to be those who are playing the ‘new for old’ and ‘future not past’ cards."
"While this House adopts the Constitutional Treaty by a two-thirds majority, there is no shortage of Heads of Government who cannot get a majority for more democracy, citizens’ rights and transparency in their own countries."
"While the European Parliament, out of the desire to make the European Union more effective, efficient and economical, adopts the Financial Perspective, there are Heads of Government sitting on the Council who disregard their own decisions, ignore treaties, undermine the common goal of developing the European Union further into a political union and fail to abide by the rules of the institutions, believing as they do that they can cope on their own."
"I get the impression that there are too many for whom mass appeal in their own countries is more important than their responsibility to the Community, who prefer to blame others rather than share responsibility and opt for egoism rather than solidarity."
"If you want to regain the public’s confidence in the European project as a success story, you cannot make them believe things, you cannot take them for mugs or ignore their worries and fears; instead, you have to meet them halfway, tell them how things are, do what you have decided to do and keep to what you have agreed."
"If you want to put an end to double standards behind padded doors, you have to give parliaments more of a say in decision-making processes and say a resounding yes to the Constitutional Treaty."
"If you want to replace egoism with solidarity, you have to contend for the social market economy."
"If you want to stop the majority being held to ransom by the minority, you have to want a stronger Europe of citizens and parliaments."
"More and more, I come to the conclusion that all those who are really serious about seeking political union and putting this continent in a stronger position on the world stage really must be committed to thinking, designing and implementing the federal state, the united states of Europe."
"Mr President, Mr Juncker, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking President Juncker for the way in which he reported on this European Council."
"I think that it was a great moment to hear a description of the work of the European Council, in application of the concept of transparency."
"It was very useful for such a report to be given in this House."
"I thank him, too, for the conclusions to which he managed to bring the European Council with regard to ratification of the Constitution."
"I think that each population is free to decide whether or not it wants to continue with this process."
"In addition, a pause is vital because what can we do when a question is asked and we do not have the answer?"
"Nobody yet knows what the French or Dutch will say in future, on what text, under what conditions."
"It is a question that is still ahead of us."
"I would, however, like to give certain speakers and perhaps the Members of the Commission or others a warning."
"Saying that there is a problem of communication, and that it is because of this communication problem that two referenda resulted in a ‘no’, is a mistake. It is to imagine that the citizens do not understand."
"That is what this argument implies."
"I think that the citizens knew perfectly well what they were doing when they voted, and claiming that they voted the wrong way because they did not understand is, in a way, advocating a return to selective suffrage."
"I do not imagine that anyone in this House would call for such a development."
"On the issue of the budget, I think that the Luxembourg Presidency has tried everything."
"The question is not really whether we are faced with national egos."
"It is whether we want to continue with a strategy of going the extra mile and of European added value."
"For this reason, we need to establish whether or not this terrible logic of a fair return, which was instituted by Mrs Thatcher several years ago and clearly continues to be favoured by some, must finally be sent back to the drawing board."
"In that respect, I think, Mr Juncker, that you have made some good proposals. We must continue with this debate."
"What I think is a shame is that, in the end, the grand ambitions of the Lisbon Strategy will not be served by the financial perspectives they need."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the failure of the summit and, not least, the circumstances surrounding it, are symptomatic of the deep crisis that we are in, and which has been precipitated by the dramatic way in which the public have denied us their allegiance."
"That much is apparent from what the voters in France and the Netherlands have done, and in doing it they surely represent many others."
"Their motivations as individuals may differ, but what underlies them can be found throughout the European Union."
"If we are to regain the public’s confidence, we have to bring about a change in direction and a change in European politics."
"I have only a few comments to make on this."
"For a start, we do not want a constitution."
"The mere term ‘constitution’ is redolent of a European superstate; nobody wants one, and we are not even trying to build one."
"What we do need, though, and urgently, is a basic agreement setting out how decisions are to be taken in the European Union, and how the institutions – Council, Parliament and Commission – relate to one another."
"We need the Charter of Fundamental Rights in an agreed form."
"Such are the essential elements of what we need, and of what will enable us to organise and manage a Union of 25 or even more Member States in an orderly fashion."
"We have to enable the public to understand and get a handle on enlargement, and that means that Europe needs borders."
"A halt must be called to the process of enlargement until such time as we have consolidated the last additions, and I would also point out that most people in Europe would feel themselves affronted if the accession negotiations with Turkey were to start on 3 October."
"What is needed is a privileged partnership with Turkey, rather than for it to become a Member State."
"My final point is that a new culture of subsidiarity is called for in the Commission’s bureaucracy."
"The Commission must give thought to how many regulations have to be enacted in Brussels and about the point at which the Member States should assume responsibility."
"Mr President, Council, Commissioner Wallström, ladies and gentlemen, when you took over the Presidency in Luxembourg, you had to deal with a natural disaster in the form of the tsunami."
"Now, you are concluding your Presidency with a summit that has produced neither decisions on the budget nor a new treaty."
"Unfortunately, few people talk about the excellent foreign policy decisions taken."
"Thank you for all you have achieved."
"During its period of office, Luxembourg has ensured that Bulgaria and Romania will become Members and that Turkey will be allowed to begin negotiations in October."
"You have made history, and I would thank you for that."
"Europe is emphatically not in crisis, because the debate is most certainly not now about countries wanting to leave the EU."
"Rather, what has emerged from the referenda is that people want the EU to do more of the right things and the Council to concentrate on the right things, a state of affairs that would be better for the future."
"People want us to be clearer about the objectives, that is to say more jobs, a proper state of affairs in the labour market, social responsibility, international solidarity, the fight against crime, sustainable development and gender equality."
"At long last, we are obtaining a debate in our Member States about the future in which Europeans now wish to participate."
"It is not enough for ourselves here in Brussels to do lots of good things if no one knows about what we are doing or takes any notice of it"
"I am hopeful and I look forward to a lively debate, but this time involving everyone who wishes to participate."
"Let us not therefore wear sackcloth and ashes, be issued with yellow cards or be depressed."
"We should pause for thought but not be passive."
"Let us challenge people and call for them to be committed and to provide answers to questions as guidance on how we want the EU to develop."
"We need to listen more and talk less."
"That is difficult for us politicians, but it would mean that we should emerge strengthened from this period of reflection."
"Finally, the debate is about politics and the future and objectives of the EU, and it is something I welcome."
"Mr President, while we, along with everyone else, regret that no financial agreement has been reached, I think that we should also consider the positive aspects."
"After all, a large majority of this House has spoken out in favour of cutting back where possible but also investing where necessary, which was also the thrust of the Böge report."
"In the Council too, the differences have become more negligible than many people had thought possible."
"I appreciate the presidency’s efforts in this respect and also what Mr Juncker said, namely that he tried to reach out to the Netherlands even further."
"I am not saying this for selfish reasons, but only to indicate that a country such as the Netherlands does not mind paying up."
"If, however, newspapers carry reminders, year in and year out, that the Dutch contribute many times more than other rich countries, then the Netherlands, having been a pro-European country, will eventually end up being sceptical."
"The Netherlands will soon need to get back on track in a referendum, and we must all find our bearings again."
"We must also learn from those referenda."
"There were many reasons for the no-vote."
"Something that definitely played a role is a certain fear among people of how fast enlargements are carried out and of where they will stop."
"We must explain in more specific terms that enlargements are not detrimental to us, but beneficial and what they have brought us."
"We must also ensure that the enlargement processes that are currently underway remain credible."
"That means that not only the position of candidate Member States must be taken seriously, but also the criteria we prescribed in respect of enlargements, and that guarantees must be put in place to this effect."
"We all carry some of the responsibility in this, not least with regard to the criterion that Europe must be able to handle the enlargements."
"We have not had an easy time of it, and if anyone was able to cope, it was this President of the Council, Mr Juncker, and his team."
"It is impressive how he, time and again, underlined the idea that Europe is about cooperation, is more than just a free trade area, not only in his work and during negotiations, but also here today when he reminded us about the end of the Second World War sixty years ago with all the empathy one would expect."
"I told Mr Juncker a moment ago that he is a leader of a small country but a big leader in Europe, and I am convinced that, if we carry on as he has begun, we will soon harvest what the Luxembourg Presidency has sowed during this difficult time."
"I thank you, I thank the Presidency, and let us continue the good work."
"The ease with which Europe stumbled into crisis sends a very disturbing message, namely that peace and progress in Europe are regarded by people and their political leaders as something self-evident, but they are not."
"If it is true that they depend on an increasing cohesion of European nations, of their mutuality and solidarity, then all of us who believe in the European idea must, at this very time of crisis, place in much sharper focus the dilemma we now face."
"Will we be capable of giving the idea of political union some new impetus, some new inspiration, and can we move ahead, or will we be content merely with a common market, and in this sense take a step backwards?"
"Almost twenty years ago now, it was determined correctly that a common market alone could not provide an adequate response to the challenging issues facing Europe."
"And twenty years later this idea can respond to these needs so much less."
"If we have therefore found ourselves in a crisis, then I propose that we do not resolve it with some minor corrections, but rather that we focus back on the fundamental issues."
"This includes – and I do not advocate the approach of Prime Minister Blair, although I would like to draw attention to a certain position of his which seems to me relevant to our deliberation over this future – whether from the aspect of the Lisbon objectives it is right for us to allocate almost half of the Union’s entire budget to agriculture, while we are so effortlessly willing to cut financing for the fundamental measures and instruments of the Lisbon strategy: science, education and technology."
"I believe that these are the relevant, fundamental issues that we should now be addressing."
"And the more courageously we respond to these issues, the greater our chances will be of finding a good solution to the bind in which we find ourselves."
"Mr President, discouragement and determination are two words that begin with ‘d’ and which I believe accurately reflect the feelings of Mr Juncker today and of many Members of this House: discouragement in view of what happened at the European Summit, determination to face the future: discouragement, because Mr Juncker, on describing the debate on the financial perspectives to us, sounded like an auditor heading a team of accountants."
"And I would put the question: who was talking about Europe when the financial perspectives were being negotiated?"
"Nobody talked about Europe."
"Everybody talked about their national interests."
"Actually that is not true, Mr President: some people talked about Europe, those we call the ‘new countries’ talked about Europe, the countries of the last enlargement."
"I believe that, if there has been an example of vision and ambition at this Summit the vision and ambition that has always characterised Europeanism then that example has been given by the new countries."
"I therefore propose that we stop calling them ‘new countries’, because they have shown that they do not need to take lessons in Europeanism from anybody."
"Like Mr Lamassoure, I too believe that we will certainly have to reflect upon the system of own resources."
"We tried that in the Convention — some of you will remember — but there was no way of introducing anything. In fact, there was a small group in the European Convention considering how to introduce a new system of own resources into the Constitution."
"We will have to return to this issue."
"With regard to the Constitution, Mr President, I believe that what is going to happen in practice, which is the suspension of the referenda, is a good thing: this is not the right time to hold more referenda and we must dedicate ourselves to debate."
"I therefore believe that the idea of establishing the end of the Austrian Presidency as the time for relaunching the process is a good one and I believe that this Parliament must begin to consider what it is going to do in the future."
"In this respect, the resolution that will be voted on tomorrow contains a clause that moves in that direction and I believe that it conforms to that ‘d’ for determination that Mr Juncker urged us to show and that I am sure this Parliament will agree with."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Luxembourg on three things: firstly, on having defended the European Constitution during its Presidency of the Council firmly and with determination, which it signed, like the governments of the other 24 Member States, on 29 October 2004."
"Secondly, on having maintained its referendum."
"And thirdly, because Mr Juncker spoke very clearly yesterday, at the summit with the United States, when he used a phrase that filled me with pride and emotion: ‘Europe is not on its knees’."
"That is more or less what those of us, for example, who represented this Parliament as observers during the Lebanese elections that ended this weekend, said: Europe exists and furthermore it is useful, not just for the Europeans, but also for the rest of the world."
"We should reflect, I agree, but to what end?"
"So that we can remain in limbo, so that we can go backwards, have less Europe, come to a halt and ultimately allow the rhythm of the world to overtake us?"
"No, not for that reason: we must reflect so that we can continue to make progress, that is to say, to bring the European Constitution into being."
"I believe that we must state very clearly that, if we believe that the European Constitution is good, it must not be renegotiated and that, however long it may take, the citizens must express their opinion on it, either directly or by means of their parliaments."
"I would like to remind you, Mr President, that it is not the case that there have only been two referenda so far and that they have both said ‘no’: there have been three referenda: the first was in my country, with 77.7% voting in favour of the European Constitution."
"In fact, if we add up the ‘yes’ votes and the ‘no’ votes in the referenda held to date, there are more ‘yes’ votes than ‘no’ votes, and far more countries have said yes to the European Constitution than no."
"But we are facing the usual problem: a genuine debate between Eurosceptics and Europeanists, between those who want more Europe and those who want less Europe."
"I am one of those who want more Europe and I therefore believe, from the point of view of the left, that what the citizens want is more and better Europe, a more democratic and more efficient Europe."
"And that is why we need this Constitution, which is a point of balance, but above all a point of progress."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to return to what President Barroso said, I would first of all like to say thank you to Mr Juncker and his team."
"I congratulate the Luxembourg Presidency on having been, for almost six months, a good Presidency, I could say a full Presidency, without a moment’s rest, a committed Presidency, a political Presidency and an effective Presidency."
"True, the last Council did not give the results we were hoping for, but Mr Juncker has given us a clear explanation of the content of the negotiations, of the British rebate and of the funding of the common rural policy, which represents, I would remind you, just 0.4% of the EU’s GDP."
"We were a few millimetres from agreement, when the Presidency and the Commission had succeeded in getting most of the delegations to move kilometres, and that is really something to regret."
"I think that there is one subject on which the Council has been particularly discreet, to a certain extent appropriately, and that is the subject of enlargement."
"I, though, would like to be a little less discreet by saying that it is clear that this Presidency, up to the end of June, and the next one will have to ask themselves whether, with regard to the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey, we can make it seem that, and act as if, nothing had changed since December 2004, as if Turkey had not slackened its efforts, as if Europe had produced a Constitution and as if it had produced a budget: it has no Constitution, it has no budget and Turkey has slackened its efforts."
"Therefore, I would say very clearly that I think that, at the moment, we are not meeting the Copenhagen criterion on the ability of the EU to take on new members without losing momentum, and I would simply say, Mr President, that it would send a very strong signal if we said to the people: Europe is taking its destiny back into its own hands by being able to state where its borders are."
"– Mr President, it has been said that the small countries are organising and setting their seal on the big presidencies of the European Union with their work."
"This was confirmed in the most decisive manner by the Luxembourg Presidency, by Mr Juncker personally and by the foreign ministers, Mr Asselborn and Mr Schmit."
"The European cycle gave the Presidency to Luxembourg at a particularly critical turn on the path towards European unification."
"Following the negative referenda in France and the Netherlands, the European Union is now in a state of institutional, political and strategic crisis."
"This crisis was confirmed and reinforced by the breakdown of the European Council, despite the brave and honourable efforts made by the Luxembourg Presidency to broker a reasonable compromise on the subject of the new financial perspectives."
"At this European Council, it was not only political will that was lacking."
"Unfortunately, there was a serious lack of political leadership and management of European developments."
"It is a European Council of political confusion and political cowardice, as the conclusions record."
"It is a European Council of the deconstruction and deregulation of the objective of deepening European integration."
"It is a European Council of the deconstruction of political union and social cohesion."
"It is a European Council typified by the fear of the leaders in the face of the fear of the citizens."
"A typical example is the reference to the enlargement procedure."
"As the fabricated fear of enlargement affected the ratifying process in France and the Netherlands, it was judged expedient to dedicate literally two lines, almost hidden away in the conclusions, to a strategic plan to foster peace, security, stability, development and, more importantly, the political and social democratisation of the candidate countries."
"A strategic plan which gave people hope of breaking out of the vicious circle of underdevelopment and autocracy and putting European principles and values into practice."
"This strategic plan, which made the European Union a strong, international factor, is not defended by anyone today in the face of the fear cultivated by the more conservative and xenophobic political forces in Europe."
"The Luxembourg Presidency was lucky to have institutional backing for its difficult task from the European Parliament."
"At the same time, however, it was unlucky to have next to it a cowardly and weak President of the European Commission with no political vision."
"To close, I must say that, above all, the Luxembourg Presidency had the courage to go ahead with the referenda in these difficult times."
"Mr President, last week’s European Council was a clear reminder that the European Union cannot carry on with business as usual following the French and Dutch votes on the Constitution."
"The decision to pause for reflection on the Constitution merely underlines a lack of direction across Europe."
"When two founding Member States reject the Constitution with no expectation of holding a second vote, it is hard to see the logic of continuing the ratification process."
"We would have preferred the Council to have acted decisively, accepted the will of the voters and moved on."
"Of course there still is a time for a real debate about Europe’s future."
"Like the British Government, we believe that Europe must face up to some profound questions."
"The move to political integration has reached its high water mark."
"It is against this backdrop that, with respect, I have to disagree with the President-in-Office when he said that he did not believe the French or the Dutch voters rejected the constitution."
"Such statements damage the relationship between politicians and the people, and if ever there was a time for politicians to demonstrate that they are listening, it is now."
"It would be folly for Europe’s leaders just to ignore the reality of what has happened."
"This crisis was avoidable: for many years my party has argued for a more flexible Europe."
"For too long the European integration process has carried on as a project of the political elite."
"That is now over and we, the representatives of the people, are now charged with conducting further debate on the kind of Europe we want to see."
"Those of us who have opposed that integration process have often been criticised, and many in this Chamber believe it is the only way forward, but it is not."
"In the coming months we will argue positively and enthusiastically for a different kind of Europe that goes with the grain of public opinion and not against it; a Europe that gets away from the obsessions of the past and moves forward with the people’s real agenda, which is jobs, growth and prosperity."
"That is the way to re-engage the electorate with the European Union."
"I regret that on this occasion the Council failed to show the necessary leadership."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Juncker and his dedicated political colleagues in his excellent diplomatic and civil service on the job they have done over the last six months."
"He has demonstrated, yet again, that it is quality and vision that count in the construction of Europe."
"I would also like to express my admiration for the new Member States, for their solidarity and forward-looking effort to avoid the breakdown of the budget negotiations."
"As has been said repeatedly, they are not the cause of the problems of Europe."
"They in fact give us far more and offer us far more in terms of a peaceful, secure and prosperous future than we can offer them."
"I would also like to remind the House that 28 states – not 25 – participated in the Convention and that at least Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania should be included in any debate now about the future of Europe."
"I believe that if they are going to be full members of this Union within a number of years then they have a right to participate in debating what kind of Europe we are going to have."
"Today Mr Juncker gave us a master class in transparency, frankness and humanity."
"This is the kind of politics that the people of Europe are crying out for and I would urge this House to insist that from tomorrow onwards all presidencies and all Commissioners meet with the standards set by Mr Juncker today."
"My group leader, Mr Schulz, has launched a five-point European agenda which seeks to kick-start the process of re-establishing the self-confidence of Europeans."
"I would like to ask Mr Juncker in the remaining days of his presidency, Mr Borrell and Mr Barroso, to support that initiative and demonstrate to the people of Europe that we have a future together."
"We must ensure that we do not leave the people of Europe to the likes of Mr Bonde and his ilk in other parts of Europe."
"It would be a betrayal of the sweat and blood of our parents and grandparents and the lessons that they learned from having a divided Europe; from having a Europe which is locked behind its own sovereign borders, unable to share power and unable to share a future together."
"– Mr President, my speech will be shorter, as Mr Juncker has already mentioned many of the questions I wished to express an opinion on in his very honest and comprehensive speech."
"That is why I should like to convey to him a personal thank you and also thank the entire Luxembourg presidency for its extremely important work."
"It is a great pity that the success that we had hoped for is still to be achieved."
"Now some words on the essence of the problem."
"Evidently, our electors, our people still do not understand that we face new challenges."
"If it was perhaps the case a few decades ago that we still had the Berlin Wall, we still had the cold war, and that this perhaps instinctively united people and allowed them to take common decisions more easily and to vote for them, none of that is present now."
"Perhaps people still do not perceive or understand this new challenge, this global competition that Europe faces, and not just every one individually, but Europe as a whole."
"That is why this medicine, this Constitutional Treaty, is essential."
"That is why it is also essential to look at what are Europe’s values; and Europe’s values today are obviously its people, for we have to take into account the demographic situation, which unfortunately is not a progressive one for Europe."
"I know that it is not progressive for my nation, but neither is it progressive for the whole of Europe."
"If we are becoming fewer, then every individual must be of a higher quality."
"Therefore our chief task is to invest in people, in people’s education; that is our future."
"Mr President, the European crisis that has resulted from two referenda is a clear indication that the political elite is not in touch with the people."
"There is such an enormous difference between the propaganda and reality that the voters have stopped listening."
"If, for example, solidarity towards the new Member States is nothing more than a mention in a speech in honour of a special occasion, the people do not need to believe anything else that is said."
"The mood now is that a referendum can be organised on any issue at all, and the answer will always be no."
"The leaders of nations have only themselves to blame."
"They lack the courage to tell the electorate that there is no alternative to globalisation, and that it cannot be opposed through political decisions, but that we could adapt to it by taking the right decisions."
"The same leaders, who in speeches complain that the Lisbon strategy is very much late in coming, allow a situation where not even the decisions agreed in one country are implemented in their own."
"Instead, Brussels is blamed for the problems and setbacks."
"Referenda are not entirely appropriate as a tool of pan-European decision-making."
"National governments and parliaments should have the courage to make the necessary decisions."
"Explaining and justifying European policy is always a local issue, if we want people to understand our good intentions."
"In the end, however, the bills for our common decisions are paid for out of national budgets, and, consequently, only the French Government can explain to its citizens with any credibility that the position of agriculture in this continent has changed, and only the British can make their own citizens understand that the rebate Britain receives on its EU contributions originated in former times and in different circumstances."
"The polarisation of Europe we are currently witnessing is a result of the EU’s financial crisis, which in turn has been triggered by its institutional crisis."
"It would appear that Europe risks being divided into two camps; on the one side advocates of closer political integration combined with efforts to achieve a more social Europe, and on the other supporters of a Europe limited to the single market, with a looser institutional framework."
"The point I should like to stress is that the EU’s future is not a matter of choosing between these two approaches."
"The EU must continue to move towards a more stable institutional framework, just as it must reform its budget and concentrate its resources on areas that will allow us to compete on a global scale."
"The incoming British presidency has gained considerable popularity in Central Europe as a result of its efforts to drive forward financial reform and economic modernisation."
"Yet such efforts must not go hand in hand with a weakening of the institutions."
"Similarly, there is public support for France and Germany’s attempts to achieve closer political integration, but not if this involves inefficient welfare systems and protectionist approaches being set in stone."
"We must settle the political dispute over economic and social strategies within the bounds of the existing institutional playing field."
"The EU will not find a way out of its current crisis if it tries to lay down its institutional framework at the same time as deciding on the content of specific policies."
"In other words, it must not attempt to mark out the playing field while deciding who has scored how many goals in which net."
"The incoming presidency has a unique chance to make its attempts to reform the EU’s budget and economy more credible, namely by ensuring that its first objective is to achieve a more stable institutional framework on the basis of Parts One and Two of the Constitution."
"I too should like to start with a few words of thanks."
"I should like to thank the Luxembourg presidency for its work, which has been both highly professional and of first-rate quality."
"I should also like to thank the President-in-Office of the European Council, Jean-Claude Juncker."
"Although he comes from a small country, Mr Juncker is a great statesman and a great politician, and he has demonstrated quite clearly that small and medium-sized countries can also play a large role in Europe."
"In order to do so, they must remain true to the ideas that underpinned the gradual construction of Europe after the Second World War."
"I refer to such ideas as Europeanism, solidarity and the placing of European interests before individual, and often selfish, national interests."
"It is my belief that Jean-Claude Juncker will always serve as a fine example, in particular for the new Member States, or in other words the small and medium-sized countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"I should also like to congratulate the Luxembourg presidency on the solution which it put forward to the problems surrounding ratification of the European Constitution, and which enables those Member States that so desire to continue the ratification process."
"I believe that the people of Luxembourg will vote ‘yes’ in the referendum to be held on 10 July."
"I hope that politicians in other countries, including my own country, the Czech Republic, will be equally courageous and allow their citizens to take part in referenda."
"I should like to raise one final issue that has not yet been touched upon, namely EU enlargement."
"Accession treaties were signed with Bulgaria and Romania during the Luxembourg presidency."
"In common with the majority of Members of this House, I supported this move, and despite the events in France and the Netherlands, I still believe that it was absolutely the right one."
"Regardless of the problems we are facing, we should not ignore the fact that the unification of Europe is in the interests of Europe as a whole, and in the interests of our history."
"Last year’s enlargement demonstrated that the problem does not lie with the new Member States, since they are acting with the utmost responsibility, whether with regard to ratification of the Constitution or to last weekend’s summit."
"I believe that Romania and Bulgaria will act equally responsibly after they join in 2007 or 2008."
"Mr President, I would like to make three points."
"The first point is that we should not blame Luxembourg; quite the contrary: it did an excellent job with the presidency and showed what small countries can do while running presidencies in general."
"The speech today from Jean-Claude Juncker was one of the best that we have heard in this House for many years."
"Secondly, we need a positive vision."
"I am sick and tired of listening to everyone blaming everyone, coming up with scapegoats."
"The two worst scapegoats that I have heard so far are firstly enlargement and secondly the liberalisation of markets."
"I do not think the results of the two referenda or the European Council should mean that we close the borders of Europe and stop competitiveness."
"Quite the contrary: the best thing that has happened to us in the past ten years are the last two rounds of enlargement."
"We must avoid protectionism and we must avoid nationalism."
"The third and final point that I wanted to make is that in Europe we now have a leadership vacuum."
"It is clear that France and Germany are no longer the engine of Europe."
"Someone needs to come and pick up the pieces and drive things forward."
"In the media it seems that Tony Blair would be the person."
"If Tony Blair is the person, he needs to do two things."
"Firstly, he needs to argue for more, not less Europe."
"Secondly, he needs to combine this with economic reform."
"If he can do this he can grab the leadership vacuum, but unfortunately what we have seen and heard from Tony Blair when he has tried to get into the heart of Europe in the past is something that can be called ‘NATO’: ‘no action, talk only’."
"Mr President, sadly, I do not believe that the statements given here today deliver on the expectations of our citizens."
"They do little to restore the credibility of the EU as a global player."
"Furthermore they will not deliver on a forward-thinking budget that the 21st century EU requires."
"The opportunity to overhaul the EU budget and to leave behind the antiquated system has, I believe, been missed both by the Commission and the Council."
"We are now faced with a budget where the only flagship policy is agriculture."
"This does little to captivate the imagination and aspirations of those we serve and has huge anomalies – not least vis-à-vis Luxembourg, the richest EU country and, at the same time, the largest net beneficiary."
"The Europe of today needs to face up to the challenges ahead and we need to learn this lesson now."
"Our citizens want us to create a better Europe, which means more economic growth and employment stability."
"Therefore, Mr President-in-Office, how can you justify cuts in the very areas that people want in terms of research funding, growth and jobs?"
"Clearly we are not listening or delivering on our citizens’ priorities."
"Finally, with regard to transparency, many people are asking why these talks are taking place behind closed doors."
"I suggest that if the Council wants to connect with the people out there, then it should leave these doors open and let the citizens hear the debate."
"All I can say is that I hope the UK presidency will make this its number one priority."
"Roll on the British presidency!"
"– Mr President, having congratulated the Prime Minister of Luxembourg and the other members of the Presidency, I should like to comment on the two points which dominated the last meeting of the European Council."
"Point one: procedure for ratifying the Constitution."
"The entry into a period of rethinking is bringing to the surface creative material for institutional, political and strategic self-criticism."
"My question to the Vice-President of the Commission is this: how does the Commission intend to address citizens' criticism about over-regulation and the excessive technicality of legislative proposals?"
"Seriously, what has become of the White Paper on European governance?"
"My question to the President-in-Office of the Council is this: is there sufficient consultation of and information for civil society before and after the adoption of decisions by the Council?"
"My question to the President of the European Parliament is this: will the European Parliament be equal to its important role as a political body, as a forum for creative discussion of the stated will of the people, of the ?"
"The only way out of the constitutional and political crisis is to establish a permanent, transparent and democratic dialogue with civil society."
"If the constitutional crisis is not resolved by 2007, then we will need to move either towards a constitutional review or in the direction of 'Nice plus' or, finally, towards the option of reinforced cooperation."
"Τhe second point refers to the financial perspectives: we are being called upon to realise that ambitious objectives require the necessary financial resources."
"Enlargement also requires enlarged resources."
"The restoration of the historic and political unity of Europe brings to the surface new definitions of cohesion policy, a policy which signals, as a horizontal principle for the old and new Member States, a Europe of stability, of solidarity and of social prosperity."
"It is to this eminent political position that the common agricultural policy aspires."
"Like many of my colleagues, I would like to begin by thanking Luxembourg's Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Council and his colleagues."
"I awaited the results of the European Council in Vilnius, Lithuania, and watched Mr Juncker's press conference on television after midnight on Thursday."
"He looked very well and his emotion did little harm, but some others, to put it mildly, did not look so good."
"I do not doubt that the new Member States, including Lithuania, will appreciate the last six months of the presidency and the personal contribution made by Mr Juncker."
"Luxembourg has clearly demonstrated that the well-known definition of this state as ‘small, but notable’ is true."
"What would the European Union be without you!"
"History and past experience clearly shows that Europe, the European Union, was always strong when it gave precedence not to national interests, the demonstration of states' power and the personal ambitions of certain political leaders, but to common values and solidarity without denying internal competition, the engine of all progress."
"I believe that today, knowing and appreciating the results of the European Council, as well as the French and Dutch ‘no’ to the European Union Constitutional Treaty, and considering the nature of the United Kingdom's vision of the European Union, we also ought to analyse the cause of the current situation very carefully."
"The ratification of the Constitutional Treaty should not be an end in itself, and agitators and expounders will be of no help in this situation, no matter how highly qualified they are."
"The citizens' Europe proclaimed by us should become a reality, and this means that we must listen attentively to the voice of the citizens if we want to avoid renewed disillusionment."
"Analysis shows that in France and the Netherlands the European Union Constitutional Treaty was largely rejected because the door was left open to Turkey to become a European Union member in the future."
"We also notice that the most sensitive issues today are employment, new jobs, the growth of economic competition and the further expansion of the European Union."
"These should be the signposts in our dialogue with the citizens of the European Union."
"Mr President, the Council President is known throughout Europe as an excellent and experienced negotiator."
"We have to look elsewhere to find the reasons why we are standing here today empty-handed."
"Many people have spoken here today about Europe’s crisis, but this is not quite right."
"It is not Europe’s crisis; it is the crisis of the 15, and not only in a geographical sense."
"We need a new agreement, and one that clearly should cover much more than just money."
"Some want to speak about Lisbon, and about competitiveness."
"Well, let us do it!"
"But let all twenty-five of us be involved."
"We cannot negotiate on competitiveness if our hands and feet are tied."
"We must review the regulations on free movement of persons – it is high time in any case."
"We must not make the same mistake with the free movement of services as we did with persons."
"When we were unable to resolve an issue politically, we put up administrative barriers."
"Some want to speak about agricultural policy."
"Fine, but I would remind you that we in the ten new Member States are contributing considerably from our own resources."
"It is important that there should be a financial agreement, but it is even more important that we should avoid a situation where the new Member States are bound hand and foot once again by a multitude of administrative obstacles regarding how funds are spent, because it looks as if that is the direction we are heading in."
"If we need a new agreement, then one of its pillars must be to solidify the enlarged 25-member Union."
"Over the past decade and a half, we in the ten new Member States have vigorously cleared the hurdles, despite all the difficulties."
"To invigorate Europe – as Europe seems to need such – all twenty-five of us must strive vigorously for solidity."
"Over the past year, there has not been much evidence of this."
"Perhaps now things will change."
"Mr President, there can be no question that the outcome of last week’s European Council has cast a shadow on the six-month Luxembourg Presidency."
"A great deal has already been said about the reasons for this fiasco."
"I myself concur fully with the views expressed by President Barroso at the start of the debate, and in particular with his comments on the reasons why no compromise was reached on the Financial Perspective."
"I disagree with the view that the EU is facing a long-term crisis, and I believe that the deadlock on EU expenditure will soon be broken."
"At the same time, however, I should like to emphasise most strongly that the new Member States must not suffer as a result."
"European solidarity must not fall prey to conflicts between the 15 old Member States."
"We will never achieve dynamic economic growth in Europe if nearly one quarter of the EU’s population is deprived of the substantial support it will need over the next few years to overcome the effects of the political and economic division of Europe that was imposed upon the nations of Central and Eastern Europe."
"The EU as a whole needs to work together to this end."
"It is in the vital interests of the richer Member States to invest in the new Member States in order to accelerate their development."
"A strong cohesion policy and free movement of services provide the best means of achieving this goal."
"As a member of Parliament’s Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I should also like to pay tribute to the Luxembourg Presidency for having instigated what has been termed a period of reflection in the debate on the Constitutional Treaty."
"This was a very judicious move, and one that is essential if we are to maintain a healthy European democracy."
"The outcome of the referenda in France and the Netherlands cannot be ignored without widening the gap between Europe’s elite and its citizens."
"Those who have called for the ratification process to be continued without any period of reflection, as though nothing had happened, would achieve the very opposite of their intentions."
"They would forfeit any chance of achieving genuine democratic legitimacy for the European project, perhaps for many years to come."
"I am quite sure that by taking its foot off the accelerator, the Luxembourg Presidency has steered the EU round a dangerous bend as far as this issue is concerned."
"I should like to take the opportunity to express my particular thanks to Prime Minister Juncker and Mr Schmit for having done so."
"– Mr President, a whole series of my colleagues has successively congratulated the Luxembourg Presidency."
"I am doubly proud today because a country the size of the country which I represent has produced leaders who demonstrate that they can talk without mincing their words and who can also stand as leaders beyond the borders of their own country."
"Little Cyprus, which qualifies as a positive contributor on the basis of certain questionable statistics, cannot be a positive contributor while, at the same time, Great Britain has the privilege of refunds."
"The criterion of agriculture cannot be used for the contribution to gross national product; it must be the social balance between town and countryside, the combating of urbanism and the protection of the environment."
"You have promoted the Lisbon process, the failure of which to date must again be blamed on the Member States."
"You have achieved the Stability Pact on which the governments of the Member States at the time knew how to compromise, because this was a particularly burning issue for them."
"I also wish to congratulate you on your contribution to the common position on the EU-Turkey Association Council, which must count as one of your achievements, and to congratulate you personally, Mr Schmit, on your contribution to action to find a package of proposals on Cyprus, which will form the basis on which a dialogue will be held, in a good climate, between the two communities, in order to resolve our problems."
"Mr President, I would like to join those who have congratulated the President-in-Office of the European Council, Mr Juncker, for the real efforts that he made to try and reach a decision on these very difficult and complex issues at the European Council last week."
"In retrospect we realise that Mr Schulz was right that we in the Parliament had done our work, the Commission had done its work, but the Council, for reasons of overcharge on its agenda, had not actually done the real thinking on the financial perspective."
"Therefore, to have completed a deal within the space of two weeks was perhaps a little bit beyond the capacity of the Union."
"No deal is better than a bad deal."
"Now we need to look forward and there are four points I will raise quickly."
"The first is to have a real debate about priorities of the Union."
"How can you have a financial perspective unless you know what the policy priorities are going to be?"
"Part of that must be the economic reform agenda."
"Mr Watson referred to the UK and France being in Jurassic Park."
"I think the economies of France and Germany are the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park."
"We have to make sure that there is an economic dynamism that shows we can be competitive in the global economy."
"Second, we need to be able to fix a budget deal."
"Not, as Mr Barroso said, to have a seven year deal with a review."
"Let us come back to what we said in the Berger resolution and have a five-year deal, allowing the Commission and Parliament to review it in 2011."
"This way we can see how far we are going without having to predict what our expenditure will be too far into the future."
"In reconsidering that option we need to do more, as Mr Virrankoski said, on co-financing on agriculture."
"Third – and I include two last points here – we need to look at the question of the Constitutional Treaty."
"I welcome the suspension of ratification, because there are many things that are needed in terms of transparency, accountability, democracy and inclusion of national parliaments."
"This will be essential for a Union of the future."
"Last, but not least, is the question of enlargement."
"Mr President-in-Office, what you do not do when you are putting a house in order is put up a new annex and then try to make sure you are still expanding."
"Let us, as Mr Nassauer said, focus on what is really essential for our European citizens and then think about enlargement, if necessary, a little bit further on."
"– Mr President, the European project is currently characterised by uncertainties and concerns, yet this is also a time that encourages us to look to the future."
"By dint of the fact that Europe has become ambitious, it takes stock and asks itself fundamental questions."
"The ambition was to create an inclusive, integrated justice system, characterised by human dignity and capable of setting an example to the world. Europe drew up a Constitutional Treaty that enabled it to break free of the confines of offices and to go out onto the streets."
"The debate on the European Constitution has, undeniably, seen the greatest democratisation in Europe’s history."
"Europe is seeking a public domain characterised by transparency and trust."
"Ultimately, there can be no turning back on this odyssey;"
"Europe is duty bound not to abandon this ambition of political sharing."
"Furthermore, Europe must not think solely on its own."
"Without an integrated Europe there is no European model and without a European model we cannot set an example of human dignity around the world."
"It is only through political integration that decision-making can be effective, that our system of values can be placed on firm foundations and that Europe can speak with one voice."
"Parliament must be proactive and visible in the times ahead; it must work in a network with the national parliaments; political parties, local authorities and citizens’ groups must play their part; and the media must also become involved."
"In this regard, the European institutions have a responsibility that they must fulfil unflinchingly, given that the European debate is not merely a sum of national debates."
"The Constitution fits into this process of searching for consensus in an open and fragmented reality."
"Through the Constitution we have a duty to raise awareness of our shared interest."
"Accordingly, there are themes that must be addressed: the enlargement and governance; the EU’s financial model; the decision-making process and subsidiarity; integration and social, economic and political pluralism; the Constitution as a driving force or the Constitution as a framework."
"Paths are made by walking."
"Mr President, as my Group’s coordinator on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I would like to congratulate the Luxembourg presidency for the outstanding work it has done, not just on moving to close a number of crucial files such as unfair commercial practices, but also in its very strong engagement with the work of our Committee and its very strong commitment to the internal market."
"I particularly want to thank the Luxembourg presidency for the fact that, under the leadership of Minister Krecké, it has moved forward with the vital work on the Services Directive."
"I am delighted that there has been no question of the Luxembourg presidency being intimidated by noises off from certain great figures in European politics about the problems with that directive, of how they have sorted it out, and of how they have killed the directive in some cases."
"President-in-Office, I have been pleased that you have been as committed to the vital project to complete the internal market as we are on our side, and we will continue to work strongly with the British presidency to bring it to a conclusion and to build on the work that you have done."
"If I may, I would like to link that point to some of the important remarks that the President-in-Office made this afternoon."
"I wanted to pick out one aspect where I disagreed with him: he said that one of the choices we are faced with at the moment is between a free market and a stronger political union."
"I would suggest, colleagues, that is not the choice at all."
"We have moved far beyond a free market already: an internal market is an entirely different proposition."
"It is a major political and economic force."
"Our citizens want and understand that, but I ask those of you still here in the Chamber how many of your electors know what a political union is, and know in what direction it is taking us?"
"Surely one of the reasons why the Constitution was rejected so soundly in Holland and France was because people do not understand what a political union is."
"They actually feel threatened by the potential loss of sovereignty that it implies."
"Therefore, let us get on with the internal market."
"We may want to review where the political union goes and the changes we make to the Constitution, but the internal market must continue to be the driving force during the British presidency."
"Mr President, first of all I would like, on behalf of the President-in-Office of the European Council, on my own behalf, on behalf of all the other Presidents of the various configurations of the Council, and also on behalf of the whole of the Luxembourg Presidency, to thank you all for your congratulations, your positive assessments and, above all, for the encouragement that you have expressed during this debate."
"It is true that Europe is experiencing serious difficulties, but I think that these difficulties can help us."
"First by making us refocus on a more in-depth reflection on the development of this Europe."
"To an extent, that is what has been decided: a reflection, not behind closed doors, in secret, but a reflection-debate, a reflection-dialogue with the citizens on the path of European integration that we must follow."
"I think that, if our current difficulties can help us to open those doors, to open that debate, then, in the end, they will have had a purpose."
"Some have referred to the idea that the negative votes were motivated by a number of concerns expressed by the citizens, particularly social concerns or those raised by globalisation."
"In short, all of that needs to be included in this debate, included in this dialogue with the citizens."
"We in Luxembourg are taking the risk of holding a debate-election, a debate-referendum: we are the ones who have stuck with the date of 10 July."
"It is a courageous decision, but it is a decision that was called for by the people of Luxembourg."
"Well, I have confidence in them and I think that, from that vote on 10 July, a clear message will emerge of continuity with the Constitution."
"I am confident and I hope that, following that vote, which I hope and pray will be positive, Parliament will take the baton so that the Constitution is not put on ice indefinitely."
"I myself thought that we had got rid of the ice when we reformed the common agricultural policy, once we no longer had butter mountains."
"Now, though, I see that we are putting the Constitution and the financial perspectives on ice."
"No, Europe does not need hibernation, it needs action."
"Europe needs a clearly marked path."
"So, the time has come to pass on the baton."
"On the financial perspectives, we could have reached an agreement, and it is extremely regrettable that we did not do so."
"I think that Mr Juncker gave as transparent a report as Mr Bonde has always hoped for, as transparent as possible."
"We have spoken a great deal about various aspects of the negotiations."
"We came within a hair’s breadth of reaching agreement, because we know that, had there been a true current of agreement, those who were rejecting it would have agreed in the end."
"They did not do so because the current of agreement failed for the reasons of which you are aware."
"Many reasons have also been put forward not to accept this agreement."
"I have a bad feeling that, in the end, those reasons are more a pretext than real reasons."
"If reform becomes a pretext for not adopting important decisions for Europe, this does Europe a disservice."
"I tell you this, and Mr Juncker has already said it: we were prepared to make, in a declaration, a substantial commitment to reform."
"Well, that commitment did not see the light of day because, in the end, there was no final decision on the financial perspectives."
"Reform, yes, but reform in solidarity."
"We will not have reform without the people."
"We will not have reform without solidarity with everyone."
"The agricultural policy was also the target of a great deal of criticism."
"We forget rather too easily that there are, nevertheless, fundamental achievements in this agricultural policy."
"Who would wish for the desertification of acres of European countryside?"
"Who wishes for that?"
"Who would wish poverty on the rural population?"
"Who wants that?"
"I think that, once again, we need to debate the agricultural policy and not blame it for every problem, not demonise it, so to speak."
"I think that, on that subject, some honesty is needed."
"Primarily, and on this point I think that I am echoing Mr Baringdorf, is everybody really so innocent when we discuss agricultural policy?"
"Does everybody think only of reforming it in one way without thinking about reforming it in another?"
"I think that you will have many more opportunities to discuss reforms, including reform of the common agricultural policy."
"Do not forget, however, that there is also solidarity with the countryside, which is also a component of European culture."
"I obviously regret that Europe has not been able to find the positive dynamic that it could have drawn from the adoption of a better Stability and Growth Pact, and particularly from a revision of the Lisbon Strategy."
"We have no financial perspectives."
"I wish the next Presidency luck in reaching an acceptable and balanced agreement – indeed, someone has already mentioned balanced agreements – taking into account Mr Böge’s report which was adopted by a very large majority of your Parliament."
"Given that the agreement in the Council was an agreement that would, in any event, still have had to be negotiated with your Parliament, it is an illusion to think that the Council alone decides on the financial perspectives, since it is clear that the Council can only reach an agreement within the interinstitutional framework with the assent of your Parliament and, of course, of the Commission too."
"Much has been said about a fair return."
"I think that it is a virus gnawing away at European solidarity: we must eradicate it."
"Europe really must be vaccinated against this narrow idea of a fair return."
"I will not talk about the definition of the richest countries – I do not want to get involved in that kind of discussion – but what I have noticed is that there has been a great deal of fiddling with the numbers."
"There has been much fiddling, in order to justify positions that, if they were explained a little better, would then appear much more qualified."
"However, I do not want to conclude this assessment of the Luxembourg Presidency without stressing, as Mr Harbour did, that, although there has been a failure with respect to the financial perspectives, there have also been many successes."
"Europe is continuing to work in other fields of importance to the populations of Europe."
"I note, for example, that there has been an agreement, thanks in part to your Parliament, on the ‘external borders’ code: this is vital if we are to increase security at our external borders, and I think that your Parliament will vote on it during this part-session."
"It is a success that we must not minimise and that we must not now drown in an overly negative discussion on the current state of Europe."
"I note, too, that there have been a dozen approvals at first reading with your Parliament on important matters, such as cross-border mergers, or concerning the internal market."
"I think that these are important achievements that must not be minimised."
"The same is true of the approvals at second reading, without recourse to conciliation, in a field such as car insurance, which has a direct effect on citizens who travel and who cross borders."
"Yes, Europe is experiencing major difficulties, but I think that a part of its destiny is now also in your hands."
"We want to open up a debate."
"That debate must take place here, and it must take place in the national parliaments, within public opinion."
"I wish you all the courage and all the creativity that you have shown before to feed this debate, so that we can extricate ourselves as quickly as possible from these difficulties."
". Mr President, first of all I would like to join all those who have expressed their sincere admiration and gratitude to Jean-Claude Juncker, Minister Schmit and their team for their engagement, the passion and what I would like to call the sense of Europe that they have demonstrated."
"We often talk about the sense of State in relation to great statesmen and women, but it is high time to introduce the concept of a sense of Europe, and this is what Mr Juncker especially has shown throughout the Luxembourg presidency."
"I would like to add that we also greatly appreciate the transparency and openness that you have introduced, Mr Juncker."
"Of course, we should also highlight the successes that you have been able to achieve in a highly difficult political context."
"However, this debate on the Luxembourg presidency has turned into a debate on the European crisis."
"The most significant expression of this crisis is perhaps the feeling of confusion that we now perceive among the public and in the very basic questions that citizens have started to ask."
"What will happen to the Constitution?"
"What does it mean if we cannot have a constitution in the end?"
"How will this affect enlargement?"
"Has it already started to affect enlargement?"
"In the different regions of Europe, they have already started to ask very basic questions about the budget."
"What will happen?"
"Will we get our money?"
"What happens to all our projects?"
"May I just say to Mr Harbour and others that we should not underestimate the citizens of Europe."
"Throughout Europe they know that Europe is not only about a market."
"It is also about quality of life and they expect the European Union to deliver and to establish policies which affect their quality of life, the environment and all the other issues that are so important for our everyday lives."
"These are the questions that European citizens will continue to put to all our institutions and it is our joint responsibility to provide the answers, as far as we can."
"The European Union is a unique creation."
"It works on the basis of this very constructive, or hopefully constructive, interaction of the ‘institutional triangle’."
"However, the outcome of the European Council this weekend seems to show that one of the corners is somehow broken."
"That puts a bigger responsibility on the other two corners, the Commission and Parliament, but in this debate I have seen that there is a willingness and determination to work together."
"Mr Juncker referred to the institutional maturity that the Parliament has shown."
"We have seen this, for example, on the occasion of the recent Parliament resolution on the financial perspective."
"As President Barroso said earlier, the Commission stands ready to assist the incoming presidency to find an agreement on the future financial perspectives."
"We however have to bear in mind three crucial points."
"First, we need the resources to implement those policies on which the citizens expect the Union to deliver, and we need the budget for that."
"A deal that does not secure those resources will not allow us to bridge the gap between citizens and Europe."
"Second, this House must accept the agreement."
"Third, it must meet the legitimate needs of the new Member States who have shown their constructive attitude during the summit meeting."
"The main challenge for the months to come is the launch of a real dialogue on the future of Europe."
"The European Council has called for that dialogue in which the Commission is also invited to play a central role."
"We will of course give shape to what we call Plan D: debate, dialogue and democracy."
"We will work with the other institutions and we will try to mobilise the necessary resources for this."
"The Commission will accept its responsibility and we will also immediately start to work on the ‘strategic roadmap’, which will hopefully provide some more of the responses to the very basic questions that I mentioned before."
"We will, more than ever, need the input, cooperation and support of this House and all of those, who like Mr Juncker, have developed the sense of Europe and are ready to respond to his very solemn invitation."
"Thank you, Mrs Wallström."
"I hope the European Parliament and the national parliaments can play a little role in the Plan D you put forward with the Council and Commission."
"I have received six motions for resolution(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be at noon tomorrow."
"– This was a European Council in which the impact of the double victory for the no campaign, in the French and Dutch referenda of 29 May and 1 June, was clear for all to see. This victory paved the way for combating the increasingly neoliberal guidelines that have gradually been introduced in the EU in recent years, and that have ultimately been enshrined in the draft so-called European Constitution."
"From a political and legal point of view, the people dealt the Constitutional Treaty a deadly blow in these referenda, given that a Treaty can only enter into force if it has been ratified by all 25 Member States."
"The European Council of 16 and 17 June had the evidence staring it in the face, yet it chose to ignore it, preferring instead to admit that it had suffered a setback and to prolong the agony for some more time by giving itself a year to take stock."
"It will at some point have to acknowledge that this proposal in its current form cannot enter into force, and even in revised form it will be required to undergo the entire ratification process again."
"With regard to the Financial Perspective, the complete absence of a spirit of solidarity is regrettable ..."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on amending the Decision of 4 June 2003 on the adoption of the Statute for Members of the European Parliament (2005/2124(INI)) (A6-0189/2005)."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Members’ Statute that we are discussing has to lay down the Members’ prerogatives, in the first instance."
"It must state who the Member of the European Parliament is, what his rights and duties are, and what his immunities are, transforming him from a national delegate to a representative of the European peoples in their entirety."
"In essence, the Statute is a fundamental pillar of the process of European integration, and it is not approved in order to govern salaries or the reimbursement of expenses, but to govern and enhance the role and function of the Member in the European Community."
"A standardised approach to salaries would risk being discriminatory, because it deals with different situations in the same manner."
"Those who gave prominence to that part of the Statute – which I define as of lesser importance and which only serves a demagogic purpose in stirring the emotions of the mass media – are mistaken and have not grasped the profound meaning that new rules at a European level can have."
"In my opinion, Mr Juncker, the decision that Parliament is about to make in a time of crisis is important, because working towards providing Parliament with a more European function is worthwhile and fundamental for the credibility of the Union."
"It is for that reason that the Council and the Member States, who do not want the European Parliament to be strengthened, oppose the Statute."
"We came close to agreement in the last parliamentary term, when Mr Rothley, a great legal expert, and I provided significant input."
"The European Parliament in June and December played its part by listening to the suggestions of the Council, which the Council, however, after we had adopted them, subsequently withdrew and has not since approved."
"I should like to mention Mr Lehne, who provided a significant, intelligent and cooperative contribution to the text in question; in December 2003, he summed it up neatly: ’we have been negotiating now for nearly five years, and we cannot continue any longer in a situation where the Council leads Parliament a dance like a bear with a ring through its nose in a circus arena.’"
"I repeat today the words that Mr Lehne spoke at that time."
"Members of the European Parliament have to have their own autonomous reference standard, which no longer derives from their Member States of origin but from their being representatives of the Community."
"In an official statement, the Council undertook to start up a process designed to provide us with common rules with regard to parliamentary immunity."
"It is a strong political commitment, which I welcome and which we would like to see confirmed today in this House by the Luxembourg Presidency."
"The text that we have approved within the Committee on Legal Affairs takes account of the umpteen suggestions of the Council and represents an important balancing point, Mr President, on which we must meet."
"Once again, we Members have been ready to pay a price in order to have the Statute and I have to say that that is also true for the Italian Members, considered to be ill-disposed to the salary, who have made a contribution, since it gives them a drastic cut in their allowances."
"So, although we have accepted all of the Council’s requests, the Luxembourg Presidency has still expressed some doubts, and opposes a recital – number 12 – that I proposed and that the Committee approved, a recital enabling the Member States to lay down supplementary measures in order to make the status of the Members of the European Parliament equal to members of national parliaments."
"Recital 12 is a mirror-image of recital 11, which in contrast allows the Member States to pay national rates."
"If some countries are allowed to nationalise the system, effectively reducing our salary, why cannot others supplement it instead or give us the facilities that they provide to members of national parliaments?"
"Why is it so difficult to understand, ladies and gentlemen, that the Statute provides the legal basis – and this is important – for allowing the Member States to provide those benefits that they also give to members of parliament in their own country?"
"By sending a personal letter and by failing to consult the Council, the Luxembourg Presidency – I have to say – has reacted hastily to this amendment, stating that it does not agree with it."
"It has sent a letter that, in my opinion and – I believe – in the opinion of the majority ofMembers, is unacceptable from an institutional point of view."
"It is undue interference, which I have reported to you, Mr President, in order to defend our independence and our sovereignty."
"The Luxembourg Presidency needs to be reminded to respect the role and the prerogatives of Parliament."
"If the Presidency had not wasted time criticising Parliament or finding specious, trumped-up obstacles, and had lavished more energy on preventing the failure of the Council, it would perhaps have acted wisely."
"It is now seeking to take home at least one positive result, by promoting the announcement of this Statute, which I believe is an important moment in the life of Parliament."
"Parliament is aware of the crisis of Europe, which we have discussed all afternoon, and of the need to change method."
"Europe has to overcome the period in which the weight of bureaucracy prevailed over the dynamics of the issues."
"Europe is a political issue, not a stereotype, for which clear guidelines are needed, and not a compromise at any cost."
"I hope that the United Kingdom intends to begin a new course of action, just as a new course of action also needs to be begun by Parliament."
"I am sure that the Council will not reject the Statute on the grounds of this amendment, the content of which lays down a possibility that the Council itself formally stated could be accepted."
"That is the legal basis."
"What if these measures did not exist?"
"In my opinion, Mr President, they could be considered invalid by the Court of Justice."
"The exchange of letters between the President of Parliament and the President-in-Office of the Council carries strong weight at a political level, but not for the Court of Justice: therefore, if they are accepted politically, why not lay it down in the Statute, unless there is a reservation in the minds of some people who I hope do not wish to stoop to similar trickery?"
"I will conclude with an appeal, Mr President: let us approve the Statute as tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"Significant cooperation has taken place among all of the Members, and it is a balanced text, which will enter into force in 2009, which leaves adequate transition periods to adapt to the new system."
"It is a genuine first step towards the single Statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for 15 years a statute for Members of the European Parliament has been under discussion and, as you know, many initiatives have been taken, both by your Parliament and by the Council, with a view to creating such a statute."
"The statute we are examining today mainly took shape under the Belgian Presidency in the second half of 2001."
"Parliament and the Council were very close to an agreement at that time, but the stumbling block proved to be the reimbursement of actual expenses and tax liability."
"The process then came to a standstill, and it was under the Italian presidency that Mr Rothley presented a new draft report to Parliament, a draft that also seemed to have good prospects of success."
"In his report, Mr Rothley proposed a solution with the potential to reconcile the positions of the Council and Parliament."
"In particular, Parliament now favoured the reimbursement of Members’ actual expenses under an arrangement that would enter into force along with the new statute."
"On 21 January 2004, the Rothley report was presented to your Committee on Legal Affairs for discussion."
"Unfortunately, on 26 January, the General Affairs Council failed to reach political agreement, chiefly because of the budgetary implications of the draft proposals."
"In November 2004, in his address to the European Council, President Josep Borrell – you yourself, Mr President – signalled that the European Parliament was willing to be flexible in this matter in order to secure an early agreement."
"He also emphasised to the European Council that Parliament could not formally present a new proposal without being assured that it would be accepted by the Council and that there was therefore a need for informal consultations."
"At the end of 2004, under the Dutch Presidency, these consultations took place in the presence of representatives of the future Luxembourg Presidency, and it was agreed that efforts would be made to reach agreement in the first half of 2005."
"On 12 January 2005, the President-in-Office of the Council, in his speech presenting the programme of the Luxembourg Presidency to the European Parliament, confirmed the Presidency’s intention of ensuring, in cooperation with the whole of Parliament and its President, that the negotiations on this matter would be brought to a successful conclusion."
"Mr President, after 26 years – yes, 26 years – of being directly elected by universal suffrage, the European Parliament still has no uniform statute for its Members."
"That is why today and tomorrow, when the vote takes place, could be decisive, given that the Council and the European Parliament seem to be able to proceed at long last to a decision."
"Let me pay special tribute to the efforts of Mr Gargani, rapporteur and chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, and to the members of that committee, who have managed, within what was admittedly an extremely tight time frame, to present a report that should certainly satisfy the Council."
"It is also true that the Presidency could perhaps have devoted even more time to this matter."
"We thought we could resolve the issue of the financial perspectives at the same time."
"Had we known then what we know now, we should have left the matter of the financial perspectives to the next Presidency in order to focus more sharply on the Members’ Statute."
"I am particularly grateful to you, Mr President, and to your office and your Secretariat for your combined efforts and for the continuous formal and informal dialogue with our Presidency."
"You have displayed a great deal of courage and tenacity in pursuit of this statute, which has not always been an easy matter."
"May I also thank all the other Members of Parliament who have patiently, and sometimes discreetly, helped us to work on this difficult and sensitive issue, which is always liable to be a target for demagogues."
"This was brought home to me once again this afternoon right here in Parliament."
"The Council, for its part, has kept its promise by trying to establish a consensus on a number of elements that might be the key to agreement on the draft statute."
"In a letter of 6 June to your President, I enumerated these elements, foremost among which are remuneration, the principle of reimbursing travel and staff expenses on the basis of actual cost and the principle that the European Parliament, and hence the Community budget, should shoulder responsibility for pension contributions."
"The Council cannot but be gratified to note that, thanks to our close cooperation, all of these elements have been incorporated into the final report submitted to you today."
"I believe that the draft on which we are preparing to take a decision is conducive to greater transparency, an ever-present demand in all of your deliberations and in all of ours."
"The draft also respects a fundamental principle that underlies all European policies, namely that of non-discrimination, as well as the principle of equal pay for equal work."
"In a letter of 16 June, I expressed my satisfaction to President Borrell at the overwhelming vote of approval delivered by the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs on the report you have presented to us."
"I also indicated that the amendments adopted by the committee were acceptable to the presidency, with the exception of the clause included in the final report, in recital 12 of the parliamentary resolution, about which Mr Gargani has just spoken."
"We believe, in fact, that the substance of this recital falls largely within the domain of national laws and regulations."
"There is nothing, absolutely nothing, to prevent a government from paying a supplement or allowance – call it what you will – to its MEPs to put them on a par with members of the national parliament."
"That, however, is a national matter; it is not a matter for European legislation."
"European law has to ensure that there is equality within the European framework."
"We talk of subsidiarity; let us practise it for once."
"It is certainly true that this provision has been discussed among the various parties."
"We have exchanged correspondence, which, I believe, has a certain political value and which is based on a sort of code of confidence between the presidencies of the Council and Parliament."
"These letters have spelled out clearly that such agreements or national regulations, as the case may be, are not opposed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on this last outstanding issue, namely recital 12, I hope that we shall be able to find a solution that satisfies the Council too."
"It would be wrong to give the impression, in adopting a Community instrument, an act of the European Union, of creating a European statute while paving the way at the same time for its renationalisation."
"This is essentially why we do not want this amendment in recital 12."
"As far as procedure is concerned, once the report drafted by the committee chairman, Mr Gargani, has been approved by you along with the resolution and decision, the adopted documents will be submitted to Coreper for approval on 30 June in accordance with Article 190(5) of the EC Treaty."
"I hope that this procedure, so close to the finishing line, will have a satisfactory outcome."
"I believe that, in doing this, in adopting this statute, we shall also be ending a situation that is completely incomprehensible to the public at large as well as ourselves."
"As you said, Mr President, we shall be enhancing the credibility of the European Union, the credibility of your Parliament and its Members’ Statute and also of the Council, which, after all, will have approved the statute."
"I believe that the Presidency has displayed commitment – not always enough, perhaps; I accept that criticism – but what we want to do today is to make that final push and take our decision."
"Lastly, as regards the question raised by Mr Gargani about the privileges and immunities of Members of the European Parliament, we attach considerable importance to that point, and we fully understand your Parliament’s concern to resolve the issue."
"The Council agrees that a clear declaration on that subject should be adopted, and we hope that we shall be able to resolve the question of privileges and immunities in the near future."
". Mr President, I sincerely welcome the efforts of the rapporteur Mr Gargani, Parliament and the Luxembourg presidency, in finding a solution agreeable to all parties on the Members’ Statute."
"The Commission gave its opinion on the original proposal for a statute in June 2003."
"It was favourable and made two general observations."
"First, we pointed out that the provisions in the draft statute relating to the privileges and immunities of Members and governed by primary law could not be amended in an act based on Article 190 of the EC Treaty."
"In this new draft these provisions have been removed."
"Our second comment concerned the financial implications of the statute and these concerns have also been addressed."
"We have seemed very close to agreement before, only to have everyone’s hopes dashed at the last minute."
"I sincerely hope that this time the statute will finally be approved."
". Mr President, I have to admit that, as recently as a couple of weeks ago, I did not believe we would ever get as close as this to adopting our Members’ Statute."
"If anyone in particular is to be thanked for this unexpected turn of events, it is the Luxembourg presidency, although I can well imagine that it would have preferred – and regarded it as more important – to achieve success elsewhere."
"I would also like to thank the President of this House for his efforts in this matter, along with the Chairman of our Committee on Legal Affairs."
"Our being so close to having the Statute owes much to our former fellow Member and rapporteur Willy Rothley’s dedication, to which I would like to pay tribute, and which the President-in-Office of the Council has already mentioned."
"I hope I am doing what he would have wanted in recalling three fundamentals that have always underpinned our calls for a common statute."
"Quite apart from anything prior to that date, it was the introduction, in 1979, of direct elections to the European Parliament, and the progressive improvement of its rights and prerogatives as the joint legislator for the EU, and its budgetary authority, that made it wholly inappropriate and improper that the rights of its Members should be subject to national law and that we should be dependent on national parliaments."
"As is well known, one consequence of that is that we, Members of a single Parliament, are now subject to 25 different national systems of regulations, which makes a mockery of the principle that all Members of this House are equal."
"There is some justification for the criticism that has been levelled at the internal arrangements, including the improvement in low basic rates of pay."
"All these things give us at least three good reasons why any Members’ Statute is better than none, but there is no doubt that what we now have before us, having for a long time been bounced back and forth between the Council and this House, adds up to more than that."
"It adds up to a balanced and respectable proposal, and one that resolves the presenting problems to which I have already referred, although we have to take on board the need for long transitional periods as we move towards a standardised system."
"Along with others, I personally would have liked certain arrangements to be different;"
"I would, for example, have liked to see higher gross pay and to have us making our own pension contributions, but this is evidently neither the time nor the place to introduce many different and mutually contradictory individual variants."
"If we want to have a Statute, then this is the only one we are going to get, and it is for that reason that my Group is going to vote in favour of it tomorrow."
"We also perceive a problem in Recital 12, against which we have already voted in the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"We have asked for a split vote on it, and my Group will be voting against Recital 12, even though we do not want the Statute to be brought down at the last hurdle by something that is a current problem, but not one with any legal significance."
"We also have a problem with the amendment to Article 23, as adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs, to the effect that the European Parliament, being a European institution, can make payments not only in euros, but also in the currencies of countries outside the eurozone."
"I think it would be inappropriate for an entity such as the European Parliament to make payments in anything other than the euro, and this would also entail numerous administrative problems for the House."
"We will therefore be opposing this addition, for which no provision was originally made."
"I would like to reiterate my warmest thanks to all those who have played a part in this, while also pointing out, for the sake of fairness, that we want to make a number of additions to the resolution that we shall be adopting tomorrow."
"Our particular concern is with expressing our desire for an Assistants’ Statute."
"It is only fair and right, if we MEPs are to at last have one set of rules for all, that there should also be one to put the legal position of our staff on a new footing."
"This is not to make the one dependent on the other, but we who are Members of this House should do everything in our power to offer our staff fair arrangements."
". Mr President, we are nearly there: a Members’ Statute that has eluded us for so long."
"This must be the best chance we have ever had and, on behalf of the ALDE Group, I would like to thank the Luxembourg presidency and you for getting us this far."
"Of course it is a compromise, but it is an important compromise for two reasons: equal pay for equal work – and that means equal; fair treatment for all our colleagues."
"This, of course, is between ourselves, but it is a small step forward for Europe."
"Secondly, and probably more important, between our citizens and ourselves it will finally deliver a transparent system of expenses based on actual cost."
"We will be cleaning up our act and removing a constant cause for public criticism."
"This is a bigger step for Europe and the European Parliament as it confirms its maturity."
"The ALDE Group will take a principled line of voting against all amendments, including recital 12."
"That is not because we do not think some of the amendments have merit."
"Of course we want a better language regime in this House; of course we want a statute for assistants; of course we want the pension fund sorted out; of course we would like earlier implementation."
"However, what we most want is a Members’ Statute and any amendment could risk destroying the delicate balance in this House and with the Council."
"If this fails, let it be Council’s fault, not this Parliament’s."
"Any amendment could potentially be a wrecking amendment in this situation."
"This House must show its full maturity and restraint tomorrow, vote for the essential and deliver a Members’ Statute for the European Parliament."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank the Luxembourg Presidency and yourself for having arrived at this outcome today."
"When the debate on the Members’ Statute began, it was extremely noble: people talked about immunity, status, and it was a means by which to underline the existence of a supranational parliament directly elected by the European people."
"Then everything went wrong: it has become a debate on money and various acts of pettiness, which is highly complicated by national exceptions that have partly drained away the European value of this Statute, which has now become almost exclusively based on money."
"Even if we vote against paragraph 12, I call on the Presidency to consider that it is by no means this paragraph that makes the Statute less European."
"It is precisely all those who interfered, particularly on the fiscal system, who have got rid of the truly European content."
"That said, tomorrow my group will be equally divided between those abstaining and those voting in favour, because there are a number of elements of this Statute about which we have very serious issues, the issue of pensions, in particular."
"We believe that we are citizens like everyone else, and that it is therefore entirely justifiable that, when you are entitled to a pension, you have in some way to contribute to, and participate in, funding that reserve."
"That is the reason for which a number of our members will abstain on that issue and will consequently vote in favour of our amendment."
"On the other hand, I should like to underline the fact that we are very strongly in favour of this Statute."
"Even we perfectly understand that we are in a ‘now or never’ situation."
"The final comment that I should like to make is the fact that in recent years certainly not only the Luxembourg Government, but also the Council as a whole, has complicated the situation and made it much more difficult, partly because it has introduced a new concept of, let us say, enlarged assent, by which people are not limited to saying just yes or no."
"We hope that in future we too in the European Parliament will be able to take advantage of this enlarged assent procedure."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although there is unanimity within my group on the need for a Members’ Statute, there are also – as of course in any group – very divergent ideas about what precise shape it should take."
"This is one reason why not all the members of my group will be voting the same way."
"Our demand – backed up by amendments to the Rothley report – had always been that the amount reimbursed in respect of travel costs should correspond to the expenses actually incurred, transparency being the primary consideration."
"Any reimbursement over and above the actual costs is not acceptable."
"I might add that the possibility exists already of repaying excessive travel expenses, and that the German Members, for example, have already undertaken to do so."
"Turning to the pension fund, there are differences of opinion among us concerning the proportion of the MEP’s share in contributions as opposed to the share payable by Parliament, but we do, in any case, endorse the basic principle according to which Members of this House – in the same way as other citizens – must contribute to the social security systems and bear their share of funding the pension scheme, even though we are aware that this is a pension fund rather than a system founded upon solidarity."
"The same applies to contributions to accident insurance."
"In our debates, we should never lose sight of the fact that one reason why MEPs need to make contributions is that it is the taxpayer who pays our salaries."
"We are all advocates of equal pay for equal work."
"It is unacceptable that the incomes of MEPs from different countries should differ by as much as EUR 11 000, and that is why it is right that a uniform salary should be brought in."
"As for how much this should amount to, we could of course have some really good arguments about that."
"It also goes without saying that MEPs in receipt of a uniform salary should also be taxed on a uniform basis, namely in accordance with European tax law."
"If the Member States go further and decide that they want also to levy the difference between the European and national tax rate, then they are perfectly entitled to do so, provided that this does not result in double taxation."
"Mr President, the Swedish June List believes that Members of the European Parliament should receive their salaries from their respective national parliaments and receive uniform remuneration from the European Parliament."
"The principle of subsidiarity must be our guide."
"It is up to individual Member States to decide the salaries to be paid to their parliamentarians."
"The national salaries paid to Members of the European Parliament are adjusted in accordance with the actual salaries and costs that prevail in the respective Member States."
"Members should have their salaries paid by their own countries and pay tax there too."
"From the point of view purely of principle, we believe that the EU should not fix the salaries of MEPs elected by people in each of the EU countries."
"It would not be fair if a Member of the European Parliament from a country in which salaries are low were to receive a salary several times higher than that received by someone with a similar or more senior post in his or her own country."
"One consequence of a common Statute for Members of the European Parliament might, for example, be that one country’s MEPs received salaries several times higher than those of their own country’s Head of State or Government."
"It is important for Members of the European Parliament not to be regarded as a privileged elite by voters in their own countries, but for salary conditions to be reasonably in keeping with the national salary situation for equivalent positions."
"The present system of travel expenses, which does not take account of actual costs and which is based on standard payments, is quite unfair in our view."
"Members should only be refunded the actual costs that arise in connection with travel."
"The travel expenses system can be reformed without a common Members’ Statute being adopted."
"For the reasons given, the June List has chosen to vote against the motion."
"In conclusion, I would point out that, in the statutes, Members of the European Parliament are called just that – Members or ‘’."
"It seems odd, therefore, that, in certain countries, MEPs refer to themselves as ‘honourable’."
"Such expressions are antiquated in a democratic EU."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will not keep to the speech that I had prepared and I apologise for that, but the speech made by Mr Schmit forces me to hurriedly change the scope of my speech."
"I find the expression ‘the same job, the same pay’ completely outrageous."
"I say that as a lawyer, as a legal expert: it is unthinkable that a Member can portray himself as an employee who is given a wage."
"The Member has an allowance and therefore a sense of dignity, and if we want to give that back to Parliament, we are the first ones obliged to respect its rules, which are also rules of behaviour, in addition to written, and sometimes disobeyed, rules."
"Among those rules, European law has to guarantee equality."
"I ask Mr Schmit whether there is a principle of equality by which, a five-star hotel room in one of the new Member States costs the equivalent of EUR 40, as was our experience two weeks’ ago in Krakow, Poland, whilst it costs the equivalent of EUR 500 or EUR 700 for a hotel of the same standard in Rome, Paris or any other European capital."
"Whilst you can dine out on EUR 10 in a restaurant in one of the countries of the East, a restaurant of the same quality in Italy, Germany or France charges EUR 70, EUR 80 or EUR 100."
"Today, we are playing a part, fully aware that we are being hypocritical at least."
"From a legal point of view, I believe that it is unacceptable, partly because the interpretation that we are going to give – and I am only talking about Articles 9 and 10, Mr President – is that the Members are entitled to a fair allowance, enough to give them an independent living."
"What constitutes fairness and independence for a Member, however?"
"Independence with regard to what, if then, in Article 10, the Member’s dignity is regarded as 38.5% of the basic salary of a judge in the Court of Justice?"
"I ask that that be not mentioned; the allowance required should still be laid down, but not by linking it to that of a civil servant."
"The Member’s dignity stems from his direct election by the people."
"Being elected by an Italian electorate of 15 million voters, as I was, is not the same as becoming a Member in an ordered list, produced by the parties in another country where a person has no expenses ..."
"Mr President, this is without a doubt an epoch-making moment in the history of this House, for this debate and vote are, strictly speaking, illicit, and the content of this Statute now amounts to a package of privileges that undermines democracy."
"I predict that what the overwhelming majority of this House’s Members have accomplished today, and will no doubt finalise tomorrow, will go down in history as the final nail in the European Union’s coffin."
"Its end result is that a people’s Chamber becomes so detached from reality that many view from a great height the real problems that afflict Europe – be they privileged eating arrangements or something else."
"It was six years ago that I came to this House, a convinced supporter of the EU and lead candidate of the same party that provides with our President, who is currently in the chair and enabling this to happen."
"I believed that we would be able to escape the trap of globalisation and make the European dream a reality; instead I have had to spend those six years watching the European trap being set – step by step, in a succession of misguided decisions, by one package of privileges after another."
"It is tragic."
"Nevertheless, I am still persuaded that it is possible to achieve real, serious democracy at European level, albeit not, of course, in such a manner as this."
"At the same time, to accuse most of this House of blindness, as happens over and over again, is to insult the blind."
"My grandfather was blind, and yet he was very sensitive, having a feel for, and noticing, many things."
"The same cannot be said of most of those in this House."
"I wish long life to any real, democratic parliament that is close to the people and binds peoples together."
"It has to be said that this is not one; it is far more a colony of the privileged."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few short messages can only be communicated in the space of one minute."
"The first message is without doubt one of thanks to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council for having in some way helped to put this debate back onto the agenda."
"An even more heartfelt message of thanks is offered to this Parliament."
"You will allow me to do this, because an objective that I consider to be of great political value, as a demonstration of the progress we are making towards a process of European political integration, is being reached through this acknowledgment of the coherent role of being a Member of the European Parliament."
"This Parliament has also accepted a number of compromise assessments that I would prefer were not ignored."
"The principle of non-discrimination is invoked, which is sacrosanct."
"That is one of the reasons why I will vote with conviction in favour of those ideas: the principle of non-discrimination cannot be sustained, however, even on the assessments of the comparison with members of national parliaments."
"Presenting the fact that the salary and allowance regime is different from that of national MPs as a privilege, while disregarding the fact that that was the one single condition preventing a Member of the European Parliament from being considered to carry out a hierarchically subordinate role to that of a member of a national parliament, is not, in my opinion, satisfactory."
"The same is true for other items."
"I will, however, conclude my speech by making just one point, Mr President – if you will allow me – in a second."
"We are finally reaching an objective that does justice to so many false debates and so many provocations on the issue of transparency."
"We will realise it."
"We will realise it when we finally embark on a so-called system of ‘payment of expenses actually incurred’ and see the effects on the parliamentary budget."
". Mr President, let me say very briefly that I believe this statute is a transparent work."
"It changes a situation which, while I do not know whether it was privilege-ridden in the way that Mr Martin has just said, was certainly unacceptable in principle."
"Is it normal, in fact, that one Member of Parliament should earn seven or eight hundred euros while another earns ten to twelve times that amount, if not more?"
"Is it normal in any administration or in any service that the system for reimbursing expenses should be entirely devoid of transparency?"
"I therefore believe that the transparency introduced by this statute is understood by the public, because people do not understand how anyone buying a flight ticket can be reimbursed ten times the actual value of the ticket."
"That is what people cannot understand."
"Consequently, if this situation is changed, that in itself, I believe, is an important step."
"For my own part, let me say plainly that I do not want anyone to indulge in demagogy now with this Members’ Statute."
"It is all to the credit of your Parliament that it has adopted this statute or will adopt it tomorrow."
"I believe it deserves thanks for that, for the efforts of all concerned."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one quick observation."
"I am satisfied with a debate that has, to all intents and purposes, celebrated the work that we do – which pleases me – and that I believe has given due importance to a significant day for Parliament, if a conclusion is reached."
"I have the pleasure of thanking the Presidency of Parliament for the assistance it has provided, and Mr Schmit for his commitment to the first part of the Statute, which, with another itinerary and with another procedure, must be approved by the Council, and furthermore for his readiness, even in the final hours between this evening and tomorrow, to find a compromise on recital 12, which, Mr President, I continue to believe is important for the legal basis of the Statute itself."
"On my own behalf and on behalf of this Institution, I too would like to express my gratitude to the Luxembourg Presidency."
"This was a hot potato that everybody wanted to pass on to the next person in the hope that they would not have to hold it for too long."
"The Luxembourg Presidency has had the courage to face the problem and to dedicate a lot of time, energy and good sense to it, aware that this is a compromise that does not satisfy anybody completely, but which will undoubtedly put an end, I hope, to a long-standing situation which, as the Minister has said, was not acceptable."
"In any event, Parliament will express its decision tomorrow through the vote;"
"I would simply like to express the gratitude I owe personally to the Luxembourg Presidency."
"The vote will take place tomorrow and the honourable Members will then decide whether they accept or reject the rapporteur’s text."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"One of the Luxembourg Presidency’s successes was its achievement of agreement on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"It is because the Members’ Statute makes it possible to do away with many grey areas and inadequate rules and regulations that I see continued opposition to this compromise as making no sense whatever."
"European regulations enable the public to get a better insight than do 25 or 27 sets of national rules and any number of compensation arrangements, some permitted and some not."
"I am aware that there are unmistakeable defects in even this compromise."
"One fundamental problem that remains is the rule on pensions in Article 14; what is needed is that Members pay their own share of contributions to the pension funds."
"Although our amendment – No 1 – on this has now been lost, I am convinced that an opening still exists to find a solution at a lower level than that of the Statute and will continue to press the case for a solution of this kind, which must be supplementary to the Statute."
"The Members’ Statute also, at last, paves the way for an Assistants’ Statute."
"The House must now make all possible haste to complete the work on one successfully."
"–Τhe next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Mr President, I was astonished to read in a British newspaper that several hundred Nazi war criminals are living in the United Kingdom."
"They include 75 Auschwitz camp guards who escaped justice."
"I would remind the House that the Auschwitz-Birkenau death factory was the most horrifying of all the concentration camps."
"I am appalled by such reports, particularly since only 700 of the 8 000 camp guards, or less than 10%, were ever put on trial."
"Most of these trials were conducted in Poland."
"I would call on the Members of this House, on the British Government and on all people of conscience to remember the crimes that were committed, and not to turn their backs on the victims or take the side of the perpetrators of violence."
"It is an affront to the dignity of Europeans and entirely reprehensible that murderers from Auschwitz-Birkenau should meet with forbearance and leniency in one of the EU’s Member States."
"I would therefore call on the President of Parliament to take action as quickly as possible, and to ensure that the British Government is called to account on this matter."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following on from my last speech before the House in Strasbourg, I should like to reiterate my views on the transport of live cattle."
"Subsidies for live cattle exports are and always will be nothing short of scandalous, particularly since, in the majority of cases, they benefit either agribusiness or distributors and wholesale distributors, and do very little to help small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises."
"It is up to us to do something, however, as we too can bring about certain changes in this respect."
"I should like to point out that it is often enough to change cost structures in certain sectors to minimise various practices or to put a stop to them altogether."
"I would ask the House to take this into account during the debate on the infrastructure pricing directive, as this would be one opportunity for us to take legislative action."
"I should like, once again, to ask the Commission and the Council to initiate a reform of this system, on the one hand in order to put an end to the suffering of animals and on the other in order to support small and medium-sized farms."
"– Unfortunately, there is no interpretation at the moment in the language in which you elected to speak and your speech was not therefore translated."
"Mr President, as an Irish speaker I welcome the decision to accord the status of official working language of the European Union to the Irish language."
"I extend congratulations and heartfelt thanks to all of those involved in the status campaign to achieve the status of official working language of the European Union for the Irish language."
"I ask the President of the Parliament to convey to the Council our satisfaction in this matter and would ask also that everything possible be done between now and 1 January 2007 to meet the needs that arise from this new status, and to ensure that the European Parliament and the other EU institutions will be able to provide the appropriate services in Irish."
"I wish to protest to the House about the defamation of Poles and of Poland as a whole."
"The latter is a country that could serve as a model of multicultural coexistence, in view of the large number of national minorities living alongside the Polish nation."
"In the latest report by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, Poland is accused of virtual anti-Semitism and discrimination against Roma."
"The report condemns national movements and singles out , even though the latter attempts to present an objective and truthful picture of reality."
"Anti-Semitism has always been foreign to the Christian outlook of Poles, whereas the German Nazis and the totalitarian Soviet regime inflicted physical and moral harm upon millions of people."
"Ever since Poland regained independence, attempts have been made to blame Poles for this harm."
"Even the Jewish Diaspora in Poland objects to the report’s accusations of anti-Semitism."
"By way of contrast, the report makes no mention of the anti-Polish sentiments that are frequently expressed, in particular in those media outlets that have been bought out by foreign capital."
"We therefore demand that the report be corrected and these insults withdrawn."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have another contribution to the previous topic."
"The date of 17 June 2005 will be recorded in European history as a failure."
"After a clear signal from the European Parliament, when we approved Böge’s report on the financial perspective by a large majority, we waited anxiously for the result of the summit, hoping for a positive conclusion."
"It did not happen."
"One-fifth of the EU25 selfishly broke away, and the enlarged Europe received yet another slap in the face."
"It happened in spite of the will of the poorer EU10, which were willing to accept a compromise even at the cost of losses for the sake of reaching an agreement."
"With the unsuccessful referenda on the Constitutional Treaty and the budget fiasco at the June summit we have, unfortunately, started to build a new European wall between the old and the enlargement parts of the Union."
"And the word ‘citizen’ has again merely remained on the lips of us, the politicians."
"Let us not forget, however, that the Chinese train is crashing into Europe with astronomical speed."
"We have slowed down the European one, or even diverted it at no less than three points on the track."
"Unless we breathe new life into the Union as soon as possible, we shall have to rename the unfulfilled Lisbon strategy as the ‘European tragedy’."
"Mr President, in the north of the Netherlands province of Limburg, the environmental standards are already being exceeded considerably on account of such things as location and road network density."
"This situation is made worse by the addition of the A74 motorway to the existing A73."
"The A74 will attract many extra lorries, which are major polluters."
"The government’s decision to map out the A74 in this area demonstrates that it is not taking the Dutch and European environmental standards seriously."
"The volume of fine dust will increase dramatically."
"How can we possibly carry on along these lines?"
"We recently concluded that at this rate, Europe will no longer meet even the Kyoto standards."
"This planned A74 is a motorway to hell."
"If we want to make it to Kyoto, we will have to make a U-turn."
"– Τhe next item is the debate on the report by Michael Cashman, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (COM(2004)0391 – C6-0080/2004 – 2004/0127(COD)) (A6-0188/2005)."
"Mr President, a fortnight or three weeks ago, we celebrated 20 years of the Schengen agreements."
"These agreements opened up a new dimension of Europe and put it in a new perspective."
"I believe that the regulation we are discussing this evening, which reflects an agreement at the first reading between Parliament and the Council, is a good signal to send 20 years after the conclusion of the Schengen agreements."
"We have achieved an objective in this domain, an objective set for us by the Thessaloniki European Council on 19 and 20 June 2004."
"In other words, we have achieved this objective in something like record time, because the recasting undertaken in the framework of this regulation is designed, on the one hand, to remove obsolete provisions from the handbook and, on the other hand, to develop and clarify other provisions on the basis of an analysis of the everyday problems encountered on the ground at the external or internal borders of the Union."
"The regulation, however, goes further than a mere makeover, because it establishes a veritable Community Code governing the movement of persons across borders, not only relating to the external borders of the Union but also, as I said, with a component on the internal borders, since these two aspects are undeniably complementary."
"Moreover, the regulation resolves the problem of the ambiguous legal basis of the handbook by creating a proper legal instrument containing all the basic principles and rules relating to borders."
"The internal-border component reiterates the provisions of the Schengen Convention on the abolition of checks on persons at internal borders and on procedures for the temporary reintroduction of such checks in the event of a threat to public safety or to the internal security of a Member State."
"This regulation adapts these provisions to the institutional framework of the Community."
"As far as the external borders are concerned, the basic principles governing checks at these borders as enshrined in the Schengen Convention and some parts of the common handbook have been more or less reproduced."
"The practicalities for the conduct of these checks are laid down in the annexes and are mostly subject, like the core provisions of the regulation, to the codecision procedure."
"Work began on the Community Code on 2 July 2004 under the Dutch Presidency and has been vigorously pursued throughout the period of the Luxembourg Presidency."
"At the meeting of Coreper on 1 June, a general agreement was reached on the wording of the Code and then, on 13 June, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs unanimously adopted the compromise amendments."
"The Community Code is the first instrument in the field of asylum, immigration, visas and borders to be subject to codecision with Parliament."
"For this reason, its adoption at the first reading is extremely important as a means of establishing, on the one hand, a relationship of mutual trust between Parliament and the Council and, on the other hand, a precedent that can only enhance the efficiency of future work on dossiers examined under the codecision procedure."
"It also demonstrates that codecision is by no means a hindrance to rapid progress but, on the contrary, serves to hasten progress and promote efficiency and, most importantly, that it takes place in a more strongly democratic context."
"The Presidency wishes to thank Parliament, and especially your rapporteur, Mr Cashman, for having worked with the Presidency and the Council in a spirit of openness and transparency but also of mutual trust."
"This collaboration has served to establish compromises which all three institutions can now endorse."
"It is, in fact, thanks to the amendments tabled by Parliament that the Community Border Code guarantees more transparency and greater protection for citizens of the European Union and of non-EU countries."
"I believe there has been much talk of crisis today, of a European Union in crisis."
"We undoubtedly have considerable difficulties, huge difficulties, but I believe that the act we are discussing this evening in preparation for its adoption at first reading tomorrow shows that the European Union is capable of taking decisions, of making progress in the interests of the people and above all, as I indicated before, of progressing democratically with parliamentary support."
"I believe that is the crux of the matter because, in a field that concerns people first and foremost, codecision has finally been given its place, thanks to today’s application of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The Presidency also wishes to thank the Commission for its efforts and for its input, throughout the legislative process, of valuable technical knowledge without which the Code would never have seen the light of day."
"I therefore believe that this is a good evening for Europe."
"We are poised to adopt an important instrument."
"On behalf of the Presidency, I thank Parliament and the Commission for their collaboration."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am pleased to be able to state this evening, as Mr Schmit has just said, that we are achieving a genuinely positive example of institutional cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and that we are doing so by means of an instrument, the codecision process, that is having its first truly important application here today on a subject that affects people’s everyday lives."
"The rapporteur has without doubt carried out some extraordinary work, and the same must be said of the Presidency."
"The Luxembourg Presidency rightly sought to make a commitment – and the Commission has always supported that commitment – to being able to put a balanced provision to the vote in Parliament at first reading."
"This provision has many merits, and it is difficult to point them out in a very few minutes: the first is the balance achieved between the need to confirm the principle of free movement of persons within the Union and the equally crucial requirement for effective controls at the external borders of the European Union."
"The other significant merit is that of having adapted a number of procedures originating in a purely intergovernmental domain to the context of the European Union."
"We have taken a step forward."
"I am referring to the principle of reintroducing internal border controls for obvious reasons of policing, effectively for reasons of security: it was an extremely sensitive subject, and any false move would have been genuinely counterproductive."
"There then follows a positive item for the Commission: the involvement and active participation of the Commission in the process of reintroducing the controls."
"That is another sign, which I believe is important, of how the European Commission can offer a constant and – I am certain of this and I will obviously strive for this – constructive contribution to ensuring the optimum application of that regulation."
"I will conclude by saying, Mr President, that those signs are the signs that the European citizens are waiting for."
"They are signs of faith in a Europe, in a European Union, which is alive, which can continue to make progress and to obtain tangible results."
"Security and freedom are two pillars of the European Union, and there is a good balance in this provision: I would say it is an exemplary case to point out."
". Mr President, it has been a real privilege to work on this dossier, primarily because when we began people told us we would not complete it under the Austrian presidency, let alone under the Luxembourg presidency."
"The importance of this has been underlined by the previous speakers."
"It is the first time that the Parliament has acted in codecision in the area of asylum, immigration and border control."
"It is extremely important that the Parliament dealt with this dossier in a mature, reasonable and practicable way."
"Wish lists are for the past."
"Of course we have not achieved everything that we in Parliament wanted; as we know that is the nature of compromise."
"That is not to say that compromise is a bad word, it is a brilliant word."
"Compromise is the whole notion on which the European project was built in the early 1950s and in 1957."
"I am proud that today we are legislating."
"In this House, and indeed in our other institutions, we talk too much and do not deliver enough."
"Tonight we are legislating and bringing forward changes that will have a real effect on real lives."
"As was mentioned earlier, each of us, especially as politicians, can talk a defining moment into a crisis."
"But what do we achieve in doing this?"
"We actually reinforce the argument from eurosceptics and the europhobes that this House means nothing and achieves nothing."
"We have difficulties, but out of difficulties comes a rebirth, a renaissance."
"Without a renaissance there is nothing for the future."
"So, codecision does not have to be slow, but it has to be thorough and it has to be built on absolute mutual respect for each of the parties involved in the negotiations."
"Why have we have achieved so much?"
"Because we have done it on the basis that only by acting together can we achieve more than we could ever achieve by acting alone."
"I have to thank my fellow rapporteurs."
"There have been no shadows in this report; we have been equal rapporteurs, equal participants and without them we could not have presented this document today."
"I would like to thank Mr Battilocchio for the opinion he gave on behalf of the Committee on Development."
"More importantly, I would like to thank those people who sit behind us – sometimes seen, sometimes unseen: our assistants and our advisers, without whom we could not do this work."
"Those people are so rarely thanked."
"So let me say once again, we have achieved a great deal."
"We have reinforced the role of the Parliament, especially in the re-introduction of internal borders."
"We have reinforced the role of the Commission, but again I wish we could have done more in relation to spot checks on the application of the Schengen , which was not possible."
"I wanted us to have a right of appeal or for the European Court of Justice to have jurisdiction."
"We did not achieve this, but we achieved a great deal more."
"On non-discrimination akin to Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, for example, there is the right of people undergoing second line checks to have those checks conducted with dignity and, if necessary, in a non-public area."
"On refusal of entry, there will be clearer explanations of the justification of that refusal and the right of appeal once the appellant has returned to their country of origin."
"And where appeals are successful, the necessary compensation will be provided according to national law and corrections."
"We have reinforced and upheld the principle of freedom of movement for EU citizens and others with a right to reside which, in a Eurobarometer poll, was seen as the single biggest benefit of being in the European Union."
"As an inclusion to the main body of text, the annexes are extremely important when we come to adopt and review this regulation in future."
"Regular reports on the implementation of the regulation are to be compiled by the Commission."
"Also, very importantly, there is the declaration by the Council and the Parliament on the issue of stateless citizens which states that ‘the European Parliament and the Council request the Commission to bring forward proposals, in the framework of the revision of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, in order to exempt holders of aliens’ and non-citizens’ passports residing in a Member State from the visa obligation’."
"I am proud of what we have done, I am proud of the collaboration and I now wait to hear from my co-rapporteurs."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my capacity of draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development, I should first like to congratulate Mr Cashman on the fine work he has carried out and on his excellent proposal."
"His report supplements and includes a large number of the observations that I had set out in my opinion on this important topic drafted on behalf of the Committee on Development."
"I should also like to highlight the political value of the fact, which in my opinion is very positive, that for the first time the Members of the European Parliament can follow the codecision process in this domain."
"Among the numerous opportunities that would be lost if the process of ratifying the European Constitution foundered, following the ‘no’ votes in France and the Netherlands, would also be that of embarking for the first time upon a policy on immigration shared by all of the Member States."
"On this issue, the European Parliament has over and again established the need to balance the interests of the European citizens, immigrants, the Member States and developing countries."
"The equation is not easy, but an effort is required in order to achieve a balance between the need for security for our countries, which has to be upheld and safeguarded, and a policy of openness towards those who lawfully venture within our borders in search of improved living conditions."
"It should in fact be remembered that, as the European Union, we also have humanitarian duties."
"It is therefore right to implement the necessary controls at border crossings in order to regulate the influx of those seeking visas and asylum, but we cannot, however, avoid adopting a global approach of solidarity and respect for human rights, particularly in humanitarian crisis situations, such as in the recent cases of the tsunami and of Darfur."
"The citizens of third countries have to be thoroughly informed about the immigration rules and about the control methods; the criteria for refusing access have to be objective and verifiable, with a view to preventing the unpleasant, and, alas, frequent episodes of discrimination, which to date still occur."
"Strict controls based on a clear set of rules and respect for the rights of the individual: Community action in this delicate area must be based on this inseparable pairing."
"It will not be easy, but it is a challenge that today’s Europe has to accept and overcome."
". Mr President, my speech this evening is rather incidental, because it relates to the study of the legal basis for the proposed Regulation."
"The rapporteur, at one point, believed that a modification should be proposed, specifically the derogation of Article 22 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, and presented Amendments 85 and 70."
"In accordance with Article 22 of the Convention, foreigners should declare their entry to the competent authorities, either on entry or within three working days of entry, and the Member States should establish the conditions and exceptions in the field."
"The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs raised the issue with the Committee on Legal Affairs and, having studied it, the latter came to the conclusion that that proposed amendment would make it necessary to review the legal basis and that Article 62(1) and Article 62(2) would not be sufficient, but that Article 62(3) of the Treaty would also be necessary, since Article 62(3) of the Treaty refers to the conditions in which third-country nationals can travel freely in the territory of the Member States for a period of no longer than three months."
"That was the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"The rapporteur subsequently reached an agreement with the Committee in this regard and did not consider it necessary to continue with his amendment, and it is not therefore now necessary to change the legal basis."
"In any event, perhaps the only value of this work is that we know that, in the case of the reference to the Schengen Agreements, not only will the reference to paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 62 be necessary, but also the reference to paragraph 3."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal that we are discussing intends to establish a Community code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders."
"It falls within the context of the Treaty of Amsterdam, thanks to which the Schengen has been incorporated within the European framework."
"This is the first real opportunity for this Parliament to deal with the issue in its entirety, keeping in mind the fact that the proposal has been transferred from the consultation process to the codecision process as a result of the decision made by the Council of the Hague."
"This complex and substantial proposal has two main objectives: firstly, to consolidate the rules in force on the crossing of external borders, as laid down in the Schengen framework; secondly, to further develop the subject, particularly with regard to the crossing of internal borders."
"The proposal is broken down into four titles: the first contains general provisions; the second regulates the crossing of external borders and conditions for entry in the Schengen area; the third deals with internal borders, reaffirming the abolition of all border controls and stipulating the cases and the procedures in which such controls can be reintroduced; and the fourth contains the final provisions."
"A large proportion of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur aim at clarifying a number of the elements of the Commission proposal only in terms of the language used."
"Such changes are designed to improve the quality of the text, and, simultaneously, to clarify and simplify the articles."
"All of that will be highly beneficial when the code on the crossing of borders definitively enters into force and becomes an item of everyday reference for the border guards and the authorities."
"The rapporteur has worked commendably, in close cooperation with all of the shadow rapporteurs and political groups, in addition to checking first-hand how the borders are crossed today."
"Thanks to this ongoing dialogue, the rapporteur has fulfilled all of the requests submitted to him."
"He has, moreover, taken part in lengthy negotiations with the Council, with the Luxembourg Presidency, and it is therefore desirable that the report is put to the vote during the current presidency."
"The compromise that has been reached with the various political groups, with the agreement of the Council and the Commission, has been put to the vote and unanimously approved by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"I personally made sure before the vote in committee that Vice-President Frattini’s office was also in favour of the report, and I also received confirmation of this from the very positive outlook on each individual amendment tabled."
"Precisely as a result of this general consensus, which was reached by means of a complex series of bilateral and multilateral compromises, the report should not be subjected to changes at the present time, and it is therefore desirable that it is adopted in full."
"Having followed its development and having thoroughly established that no problem exists, I personally, as shadow rapporteur, propose that, through our vote, we give our full support to the rapporteur, whom I wholeheartedly thank for the valuable work he has carried out."
". Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Cashman and others for a very constructive report."
"Because asylum, refugee policy and immigration are issues to which we in the committee devote a lot of time, it was necessary initially to obtain clear rules on the Community Code and the movement of persons across borders."
"The fact that we can now revise controls and jointly strengthen the external borders means that the EU’s borders become more secure."
"Criminals, drug traffickers and human traffickers who import women and children for the purposes of prostitution will have fewer opportunities to move freely across borders, while other people, despite their foreign appearance, can now feel welcome."
"When, tomorrow, we vote in favour of the report, we shall be able to get to grips with one of the committees’ major tasks: asylum and immigration policy."
"We have so many shared questions about how we in the EU are to safeguard the values referred to."
"We want of course to see a more open EU, but that requires common solutions and respect for countries, as well as respect between countries and between people and groups."
"That is the first step."
"Thank you again for a very constructive report."
". Mr President, it is not mere courtesy that compels me to begin by offering my congratulations to the two architects of the achievement – and I use the term advisedly – that has paved the way for the agreement presented to us today on the basis, I must add, of an excellent proposal from the Commission."
"My thanks go to those who are seated behind Mr Frattini today."
"I wish to thank Mr Cashman, who, in the face of widespread scepticism, in which I initially shared, sought to reach agreement with the Council at first reading."
"Congratulations, Michael!"
"But I also wish to extend my congratulations to the Luxembourg Presidency for showing the necessary drive and tenacity to stay on course while encouraging the essential compromises."
"It is indeed a marvellous Little Big Land, this Grand Duchy of Luxembourg!"
"For my part, I had three particular concerns about this dossier."
"The first was that, while guaranteeing the rights of the beneficiaries of freedom of movement under Community law, the instrument must also keep open the option of conducting the checks required for the identification at external borders of persons registered for refusal of admission and wanted persons."
"The agreement reached on this point, which is reflected in the wording of Article 6(2), corresponds very precisely to the spirit of the amendment I had tabled myself but is an improvement on my proposal, and I am delighted with that."
"It seemed to me – and this was my second concern – that, in cases where nationals of non-EU countries were refused entry to the territory of the Union, their rights ought to be clearly defined and made known to the parties concerned, but at the same time security requirements had to be rigorous."
"The people of Europe do not want their external borders to be controlled by thugs, but neither do they want to have them controlled by blinded and limbless eunuchs."
"The provision that is set out today in Article 11(13) is a good provision, and I am delighted about that – just as I am delighted, Mr President, by the confirmation of the exceptional nature of the reintroduction of checks at external borders and by the more prominent role assigned to the Commission and Parliament."
"In view of these three grounds for satisfaction, it will give me pleasure to vote in favour of this report, and the entire Group will do likewise."
". Mr President, as shadow rapporteur for my group, I should like to extend sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, to all of my counterparts from the other groups and, of course, to the Luxembourg presidency for the work we have done together."
"The various groups within this House have amply demonstrated their ability to cooperate jointly and effectively, both among themselves and with the Council."
"Let me give an example of the sort of case that could occur, the sort of case with which we were faced when we began work on this dossier."
"A citizen of a third country wishing to enter the EU, and holding a visa to do so, could be refused entry if he was unable to produce all the required documents at a border crossing point."
"This would have resulted in a stamp being placed in his passport showing that he had been refused entry to the EU."
"It is hardly likely that the person in question would then have been able to travel to the USA, Canada or Australia with a stamp of this kind in his passport."
"The point I should particularly like to emphasise is therefore that we have succeeded in enshrining the right to appeal in the regulation, following lengthy negotiations. The most important consequence of this is that all stamps indicating refusal of entry into the EU will be corrected in cases where entry has been refused for no good reason."
"We have also achieved other, equally significant improvements for third–country nationals."
"Human dignity must be respected during border controls, and discrimination on any grounds is prohibited."
"In a nutshell, our joint efforts have resulted in a solution which means that checks on those crossing the EU’s external borders will become a great deal more welcoming."
"Mr President, as the final Member speaking in this debate can I emphasise that I was not a shadow, but I have learned a great deal from the way Mr Cashman has achieved agreement on the most difficult of subjects, dealing with sensitive issues like the reintroduction of border checks, creating a balance between security post-9/11 and all the benefits of Schengen free movement and respecting the dignity of people, particularly from third countries, who want to enter the Union."
"Doing all of that within a codecision procedure is a great achievement and we have learned a lot from the way that cooperation has taken place."
"It is also a great success because Members like me have observed that reaching a compromise between security at border control on the one hand, and fairness on the other, is very difficult."
"Therefore I commend in this report – the first time in a codecision report since the Article 13 directives went through this Parliament – the fact that we have an explicit reference to anti-discrimination and to the dignity of people while carrying out border checks."
"There is a huge hidden minority of people that are harassed and victimised at borders."
"Mr Cashman has understood this, he has put it explicitly in his report and he has created the balance that we all wanted to see."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the debate on the report by Bogdan Klich, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on Security Research (2004/2171(INI)) (A6-0103/2005)."
". Mr President, it has been a pleasure to draft this report for two reasons."
"The first of these is the excellent cooperation on the part of both the committees that have delivered opinions, namely the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and on the part of the vast majority of political groups, in particular the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group."
"The second reason is that the Commission has made an extremely valuable contribution on points of substance."
"The European Security Strategy states that there are currently a great many new threats and challenges to our security, the most significant of which include the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the spread of international terrorism."
"It is a fact of life that the kind of terrorism to which Europe grew accustomed in the 1960s and 1970s has been replaced by a new kind of terrorism that affects many more people and is far more deadly and dangerous."
"What this means is that the objectives of maintaining public security and making our security and defence policy credible are hard to achieve nowadays without high-tech tools."
"The European Union currently invests four times less in the defence sector and five times less in research and development than the United States."
"The result of this is that EU Member States are not in a position to close the technology gap that exists between the United States and Europe in terms of defence potential and security."
"Accordingly, in response to this need for more effective security research, the Commission has proposed a European Security Research Programme, due to be launched in two years’ time under the umbrella of the Seventh Framework Programme."
"The European Security Research Programme will be based on a coherent, flexible and coordinated approach, and will focus on research projects that enhance our technological capabilities."
"The approach currently taken to security research at the highest EU level lacks coherence."
"This leads to extensive fragmentation and weak cooperation between Member States, and also makes such research less cost-effective."
"The establishment of a European Security Research Programme will therefore facilitate both interoperability and cost optimisation by putting in place common frameworks and structures at European level."
"The Programme provides for the exploitation of synergies between defence and civil research, so it can be expected to boost the integration of these two sectors."
"What is more, Parliament’s adoption of the Programme, the proposed annual budget for which is EUR 1 billion in addition to any research funding already earmarked for this sector by the individual Member States, should serve to narrow the gap that currently exists between the EU Member States and the United States."
"Strengthening our research base and finding more innovative solutions is bound to enhance Europe’s competitiveness."
"It is anticipated that this Programme will be an excellent opportunity for European industry, and also for our research centres."
"I have in mind all such centres, academic, non-academic, civil and defence ones. The Programme will undoubtedly improve external border protection and make it possible to modernise the armed forces of the EU Member States."
"The report refers to several priority areas of interest, of which I shall only mention a few."
"They include the fields of C4ISR systems, or in other words command, control, communications, computing, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and also research in the field of biotechnology and space and IT technology."
"The report also encourages the Commission to support research in the field of social sciences, without which appropriate planning of research into modern technologies is inconceivable."
"I have to say, and it gives me great satisfaction to do so, that this would appear to be the key contribution made by Parliament to the Commission’s proposal, namely that any discussion of advanced technological research must first focus on support for such research."
"Given that defence-related issues are at the top of the political agenda, there is every likelihood that this Programme will enable us to increase security and make it easier to achieve the EU’s objectives."
"Mr President, I would therefore strongly recommend that the House vote in favour of this report."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss security research with the House today, and I should like to express my thanks for the recommendations and suggestions you have made to the Commission."
"Security is an essential component of a number of different EU policy areas, including the common foreign and security policy and the area of freedom, security and justice."
"At the same time, however, security is also a basic requirement for prosperity and growth and, as such, indispensable for achieving the economic policy goals of the Lisbon Agenda."
"We need the best tools available if we are to be able to meet challenges to public safety, and we also need a strong knowledge and technology base."
"Research at both national and European level is required to create such a base, and it was for this reason that the Group of Personalities made the following recommendation to the Commission one year ago; ‘technology alone cannot guarantee security, but security without technology is impossible’."
"Security managers, industry and the public are among those who benefit from security research, and, in order to meet their high expectations, consistency must be achieved between its various facets."
"Firstly, this research must actively help to create a social and business environment which is conducive to positive economic development and which lays the groundwork for prosperity, as this will ensure that it acts as a driving force for growth and employment in Europe."
"It must also enhance the competitiveness of the European security industry, and in fact the European Security Research Programme will help create and extend a European market for security products."
"A further aim of the Programme will be to focus on civil security matters."
"Although research of this kind falls within the remit of the European Defence Agency, those working in the field of civil security research maintain close contacts with the latter in order to address the dual-use aspects of security technologies."
"Finally, there is no escaping the fact that security research is a particularly sensitive sector with very specific requirements, which include intellectual property rights, the spread of information, cooperation with third parties – including those outside the EU – and the level of Community contributions."
"Security research is one half of the two-fold thematic priority ‘Security and Space’, which falls within the specific programme ‘Cooperation’ under the Seventh Research Programme."
"Current proposals provide for an annual budget of around EUR 500 million."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament’s report calls for an annual budget of EUR 1 billion, as proposed by the Group of Personalities."
"Security research under the Seventh Framework Programme will focus on the following areas; protection against terrorism and crime, security of infrastructures and utilities, border protection and restoring security in case of crisis."
"These four topics will be supported by a number of horizontal areas, namely systems integration and interoperability, security and society and coordinating and structuring research."
"The European Security Research Advisory Board will play a leading role in helping to develop a longer-term vision, as it will act as a forum where users and the Commission discuss the structure of the Research Programme."
"As proposed in the report on security research, and in order to ensure that Parliament is properly represented, Vice-President Verheugen has invited five committees to appoint representatives to act as observers on the European Security Research Advisory Board."
"Parliament has always backed the current Preparatory Action for Security Research, and this backing has been much appreciated."
"It is for this reason that we welcome the report upon which this House will vote, and which was drafted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs together with the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"I should also like to thank Parliament for giving its consent to security research in general during the debate on the Seventh Framework Programme, and in particular with regard to funding for the Preparatory Actions."
"The Commission will be happy to continue submitting reports on the implementation of the Preparatory Action until such a time as implementation of the European Security Research Programme becomes possible under the umbrella of the Seventh Research Framework Programme."
"Security research will focus on activities that provide a distinct European added value compared to national measures."
"This will allow us to take action at Community level that enhances the competitiveness of the security industry, allows us to progress towards the Lisbon goals and helps our society as a whole to feel and be safer."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur once again for his work."
". Mr President, as representative of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I would firstly like to thank and congratulate Mr Klich on his wonderful report."
"Our contribution fundamentally consists of setting objectives optimising resources, clarifying responsibilities, classifying security research as of public interest — a fundamental and extremely important issue — providing great impetus, by means of research, for interoperability, which is so necessary in crisis situations, not so much in terms of prevention but in terms of response to and resolution of those crises, and advocating the need for adequate funding, linking security research entirely to gross domestic product, hence taking account of the economic weight of States and not allowing research in this field to be subject to considerable fluctuations in available budget."
"Finally, Mr President, I believe that we will have a European programme for security research within the seventh framework programme and a plural, technical and political advisory committee."
"By means of these research formulae, we are going to improve one of our greatest weaknesses, the so-called C4ISR — control, intelligence and monitoring systems — and it can only be corrected by means of the correct application of European research policies, without any links to or dependency on third parties."
"It is essential to increase the efficiency of progress with the sensor system, biotechnology, space and communication technologies."
"I would therefore like once again, Mr President, to congratulate Mr Klich on having dealt with this report of such essential importance."
". We live in a time that demands rapid response to global changes and security threats."
"When we attempt to formulate and define a policy of common security research, this does not involve irrational fears or ideology, but a very rational policy that will enable a higher degree of security for European citizens."
"The dangers and threats demand that the problem is dealt with on a European level."
"And security research, as set out, represents a tool for increasing European competitiveness and achieving the Lisbon objectives."
"Indeed it represents an area that signifies major research, innovation and technological potential for the European Union."
"In this light I would like to express great concern at the potentially fatal consequences that might be suffered by the area of security research if there is no suitable agreement on the financial perspective."
"If the Council does not follow the guidelines of Parliament and the original proposal from the Commission, there is a serious fear of the termination of new programmes that are now still included in the seventh framework programme."
"These new programmes include security research."
"It must be stated clearly that without adequate financial support, we cannot expect good results."
"The Kok report has already set out the clear finding that responsibility for achieving the Lisbon objectives lies first and foremost with the Member States, both in decision-making at home and in decision-making on the European level."
"I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to give their determined support in the negotiations on the financial perspective to mechanisms that will enable the achieving of the Lisbon strategy, and thereby security research."
"This is indeed important for each individual Member State, and in view of the numerous synergy effects, also for the European integration processes."
". – Mr President, the proposal by the European Commission to create a European Security Research Programme is an initiative which moves in the right direction."
"Both the European Council, with the European security strategy adopted in December 2003, and the European Parliament, in its resolution in April 2005, have highlighted the need to combat international dangers and challenges by reinforcing European defence and security policy and the common foreign policy and defence and security policy."
"However, the problem is not only institutional and political."
"It is, at the same time, operational."
"It is a question of the effective application of the decisions taken at the level of the European institutions."
"Consequently, it is also linked to the ability of the European Union to proceed more quickly in the sectors of research, technology and innovation for European security."
"Our objective must not be blind competition with the United States."
"However, it is true that, when investment by the United States is compared with investment by the European Union in internal security and even in the arms industry and defence equipment, the European Union and the Member States are, unfortunately, much worse off."
"The European Union must move forward, because it has every interest in avoiding dependence and, at the same time, securing its interests, the interests of the Member States and the security and protection of European citizens."
"It is also in its interest for the European Union to strengthen research programmes and policies and to contribute to economic development, to the strengthening of competitiveness and to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The proposal to integrate this programme into the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union is particularly important, as is the proposal to give it an annual budget of EUR one billion."
"The European Security Research Programme must not be one-sidedly orientated towards technology research."
"Balanced development of research is needed which will also cover the fields of political, social and human sciences."
"If they are to be combated effectively, the problems of international terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration need a broader approach, not for research to be encaged in a militaristic or police-state philosophy."
"One of the main goals of the Programme is the protection of outside borders and basic infrastructures."
"These are important goals which relate to the security of the European Union, because they strengthen the visibility of the Programme to European citizens."
"Finally, I believe that we need to ensure, as the European Union, that security research does not undermine our collective principles and values about the protection of human rights and political and democratic freedoms."
"Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Klich, and to say that our group will be voting in favour of his report tomorrow."
". – Mr President, it has almost become routine in this Chamber for us to have a legislative framework against terrorism in every plenary session."
"Every measure we take against terrorism, which we cannot be sure will be effective against it, is by definition harmful to democracy and human rights."
"In order to deal with terrorists, we have made our life difficult and, at the same time, we demean the life of citizens: body searches, microphones, cameras; none of this promotes democracy."
"Despite its pretty words, this report also moves in the same direction."
"Terrorism started to show its teeth thirty years ago."
"Then we said that the Stasi, the KGB and Gaddafi were behind it."
"Remember the aeroplane hijacks."
"Now there is no Stasi, there is no Gaddafi, there is no KGB."
"How does terrorism develop?"
"Who feeds it?"
"Another issue which it raises is why terrorists hit certain specific countries."
"Perhaps they hit the big countries?"
"Then why do they not hit China, Brazil or Canada?"
"Why did the last generation of terrorists choose to pick on Spain out of all the European countries?"
"My country organised Olympic Games, squandered billions of euros of taxpayers' money and yet the terrorists did not hit us, which they could very well have done."
"We need therefore to learn a lesson: violence begets violence."
"In order to stop terrorism, we invaded two countries: Afghanistan and Iran."
"As a result, opium went up in Afghanistan, the opium which is killing our children, including many in Greece, while in Iran oil went up from USD 20 to 60 a barrel."
"We have new reports against terrorism and yet no report puts Mr Bush, who brought us to this point, in his place."
"Mr Blair, Mr Bush's field marshal, will be here tomorrow."
"So let us tell him that he owes us much more than he gives us, because the price of oil has risen from USD 20 to 60 a barrel, with the result that people are unable to pay and we are in this difficult position."
"Yes, money against terrorism but, above all of course, a policy for the people of Europe."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
". – Τhe next item is the debate on the report by Catherine Trautmann, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the information society (2004/2204(INI)) (A6-0172/2005)."
". Mr President, my report deals with the World Summit on the Information Society, a process initiated by the United Nations."
"The first phase took place in Geneva in 2003 and concluded with the adoption of a declaration of principles and a plan of action."
"The second phase, which will take place in Tunis this November, will focus on the implementation of the plan and on two unresolved issues, namely financing the plan of action and governance of the Internet."
"The European Union has engaged in this process with a coordinated position and considerable authority, because it can speak with one voice."
"If my fellow Members adopt this resolution, our Parliament will underpin the position of the Union and signal its commitment to the success of the process."
"Information and communication technology, ICT, plays an integral part in the pursuit of the Millennium Goals, which are all about the elimination of poverty."
"The war on poverty focuses on material necessities but it also involves access to online services, whether these be educational, health-related, administrative or commercial."
"The rise of the Internet and of mobile telephony has created new potential for development, competitiveness and growth."
"Europe suffers from four dimensions of the digital divide: geographical, social, economic and cultural."
"This divide is even deeper in the least-developed countries, or LDCs, which have neither an adequate infrastructure nor the means to provide mass access to these forms of technology."
"The first issue to emphasise is the contribution of ICT to democracy."
"It is an essential means of reducing inequality and promoting human dignity as well as of guaranteeing freedom of expression and information, pluralism of opinion and popular involvement in decision-making processes."
"It is imperative that these human rights be respected in the information society."
"The concern of the World Summit to ensure that a better regulatory framework, an appropriate system of governance, is created to avert the risks and aberrations that might jeopardise the security and integrity of individuals, organisations and even governments, cannot justify failure to respect these rights."
"Cultural and linguistic diversity should be one of the driving forces of the progress initiated by the World Summit."
"Such diversity is easier to achieve in a democratic context, and our Parliament has a duty to point this out to Tunisia, which will be hosting the summit."
"The second issue is the need for a new form of partnership with the countries of the South."
"These countries require confidence and the prospect of long-term stability before they can act."
"Cancelling the debt of the poorest countries is a good thing as long as it does not reduce their access to funding."
"Merely substituting donations for access to lending facilities would be ineffective."
"The European Union did not want a new fund to be created at the United Nations for the purpose of encouraging cooperative ventures, since it would entail the mobilisation of the existing funds allocated to our own development programmes, to the framework programme for research and development and to the Competitiveness and Innovation programme."
"In the same vein, I have suggested that unused development appropriations be allocated to the plan of action."
"The creation of the Digital Solidarity Fund on a voluntary basis is to be welcomed, but the Fund remains a complementary instrument."
"The Union should give preference to multipartite initiatives involving national governments, the private sector, local and/or regional authorities and NGOs."
"People using ICT should be involved as users and players, thereby helping to ensure that ICT-based services promote the quality of life, the development of entrepreneurial activity and the production of content with due respect for local cultures and local know-how."
"Multipartite ventures are an indicator of confidence and mobilisation."
"Before our representatives leave for Tunis, incidentally, our Parliament will meet interested parties from civil society in order to establish a durable working relationship."
"In conclusion, let me say that the key aim is the promotion of fair and sustainable development."
"This is the essence of our vision of an inclusive information society."
"It is for this reason that I should like the timetables for the Lisbon and i2010 strategies to be linked to the plan of action and the involvement of the European Union to be considered in terms of shared development and shared responsibility."
"Our partners, like ourselves, should be assured of a voice in the system of governance and of the preservation of their sovereign decision-making powers."
"Whether in the field of health care, prevention, environmental risks, waste management or conservation of resources, we are interdependent."
"European growth is inconceivable without solidarity."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this report on the information society, dealing with the UN World Summit in Tunis in November, is a useful and timely initiative."
"It confirms the interest you have already shown in this summit, both through the participation of several Members of Parliament in the Geneva session in December 2003 and through your regular debates on the information society."
"The Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the summit and is also devoting considerable efforts to it in close liaison with the Member States."
"This is no coincidence, for the vision of the information society adopted by the international community in the UN framework is in line with European thinking, which extends beyond the technological dimension to encompass the impact of the relevant technology on society and social welfare."
"I should therefore like to emphasise our concordance of views with the analysis presented by Mrs Trautmann and to tell you how much the Commission appreciates the work that has been done on its behalf."
"Indeed, the report clearly identifies the main issues of the summit, namely the development dimension and the importance of the social component of the digital divide, the role of technology in improving essential public services, in increasing popular participation in decision-making processes and, ultimately, in developing participatory democracy."
"The same applies to the subjects on the agenda, such as governance of the Internet, financing, partnerships and the follow-up to the summit."
"In addition, your report rightly stresses the significance of a consistent approach on the part of the Community. It also underlines the importance of participation by civil society and mobilisation of the private sector."
"For the future, it supports the Commission’s proposals in general and proposes a follow-up focusing on targeted initiatives in the various areas of Community competence."
"In this context, I should like to inform you that, on 2 June of this year, the Commission adopted a communication which lays the foundations of the European position for the summit, a position that the Council should set out in the form of conclusions in Luxembourg this coming Monday."
"What we expect from Tunis may be summed up as follows: confirmation of the Geneva declaration on an inclusive information society respecting human rights, freedom of expression and cultural and linguistic diversity; a summit focused on action and devoting its attention to a limited number of priorities; an agreement on financing which will result in higher priority being attached to information and communication technology within the existing mechanisms and which incorporates the Digital Solidarity Fund created in Geneva."
"The Internet has become an essential resource for all countries; for this reason, we should be committed to a more international form of governance of the Internet, the practicalities of which must be compatible with the responsibility of governments to their citizens."
"A new model of cooperation is needed in order to translate into practice the provisions of the declaration of principles adopted at the Geneva summit relating to the crucial role of all parties involved in this governance."
"As far as the follow-up to the summit is concerned, our wish is for a simple, effective, decentralised solution that makes use of existing organisations and their coordination mechanisms."
"Lastly, I should like to say to the rapporteur and her collaborators that I share their concern about the human-rights situation in Tunisia."
"The situation is far from satisfactory in many areas, particularly as regards freedom of expression and association."
"For my part, I have taken every available opportunity to express the view that the host country of a summit must be irreproachable in its adherence to the principles approved at preceding summits."
"I also attach great importance to the full participation of NGOs at the Tunis summit, and I should like to say to Mrs Trautmann that I shall, if at all possible, attend the hearing she is organising to consult the European NGOs prior to the summit."
"In conclusion, I wish to congratulate your Assembly on this report and to assure you that the Commission will heed your recommendations and follow them up."
"Let me also express my conviction that the message you are delivering will strengthen the position of the European Union in the global arena."
". Mr President, I would firstly like to welcome the report on the information society by Mrs Trautmann and congratulate her on the excellent work she has done."
"With a view to the second phase of the World Summit on the Information Society, that will take place in Tunisia in November, and also in view of the Millennium Objectives of the United Nations and the Lisbon Strategy, the rapporteur has included all the considerations relating to information and communication technologies and the information society, from an economic point of view and also from technological, social and cultural points of view."
"In the field that concerns me in particular, the cultural field, the report has incorporated the suggestions of this Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education: it states that the information society must be open to everybody and education, training and digital literacy are priority fields in terms of creating an inclusive information society which helps to overcome digital fragmentation and guarantees access to basic technologies under equal conditions, and also helps the citizens to participate in political decision-making, with a view to strengthening democracy, though always moving in the direction laid down in the Lisbon Strategy."
"It also indicates that, as well as presenting risks, the information society also offers an opportunity to promote intercultural dialogue and to guarantee freedom of expression and information, cultural diversity and multilingualism."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in this respect, our reflection is complete."
"It is now time to turn these priorities into real actions, and in order to do so we also need a good budget."
"It is pointless to carry on working and talking about priorities unless we have a budget to back them up."
"Genuine political will is expressed through commitments and, as the Commission also indicated in its Communication on ‘i2010 – A European Information Society for growth and employment’, the information society is a key factor which must also be considered, given its significant impact on economic growth, employment and social cohesion."
"It is therefore urgent that we organise a debate at European level, together with the governments of the Member States, and consider how we are going to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in a Europe of 25 with a budget of just 1% of Community revenue."
"Unless we leave aside exclusively State interests, leave aside the focus on the ‘me’ and think of ‘us’, in Europe, our political will will be called seriously into question, if it has not already."
". Mr President, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats sets great store by this House’s active involvement in the second world summit on the information society."
"After Geneva, we have now reached a second phase. We therefore greatly appreciate Mrs Trautmann’s own-initiative report and also her way of going about things."
"Although she managed to organise the dialogue between the groups in a very fruitful and sound manner, she also knows that we have some critical comments to make about the presentation of the report."
"The title of the report ‘On the information society’ is very ambitious and broad indeed, but what is it about?"
"It is about Parliament expressing an opinion and making its contribution to the conference of 16 to 18 November 2005."
"That is why we suggested she should choose less ambitious and more direct wording along the lines of ‘The world summit on the information society, second phase’."
"This would also be more in keeping with Mrs Reding’s communication."
"As I said, our group greatly appreciates this discussion and active participation."
"Access to the Internet, special attention to ICT and education all over the world, on-line government and truly participatory democracy are crucial."
"High-level ICT is not only central to our Lisbon agenda but also, and specifically, to its implications for the developing countries."
"A combination of education and development of networks and corresponding services is of major importance for developing countries."
"We would do well to consider what support the EU can offer in this context."
"I would now like to turn to the instruments that we discussed."
"The PPE-DE Group advocates a framework of independent regulatory authorities guaranteeing access, freedom of expression and information, cultural diversity and multilingualism."
"We are therefore opposed to even more rules and regulations, and we support the existing current basis for on-line government."
"Having also debated the free and public search programmes, we will not be backing the amendments that have been tabled concerning them."
"Last week, as we just heard, Mrs Reding unfolded her plans for 2010."
"She places ICT in the context of the development of economic growth and job creation, and this something that we welcome."
"This is where economic growth and a social model fit together very well."
"In 2010, the emphasis is on a competitive and open internal market, on increasing EU investments, information and communication technology and on promoting a universally accessible information society in order to narrow the gap between the haves and have-nots."
"This is what ties in with EU policy, for the gap is still enormous."
"We in the PPE-DE Group are very keen that there should be projects at global level to flesh out, and it goes without saying that this means that a financial basis is urgently needed."
"It can hardly be said that the past weeks have increased confidence in this area."
"That will be the subject of a follow-up debate."
". Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Trautmann for her excellent report which, to a large extent, has incorporated our concerns by means of amendments."
"At the same time, I would like to express our profound concern about the human rights situation in the host country, which we believe to be very critical."
"I would like the Commission to take action in this regard in order to ensure the participation of civil society in the coming Summit."
"Furthermore, I would like to express my perplexity at the possible and imminent extension of software patents, which could represent a very considerable obstacle to access to the Internet, access to information, above all in the countries of the South."
"We find it unacceptable that, in the countries of the South, a few large multinational companies create a dependency in the field of the Internet from the outset."
"Instead, we believe that the European Union’s support and financial aid should be aimed at promoting free and open software in those countries, which require interoperative systems, as indicated in Mrs Trautmann's excellent report."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Mrs Trautmann for her excellent report, which addresses, , the topic of eliminating the digital divide."
"It is an issue of balanced development, but above all of social equality."
"With this in mind, information technology is a fundamental element for constructing a more culturally-rich and more unified society."
"The information society has to be accessible to all: an element of democracy that takes account of cultural diversities and that promotes the participation of the citizens, who are involved parties and not only consumers."
"The role of public investment is fundamental in order to safeguard the accessible character of information technology, for instance, in ensuring the development of free software and its adoption within public administration."
"There is, moreover, the issue of governance, which Europe has to address in order to establish a control mechanism at international level."
"The mandate of the ICANN is about to expire."
"It is a matter of ensuring the representativeness and the legitimacy of the new organisation managing the Internet, by establishing governance with various players: governments, NGOs, private sector, and civil society, each with its own role and clear obligations."
"In drafting the proposal, the fact that knowledge, as an instrument of development and of freedom, is a common asset should be reaffirmed."
"Worrying signs are, however, emerging from the Council, which are at odds with this."
"By means of the directive on the patenting of software, the right to free movement of knowledge is attacked, challenging the objective of the information society becoming accessible to all and thus undermining the very foundations of the Lisbon Strategy."
". Mr President, thank you for giving me this opportunity."
"The Commissioner and rapporteur have done some excellent work."
"The new information and communication technologies can help promote European democracy, skills and expertise, and competitiveness."
"The Union’s legislation must, however, ensure that this is actually the case."
"New communications media, such as the mobile television, will open up new opportunities for small producers."
"Mobile communications are not affected by restrictions such as prime time viewing or viewing times that are too short."
"In other words, everyone can in principle watch television when they like."
"I would propose that the Commission should set up a programme to support small European producers of these new media; for example, the mobile television."
"That way we would bring about an increase in much needed, distinctive and versatile software."
"A multicultural Europe is just the right basis for that, and, consequently, as Europeans, we would find our place in these new communication technologies."
"As legislators, we have a democratic and cultural duty to prevent centralisation of the sector."
"That is a problem we all have in common."
"The same giant companies now own not only the television, radio and press institutions but also the mobile communications technologies, and this kind of homogeneity presents us with a major challenge, because diversified communication is absolutely essential for us to develop a knowledge-based economy."
"The Commission should therefore take a close look at the viability of markets and access to a diverse culture and information in different countries, different media and different content."
"Mr President, Commissioner Reding, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Paasilinna, today we are discussing the future not only of Europe, but also of the international information society."
"Europe has every chance of setting an example to the rest of the world in this field, particularly since the information society plays a leading role in the Lisbon Strategy, the main objectives of which are growth and employment."
"Our task must be to show people that what growth really means is how much they have in the bank at the end of each month."
"We must also show them that increases in employment, or in other words in the number of people in work, mean that we can spend more on welfare benefits, whether in the case of pensions, students or universities."
"The digital divide plays a key role in this respect; to take but one example, family businesses in developing countries lack the basics not only in terms of hardware and software, but above all in terms of training."
"The focus of our efforts must be on promoting the role of Internet-based professional training. The Internet is also home to a wealth of cultural and linguistic diversity – another example of which can be seen in this House, with its 20 languages – and so it opens up a wide range of possibilities for achieving what must be our main goal, namely encouraging growth and employment throughout the world."
"Health is another factor that must not be neglected, as it will be a key determinant of future welfare spending."
"The provision of Internet-based information on health, prevention and awareness of the causes of disease will have a major impact on such spending, and will be most useful in the case of diseases of old age."
"It is for this reason that research, development and trade are of absolutely vital importance, as are family businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I would ask the Commissioner to ensure that such issues take centre stage in Tunis."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her good work, which I support entirely."
"Commissioner, the Tunisia Summit must demonstrate the political will of the European Union and the Member States to promote information and communication technologies as a strategic instrument for economic and social development, and also for cooperation."
"The European Union’s leadership with regard to cooperation with developing countries undoubtedly offers those countries an opportunity to open up to the information society to the benefit of everybody."
"Two issues concern me, however."
"The first is the funding of the action plan."
"The World Digital Solidarity Fund is clearly insufficient, given its voluntary nature, and we must therefore mobilise more financial resources, whether they be development, structural or other new resources."
"I am sure that the citizens would support us in this; the last Eurobarometer confirmed this: 71% of Europeans want more emphasis and more resources to be dedicated to the information society."
"And if we reach an agreement on the new financial perspectives, we in the European Union have the opportunity to take advantage of the priority, already expressed by the next Presidency of the Council, attached to promoting greater establishment and development of information and communication technologies."
"Secondly, with regard to the governance of the Internet and in view of the approaching conclusion of the ICANN, a new model must be created that is based on an international organisation and in which political decisions are reserved for governments and technical tasks for the industry and the private sector, undoubtedly with a flexible operation that reconciles decision making with the participation of all the States."
"That model, ladies and gentlemen, must also ensure the participation of civil society, through the creation of a discussion forum to respond to the challenges and problems raised by the development of the Internet; only in that way will our true support for the information society be credible."
"Mr President, I hope you will not think me a kill-joy at this late hour, but I would like to touch on something negative relating to the report, which I otherwise support and believe to be good."
"This negative thing is a phenomenon that can be described using the increasingly familiar expression ‘e-apathy’."
"The Trautmann report is undoubtedly correct when it asserts that ICT development must serve to strengthen democracy and citizens’ interests, so as to make people participants and not simply consumers in the information society."
"This really is our only possible goal, but we must see the obstacles too."
"E-apathy is one of these obstacles."
"In Hungary today, for example, only one in every four adults uses the Internet regularly."
"Meanwhile, the vast majority of non-users insist that they do not need it, or are simply not interested."
"This example is not unique."
"The ratio is similar in the majority of the new Member States."
"To a significant share of the population the advantages and opportunities provided by the Internet appear ambivalent."
"In these Member States, development of the services sector and infrastructure could easily become asymmetrical as a result, since a significant portion of society, lacking the appropriate motivation, is passive or dismissive towards the implementation of costly systems."
"All of this of course could also bring about asymmetry in the relationship between the old and new Member States."
"It is in our common interest to avoid this and strengthen cohesion in this area too."
"We must therefore do everything we can to reinforce -inclusion by ensuring more vigorous, clearer and more intelligible communication than hitherto."
"And we must also give priority to dispelling engrained negative attitudes and misconceptions surrounding the new medium, alongside emphasising its positive attributes."
"I am confident that the report has taken a step in this direction and so I support it, and of course I too congratulate Mrs Trautmann and thank her for her work."
"Nowadays, information and communication technologies most certainly rank among the main contributing factors to economic growth and sustainable development."
"Alongside the fact that they increase productivity and promote inclusion in society, this transition to the age of digital communication is also a cause of exclusion from society, especially if users or citizens are insufficiently aware of the advantages, or are not capable of using our modern acquisitions."
"It is therefore extremely important that we invest in the development of the information society, and at the same time in education for the use of modern technology even in the earliest stages of school education."
"On the other hand, society should not exclude older people who are still afraid to use modern communication and modern media."
"Many cases are known where citizens have preferred to retire or become unemployed rather than adapt to using computers."
"At today’s rapid pace we have trouble keeping up with what is new, and this will be repeated from generation to generation."
"There exists, therefore, the danger of elite groups emerging, owing to exclusion from the information society."
"Given that we perform an increasing number of services by modern means and a declining number on paper, there is the possibility of discrimination emerging owing to a lack of knowledge and experience in this area."
"For this reason, in addition to development, society must ensure the possibility of education for all strata of the population and for all age groups."
"Equally important is that great attention should be paid to the security of using modern technology and communication, and that trust will grow through development and the possibility of misuse will diminish."
"Institutions offering these services must advise consumers of the possibility of dangers, while at the same time giving them guarantees against misuse."
"Mr President, it was developments in information technology that broke the monopoly of Communist censorship in the 1980s, and helped bring democracy to our part of Europe."
"We must now go one step further."
"The next challenge awaiting us is the development of an information society, in which technology and communications are used to enforce human rights standards effectively at international, national and regional levels."
"While building this information society, we must focus not only on the obvious tasks of promoting and constructing basic infrastructure, but also and above all, on education."
"By this I mean firstly primary education, in order to ensure that no one feels scared of technological progress, and secondly education on media content, which would allow young people to take a critical and creative approach to all forms of media."
"The information society entails free and unrestricted access to technology and information, and this is why I believe that software patents would mean certain death for such a society."
"Grim dictatorships, motivated by the fear of certain ideas, still find ways of blocking access to information."
"There is nothing new in this."
"A law has been adopted in Cuba restricting Internet access to selected businesses and government offices, and banning the sale of computers to the public."
"Only 6 000 of the 100 000 computers in Cuba are connected to international networks, and even these are kept under close control."
"The Belarussian Government is also well aware of the potential role of the Internet in developing civil society and democracy, and it uses every means at its disposal to curb its growing popularity."
"A new law has been drafted on the mass media. , this law provides for mandatory registration and makes it necessary for Internet-based publishers to obtain what is known as a publishing licence."
"In reality, the latter will act as a powerful instrument of censorship."
"A further characteristic feature of the situation in Belarus is the fact that the state is the only Internet provider, as there are no other operators in the country with access to external telecommunications services."
"The Belarussian Ministry of Communications requires all Internet users to obtain authorisation for their modems at a cost of USD 20, even though the average monthly income per capita is USD 60."
"There is no escaping the conclusion that this issue must also be a focus of our activities."
"Mr President, I must apologise to the Commissioner because, as she probably knows, I do not normally make a practice of turning up just in time to speak."
"Unusually, everything has run very early tonight."
"I am pleased to be here to support Mrs Trautmann’s report, particularly because I was part of the delegation that went to the first World Summit on the Information Society in December 2003 with her distinguished predecessor, Erkki Liikanen."
"I was privileged to be there in the great chamber in Geneva when he made a very eloquent speech on behalf of the European Union."
"I can tell colleagues from that experience that it is quite clear how respected the European Union has been and continues to be within the whole process of developing the work of the information society."
"It has given a clear lead to other member states as well."
"I am sure that Commissioner Reding will want to continue that important tradition, because there is much work to be done."
"I want to underline two points that were emphasised to me during that time in Geneva."
"The first is the importance of our research programme and spreading that research programme out to the less-developed world."
"There are many computer scientists struggling with totally inadequate facilities who would really like to be on our research networks and working with our research scientists."
"I know that part of the next generation of the ‘Geant’ programme, which the Commissioner launched last week, will address that issue."
"I cannot overstate the importance of that, particularly because we want those computer scientists to develop the tools, products, services and new ideas that will help their communities, whether it is in health, education or other forms of local service provision, particularly over a very widespread area and one where communications are very light."
"Secondly, there is the importance of encouraging them to have a competitive infrastructure for telecommunications, to bring those costs down, to encourage competition so they can have the same access as us to plentiful, cheap services."
"If we can achieve those two things, along with the other things, it will be a tremendous advance for all those countries."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"– Τhe next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Marcin Libicki, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the Lloyd's affair (O-0068/2005 – B6-0245/2005)."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, Mr Libicki, has asked me to state the following on his behalf, due to his sudden departure for Poland."
"Everything which is said only reflects the position of the Committee on Petitions and not that of any political group or of me personally."
"The Chairman, Mr Libicki, asks the House and the committee to excuse his absence."
"The debate this evening, moved by the oral question tabled on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, touches the very core that many people have in mind when they talk of a Europe of the citizens or, more specifically, of European nationality."
"The right to petition, as enshrined in the Treaty, implies obligations for all the European institutions, not just Parliament."
"Every citizen has the right to petition Parliament within the framework of the activities of the European Union and to expect a satisfactory response; to expect that, where there is infringement in matters which touch on the competences of the European Union, there will be reparation."
"The debate on the petitions relating to the Lloyd's affair seeks an honest reply from the Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties."
"If a European law has not been applied correctly by a Member State for a great many years; if, indeed, incorrect application has also resulted in serious personal losses and, in certain cases, pushed people to the point at which they end their lives; if it is true that the petitioners in the Lloyd's affair in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany and numerous other countries in the European Union suffered huge financial losses because the First Non-Life Insurance Directive was not applied correctly, then this matter must make all of us think about how Europe operates."
"Citizens have the right to expect that, when the Council and Parliament adopt legislation, it is applied correctly in the Member States of the European Union without exception."
"It has come to our attention that the petitioners in 1997 in the United Kingdom have stated that the Community Non-Life Insurance Directive was late being introduced."
"On this subject, after a long interval, Parliament took exceptional measures, approving the report by Mr Roy Perry in September 2003 by 358 for, no votes against and 35 abstentions."
"Long and detailed enquiries followed by the Committee on Petitions and yet, despite all this, the petitioners are still waiting for a clear answer to the questions raised in the Perry resolution, so that they can finally proceed with their case before the courts in Great Britain and seek compensation for the losses which they have sustained."
"If the European Parliament needs to refer the European Commission to the Court of Justice of the European Communities, because it failed to reply to our question and because it failed to render proper account to the European Parliament, then I believe that we should do so without fear, Mr Libicki says."
"The question at issue is a question of the European Commission's rendering proper account to the European Parliament and, consequently of the European Parliament's rendering proper account to the citizens, more and more of whom are filing petitions."
"Is our usual legislation good enough and is it correctly applied?"
"Is there free movement of goods and persons and recognition of professional qualifications?"
"Do European citizens have rights?"
"That is the substance of this evening's debate."
"The European Parliament is waiting for the European Commission to decide if European citizens have rights and to investigate if the United Kingdom has applied the laws on the proper regulation and control of the insurance market over the last two decades and if solvency requirements existed at that time."
"Reply please, Commissioner; not you personally, of course."
"Remember that your predecessor only went into action when he came under pressure, instituting infringement proceedings which were later withdrawn when the United Kingdom complied."
"Reply, on behalf of your institution, before Parliament; reply above all on the question of compliance by the country in question over this specific period."
". Mr President, the question of the regulation of Lloyd’s and the application of the First Non-Life Insurance Directive in the United Kingdom has been debated before in this Chamber."
"I refer to Oral Question B5-0010/2004 by Mr Perry, which was debated by Parliament on 12 February 2004, and to the answer given by the Commission on that occasion."
"The Commission has always expressed the greatest sympathy for the thousands of individuals – including the petitioners – who have suffered as a result of the Lloyd’s affair."
"The Commission’s views and concerns relating to the pre-2000 UK legislation were set out clearly in its letter of formal notice of December 2001, which is now a public document."
"The UK authorities informed the Commission that new legislation had been enacted to replace the former regime and answered further Commission questions relating to that new legislation."
"The Commission then announced that it was satisfied that those aspects of the regulatory and supervisory regime for Lloyd’s under examination were compatible with the requirements of the directive."
"The Commission has no doubt that once it had established the compatibility of the new regime for Lloyd’s it had no basis for continuing the infringement proceedings it had begun with the letter of formal notice in December 2001 in relation to the old regime."
"The Court of Justice’s jurisprudence on the purpose and conduct of infringement proceedings is quite clear."
"The Commission has always stressed to complainants that any action seeking damages for alleged incompatibility under the former regime must be undertaken exclusively before the United Kingdom courts."
"In order to help them in their litigation in the UK against the UK Government, the petitioners and many correspondents seem to seek a ruling from the Commission on the compatibility or incompatibility of the former Lloyd’s regime."
"However, only the Court of Justice can give such rulings."
"The Commission voiced its concerns in its 2001 letter of formal notice but this was only the first step in a long process of argument and counter-argument that might ultimately, if it had been continued, have led to a formal hearing and ruling at the Court of Justice."
"The Commission is fully aware that it is a subject of great regret to many that the legal proceedings begun with our letter were not pursued to their ultimate conclusion, but it has no doubt that its decision to discontinue the proceedings was the right one and was fully in conformity with the constant jurisprudence of the Court in the matter of infringement proceedings."
"I have taken note of the motion for a resolution tabled for the purpose of winding up tonight’s debate on this question."
"The Commission believes that the points addressed to it in Mr Perry’s report, to which the draft resolution makes reference, have all been answered."
"The Commission made its views on the UK authorities’ responses to the letter of formal notice public when it decided to close the infringement procedure."
"As to the access to documents retained by the Commission, I stress that these are governed by Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001."
"The conditions for gaining access to these documents are set out in that regulation."
"As to the third question in Mr Perry’s report about possible shortcomings or omissions in the UK regime, I reiterate that the Commission raised a number of questions in its letters of formal notice."
"I stress, however, that these were only questions."
"Such questions do not, in themselves, constitute an opinion or judgement."
"The answers provided by the UK authorities satisfied the Commission and led it to decide that there were no grounds to pursue the infringement procedure."
"Mr President, I should say first of all that I come from a Lloyd’s background, although I am not a Name; I never have been and I have no financial interest in any way, shape or form."
"My family has been associated with Lloyd’s for over 200 years in one form or another and I therefore understand the marketplace and how Lloyd’s functions."
"I have no specific animus against Lloyd’s in any way, shape or form."
"Indeed, arguably, I strongly support the organisation."
"But equally I support the principle of this question, which dates back – as many colleagues now know – to 1997 in terms of the petition and far longer in terms of the substance."
"This is about the fact that the question tabled by Roy Perry and now by the Committee on Petitions has not been answered properly."
"It is a measure of that concern that there is unanimity in the Committee on Petitions, even though there may be disagreement about the substance on the fact that this question has not been responded to properly."
"That is why there is a motion for a resolution attached to give power to the President of Parliament to instruct the Committee on Legal Affairs to take legal action against the Commission to answer that question, if – as I suspect is already the case this evening – this has not happened."
"The cause for concern here is that it is a failure by the Commission to respond to the Committee on Petitions – now in total as opposed to an individual Member."
"The issue itself continues, as the Commissioner and Members know."
"People are still being made bankrupt and their health and their lives are still often in turmoil."
"This petition needs to be closed, we need answers to the question."
"My colleagues and I on the Committee on Petitions cannot agree to the petition being closed until we get the proper answers to these questions tabled now and also previously by my former colleague Roy Perry."
"The Commission must answer the question properly to give at least a chance to those who have suffered at the hands of Lloyd’s in this sad affair the opportunity to be able to pursue their cases."
"I have never been and will not be one who advises members of Lloyd’s – ‘Names’ – who have suffered financially to pursue a case with no expectation of success."
"That way lies folly and further trouble."
"However, I, along with colleagues who have investigated this matter, believe that it needs proper consideration."
"That is why the question has been tabled in the terms it has."
"This is no personal reflection on Commissioner McCreevy, but I am not satisfied that the Commission has given the proper answer."
"Therefore, it must realise that further consequences will follow."
". Mr President, during the last term in office, I was a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and I followed this issue, and then, just as now, I was highly perplexed, because we are talking here about the Commission’s legal responsibilities, in accordance with Article 232 of the Treaty, which relates to the procedure on failure to act, but, according to Article 232, in order for the European Parliament to complain about a violation of the Treaty, it must involve a violation of the Treaty as such."
"Of course, this is a Directive that was not adopted by a previous British Government but which was then adopted by a subsequent government, the current government; the Commission began an infringement procedure pursuant to Article 226, the situation was changed, the Directive was incorporated and, from that point, as Commissioner McCreevy has pointed out, according to the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, it was not possible to continue proceedings before the Court, because Article 226 says: ‘If the Commission considers that a Member State has failed to fulfil an obligation under this Treaty, it shall deliver a reasoned opinion on the matter after giving the State concerned the opportunity ...’."
"Since the State conformed to the Commission’s opinion, we currently have no case from a legal point of view."
"That is to say that I have the impression that, as Commissioner McCreevy has said, at this point, the only possibility is to bring an action before the British legal authorities, but not before the Institutions of the European Union."
"In legal terms, we could say that, as things stand, neither this Parliament, nor the Commission, nor the Court of Justice of the European Union are the appropriate fora for dealing with this kind of complaint."
"That, unfortunately, is how the Treaty is worded."
"We could have a different Treaty, which would impose obligations on the Commission with regard to things that have happened previously, but in this case the case-law of the Court of Justice is clear and that is why I raised objections in relation to this issue and I continue to do so today."
"That is to say that the Treaty does not authorise the Commission to bring a State before the Court of Justice once the State has conformed to European Union Law."
"It is not a mathematical or immediate, or automatic, system, but rather the State must firstly be called upon to comply, and when it does so, the procedure comes to an end; from that point, the Commission can do nothing."
"My feeling is that, at this point, both the Commission’s previous reply and the reply that Commissioner McCreevy has just given us are entirely satisfactory."
"I recommend that the people affected by the Lloyd's case turn to the British courts and take appropriate action in accordance with British Law, but I believe that there is no point in our considering this procedure at this point; it is a huge waste of time for this Parliament and we could go as far as to say that it would also mislead the people affected, because it takes them along a path that will take them nowhere."
"The British courts themselves are their only chance of success; in fact I believe actions have already been brought before those courts."
"This is the only form of action possible."
"And that is what I recommend to the people involved in this kind of complaint."
". Mr President, the Commissioner is of course new to this saga, but unfortunately for many of our constituents, both in the UK and elsewhere, this is a long-running tragedy that, as we have seen, dates back to the 1970s."
"If we are honest, and I agree with Mr Medina Ortega about this, we know that whatever we do may not bring a resolution to the many personal cases of loss."
"We do not want legal proceedings between our institutions for the sake of having legal proceedings, but we do want to do something that enhances the position and standing of Parliament and Europe’s institutions."
"The central issue here is about how the European Union functions and, more particularly within your area, about how the internal market functions."
"It is quite simple really: a directive appears not to have been fully and properly implemented over a long period of years."
"Eventually the Member State comes into compliance 20 years after the event."
"That just cannot be good enough for Parliament or for Europe."
"In addition, our Committee on Petitions is often the first point of call."
"It should be an early warning system, but sometimes, as in this case, it happens after the event."
"The Commission should always be on guard to ensure that implementation takes place properly."
"And if there is a query about implementation it should be prepared, given the current political climate in Europe, to give unequivocal answers."
"Parliament has always argued that correspondence regarding possible enforcement proceedings between Member States and the Commission should be shared."
"It is quite straightforward and I appreciate that your predecessor, Mr Bolkestein, wrote saying that there were reasons for not revealing some of the correspondence."
"Surely, again in the current political climate, we have a duty to our citizens to get to the bottom of what happens in cases like this and to give them satisfactory answers."
"Otherwise we have every right to expect the negative responses that we got in France and Holland."
"If we cannot answer our citizens’ straightforward questions about how we implement EU law, then it is a poor show."
"I hope, Commissioner, that you will be able to help us more than your predecessor could."
"The Commission should reply to Parliament’s question as to whether the UK properly applied the Non-Life Insurance Directive between 1978 and 2001."
"As this question relates to the internal market, there are no grounds to refuse to make such a reply."
"In November 2003 Commissioner Bolkestein refused to give a proper answer."
"The committees responsible then asked the President of Parliament to take legal action against the Commission."
"A few months later it was indicated that the necessary legal requirements would not have been met."
"Now again, a year later, a new resolution has been tabled."
"Colleagues, we are now eight years on from what was in this case the first of many petitions."
"It is almost two years since the overwhelming vote on the first resolution on the Lloyd’s affair."
"Thousands of citizens were driven into bankruptcy and are now, as we speak, still at risk."
"Some have committed suicide."
"This is the result of deliberate and systematic deception in the Lloyd’s affair."
"When it is dealing with a petition, not the role, but the credibility of this Parliament is at stake."
"If the European citizens write to us to turn to us for help, and Member States fail, a successful case before the European Court of Justice would enhance Parliament’s role in the examination of petitions."
"Commissioner, if no progress is made, I must conclude that Parliament is unable to help the European citizens who ask for its help."
"In that case, I must apply other techniques in an effort to wake this House; to get justice for tens of thousands of European citizens who are terrorised by this affair."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Libicki’s question rubs salt into the wounds of the contradictions of this Europe, which is tailor-made for large financial interests, a Europe that its citizens do not want, as was at least demonstrated by those Europeans who had the opportunity to give their opinion on the matter."
"From examining the documentation, both the breaches of the Commission and those of the British Government, or at least of its so-called supervisory bodies, stand out, but what also stands out is the gap between the interests of the people and the interest of a very restricted number of plutocrats and speculators."
"With regard to the Lloyd’s affair, what was controlled can be very easily identified, whilst, as chance would have it, who controlled it cannot."
"The legitimate doubt arises that Directive 73/239/EEC on solvency was disregarded with the conscious acquiescence, not to say complicity, of the European Commission and the competent supervisory bodies of the UK Treasury."
"A popular Italian proverb says: ‘Every law has its loophole.’"
"The old saying is also true in terms of the United Kingdom and the European Commission: the fact remains, however, that the business of insurance is a gamble that Lloyd’s has nearly always won and won for centuries."
"There is no sympathy for those who take risks in investing and in financial speculations, because those types of entrepreneur feel no sympathy for small savers, for consumers, for the extremely high number of victims of their dangerous and unscrupulous financial games, and for those who, on the contrary, make money through the sweat of their brow, investing their physical and mental resources and drawing an income from it."
"Those who gamble on probability, a gamble that clearly yields more profit than forgiveness, given that that activity has been practised for centuries, must also accept the risks; the Lloyd’s affair is a symbolic example of the unfair expectations of those who always want to win just because they have large sums of money to risk, not caring less about all those, the great majority, who bet their own lives on their work."
"Mr President, I was disappointed with Commissioner McCreevy’s reply."
"We need to distinguish between two issues here."
"The first is the issue of those who invested in Lloyd’s and whether or not the British Government is obliged to compensate them for their losses."
"The Commissioner quite rightly pointed out that it is an issue that has to be pursued through the UK courts."
"However, what we are specifically dealing with here is the refusal of the Commission to deal properly and in accordance with the Treaties in replying to questions from this House."
"The Commissioner is explicitly obliged under the Treaties to reply to questions."
"Tonight, yet again, he has refused to provide all the information that was sought as far back as 2003."
"On another occasion, a previous Commissioner indicated that the UK Government was unhappy with the Commission revealing the information which was being sought by the Committee on Petitions."
"Since this is a codecision issue – as the insurance directive is a codecision directive – Parliament has at least equal right to the information which is available to the Commission and the Member State."
"They are not the only ones responsible for the legislation."
"So I appeal to the Commissioner to avoid the ignominy of being brought before the European Court of Justice by this House for failing to comply with the Treaties."
"It seems to me, Commissioner, that in any event that you may end up in court if you do not comply."
"I do not know British law that well, but I suspect that if this case was in Ireland the complainants could force you to produce the information."
"I think it is entirely unfair to deny this House the information to which it is entitled, and you face the real risk of being brought before the European Court of Justice if you do not provide it."
". Mr President, the Commission believes it has fulfilled its duties under the Treaty."
"When doubts were raised, the Commission started an investigation and issued a letter of formal notice and a supplementary letter of formal notice."
"The Commission has answered questions put to it by the Parliament to the best of its ability."
"My predecessor met with representatives of the Committee on Petitions and answered questions in this Chamber, as well as many written questions."
"I have met with Mr Libicki to discuss this matter, and am here again this evening to answer Parliament’s questions."
"This is what accountability on the part of the Commission amounts to."
"The Commission has acted by deciding to open an infringement procedure and acted again by deciding to close the case when it received a satisfactory answer from the UK authorities."
"The Commission always endeavours to answer Parliament’s questions to the best of its abilities."
"In this case, however, the Commission is being asked to pronounce on whether a Member State was in conformity with Community law during a certain period in the past, and under a different legislative regime to that which is now in place."
"The Commission cannot answer that question because the pre-litigation and litigation proceedings that would have established the answer were not completed."
"– I have received a motion for a resolution(1) to wind up the debate in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"– Τhe next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading by Othmar Karas, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Council common position for adoption of a Council regulation on amending Regulation (ΕC) No 1466/97 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies (09812/2005 – C6-0192/2005 – 2005/0064(SYN)) (A6-0204/2005)."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Juncker, said in his speech this morning that he had brought two principles to the attention of his colleagues at last week’s summit."
"The first of these was that they should revisit their own decisions and ensure that these decisions are implemented."
"The second was that they should abide by the institutional rules."
"It is a sad state of affairs when the members of a community must be reminded of such self-evident rules of conduct, and when appeals must be made to those in positions of responsibility to abide by them."
"Unfortunately, the appeals fell on deaf ears in the case of too many Heads of State or Government."
"For many years now, the euro zone finance ministers have also ignored these principles, even though they are necessary for formulating efficient, confidence-building and professional policies."
"Those who infringed the Stability and Growth Pact have even set themselves up in judgment and prevented the Commission from enforcing the rights conferred upon it."
"The same happened to Parliament when it considered the two draft Commission regulations on the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The Commission called on the finance ministers to incorporate Parliament’s proposals; the President-in-Office of the Council called on his colleagues to take heed of them."
"During the last part-session, a majority of Members of this House voted in favour of both my reports on the two Commission regulations."
"Yet, even though the majority of finance ministers, the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council agreed on the substance of our new amendments, not one of them was accepted by the Council."
"Most of the national delegations would have been prepared to incorporate certain amendments, in particular those relating to total debt evolution and monitoring, but a small number of influential countries stood in the way of this happening."
"Attempts are now being made to pass the buck to Parliament, by telling us that although no one is going to ask us what we want, we have no power to stop anything from happening."
"This is not a matter of institutional competence; it is a matter of substance."
"In its statement on the ECOFIN decision, the Commission said that in its opinion, the draft regulation would have been further strengthened had some of Parliament’s amendments been incorporated, in particular those relating to debt monitoring."
"This is a sign that Parliament is heading in the right direction, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has therefore decided to resubmit the amendments adopted at first reading. Our reasons for this are as follows; we are convinced that the substance of these amendments is appropriate, and we do not want the other EU institutions to disregard institutional rights and opinions on matters of substance."
"What do we want?"
"We want a comparison between the data supplied by the Member States to the ECB and that supplied to Eurostat."
"The Council has stated that comparisons of this kind are already being carried out, but this begs the question of why no one noticed the discrepancies in the figures reported by Greece."
"Secondly, we want the medium-term budgetary objectives to be reviewed, and not ‘at least every four years’, as the Council has now proposed, but on a regular basis, as per our original proposals."
"We want public debt monitoring, of which there is no mention in the regulation, even though the Council agreed to it in March."
"We want stability programmes to be submitted annually for a two-year period; yet again, this proposal was rejected."
"It is hard to escape the conclusion that this is not in fact a dispute over points of substance; the simple truth of the matter is that the Council did not wish to accept any of Parliament’s amendments."
"An attitude of this kind hardly inspires confidence, and it is not only unwarranted from a factual point of view, but also unfair in institutional terms."
"I would therefore ask the House to vote tomorrow at second reading in the same way it did at first reading."
". Mr President, with the positive vote of the Council common position, the European Parliament can clear the way to a fruitful conclusion on what has been a long, intense and yet constructive reform debate."
"The Commission indicated the need and the main avenues for improving the functioning of the Stability and Growth Pact in its communication of 3 September 2004."
"After several rounds of discussion, the Ecofin Council met again on 20 March, reached agreement and adopted its report on improving the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"On 22 March 2005, the European Council endorsed the report stating that it updates and complements the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The main aim of the report is to enhance governance and the national ownership of the EU fiscal framework by strengthening its economic underpinning, while safeguarding the sustainability of public finances and promoting growth."
"We hold the view that, overall, the agreement is balanced and provides an appropriate basis for restoring national ownership of the fiscal framework."
"If fully implemented it has the prospect of reinforcing fiscal discipline and growth support of fiscal policies."
"On 20 April 2005, the earliest possible date following the agreement, the Commission adopted the two proposals amending the two Council Regulations – (EC) No 1466/97 and (EC) No 1467/97 – which underpin the pact."
"Parliament and the Council have immediately begun discussing the Commission proposals in a constructive spirit."
"All parties strove to bring the process to a successful conclusion swiftly."
"I would like to express the Commission’s gratitude, in particular to the Parliament for its cooperative attitude, thereby making it possible to finalise the amendment procedure during the Luxembourg presidency."
"Earlier this month, the Parliament adopted at first reading a number of amendments to the Commission proposals."
"The Council, taking account of Parliament’s opinion, agreed on its common position shortly thereafter."
"In its position however, Council could not agree on taking on board any of the amendments proposed by the Parliament."
"Nevertheless, the changes adopted by the Council with respect to the Commission proposal go in the direction of further clarifying the implementation of the preventive part of the Stability and Growth Pact in line with the overall thrust of the amendments tabled by Parliament."
"Other changes envisaged by Parliament, namely those in the statistical field, have been considered by the Council in the finalisation of the legal acts directly linked to the statistics of public finances."
"In the view of the Commission, the inclusion of some of the amendments tabled by Parliament could have strengthened the proposed regulation further."
"However, after careful consideration, the Commission decided to accept the Council common position."
"Overall, the revisions made to the Stability and Growth Pact are balanced; they will give the pact a new vigour and provide a better framework for an economically sensible implementation of the rules."
"The Commission is committed to a balanced and rigorous implementation of the reformed pact."
"It continues to closely monitor the budgeting situation in all Member States."
"It will use its right of initiative where appropriate, as it has done in recent days."
"As you know, the Commission decided to initiate excessive deficit procedures for Italy and Portugal."
"We expect the procedures to be seen as a means of supporting the fiscal consolidation needed in both countries to return to high economic growth."
"A cooperative approach to ensure the smooth implementation of the excessive deficit procedure will contribute to the credibility of the renewed framework and of the overall functioning of EMU in this challenging period."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is perhaps symbolic that what may be the last debate before the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is taking place at this late hour."
"The Pact is being quietly laid to rest, well away from the public eye."
"Be that as it may, I should like to thank Mr Karas for his report, and for his attempt to formulate a position for Parliament that reconciles the views of the Council and the Commission."
"In my opinion, it says a lot that the Council can reach agreement on a further weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact at a time like this, when it cannot agree on a single important issue."
"This is all taking place at a time when the euro needs a stable framework and when our key objective should be to avoid running up debts and thereby increasing inflation. Above all, it is a time when the Commission’s position must be strengthened."
"I therefore find it equally regrettable that the Commission has given its consent, as this means that nothing has been done about the Pact’s underlying problem, which is that those who violate it sit in judgment on themselves."
"The Council should have given its backing to attempts to flesh out somewhat the details of how its own decisions are to be monitored and interpreted, and the Commission should have supported such attempts accordingly."
"The first infringement proceedings against Italy will now make clear what approach the Commission services favour."
"All we can do is encourage them to continue the fight to achieve a solid framework for the euro and for the Pact governing the euro, which is our common currency, even if this means coming out in opposition to the Member States."
"Members of the previous Commission were prepared to do just that, and I would encourage you to continue fighting for the Pact and for the spirit that it formerly embodied."
". Mr President, among the aspects of European cooperation that was left unfinished is European integration and Monetary Union."
"When it was set up in Maastricht, there were still inspired and visionary Europeans on the scene. Jacques Delors was one of them."
"His objective with regard to monetary union was twofold: to stabilise exchange rates and the development of inflation, and to bring closer a political Union in which Europe’s citizens would be guaranteed prosperity and welfare."
"We managed to achieve the first part of the objective beautifully."
"We have a stable euro that has withstood major currency crises and inflation that is so low that it has now again given economists something to worry about."
"As far as the second aspect, political Union, is concerned, though, we seem to be further removed from it than ever these days, although crises sometimes give rise to surprising leaps forward."
"The Member States that exchanged their national currencies for the common euro without committing to a further political Union and starting one macro-economic and budget policy needed guarantees to prevent one Member State’s frugality from being undermined by another’s irresponsible overspending."
"They did not want to encroach too much on each other’s territory in terms of political choices for budgetary policy, and that is how the Stability and Growth Pact with its system of sanctions, came about; it was, in other words, a pact based on distrust."
"The pact prescribed quantitative standards for, among others, the net result of annual government budgets and for the level of public debt. That worked at the end of the last century, but the economic situation of the past few years has made these rules appear too rigid."
"So, on a purely rational basis, it was logical and sensible to change them and to give due priority, once again, to this objective of stability and growth."
"At the same time, however, a number of large Member States got into difficulty and resisted interference from the Commission and the sanctions of their fellow finance ministers."
"Consequently, the Commission’s appropriate adjustment to make the pact more intelligent coincided with a battle for prestige among the Member States."
"Commissioner Almunia concentrated his efforts on sensible reform, but the eco-feminists wanted, above all, to create room for their own excuse to break the rules."
"This has therefore been the subject of much heated debate and, in general, most criticism has been levelled at the latter."
"For example, the European Central Bank was very negative about this corrective aspect but was able to endorse the pact’s preventive section, while taking into account such factors as economic trends and long-term debt. That storm abated."
"The pact itself has not changed, but an estimate of those budgets is now available to us."
"The strange thing is that we have now adopted this regulation on this controversial corrective section, that this only falls within the scope of an advisory procedure and that this has now entered into effect since last time’s vote, but that we now have a regulation at second reading on this other, preventive section."
"I will leave this to one side for the time being."
"In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, a number of amendments to this regulation have therefore been adopted, but, as a qualified majority is required for those amendments to be adopted, the upshot could be that this regulation will not enter into force."
"I would therefore counsel against this, and advise this House to accept the situation as it is, as the Commission was sensible enough to do, for both regulations – the second of which we regard as more important than the first – can enter into force simultaneously."
"Mr Juncker has had a tough time lately, and we should at least let him have this success and result during the Luxembourg Presidency."
"I would like to appear before you now to support the position of the mover, Mr Karas."
"I consider several of the reservations and objections from the European Council to be superficial and insufficiently thought through or justified."
"Due to lack of time, I would like to touch upon just two of the points contained in the Council’s comments on Article 6 paragraph 1 and Article 7 paragraph 2(a)."
"With regard to Article 6 paragraph 1, it is clear that there is a fundamental difference between reporting and monitoring the absolute value of the surplus or deficit in public finances, and the level of overall public finance debt as a percentage of the preset basis, for example, gross domestic product, which has a substantially higher information value from the viewpoint of maintaining budgetary prudence than absolute data on the level of deficit."
"I therefore support the position of the European Parliament submitted by Mr Karas in this and other points."
"Over and above the position of the European Parliament, I would like to question the wording of Article 7 paragraph 2(a) and how it has been amended by the European Council, where the deviation from the medium-term budget targets in connection with multi-pillar pensions reform has been permitted."
"This may only be applied if the costs of pensions reform will demonstrably be addressed at the expense of lower final consumption or increased savings by citizens, and not the short- or medium-term coverage of pension deficits by one-off and unrepeatable receipts from privatisations, as it happens at present in several European Union countries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are experiencing difficult times in the European Union, difficult times that are characterised by a lack of confidence, which leads to a lack of economic growth and an inability to create employment."
"At times such as these, when reforms of the Institutions are being carried out, as in the case of the Stability Pact, it is important that all the institutions of the European Union are present and that they participate in those institutional reforms, in order to give them more credibility and in order to communicate to the European citizens, at the end of the day, that those reforms are aimed at producing economic growth and creating employment."
"That has been the purpose of this European Parliament action: a clearly constructive purpose."
"Some of us are very critical of the Spring Council; we believe that the Pact should not have been reformed in the way it was."
"Despite this, however, we have presented constructive initiatives in order to supplement no less than the preventive aspect of the Stability and Growth Pact, and it is therefore absurd that the Council should dig its heels in and not allow a European Parliament initiative of a constructive nature which is intended to make the Stability Pact more reliable and more credible."
"I trust that this situation will change, that tomorrow the European Parliament will express its support for these amendments and act consistently and, also, that the intransigence of the Council will be overcome, after ascertaining the situation and the causes of the difficult crisis we are experiencing in Europe."
"The Commissioner, who is here today, is well aware that the budget surplus — what a budget surplus you achieved when you were responsible for finance in Ireland, Mr McCreevy ... it makes us jealous... — is well aware that the quality of public finances makes a contribution to confidence when it comes to promoting economic growth and job creation; that is what the European Union needs at the moment and that is what we aspire to."
"I would like to end by thanking Mr Karas, who has done a commendable job, for his attitude and his work."
"– Mr President, I should like to begin by commending Mr Karas, as indeed I did in our debate in Strasbourg a few days ago, on his far-reaching and well-executed work, even though our positions differ on the most appropriate means of achieving stability in public financing and on the importance of this instrument to the European economy’s much needed recovery."
"The issue before us is whether, on the one hand, we accept a proposal that is to my mind relatively well balanced and thereby succeed in adopting this balanced proposal before the end of the Luxembourg Presidency, or, on the other hand, we find a way of postponing the process and possibly leading it down a blind alley through a succession of amendments."
"I therefore feel that, rather than appealing to the Members of this House, who might block the adoption of this common position, our overriding priorities should be common sense and the need to take this process forward."
"As we know, the Council adopted a motion in March to amend the Stability and Growth Pact and its two pillars."
"Although this is not a position that I myself welcome, it is clearly a step in the right direction, towards smoothing relations between the EU and the citizens, whose concerns have not been met on any practical level by the economic governance of Europe."
"It is on this basis that we have to work."
"The issue before us is not, of course, the sustainability of public finances and, less still, their consolidation. Our priority is rather to make the Pact more effective and easier for society as a whole to understand."
"I therefore urge common sense so that we can take this process forward."
"I should also like to point out that the European Central Bank (ECB) finally appears willing to adopt more growth-friendly monetary policies."
"It is said that interest rates are set to fall."
"At a time when the ECB is ready to break free from its orthodoxy, now does not strike me as the right time for Parliament to cling stubbornly to its financial orthodoxy."
". Mr President, I should like to repeat that in the deliberations of the Council’s ad hoc group on the Stability and Growth Pact, the Commission actively supported a number of the amendments tabled by Parliament at first reading."
"Unfortunately, as I said in my introductory remarks, the Council did not take our advice on board."
"Against this background I can understand the position of the House with regard to some of its initial amendments."
"However, as I stated earlier, I think the common position is generally acceptable; it is broadly balanced and contains the essential elements initially proposed by the Commission."
"Also against the background of the spreading scepticism surrounding the European project, it is important to demonstrate interinstitutional cohesion regarding this important reform project."
"Your agreement with the Council’s common position would help reinforce the pact’s credibility and political support, sending out a clear message of reform."
"Finally, let me reassure you again that the Commission is firmly committed to implementing the pact rigorously and even-handedly."
"The adoption of the reformed pact will help maintain and enforce the solid basis on which that is done."
"We would like the European Parliament to join the Commission in encouraging Member States to pursue macro-economic stability."
"The Commission is committed to informing Parliament regularly about relevant developments in budgetary surveillance."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Ladies and gentlemen, before giving the floor to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, I am pleased to welcome a delegation of Members of the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea, headed by the Honourable Mr Lee Sang Deuk, who have come to Brussels to take part in the eighth Inter-Parliamentary Meeting between the European Parliament and Korea."
"This will be the first meeting between the European Union and the Korean Parliament of what for both of them is a new term in office."
"I would like to stress that our dialogue is now fully political and over the years it has dealt with many issues ranging from regional and international security to the day-to-day concerns of the citizens, in parallel with the increasingly active role played on the international stage by both the European Parliament and South Korea."
"Mr President, please allow me to express our pleasure at this visit and at our increasing cooperation with the Republic of Korea, and we wish you a happy stay in Brussels."
"The next item is the Council statement on the Programme of the British Presidency, for which purpose I am going to give the floor to its Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair, whom I welcome."
"I would like to remind you that, before today, the Conference of Presidents of Political Groups of this Parliament has had the opportunity to meet with the British Presidency in London; that gave us the opportunity to exchange a series of points of view with the Prime Minister on the way the United Kingdom is going to conduct its rotating Presidency of the Union."
"But it is now time to inform the plenary of this Parliament."
". Mr President, colleagues, distinguished guests, it is an honour to be here in the European Parliament today."
"With your permission, I will come back after each European Council during the UK presidency and report to you."
"In addition, I will be happy to consult Parliament before each Council so as to have the benefit of the views of the European Parliament before any Council deliberations."
"This is a timely address."
"Whatever else people disagree upon in Europe today, they at least agree on one point: Europe is in the midst of a profound debate about its future."
"I want to talk to you plainly today about this debate, the reasons for it and how to resolve it."
"In every crisis there is an opportunity."
"There is one for Europe now, if we have the courage to take it."
"The debate over Europe should not be conducted by trading insults or in terms of personality."
"It should be an open and frank exchange of ideas."
"At the outset, I want to describe clearly how I define the debate and the disagreement underlying it."
"The issue is not between a ‘free market’ Europe and a social Europe, between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in Europe as a political project."
"This is not just a misrepresentation."
"It is designed to intimidate those who want to change Europe by representing the desire for change as a betrayal of the European ideal, to try to shut off serious debate about Europe’s future by claiming that the very insistence on debate is to embrace the anti-Europe."
"It is a mindset I have fought against all my political life."
"Ideals survive through change."
"They die through inertia in the face of challenge."
"I am a passionate pro-European."
"I always have been."
"I was wondering whether this was going to be a lively forum, and I am delighted to see that it is."
"It is called democracy and long may it be so."
"The first time I voted was in 1975, in the British referendum on membership, and I voted ‘yes’."
"Shortly before the British election in 1983, when I was the last candidate in the United Kingdom to be selected, and when my party had a policy of withdrawing from Europe, I told the selection conference that I disagreed with the policy."
"Some thought I had lost the selection, some perhaps wish I had."
"But I then helped to change that policy in the 1980s and I am proud of that change."
"Since becoming Prime Minister, I have signed the European Social Chapter; helped, along with France, to create the modern European defence policy; have played my part in the Amsterdam, Nice and Rome Treaties."
"This is a Union of values, of solidarity between nations and people ..."
"… of not just a common market in which we trade, but a common political space in which we live as citizens."
"It always will be."
"I believe in Europe as a political project."
"I believe in Europe with a strong and caring social dimension."
"I would never accept a Europe that was simply an economic market."
"To say that this is the issue is to escape the real debate and to hide in the comfort zone of the things we have always said to each other in times of difficulty."
"There is not some division between the Europe necessary to succeed economically and social Europe."
"Political Europe and economic Europe do not live in separate rooms."
"The purpose of social Europe and economic Europe should be to sustain each other."
"The purpose of political Europe should be to promote the democratic and effective institutions to develop policy in these two spheres and across the board where we want and need to cooperate in our mutual interest."
"But the purpose of political leadership is to get the policies right for today’s world."
"For 50 years European leaders have done that."
"We talk of crisis; let us first talk of achievement."
"When the war ended, Europe was in ruins."
"Today the European Union stands as a monument to political achievement: almost 50 years of peace, 50 years of prosperity, 50 years of progress."
"Think of it, let us all be grateful for it and be proud of what has happened in Europe in these past 50 years."
"The broad sweep of history is on the side of the European Union."
"Countries round the world are coming together today because in collective cooperation they increase individual strength."
"Until the second half of the 20th century, individual European nations had, for centuries, dominated the world, colonised large parts of it, and fought wars against each other for world supremacy."
"Then, out of the carnage of the Second World War, political leaders had the vision to realise that those days were gone."
"Today’s world does not diminish that vision: it demonstrates its prescience."
"The United States is the world’s only superpower."
"But within a few decades China and India will be the world’s largest economies, each of them with populations three times that of the whole of the European Union."
"The idea of Europe, united and working together, is essential today for our nations to be strong enough to keep our place in this world."
"But now, almost 50 years on, we have to renew."
"There is no shame in that."
"All institutions must do it, and we can, as well, but only if we remarry the European ideals we believe in to the modern world in which we live."
"If we do not, if Europe defaulted to euroscepticism, or if European nations, faced with the immense challenge we have in front of us, decided to huddle together, hoping we can avoid globalisation, shrink away from confronting the changes around us, take refuge in the present policies of Europe as if by constantly repeating them, we would by the very act of repetition make them more relevant, then we risk failure."
"Failure on a grand, strategic scale."
"This is not a time to accuse those who want Europe to change of betraying Europe."
"It is a time to recognise that only by change will Europe recover its strength, its relevance, its idealism and therefore its support amongst the people."
"As ever, the people are ahead of the politicians."
"We always think as a political class that the people, unconcerned with the daily obsession of politics, may not understand it, may not see its subtleties and its complexities."
"Ultimately, people always see politics more clearly than we do, precisely because they are not obsessed with it on a daily basis."
"The issue, therefore, is not about the idea of the European Union."
"It is about modernisation and policy. It is not a debate about how to abandon Europe, but how to make it do what it was set up to do: improve the lives of people."
"And right now, they are not convinced."
"Consider this. For four years Europe conducted a debate over our new Constitution, two years of it in the Convention."
"It was a detailed, careful piece of work setting out the new rules to govern a Europe of 25, and then in time 27, 28 and more Member States."
"The Constitution was endorsed by all governments."
"It was supported by all leaders."
"It was then comprehensively rejected in referendums in two founding Member States, in the case of the Netherlands by over 60 per cent."
"The reality is that, as we speak today at least, to secure a ‘yes’ vote in a referendum in most Member States would be difficult."
"There are two possible explanations."
"One is that people studied the Constitution and disagreed with its precise articles."
"I doubt that was the basis of the majority ‘no’."
"This was not an issue of drafting or specific textual disagreement."
"The other explanation is that the Constitution became merely the vehicle for the people to register a wider and deeper discontent with the state of affairs in Europe."
"I believe this to be the correct analysis."
"If so, it is not a crisis of political institutions."
"It is a crisis of political leadership."
"People in Europe are posing hard questions to us."
"They worry about globalisation, about job security, about pensions, about living standards."
"They see not just their economy, but also their society changing around them."
"Traditional communities are broken up."
"Ethnic patterns change."
"Family life is under strain as families struggle to balance work and home."
"We are living through a profound era of upheaval and change."
"Look at our children and the technology they use and the jobs market they face."
"The world is unrecognisable from that which we experienced as students twenty or thirty years ago."
"When such change occurs, moderate people must give leadership."
"If they do not, the extremes gain traction on the political process."
"It happens within a nation."
"It is happening in Europe now."
"Just reflect. The Laeken Declaration which launched the Constitution was designed, and I quote, ‘to bring Europe closer to the people’."
"Did it?"
"The Lisbon Agenda was launched in 2000 with the ambition of making Europe, and I quote, ‘the most competitive place to do business in the world by 2010’."
"We are half way through that period."
"Has it succeeded?"
"I have sat through Council Conclusions after Council Conclusions describing how we are reconnecting Europe to the people, but are we?"
"It is time to give ourselves a reality check and to receive the wake-up call."
"The people are blowing the trumpets around the city walls."
"Are we listening?"
"Have we the political will to go out and meet them so that they regard our leadership collectively as part of the solution, and not part of the problem?"
"That is the context in which the budget debate should be set."
"People say we need the budget to restore Europe’s credibility."
"Of course we do, but it should be the right budget."
"It should not be abstracted from the debate about Europe’s crisis, it should be part of the answer to it."
"I want to say a word about last Friday’s summit."
"There have been suggestions that I was not willing to compromise on the UK rebate; that I only raised common agricultural policy reform at the last minute; that I expected to renegotiate the CAP last Friday night."
"In fact I am the only British leader that has ever said I would put the rebate on the table."
"I have never said we should end the CAP now or renegotiate it overnight."
"Such a position would be absurd."
"Any change must take account of the legitimate needs of farming communities and must happen over time."
"I have said simply two things: that we cannot agree a new financial perspective that does not at least set out a process that leads to a more rational budget …"
"… and that this must allow such a budget to shape the second half of the perspective up to 2013."
"Otherwise it will be 2014 before any fundamental change is agreed, let alone implemented."
"In the meantime, of course Britain will pay its full share of enlargement."
"I might point out that on any basis we would remain the second highest net contributor to the European Union and have in this financial perspective paid billions more than similar-sized countries."
"That is actually the context for this debate on the budget."
"So what would a different policy agenda for Europe look like?"
"First, it would modernise our social model."
"Again, some have suggested that I want to abandon Europe’s social model."
"But tell me, what type of social model is it that has 20 million unemployed across Europe; …"
"… that has productivity rates falling behind those of the United States; that is allowing more science graduates to be produced by India than by Europe; and that on any relative index of a modern economy – skills, research and development, patents, information technology – is going down and not up?"
"India will expand its biotechnology sector fivefold in the next five years."
"China has trebled its spending on research and development in the last five years."
"Of the top 20 universities in the world today, only two are now in Europe."
"The purpose of our social model should be to enhance our ability to compete, to help our people cope with globalisation, to let them embrace its opportunities and to avoid the dangers."
"Of course we need a social Europe, but it has to be a social Europe that works."
"And we have been told how to do it."
"The Kok report of 2004 shows the way: investment in knowledge; in skills; in active labour market policies; in science parks and innovation; in higher education; in urban regeneration; and in help for small businesses."
"This is modern social policy, not regulation and job protection that may save some jobs for a time at the expense of many jobs in the future."
"And since this is a day for demolishing caricatures, let me demolish one other: the idea that Britain is in the grip of some extreme Anglo-Saxon market philosophy that tramples on the poor and disadvantaged."
"The present British Government has introduced the New Deal for the unemployed, the largest jobs programme in Europe that has seen long-term youth unemployment virtually abolished in my country."
"It has increased investment in our public services more than any other European country in the past five years."
"We needed to do this, it is true, but we did it."
"We have introduced Britain’s first minimum wage."
"We have regenerated our cities, we have lifted almost one million children out of poverty, two million pensioners out of acute hardship and are now embarked on the most radical expansion of childcare, maternity and paternity rights in our country’s history."
"We have done all this on the basis of, and not at the expense of, a strong economy."
"So that is the first thing, to modernise our social model."
"Second, let the budget reflect these realities."
"The Sapir report shows the way."
"Published by the European Commission in 2003, it sets out in clear detail what a modern European budget would look like."
"Let us put it into practice."
"But a modern budget for Europe is not one that ten years from now is still spending 40 per cent of its money on the common agricultural policy."
"Third, implement the Lisbon Agenda."
"On jobs, labour market participation, school leavers, and life-long learning we set targets at Lisbon, but frankly, at present we are nowhere near meeting those targets by 2010."
"The Lisbon Agenda told us what to do, let us do it."
"Fourth, and here I tread carefully, get a macroeconomic framework for Europe that is disciplined but also flexible."
"It is not for me to comment on the eurozone, but I just say this: if we agreed real progress on economic reform, if we demonstrated real seriousness on structural change, then people would perceive reform of macro policy as sensible and rational, not a product of fiscal laxity but of common sense."
"We need such reform urgently in Europe if Europe is to grow."
"After the economic and social challenges, then let us confront another set of linked issues: crime, security and immigration."
"Crime is now crossing borders now more easily than ever before."
"We estimate that in the UK alone organised crime is costing us GBP 20 billion a year."
"Migration has doubled in the past 20 years."
"Much of it is healthy and welcome, but it must be managed."
"Illegal immigration is an issue for all our nations and a human tragedy for many thousands of people."
"It is estimated that 70 per cent of illegal immigrants have their passage facilitated by organised criminal groups."
"Then there is the repugnant practice of human trafficking, whereby organised gangs move people from one region to another with the intention of exploiting them when they arrive."
"Between 600 000 and 800 000 people are trafficked globally each year and every year over 100 000 women are victims of people trafficking in the European Union."
"Again a relevant Justice and Home Affairs agenda would focus on these issues: implementing the European Union action plan on counter-terrorism, which has huge potential to improve law enforcement as well as addressing the radicalisation and recruitment of terrorists; cross-border intelligence and policing on organised crime; developing proposals to hit the people and drug traffickers hard in opening up their bank accounts, harassing their activities, arresting their leading members and bringing them to justice; getting returns agreements for failed asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants from neighbouring countries and others; developing biometric technology to make Europe’s borders secure."
"All of these are issues we can concentrate upon."
"Then there is the whole area of common foreign and security policy."
"We should be agreeing practical measures to enhance European defence capability, to be prepared to take on more peacekeeping and enforcement missions."
"We should develop the capability, with NATO, or where NATO does not want to be engaged then outside it, to be able to intervene quickly and effectively in support of conflict resolution."
"Look at the numbers today in our European armies and the expenditure we make on defence."
"Do they really answer the strategic needs of today?"
"Such a defence policy is a necessary part of an effective foreign policy."
"But even without it, we should be seeing how we can make the influence of the European Union count."
"When the European Union agreed recently to a doubling of aid, and in particular a doubling of aid to Africa, it was an immediate boost not just for that troubled continent, but for European cooperation."
"We are world leaders in development today, we should be proud of it."
"We should be leading the way on promoting a new multilateral trade agreement which will increase trade for all, especially the poorest nations."
"We are leading the debate on climate change and developing pan-European policies to tackle it."
"Thanks to Javier Solana, Europe has started to make its presence felt in the Middle East peace process."
"My point is very simple: a strong Europe would be an active player in foreign policy, a good partner of course to the United States, but also capable of demonstrating our own capacity to shape and move the world forward."
"Such a Europe – its economy in the process of being modernised and its security enhanced by clear action within our borders and beyond – would be a confident Europe."
"It would be a Europe confident enough to see enlargement not as a threat, as if membership were a zero sum game in which old members lose as new members gain, but an extraordinary, historic opportunity to build a greater and more powerful Union."
"Be under no illusion."
"If we stop enlargement or shut out its natural consequences it would not, in the end, save one job, keep one firm in business, prevent one delocalisation."
"For a time it might, but not for long."
"In the meantime, Europe would become more narrow, more introspective and those who garner support would be those not in the traditions of European idealism but in the traditions of outdated nationalism and xenophobia."
"I tell you in all frankness, it is a contradiction to be in favour of liberalising Europe’s membership but against opening up its economy."
"If we set out that clear direction, if we then combine it with a Commission – as this one under José Manuel Barroso’s leadership is fully capable of doing – that is prepared to send back some of the unnecessary regulation, peel back some of the bureaucracy and become a champion of a global, outward-looking competitive Europe, then it will not be hard to capture the imagination and support of the people of Europe."
"In our presidency, we will try to take forward the budget deal; to resolve some of the hard dossiers like the Services Directive and Working Time Directive; to carry out the Union’s obligations to those like Turkey and Croatia that wait in hope of a future as part of Europe; and to conduct this debate about the future of Europe in an open, inclusive way, giving our own views strongly but fully respectful of the views of others."
"There is only one thing I ask: do not let us kid ourselves that this debate is unnecessary; that if only we can assume business as usual, people will sooner or later relent and acquiesce in Europe as it is, not as they want it to be."
"In my time as Prime Minister, I have found that the hard part is not taking the decision, it is spotting when it has to be taken."
"It is understanding the difference between the challenges that have to be managed and those that have to be confronted and overcome."
"This is such a moment of decision for Europe."
"The people of Europe are speaking to us."
"They are posing the questions."
"They are wanting our leadership and it time we gave it to them."
". Mr President, President of the Council, honourable Members of the European Parliament, we have entered a turbulent period in European politics and last week’s difficult European Council simply reflects that fact."
"If nothing else, last week’s meeting of European leaders established a need for the new political consensus that I called for in this very Chamber some time ago; a consensus that is vital if we are to avoid all ideological confrontations and paralysis; a consensus that is vital if we are to deliver on our programme of prosperity, solidarity and security."
"The way to reconnect Europe to its citizens is by delivering solutions to the concrete challenges they face."
"Prime Minister Blair, your presidency is taking place at a decisive moment for Europe."
"Saying this has become a cliché, but this time it happens to be true."
"This has important implications for the responsibility you are about to take on."
"It also raises high expectations."
"The United Kingdom’s record of pragmatism and results-oriented action will be put to the test in the coming six months."
"Prime Minister Blair, you are a statesman of enormous experience and conviction and you have confirmed today your commitment to Europe as a political project."
"I therefore have every confidence that you will lead an inclusive, constructive debate on what Europe can do for its citizens and create the consensus required for the urgent decisions that Europe needs."
"I am greatly encouraged that achieving this new consensus and playing an active role during the period of reflection called for by the European Council are priorities for the incoming UK presidency."
"As I outlined here yesterday, the Commission will also fully live up to the special role it has been given for this debate on the future of Europe."
"You will recall the meetings I proposed with all Member States – including parliaments, social partners, civil society and young people – to listen and share ideas."
"A strategy paper will draw on the results of this debate and tackle fundamental questions about the future of Europe."
"This will feed into next June’s European Council under the Austrian presidency, where we will reassess the situation."
"I am sure the European Parliament will play a vital role in all this."
"As 50 years of history have taught us, the day-to-day business of the European Union continues, even during one of its periodic crises – and so it should."
"It is crucial that we address the core issues that help to define the Europe our citizens want."
"But we must not get lost in a period of narrow introspection."
"It is by actions, not words, that we will win back public trust and confidence."
"There is certainly plenty of business to be getting on with, as Prime Minister Blair has just made clear."
"The goals and priorities he has outlined for the UK presidency over the next six months closely match those of the European Commission and he can count on our support and advice in working towards them."
"I wish to take this opportunity to highlight one or two of them in particular."
"Economic renewal and reform remain the cornerstone of this Commission."
"The next six months will see the launch of concrete steps to turn the revitalised Lisbon Agenda into reality."
"The mid-term review of the Lisbon Agenda is behind us."
"Now is the time for action at both European and national level."
"Member States will present their national reform programmes this October."
"These will set out in detail the principal measures they are taking to support our programme for growth and jobs."
"The Commission, for its part, will present a Community reform programme over the summer."
"This will set out the different priority actions, both legislative and financial, that need to be adopted or decided upon at European level in support of the Lisbon Agenda."
"Naturally, our ambitions on Lisbon will be tempered to a greater or lesser extent by the final outcome on the negotiations on the financial perspectives."
"It is regrettable that the heaviest cuts to the current negotiating box fall on precisely that heading which most supports Lisbon-related policies."
"That would not have happened if the ‘one per cent club’ of countries did not fight to reduce Europe’s ambitions."
"But there is now a real urgency to reach an agreement to avoid paralysis in the Union beyond 2006, a paralysis which will have a negative effect on our policies and on Member States, particularly the new ones."
"The new members of the European Union expect concrete signals of our solidarity and not just words."
"That is why we must make further efforts on the existing proposals and the work of the Luxembourg presidency."
"This does not mean that we should abandon the search for a better-balanced budget, reflecting a good compromise between existing spending on our tried and tested policies, in particular cohesion and our new policy agenda for growth and jobs."
"That is why I called for a review clause even before the European Council."
"We need a review clause because we cannot know exactly what the world will be like in 2013."
"But we cannot wait for 2013."
"Given the urgency, it is not reasonable to put everything into question now."
"What is reasonable is to approve the financial perspectives now, working on the basis of the Luxembourg presidency, and accept a review clause during the period of those financial perspectives …"
"… so that we can adapt the priorities, the structure of expenditure and the structure of resources to the changing circumstances."
"Responsibility now lies with the UK presidency to ensure that this is brought to a rapid conclusion, and the Commission is ready to work with it and other Member States to do this."
"One core area of the Lisbon Agenda is better regulation."
"It is not by chance that the first major Commission initiative to implement the revised Lisbon Strategy was the March communication on better regulation for growth and jobs."
"In that context, we have called for closer collaboration between the European Union and Member States."
"The UK presidency’s contribution will be essential to the success of this process."
"We also need this Parliament and the Council of Ministers to make renewed efforts to ensure the quality and workability of the rules you adopt."
"A first target must be agreement next month on a common approach to impact assessment across all three institutions."
"In our bid to cut down on red tape and unnecessary administrative burdens, we are now reviewing proposals that were tabled by preceding Commissions but which have not yet been adopted by the legislators."
"Our objective is to ensure that pending proposals are in line with our Lisbon priorities."
"Some 200 pending proposals are under examination."
"In early autumn we will conclude whether these should remain on the table, be amended or simply thrown out."
"Finally, in October the Commission will present the next phase of its simplification programme setting out a work programme for 2006-2007."
"Another priority I would like to pick out from the many priorities jostling for attention is Africa."
"I have always said that Africa should be a flagship issue of the Commission."
"We got off to a good start with our April package of proposals aimed at accelerating European Union progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and giving priority to sub-Saharan Africa."
"I regret that the European Council’s agreement to our proposals went unnoticed in all the drama of last week."
"This agreement provides the UK presidency with a solid basis for defending the European Union’s position in the important events which mark 2005 as the year of development, particularly the United Nations Summit in September."
"I wish to congratulate the UK on making Africa a priority for its European Union and G8 presidencies, as this will give a welcome extra boost to ongoing activities at European Union level."
"This autumn, for example, the Commission will present a European Union strategy for Africa which will put flesh on the bones of its focus on Africa."
"This focus aims to accelerate European Union action in three key areas: governance, interconnection and equity."
"In order to give a decisive incentive for the reform of Africa’s governance, the Commission proposes to support the implementation of reforms triggered by the Africa peer review mechanism."
"The Commission also proposes a replenishment of the peace facility so as to provide the African Union with the necessary financial muscle to cope with Africa’s conflicts."
"We are already supporting the African Union mission in Darfur, for example."
"I am pleased that the UK presidency will maintain the momentum also on climate change."
"This is a top issue for the European Union."
"Not only must we live up to our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, we must also start intensifying discussions on the international climate policy regime post-2012 and we must engage our main partners in that direction."
"A post-2012 framework must build on five elements: the participation of all major emitting nations; the use of market-based instruments; the inclusion of more sectors, such as international aviation and shipping; the development and use of new technologies and support to enable the poorest and worst-affected countries to adapt effectively to climate change."
"December’s United Nations conference on climate change in Montreal will be an important staging-post in this debate."
"Also in December – and this is the last priority I should like to touch upon – is the WTO ministerial meeting in Hong Kong."
"It is crucial that we spare no effort in making this a success."
"Only then can we hope to bring the Doha Development Agenda to a speedy and successful conclusion, which is the key to greater prosperity, not only for our citizens but also for those in developing countries."
"The UK presidency will see the launch of a period of reflection called for by the European Council."
"We must look within ourselves for a new consensus and strive to regain the confidence of our citizens, but we must also look outwards towards our global responsibilities and opportunities."
"We must be a generous Europe, a Europe of solidarity, a Europe of values as well as markets."
"My Europe – the Europe I want to be part of – is big enough to do both these things."
"The Europe we want is a Europe where we have both economic and political integration."
"We believe in Europe as a political project."
"I hope the UK presidency will make an important contribution to a political Europe and a dynamic Europe."
". Mr President, Prime Minister and future President-in-Office of the European Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we heard yesterday a significant speech by the outgoing President-in-Office of the European Council, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker."
"Today finds us hearing another significant speech by the current Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and incoming President-in-Office of the European Council."
"I would also like to express my thanks to the President of the Commission for his speeches yesterday and today."
"Having been a Member of this House since 1979, I have to say that there has never, in all those years, been such intensive debate about the future shape of the European Union as we have had yesterday and today."
"That is a victory for democracy, a victory for parliamentarianism, a victory for the people of Europe, as the fact that this debate is open to the public means that the people of Europe can participate in it."
"It is for that reason that these two days – yesterday and today – must be our starting point when it comes to informing the European public throughout the European Union, and it is here that the debates must be conducted."
"For that reason, our debates yesterday and today are already of major importance."
"It is also necessary for each succeeding President-in-Office of the European Council to justify his conduct in this Chamber and before the European Parliament whenever he has met with defeat, as he did last weekend."
"Defeat on the financial issue was not in itself all that tragic, but, because it came on top of the defeats in the referenda, that made the crisis all the more acute."
"We insist that it is not behind the closed doors of the European Council that the great debates on our future must be held, but here in the midst of the representatives of the peoples of the European Union, here in the European Parliament."
"That is how it must be in the future!"
"You, the incoming President-in-Office of the European Council, have an immense and difficult task ahead of you."
"You spoke about respect."
"There is indeed a need for respect in Europe, not just respect for the great, but for great and small alike."
"We want no new axes forged between the major states in Europe; we want every country and every citizen to be taken seriously, for this Europe of ours is one in which we share together, and we want it to be a strong Europe, a strong European Union and a Europe that is a Community."
"That is our goal, and it is one from which we shall never be deflected."
"It is for that reason that we are glad that you began your speech by saying that your model does not involve retreating to a free trade area."
"If your actions reflect your words, if what you do in practice makes clear your desire for a community in Europe, then we are right alongside you."
"When it comes to reforming European policies, you gain in credibility if you leave no room for doubt about your European vocation, and I ask that you make this clear during your Presidency."
"We now have to resolve the crisis of confidence in which we find ourselves, to re-establish trust between the actors in the European Council and regain the confidence of the public."
"It follows that what is in the Constitution, our common values and the decision-making processes that we need in order to resolve the issues about our future must become legal and political realities."
"What I ask is that we should not take this pause for reflection as a pause as such, but as a pause in which to think about how we can establish a legal – and hence political – foundation on which this European Union of ours can become effective in the future."
"You now have an immense task ahead of you, one about which Mr Juncker spoke yesterday: the Financial Perspective, about which there was a fair old bit of haggling at the European Council."
"Mr Böge has put forward a proposal from this House relating to the Financial Perspective, and, if you want the possibility of compromise, I urge you to be guided by it."
"Mr Blair, you are a Labour Prime Minister; it was our friend John Major who, as the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister in 1992, managed to put together a Financial Perspective for the whole of the European Union, which was at that time the European Community."
"I wish you, a Labour Prime Minister, the same success that the Conservative, John Major, had in 1992."
"Now for my final point, if the President will allow me a few seconds more."
"You said that we have to carry the people with us."
"We must indeed carry the public with us, but the public want to have a sense of being representative of their own countries as well as of being Europeans together."
"Let us then think about the borders of the European Union; not every country that wants to join it should be welcomed in, for then Europe would risk losing its identity."
"Let us go to work on Europe together."
"Prime Minister, it is now 10 a.m., while in the United Kingdom, where the clocks keep rather different time, it is 9 a.m."
"You got up early this morning."
"Let us always get up early to go to work on Europe!"
"We need, though, to be calm in action, so we need to have had a good night’s sleep."
"Our vision is still a vision of Europe; make it a reality, and we will be by your side."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, Prime Minister, for speaking with such frankness."
"Yours was the sort of frank speech that does one good, and I know that you are the sort of man who can take that sort of language, so I will start with some: John Major may well have been a great Briton, but your beating him gave us particular pleasure."
"Today, Mr Blair, sees not only the beginning of your Presidency of the Council, but also – and this should not be forgotten – the beginning of another great European event, the Tour de France, and when I apply what I think about the Tour de France to the United Kingdom, I have to say that the UK has, in the last few years, always rather pedalled along at the rear of the pack."
"If you think back to Schengen, or to the euro, Great Britain was always, one might say, just before the follow-up vehicle."
"Now, Mr Blair, you must place yourself at the head of the pack, and on a mountain stretch too!"
"We are just coming up to Alpe d’Huez, and I think you should bear in mind that the winner of the Tour gets to wear the only if he makes it through the whole distance and wins every stage."
"Today sees the beginning of the , a short time-trial that has augured well for the future, and, as we discuss your performance in it, let us consider carefully what you actually said."
"You are right to say, Mr Blair, that the time is ripe for reforms and changes."
"That is indeed the case."
"I quite clearly heard you say that this is not the time for accusing those who want to change Europe of betraying it."
"You are right in that, but this is not the time either to put those who want to defend our European social model into a museum – you are right there too."
"Improving our people’s living conditions is dependent upon change, and, while you are right to say that Europe needs more flexibility and more competitiveness both at home and abroad, it needs them because something nobody can dispense with depends upon them."
"By that I mean the growth that they create, which itself is needed in order to create jobs, but not only for their own sake; they must be worthwhile jobs, secure and properly paid so as to enable people to live decently from them – that is what we, in Europe, are aiming for!"
"And, if the change you seek is none other than that very change in the European Union, then Tony Blair the Socialist will have Europe’s Socialists side by side with him – of that you may be certain."
"We must be precise in the debate on reforms in which we are engaged."
"You, Mr President-in-Office and Prime Minister, are right, and Mr Poettering – whom you really did manage to get worked up today – found the right way of saying it: there are debates that have to be conducted, and they have to be conducted here."
"We must, however, conduct them in such a manner that the public can understand what they are about, and that is where we must not confuse one thing with another."
"Yes, Mr Blair, of course we have to reform the common agricultural policy, and yes, of course, we need to spend more on research and development."
"What we must not do, though, is act as if agriculture were the only thing going on in Europe, and there were no research and development being done."
"Our Budget expert, Mr Walter, gave our group some more figures yesterday, and I want to run through them again briefly."
"Taking all agricultural expenditure together, we, in the European Union as a whole, spend 0.48% of Europe’s total gross domestic product on agriculture."
"Add together what the EU and all its Member States spend on research and development, and it works out that, even now, that figure reaches 0.86%."
"That figure must be increased – you are right in saying that – and there is room for reform in agriculture, but these are long drawn-out processes and our credibility depends on our not acting as if Europe amounted to no more than agriculture, without research or development."
"If, Mr Blair, you want to make the European Union deeper, then we are right alongside you."
"I am grateful to you for having, here in this Chamber today, committed yourself to the Constitution."
"I was there as a witness when you signed it in Rome, and I think it is marvellous how the United Kingdom, under your presidency of the Council, is committing itself to the Constitution; there are quite enough people who are committing themselves to it in public and doing something different behind the scenes."
"We have had our fill of politicians who, by their words, throw spanners in the works of European integration and then complain that the European engine is faltering;"
"I find it highly praiseworthy that you should distinguish yourself from them this morning, and for that I am grateful to you, for what is crucial is that we speak frankly and are open and honest in debating the future of Europe."
"Let me draw to a close by saying that, if you are willing to compromise on the Budget, the services directive and the working time directive, then we will back you in that."
"Yet the credibility of your own demand for a compromise, Mr President-in-Office and Prime Minister, is always in proportion to your own willingness to enter into one."
"At some point, then, you must say what you are willing to contribute. To let others make their move before considering making your own may well be the right thing for a British Prime Minister to do, but it is not enough for the President of the Council of the European Union."
"Note well from whom you get applause; it is the Right wing in this House that has just applauded you."
"They have chosen not to hear you say that we want to welcome Turkey into the European Union."
"It is those who are sitting on this side of the House who will be the first to embrace you for saying that."
"Thank you for your attention."
". Thank you, Mr President."
"Prime Minister, you take the helm of a craft lacking direction, wallowing in heavy seas."
"You have every opportunity to show leadership."
"For too long your country has been vulnerable to the caricature sketched 50 years ago by the musical comedy duo Flanders and Swann in their ditty ‘The English are best’, which lambasts the character of other Europeans and insists ‘The English are moral, the English are good, and clever and honest .... but misunderstood’!"
"Britain has moved on since then – heavens, even England has moved on!"
"Modern, meritocratic Britain has a level of intercultural sensitivity not common to its forebears and your speech today reflects that."
"But one speech will not suffice to set aside years of suspicion."
"You need to show that Britain is of Europe, not just with it."
"That you will build on the Union’s institutions, not undermine them; that your drive for reform is rooted in creating consensus, not delighting in division; that your protestant work ethic caters for a catholic sense of community."
"The phenomenon we call globalisation is re-shaping our world view, as you say."
"It opens to humankind new opportunities, yet also puts new strains on our societies."
"The three biggest challenges we face – Third World misery and the migration it generates, climate change, internationally organised crime – all require supranational responses."
"You are right to direct EU priorities to meeting new global demands, complementing the work of the G8."
"But we look forward to seeing how you will do all that on 1% of GNI."
"You are correct, too, that there is a cognitive dissonance between reality and political debate, that we need to get the politics right and give Europe a compelling narrative."
"So let me give you three suggestions."
"First, Council transparency."
"Europe can no longer be built on secrecy and spin."
"If people do not understand what is happening, you cannot reproach them for rejecting it."
"Change the rules of the Council of Ministers."
"The public has a right to know what is being decided in their name and by whom, even if they disagree."
"That is the nature of democracy."
"Second, parliamentary scrutiny."
"National parliaments do not need a European Constitution to scrutinise the European work of their ministers more closely, but they need to be engaged in a process of monitoring and holding ministers to account."
"The European Parliament must also be listened to if we reject draft laws for infringing citizens’ rights or exceeding EU competences."
"Third, public debate."
"This debate cannot wait for the need to underwrite a treaty that governments have already signed."
"Did you go out and meet your trumpet-blowing people in your recent general election?"
"As President Borrell pointed out last week, the rejection of the Constitution was less about the text than the context."
"Last week called you ."
"Show it."
"The EU will be leaderless for as long as its national leaders play to their public galleries."
"You will not secure support for supranational solutions if you claim the credit for common successes and blame Brussels for every ill."
"Stop referring to ‘Europe’ as if it were a thing apart."
"Liberals and Democrats will back your presidency and your drive for better regulation."
"We will help you forge a Financial Services Action Plan to make money move more easily."
"We will support a single market in services if you protect proper public provision and if you heed our concerns for personal freedom we will tackle terrorism together with the Council."
"We also welcome a debate on the structure of a budget inconsistent with the competitiveness and innovation foreseen in Lisbon."
"Rapid and radical reform of rural spending cannot credibly be contemplated, however, without co-financing the CAP to redress French and British budget imbalances."
"Prime Minister, I welcome your speech today."
"It offers the promise to our continental colleagues of a less perfidious albion."
"Heed the words of St Francis of Assisi, quoted on a similar occasion by one of your predecessors: bring pardon where there is injury and harmony where there is discord."
"That is the road to new respect for Britain and the European Union."
". – Mr Blair, I think that, today, you have issued a challenge."
"You have said, ‘I want to change Europe’."
"Welcome to the club, TonyYou are welcome to do this job."
"In that case, though, let us make a few things clear."
"You are not John, Duke of Bedford, Mr Balkenende is not Bishop Cauchon and Mr Chirac is not Joan of Arc. That is old Europe."
"The 100 Years’ War is over, and we need to tell that to Mr Chirac, to Mr Schröder, to Mr Blair and to the rest."
"Europe is exactly the opposite; that is why you were right to say ‘Europe needs leadership’, but who wants to be the leader?"
"Today, a modern leader must tell the truth."
"Mr Blair, you applauded when Mr Barroso referred to the 1%, the skinflint letter that you, Mr Blair, comrade Blair, signed."
"You withdraw your signature."
"Welcome to the club, Mr Blair, welcome to the club."
"And, if I understand it correctly, in 2002, it was your government that rejected the setting of a ceiling for the big agribusinesses, it was your government that gave EUR 300 000 so that the Duke of Bedford, the Queen and Prince Charles could have their subsidies from the European Union."
"Welcome to the club, Mr Blair, welcome to the club."
"And because you rejected that, Tate and Lyle, the biggest sugar company, received EUR 180 million last year."
"Welcome to the club, Mr Blair."
"You will put an end to the situation with Tate and Lyle, with their European aid and subsidies, because they do not deserve it; we agree with you, Mr Blair."
"You see, telling the truth is sometimes difficult."
"You said something else that was very interesting; you said ‘politicians fight populism’."
"You are right."
"We, I lost the referendum on Europe, and we must confront that defeat."
"You must confront your own defeat: the people of Europe said no to the invasion of Iraq."
"Confront the people of Europe on this subject, too."
"Welcome to the club, Mr Blair."
"It is always easy to lecture everybody, and I am a specialist in lecturing: I know how easy it is."
"But if there is one thing I know, it is that, if you want to modernise Europe, the modernisation must be environmentally and socially sustainable."
"That is what we are calling for."
"If you say that the French model is not working, that the right-wing French Government is not working, you are right."
"If you say that the German Government is clearly not working, you are certainly right."
"In that case, however, the problem is that Europe cannot operate on the model of the United Kingdom, Europe cannot operate on the model of France, Europe cannot operate on the model of Luxembourg or of the Netherlands."
"The intelligence of Europe lies in finding a blend between those models and, to do that, Mr Blair, you must not remain Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but become President of Europe, with a vision of Europe."
"We have economic and social problems, and we have environmental problems."
"Therefore, take responsibility and say that Europe, the whole of Europe, must meet the Kyoto commitments."
"You must take responsibility, and the UK must take the responsibility to give more than 0.35% to development aid, because poverty in the world needs it."
"Mr Juncker was right to propose to eradicate world poverty within the first half of this century."
"Let us make that commitment together."
"Welcome to the club, Tony, we are with you"
"To conclude, it is exactly ten years since Srebrenica; it is ten years since Europe, the shame of Europe and of the world, was put before us."
"I call on you to take an initiative."
"The Dayton Agreements cannot and will not make Bosnia and the Balkans work."
"Take this grand initiative, go to see your friend George Bush, go to see your friend Mr Chirac, go to see all your friends and say ‘We need to put an end to Dayton, Europe has (...)’"
". Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have, Mr Blair, put your finger on the tragic inability of the EU, as it is now, to meet the expectations of our fellow citizens."
"You have spoken of change, modernisation and solidarity."
"Very good."
"Now let us look at things a little more closely."
"On three occasions in the space of a month, each time in a very different context, we have had the opportunity to acquaint ourselves with the top priorities of the UK Presidency."
"The first time was on 26 May in the form of a succinct and very specific statement by Gordon Brown, Chancellor of the Exchequer, to the House of Commons."
"I will remind you of four points."
"Firstly, I quote, ‘All regulatory proposals must be tested for their impact on competitiveness’."
"Secondly, an independent business-led advisory group should be set up ‘to give business a central role in the EU rule-making and simplification process’."
"Thirdly, we will hold a conference in London in July on reducing State aid."
"Fourthly, we will call for the creation of a barrier-free transatlantic financial market."
"Dare I say, Prime Minister, that the social courage of these tasks does not exactly leap out at us."
"Nevertheless, a few days later, in an interview with the , you said that you wanted to be receptive to what had just been expressed in the French and Dutch referenda."
"To that end, you called, back then, for reflection on the European social model."
"It seems to me that we do indeed need such reflection, but we need it so that we can draw lessons from the systematic unpicking to which this infamous model has been subjected practically everywhere over the last few years, in the name of ‘the market above all’."
"As Commissioner McCreevy so aptly emphasised in the context of the European Policy Forumon 24 January, and I quote, ‘We should remember that the internal market programme is by far the greatest deregulatory exercise in recent history’. The issue is now to reflect on the European social model, yes, but in what direction?"
"You seem to be convinced that the in that regard is your own model, as it limits apparent unemployment to some 5% of the active population."
"Does this symbolic figure sum up this model?"
"That does not seem to be the case for all the people of the UK."
"For example, according to Mr John Monks, General Secretary of the ETUC, who is a friend of yours, the Anglo-Saxon model is no more popular with the UK electorate than elsewhere in Europe."
"I believe that many labour representatives in the United Kingdom want far-reaching changes."
"Why are you ignoring them?"
"We gain more from listening to doubts than from repeating certainties."
"The third time that we were given the opportunity to see your ambitions for the six months of your Presidency and beyond was of course during your performance at the last European Council."
"As a well-known song says, you want to make the past a blank slate, or at least send the CAP and the budget back to the drawing board."
"Very good, but, in that case too, the only valid question is: in order to change it in what direction?"
"With regard to the CAP, I agree that we should modulate aid to take account of the environment and town and country planning and to avoid productivism."
"I also agree that we should call into question export subsidies that compete directly with production in developing countries, particularly in Africa."
"I also agree whole-heartedly with putting a ceiling on aid so that it does not end up making the rich, or those pseudo-farmers sitting in the House of Lords, even richer, but I do not agree with throwing the baby out with the bathwater: a genuine agricultural sector that will protect us from scourges such as mad cow disease and that will guarantee our sovereignty over our own food in the face of ‘agribusiness’, particularly in the US."
"It is an issue for civilisation."
"As for the infamous rebate, you will have to give it up sooner or later, because it flies in the face of common sense."
"Europeans should be told that, in 2005, this cheque exceeds the whole European research budget."
"It represents more than all the pre-accession aid granted to Romania and Bulgaria over three years."
"This year, it adds up to half of all the agricultural and structural aid allocated to all ten new Member States."
"It enables you to default on your responsibilities on enlargement, and it no doubt helps you to finance the war in Iraq."
"Finally, your share in financing the EU’s budget is 4.5 points lower than your share in Community revenue."
"Where is the solidarity in that?"
"You want to talk about the Europe of the future, Mr Blair?"
"Very well, you are on, let us talk about it!"
". Mr President, Prime Minister, what a change since 1997 in terms of the rhetoric!"
"Suddenly we have a Labour British Prime Minister talking about low growth in Europe, talking about unemployment in Europe, talking about the failure of European economic policies and common policies."
"In fact it all sounds a bit like the same sort of thing UKIP has been saying for the last ten years and I am delighted to hear it."
"There you were at the Summit last week, the tough British Prime Minister, and I am sure that millions of people at home were watching the early evening news saying there he is!"
"That is our boy, he is the man that is going to stand up for British interests."
"In fact it seems to me that you are a europhile that has been mugged by reality."
"Now you are going to lead a battle for the future of Europe."
"Several times in the last week you have talked about the 21st century, you have talked about the need to modernise."
"It seems that the devastatingly brilliant third way that you introduced into British politics is what you are going to bring in during this presidency here."
"The question is, will it work in the European Union?"
"I am the joint leader of the only Group in this Parliament that has actively been campaigning for ‘no’ votes in the Constitutional referendums."
"So we feel that we are perhaps rather more in touch with public opinion than all the rest of the Groups in this Parliament."
"But I have to say that you are just about the only European Leader who really understands why the people of France and Holland voted ‘no’."
"I agree with what you said earlier, i.e. that they were saying ‘no’ to the direction that the European Union is going in."
"I am asking you in your presidency to make sure that those people in France and Holland are not treated with contempt."
"I am asking you to make sure that the parts of the Constitution such as the separate military command structure, the European Space programme and the establishment of the European Union foreign embassies across the world are halted because they are only given legitimacy by a Constitution that is now best part dead."
"You have talked much in recent times about Africa and I know you are very proud of the fact that the aid that will be going to Africa is going up in value."
"However, the one thing I have spoken on more times in this House since 1999 than any other subject are the appalling European Union fisheries deals with black Africa."
"There are now over twenty of these deals in place."
"They are destroying any hope, any prospect for the local artisanal fishermen."
"We are actually killing hundreds and hundreds of local fishermen every year and what we are doing to the seas off Africa is the environmental equivalent to setting fire to the Serengeti."
"Everybody here has been deaf to what I have been saying on this, but I believe there is now a body of support across this Parliament to end these deals."
"If you really want to help Africa, please, stop those deals."
"But of course the big challenge, and what you will be judged by, is whether you can turn this ship around; whether you can make Europe more competitive; whether you can make the Lisbon Agenda appear to be rather more than just a child’s wish list to Father Christmas."
"Of course my view – our view in UKIP and most of us here on this side of the House – is that we would much rather see a common market."
"We would much rather see a free trade deal across Europe, rather than the Treaty of Rome and all that has come since."
"I know that you are not going to do that over the course of the next six months, but I think you have got a real problem."
"You said earlier that you wanted Europe to do what it was set up to do."
"Jean Monnet was the inspiration behind this and he wanted a system whereby, under the , the Community picked up power along the way."
"I would argue that if you now speak to small and medium-sized businesses – not just in Britain, but right across the European Union – the trouble is that the legislation, the , the body of law, has gone too far already."
"The challenge for your presidency – and perhaps you could explain to me in your response – is how you are going to turn the ship around."
"If you can reform the European Union, Mr Blair, then I may even change my mind."
"I may even think it is worth us staying as a Member State."
". Mr President, I too would like to join with my colleagues in welcoming Prime Minister Blair to the House and thanking him for his contribution and his speech this morning."
"Much as I appreciate that speech, I am somewhat disconcerted by Gordon Brown’s annual address at the Mansion House last night."
"Despite the good words and the good intentions, I have three separate conclusions about what we saw last weekend, what we read in the papers from Britain, what we have seen in the news media over the last few days and what Mr Brown said in his speech last night."
"Ensure that any budget changes that are made will be predicated upon getting rid of the common agricultural policy. This is despite the fact that in 2002 there was a unanimous agreement amongst all Member States that the CAP budget will be fixed for a period up to 2013 on foot of reforms and on foot of sacrifices made by people living in rural areas and people involved in agriculture, including the reduction in the annual budget of CAP because there was no cost of living increase or no inflation index allowed for increasing of funding."
"So therefore what people really need to see is certainty."
"Second, much emphasis is being placed upon the lack of ability on the part of Europe to deliver on things like the Lisbon Agenda and creating more jobs."
"Let us get real about this."
"Europe is as incapable of creating jobs as the British Government is of creating jobs."
"It is up to us as legislators and as rule makers to ensure that the legislation and the regulations that we put down do not impede private industry and private business to give them the right atmosphere, the right opportunity in which to thrive and to grow."
"And it is ridiculous to speak about how we must do more at European level when at the same time you will not increase the budget that is available to the European Union to undertake this work, despite the fact that the numbers of people involved in the European Union and the number of countries involved in the European Union has increased."
"I think that if we want to speak about real debate and real engagement then that debate and that engagement must be based upon facts, certainties, not the continuous misconception, myth and innuendo that have been cast about over the last 20 years."
"Last night I heard Jeremy Paxman on saying that the reform of the sugar regime in Europe was the most disreputable and inefficient form of subsidy given to farmers in Europe and is harming farmers in developing countries."
"On the same report about these reforms we heard the President of Guyana, the chairman of the Jamaican sugar industry and the chairman of the Mozambique sugar industry saying what a disaster these reforms would be for those countries."
"The President of Guyana actually said that they would receive EUR 8 million in debt relief because of the fantastic initiative undertaken by yourself and your government as leaders of the G8 with regard to alleviating debt in Africa and it would cost them GBP 44 million to try and comply with the reforms that would be put forward."
"Finally, some will say that we are standing on the edge looking into the abyss."
"As I said to you in London last week, I believe we are standing at the dawn of a new future."
"You can give the leadership but that leadership requires compromise and consensus."
"It requires you to bring the other actors together to ensure we have a success."
"Mr President, speaking as a British Conservative I would like to congratulate Prime Minister Blair on his recent robust defence of the British rebate in the House of Commons and in Westminster."
"I urge him to stand firm on the rebate and to honour the clear commitments he has made."
"I also commend his conversion to a long-standing Conservative policy, that of wide-ranging reform of the EU; reform which is essential now that the EU has ceased to command the respect, or to engage the enthusiasm, of the public."
"However, as John Redwood said this morning on the programme, if Mr Blair is serious about reform and deregulation he will have had a team in place for months working out detailed plans."
"Who are these people?"
"What are these plans?"
"I am concerned that he has agreed to a period of reflection on the Constitution."
"There is nothing to reflect about."
"The decision of French and Dutch voters is extremely clear: France and Holland did not vote for a slightly different Constitution, they voted against the Constitution in its entirety."
"Under its own terms the Constitution cannot take effect until all Member States ratify it, which will not now happen."
"UK voters, given the chance, would have rejected the Constitution by a still wider margin than France or Holland."
"Overwhelmingly they want trade and cooperation in Europe, they reject your political union."
"Mr Blair, will you agree with me that meaningful reform of the EU will require radical renegotiations of the Treaties, including the Treaty of Rome?"
"Will you make this a key objective of the British presidency?"
"Finally, Mr Blair, may I thank you for staying to listen to the debate here today, which you so rarely do in Westminster."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Conservative delegation and my European Democrat colleagues, can I welcome the Prime Minister and say that we hope the British presidency will indeed be a truly reforming one."
"It is important for our country and our national interest that Britain gives leadership to Europe at a time when fundamental questions on its future are being asked."
"However, it has to be the right kind of leadership and it has to be the right kind of future."
"The events of recent weeks have indeed been a wake-up call for politicians across the Union."
"The fact that the people of France and the Netherlands, two founding States, voted emphatically against the Constitution has to be of profound significance."
"I regret that the European Council did not respond decisively to these votes by declaring the Constitution dead."
"Mr Blair has said that there needs to be a real debate on the kind of European Union that we want in the future and I agree with him."
"I look to him to lead that debate in the coming months."
"We hope that he will show his leadership by explaining exactly what he meant by his comments the other day that there is more than one view on Europe's future."
"Earlier this week Mr Blair said the crisis is about the failure of leaders to reach agreement with the people who see the world changing, and who want answers to the challenges they face."
"Well, British Conservatives have been saying this for years about the European Union as we have led the way here in the fields of liberalising our economies, deregulation, the Lisbon Agenda and open accountability and control of our budgets."
"If he is now rather belatedly accepting our positions, I certainly welcome his conversion."
"However, this is not just a crisis of leadership, as he says, but it is also a crisis of legitimacy within the EU institutions."
"Fine words from our government are all very well, but what we now need is action."
"The social model has not succeeded in Europe and millions of unemployed with low growth and inflexible labour markets personify economic decline."
"We now have to compete with India, China and the United States, and the longer we brush the reality aside, the Lisbon Agenda remains nothing but an aspiration."
"I turn now to the future financing of the Union."
"The Prime Minister was right to defend the British rebate."
"There is a reason for this rebate existing, and it is as strong as it was in 1984."
"The apparent slippage in the Government's position, which has been confirmed this morning by the Prime Minister, is of concern to us and we obviously watch carefully to ensure that British taxpayers do not become pawns in discussions over the future of our budget."
"In conclusion I want to urge the Prime Minister not to be deflected from his stated goals of reform in the Union."
"We want his rhetoric of recent days to be matched by real leadership and real action."
"We hope that he can deliver."
"It is the interests of all of us that he delivers what he says he will."
"When we judge him in December we hope that he will not have failed us."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome the future President-in-Office by quoting Charles Dickens: 'it was the best of times, it was the worst of times, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us'."
"So it is with the European Union."
"At the time of our greatest success, the enlargement to 25, we find ourselves cast down by doubts and recriminations."
"Globalisation has bred insecurity among our citizens, causing some to doubt the European project and to embrace protectionism and isolationism."
"Yet it is only by coherent European action that we can confront the threats and seize the opportunities of globalisation."
"Unfortunately, much of what the EU has achieved is now taken for granted by the voters and is regarded, frankly, as 'old hat'."
"We have to define a modern vision of the European Union and its purpose and relevance; a vision based on concrete outcomes, not processes; a vision based on certain key principles."
"Firstly, the importance of international partnerships and particularly the most successful partnership of them all, the European Union."
"We have to recognise that the strength of the EU lies in its supranational institutions which complement and supplement national sovereignty and do not replace it."
"Secondly, our ability to deliver jobs for our citizens and economic security for their families is central to our continuing success."
"A successful economy is not an Anglo-Saxon conspiracy, but the key to our survival."
"The European Union has already done a lot."
"In recent days we have heard that EU membership costs this country EUR 20 per head, or that country EUR 50 per head."
"These figures are insignificant compared with the EUR 6 000 per head by which the single market has benefited its citizens through extra growth."
"But we must do more to harness the knowledge economy by investing in the projects of the future and not the past."
"Economic efficiency depends on social justice."
"Prosperity comes from a secure workforce and a society that invests in all its citizens, excluding no-one."
"We need active labour market policies to help people find and keep work."
"A third of our working-age population is economically inactive."
"That figure is a disgrace and stands to the condemnation of the EU and its Member States."
"Finally, we need an open society where people are free to travel to find work."
"Such an open society has to be fair and just and not a free ride for the criminals and the terrorists."
"That is why I particularly welcome the presidency programme on justice and home affairs."
"Real progress here will show our citizens the benefits of European action."
"The presidency has to bring Member States together to build a competitive Europe and a Europe capable of giving leadership in the world on issues such as security, climate change and world poverty, the very issues that our citizens are concerned about."
"I wish you the best of luck."
"Mr President, Mr Blair, thank you for a wonderfully committed speech."
"You are a terrific speaker, and you are very convincing."
"You would have been more credible, however, if you had presented the same European vision to your electorate at the last parliamentary elections you held."
"I see your Presidency as an historic challenge."
"In six months’ time, you can either transfer the Presidency to Austria, having unified Europe, or you can slam the door and leave Europe still more divided than it is at present."
"It is up to you."
"First and foremost, it is a question of putting the European agenda above national agendas."
"That is difficult and demands leadership, but it also requires will, and I hope that you have that will."
"Above all, you should now, moreover, as one of the leaders of the enlargement process, show solidarity towards our new Member States."
"I am pleased that you attach a lot of importance to the Services Directive and that you will do a lot of work on removing the administrative difficulties."
"Precisely by creating a free market for services, we can give our people jobs and give consumers freedom of choice at fair and reasonable prices."
"I look forward to seeing, in six months’ time, that you have stood the test as Europe’s best leader."
"I shall then happily give you your examination certificate."
"Mr President, in the past Mr Blair has said that climate change is the biggest threat that we face."
"He said that it would be a priority for the British presidency."
"Yet, Mr Blair, we have had just half a sentence on climate change from you in your speech here today."
"Moreover, yours is a government under which greenhouse gas emissions have actually risen."
"Yours is a government which has attempted to increase the volume of emissions allowable to British industry under the EU emissions trading scheme."
"That is hardly a very good start for someone who is pledging to show international leadership on the issue of climate change."
"I would like to challenge you to make three key assurances about your presidency."
"First, to promote mandatory targets for energy efficiency across the European Union."
"Second, to adopt targets for renewables which are consistent with a reduction of between 30 to 40 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020."
"Third, to rule out nuclear power as any kind of so-called solution to reducing CO2 emissions."
"When you lecture the rest of Europe about the merits of modernisation, competition and flexibility, yet leave out any reference at all to sustainability: it completely undermines any claims you make to be committed to sustainable development."
"Yes, Europe must change as you say, but unless that change puts sustainability at its heart then your presidency will lose a vital opportunity to help the European Union regain public support and it will squander a key moment to address climate change seriously."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you, Mr Blair, are not the solution to Europe’s problems; in fact you are one of the problems."
"You are not a new problem, but an old problem."
"The problems of Europe are its inability to work towards achieving peace, and, let us not forget, you went to war in Iraq alongside George Bush. They are democratic, political, economic and social crises precisely due to the liberalist, monetarist and technocratic policies that you advocate, passing off old ideas as new."
"You talk about political Europe, but in fact you entrust it all to the market, because for you, politics, the economy and the market are one and the same thing."
"In fact, whilst you understand that this liberalist Constitutional Treaty is dead, the cure that you propose to us is completely inappropriate, in terms of liberal reforms, starting with the one on services and the labour market: this cure of yours does not even enjoy good health in your own country, as we witnessed with the elections."
"No!"
"The solution to Europe’s problems is something else entirely, and it is preciselyto be found in this left-wing, mass Europeanism that has consciously emerged among citizens who have read and understood and expressed themselves by means of the vote in France and the Netherlands."
"They were not protesting against either Turkey or enlargement, but explicitly against liberalism."
"They call for a tangible and formal Constitution for a new peaceful, democratic and social Europe, and can find broad agreement on that with the many citizens who expressed a critical ‘yes’ vote."
"That is our Europe and this Parliament has a major responsibility that it cannot and must not avoid."
"It is not a matter of chasing after new supposed leaders, but of being a thoroughly new Parliament."
"This crisis is not a crisis of calculations and of egoisms, or of the computer against the country folk, but we cannot forget how ‘mad cow’ disease started."
"It is that too, but it is above all the unquestionable crisis of a liberalist idea: not to formulate an alternative idea of Europe would truly be unforgivable."
"Mr President, Prime Minister Blair, ladies and gentlemen, there would appear to be no justification for the across-the-board criticism levelled at the United Kingdom following the failed European Council summit."
"As a matter of fact, there are strong grounds for believing that the British Presidency has no intention of being influenced by the selfish national interests attributed to it."
"Its stated priorities reveal that the EU’s goal will instead be solidarity between Member States, which represents a return to the ideas of Europe’s founding fathers."
"The fact that the Presidency wishes to reform the EU’s ossified structures is cause for optimism."
"This pragmatic and future-looking approach, which is of enormous value, could give a fresh impetus to the development of Europe’s nations and to cooperation between them, by supplanting the illusory idea of a superstate with a constitution, the latter being fortunately dead and buried."
"As far as the British rebate is concerned, Prime Minister Blair recently said in an interview that the United Kingdom would be prepared to pay more, but only if the money went to poor countries rather than rich ones."
"This way of thinking represents a major opportunity for Europe’s poorest regions, five of which are in Poland."
"They include the Lubelski and Podkarpacki regions, which have huge infrastructure problems, but also huge potential in the form of major universities."
"Sensible policies of this kind are just what these and many other European regions need."
"One can but hope that all EU Member States will support the measures taken by a strong British Presidency, and I am sure that France and Germany will also back European solidarity."
"After all, solidarity was the founding principle of the European Community, even though the current leaders of the two countries I mentioned appear to have forgotten this fact."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, the vast majority of Danes, in common with the British, do not want the EU Constitution because we do not wish to surrender our sovereignty to politicians who go about things as badly as the EU does at present."
"Mr Blair, you are a very popular politician in Denmark, but we shall respect you even more if you arrange for the Constitution to be buried for, as you well know, it does not solve a single one of the problems that engage the attention of Europeans and that you described very precisely."
"I would thank you for your plans to amend the EU budget, which has now completely seized up."
"It is not the richest who pay most and the poorest who receive most."
"EU aid policy has lost all meaning when it comes both to agriculture and structures."
"What happens is that those countries that are industrious and willing to tax their citizens hard make payments to countries that do not implement reforms and do not wish to tax their people."
"We go on and on about research and development, but these are not what we spend money on."
"We look forward to the reforms you are to present, and I wish you good luck."
"Mr President, the voters of France and Holland have denied power to those they no longer trust, as indeed we would have done in the UK had we had the chance."
"We are now left with the worst possible solution: the Constitution is dead, but we have the structures and methods to govern a unitary state still in place."
"Projects have been started which depended on the Constitution for their legitimacy."
"A European president and foreign minister, a European public prosecutor, diplomatic service, space policy, a European Defence Agency and Rapid Reaction Force, a Fundamental Rights Agency to enforce a charter that now has no standing, a police force and a European asylum and immigration policy."
"These bits of the Constitution cannot be forced into being against the will of the people."
"We have had far too much unaccountable and interfering government from this place over the years."
"The British presidency should take three immediate and crucial steps: to enforce the rule of law in this place; to abandon projects which pre-empted the Constitution and now have no legal basis; and to guarantee that no attempt will be made to implement any part of it."
"Prime Minister, you say that you want to level out the anomalies in Europe."
"Well, your presence in Brussels today is an anomaly."
"You should know that the programme of activities for a Presidency of the European Council is presented in Strasbourg, the official site of the European Parliament."
"Yes, Europe is in crisis, the Summit was a failure and your coming Presidency is faced with a crucial choice: either Europe will be a huge economic grouping with neither head nor tail in which witches dance around the grave of the draft Constitution, a sort of ‘Blair witch project’; or you release the handbrake to help us turn this historic corner that is the advent of a truly political Europe."
"Prime Minister, you are talented – you speak brilliantly – but who are we to believe, you or Mr Juncker?"
"You preferred to create a crisis so that you could ride the crest of that crisis and serve your own interests."
"If you want to lead Europe, you must first of all stop having one foot in Europe and one foot outside."
"Therefore, yes to social modernisation, but we do not want your uncertainty."
"Yes to the development of biotechnology, yes to a rational European budget, yes to true European defence, but do not forget that the CAP is a foundation of the European Union which cannot be consigned to history, but whose survival depends on its development."
"You say that you want to make progress in the fight against crime and illegal immigration, but how can we believe you when, for the last ten years, the United Kingdom has systematically opposed police and judicial cooperation?"
"Finally, how can we explain the fact that, in their own countries, the Heads of State or Government are announcing the idea of a moratorium on the enlargement of Europe and that, on the other hand, in the Council, they are leaving all the doors open?"
"Mr Blair, the citizens of Europe no longer agree."
"It is now time to stop the doublespeak, because it has led to the worst. Mr Blair, you have much to prove to gain our confidence."
"Mr President, you, Mr Blair, are entering into a difficult inheritance."
"Yesterday, Mr Juncker was in this Chamber, and we very much appreciated and applauded his commitment – an emotional commitment – to the European cause."
"You, today, have told us the other half of the truth, a great deal of which I can understand, and if many Members of this House were to rid themselves of the prejudices they have accumulated over recent years, they would find a lot in what has been said today that they would agree with."
"What Europe needs, though, is wholehearted commitment, both on your part and on that of your country."
"The British press and public being what they are, that will not be easy, but what is needed is an opt-in rather than an opt-out, and I hope that you, as President-in-Office of the Council, will be putting the case for one."
"Let me mention a few issues, starting with unemployment, in respect of which you, in the UK, have notched up some enormous successes."
"Any objective observer must concede that."
"Having had very high unemployment during the Thatcher era, it is now very low, among the lowest in Europe."
"That is the sort of thing we need, although – as Mr Schulz said – we also need jobs that confer dignity, particularly in view of enlargement."
"I am very grateful to you for the sympathetic things you had to say about enlargement, but we have to ensure that there are no new divisions, and that the workers from Eastern Europe, who are, alas, perennially underpaid, are not exploited."
"Secondly, there is the issue of the services directive, and about this you are entirely right; although we need a common market in services, we have to create one step by step, and we also need something that you mentioned only indirectly, namely public services."
"As you yourself said, manifest deficiencies mean that the United Kingdom has to make massive investments in such public services as transport, health and housing, and that sort of investment too must make up the shortfall in the services sector, which we are in the process of liberalising."
"This liberalisation process is something that people will accept if they see that this Europe of ours is all in favour not only of a common market, but also of the public services about which they care a great deal."
"You are entirely right in what you say about enlargement."
"We cannot call a halt to it, but we must make better preparations for it, both in the new Member States and in the existing Member States of the European Union, for the argument was often – and wrongly – deployed that enlargement would be to the detriment of the existing Member States."
"You were right to say how false that is, but that is something we have to get across to our own people."
"Foreign policy will also be a decisive factor."
"Great Britain, the country of which you are the Prime Minister, has traditionally had good relations with the United States of America."
"You enjoy especially good relations with President Bush, and that can be to Europe’s benefit, provided that it is clear that you speak also for Europe; provided that it is clear that the position you represent in Washington is Europe’s."
"If you do that, we will be right behind you."
"One of the greatest projects – and one to which you referred – is the Middle East."
"We need peace in the Middle East, for – far from being just any old region of the world – the Middle East is our own back yard, our own neighbourhood, and we need peace to be concluded between the Palestinians and the Israelis."
"You have undertaken to play a very active part in bringing it about, and have indeed already been doing so over recent months, but the critical stage will come – as we must be aware – with the withdrawal from Gaza, which is imminent."
"The European position cannot amount to ‘Gaza first and last’; we have to take a more progressive line here."
"Lastly, I urge you to cultivate your good relations with the Americans, but London is closer to Brussels than to Washington."
"Even if President Bush needs you in Washington, we need you here in Brussels."
"Mr President, Europe will never be brought closer to the people, and national parliaments can never hope to hold Ministers to account so long as Europe's most powerful law-making body continues to meet in secret."
"Is it any wonder that people complain of a democratic deficit in Europe when debate about new laws in the Council of Ministers takes place behind closed doors?"
"The Prime Minister will recognise this failing."
"In signing the Constitutional Treaty he accepted that the Council should meet in public when it deliberates upon legislative acts."
"But no referendum or treaty is required, just a simple vote in the General Affairs Council."
"The support of just 13 Member States is an easy task."
"It is a quick win."
"The Prime Minister says it is time for Europe to make choices."
"So here is a simple one for him to make: maintain the culture of secrecy or put the principles of openness and transparency into practice."
"Mr Blair, I listened very carefully to your presentation, in particular the emphasis on solidarity in combating poverty."
"However, the delay in the agreement on the EU budget means that my constituency, West Wales and the Valleys – an Objective 1 area – has lost its chance for full convergence funding after 2007."
"While the UK Government focused on retaining the rebate, Wales lost up to GBP 3 billion and next year will be too late, so the UK’s interest was not in Wales’ interest."
"I want Europe to change."
"We want a Europe where nations like Wales can play a full part in their own right."
"It is essential that we make Europe more relevant to people."
"In line with that aim and following the example of the Irish presidency, and more recently the Spanish Government, I call upon the UK presidency to request that Welsh be made an official language of the European Union."
"To translate that into Welsh myself as I have to do in this Chamber at present:"
"Mr President, I would like to extend a to you, Mr Blair, and to wish to well in your presidency of the European Union."
"We are all aware of the challenges that lie ahead for the European Union both economically and socially."
"I want to support what you said earlier on and I agree with you, if we want to see a maturing and a strengthening of the European social model, we need vibrant economies, that is plain for everyone to see."
"Last week's events, however, saw an unfortunate and heated debate on the financial situation of the European Union."
"Some of that debate unfortunately centred around the common agricultural policy."
"Opinion is greatly divided on the effectiveness and the long-term sustainability of the common agricultural policy, but one of its most ambitious aims is to support and sustain the European Union’s rural communities, which are under serious threat."
"We live in a world where half a million people move from a rural environment to an urban environment every single week."
"In 1970, 63% of the world's population lived in a rural environment, in 2020 it will be 45 per cent."
"The challenges that lie ahead are great, not just for the quality of life for those who reside in an increasingly urbanised Europe."
"Bearing that in mind, I would ask you, Mr Blair, to concentrate on the urban problems as opposed to dismantling the CAP, which hopefully will strengthen rural communities in the years ahead."
"Mr President, after the rejections of the Constitution, the Prime Minister rightly said that profound questions now arose about the future of Europe."
"From the example of last weekend, it is clear that the over-centralised EU is presently not working."
"Although Mr Juncker, yesterday, sought to make the United Kingdom a scapegoat, the reality is that it is the structures and policies of Europe which are fatally flawed."
"I suspect from your speech, Mr Blair, that you are not prepared to face the real questions that arise from that."
"Sticking-plaster politics do not work."
"You should know that from Northern Ireland."
"Ever-closer union has failed."
"It is time to embrace the primacy of the nation states over the stifling control of Brussels."
"It is time to repatriate key powers."
"It is time to return to making free trade, not political union, the cornerstone of Europe."
"Finally, I urge you, as Prime Minister, to continue to take a firm stand in defence of the justified rebate, which you can properly defend on its own merits …"
"Mr President, as one of the first Members of this House from the new Member States to take the floor, I must begin by saying that it was not because of the new Members that either the Constitutional Treaty or the budget debate have brought about a crisis in the EU."
"The crisis was generated by the EU-15."
"I am convinced that the example of the dynamic new Member States, which have implemented colossal changes over recent decades, can revive the often ossified European economy, and bring jobs, growth, a secure, family-oriented and citizen-friendly Europe."
"When looking for a way out, let us begin with the unjust and unjustified discrimination that still persists within the Union."
"Prime Minister, your country is one of the few that has not taken fright at workers from the new Member States."
"The task is this: throughout Europe, we must immediately clear the obstacles obstructing the new Member States citizens’ freedom to work."
"Prime Minister, you said that the common agricultural policy is untenable in its present form."
"But do not forget that farmers in the new Member States now only receive a fraction of what the old Members get."
"Our task is to reform the common agricultural policy, but let us also begin to eradicate the internal inequalities, and let Polish, Hungarian and Estonian farmers receive the same support that their Austrian, French or British counterparts are entitled to."
"Prime Minister Blair and President Barroso, both of you also referred to the need to make Europe competitive."
"Today, however, it looks as if Europe has baulked at competition."
"The task that faces us in this regard is to dismantle the barriers to free movement of services, for although services account for the largest share of the European economy, their free movement is a freedom which so far exists only on paper."
"Let us adopt the Services Directive!"
"Prime Minister, you spoke of Europe’s renewal, and rightly so."
"Let us begin the process of renewal together, all twenty-five of us, without unjust, artificial and internal discrimination."
"That concludes the debate."
"Colleagues, it gives me great pleasure to welcome members of a delegation from the Parliament of Kuwait – led by Dr Nasser Jasem al-Sane – who have taken their seats in the distinguished visitors’ gallery as part of their first visit to the European Parliament."
"The delegation’s visit is particularly timely, coming just one month after the Kuwaiti Parliament endorsed the request made by the Emir, Jaber al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, to amend the electoral law in order to reflect more closely the Constitution by allowing women to secure the right to vote and to stand for election in national and local elections."
"We in this Parliament welcome this historic vote and encourage the women of Kuwait to exercise their newly acquired rights in the general election scheduled for 2007."
"We now continue with the debate on the programme of the British Presidency."
"Mr President, one could accuse Prime Minister Tony Blair of many things, but not of paying lip service."
"Mr Blair, you are a courageous and strong leader."
"You have stated your convictions and the direction in which you wish to go."
"I thank you for that."
"Let me say that today’s debate should not be about whispering in the corner or blaming somebody else for what happened yesterday, but should focus upon what you said."
"One thing is worrying the citizens of Europe, and that is the future: the lack of jobs and answers to globalisation."
"The responsibility of Parliament is to support a UK presidency which said the following, ‘We have to create changes to equip people to live during permanent changes’."
"The question is not whether there will be changes but what kind of changes."
"The question is not whether there will be reforms, but what type of reforms."
"Mr Blair, in my short amount of time today I will focus on that question."
"Your principal task internally in Europe in the next six months will be to create more jobs through higher growth and the right reforms."
"It is about doing these things simultaneously."
"I know that even if you succeed – which I hope you will – in achieving this new European budget, we know and you know that most of the effort to create more jobs takes place in the nation state."
"It is also the responsibility of the nation states to really focus on a modernisation process and to unite a new social progress with a new competitiveness and growth."
"Today, as your first task internally, I urge you to formulate a new deal among governments to invest in the Lisbon process in the next four years, not because it is a requirement of the Treaty, but as an obligation to the people."
"If you can achieve a new agreement during your presidency on goal-oriented investments to increase growth internally, combined with some consensus on the social model, then you are in the driving seat and I sincerely hope you will stay there."
"Mr President, the Lisbon strategy is a very important tool to enhance European economic growth and when we negotiated this in the Parliament we were very clear that we wanted sustainable economic growth."
"Despite this, in your speech, Mr Blair, you hardly mentioned environmental questions at all."
"Environmentally driven industry has two and a half times the growth rate that is normal in European industry."
"Environmentally driven questions are also key to economic growth, so I want a message on this from you, Mr Blair."
"Secondly, I am negotiating the chemical directive as rapporteur."
"Right now that is one of the very few things that can deliver a result to the European citizen during your presidency."
"Therefore it would be very nice to also have a clear result on this to ensure that the future is not blurred but ."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, it seems that French and Dutch voters have startled you into some attitude changes."
"Now all of a sudden you say that the EU needs modernisation and yet not so long ago you told us that this was what the Constitution was for."
"Now you find the agriculture funding package that you signed up to not so long ago unacceptable."
"Now you cannot sign up to a budget compromise, because it is not the right deal for Britain."
"Yet your own government has repeatedly signed up to disastrous deals, particularly for Scotland, such as the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"Speaking of disasters for Scotland, your own line on the EU budget limit would end structural funding in Scotland at a cost of a billion pounds."
"While it is true to say that the EU institutions need reform, it is also true that euroscepticism has grown in Scotland because you have continued the traditional UK Government practice of selling out Scotland's interests in cobbled together compromises."
"The best form of constitutional reform for Scotland would be to represent ourselves in the European Union as an independent Member State."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today is a red-letter day for this House."
"An important speech has been given by a politician who does not use the empty phrases, or Eurospeak, so beloved of Brussels bureaucrats."
"Whether one agrees with him or not, his speeches are worth hearing."
"Mr Blair, I remember well the speech you gave in Warsaw four years ago, at a meeting with the Prime Ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia."
"In that speech, you rightly referred to the vision of a Europe of nations as opposed to that of a supranational Europe."
"The latter is an idea that only looks good on paper or in the minds of its creators."
"Today you treated this House with the utmost seriousness, by identifying those aspects of our present situation that are illusions, those that are challenges and those that are unquestionably propaganda."
"There is one point, however, upon which I cannot agree with you..."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr Blair, I think it is the case – and it is the message that we get from the European people – that we need reforms."
"We have to make Europeans more competitive, which involves setting limits and avoiding red tape and excessive regulation."
"I would also, however, like to say that this economic project is not at odds with a constitutional treaty; on the contrary, the latter creates the conditions without which the former cannot succeed, by creating better decision-making structures, greater transparency and more participation for the public."
"In particular – and this was something we saw yesterday at the Iraq conference – it also better enables Europe to play its part on the world stage."
"One reason, I think, why we have to make it clear that there is no contradiction between improving Europe’s economy and a political project, but rather that the former is dependent on the latter, is that the political project calls forth the solidarity that is needed if there is to be cooperation in economic matters."
"That is why we need both a political project and one market, rather than just a political project or just a free trade zone."
"The market demands modern conditions under which to operate, including social security and protection for the environment and the consumer."
"These strike me as important issues to which we want to respond in a positive way."
"We want a social market economy rather than Manchester liberalism, and we need to keep reminding ourselves of that fact."
"I have to say, Mr Blair, that if Europe is to be effective in this way, it has to set limits upon itself."
"Enlargement must be limited in the light of the present situation, in order that Europe may not become overstretched and hence less effective and less competitive."
"I therefore invite you to resolve this persistent contradiction."
"I welcome your statement that you want to advance the political project, and so I will take this opportunity, here in this Chamber, to invite you to become a full member of this Europe, for it is to the euro that the European Union owes much of its ability to compete, and I would be delighted if the United Kingdom were to sign up to the euro and to Schengen too, thereby taking full advantage of its membership of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the unsuccessful agreement on the financial perspectives is all the more serious because it was the first act carried out by the Council following the problems encountered in ratifying the Treaty."
"Formulating new policies for Europe with fewer resources does not equate to a solution, and neither does suggesting reforms, including legitimate ones, which encroach upon other people’s privileges, without seriously questioning one’s own."
"The recent European Council adopted many foreign policy decisions to tackle external commitments that cannot be postponed."
"I hope that that is a sign of the will not to abandon an effective policy and the prospect of having a real European Foreign Minister."
"On the subject of Iraq, holding the Brussels Conference was important; however, the situation on the ground remains serious and out of control."
"The United Kingdom supported military intervention, recommending it as a means of resolving the entire Middle East crisis."
"That gives you added responsibility during your presidency in terms of finding a definitive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"The Iraq affair further confirms that Europe’s international role is unthinkable outside of a multilateral context, and it was therefore a serious mistake, in the past, to split Europe, and today, for a number of Member States to abandon the objective of a European seat in the future United Nations Security Council."
"You stated that you were against having a free trade area; that is an important point."
"However, the risk of sliding towards that prospect is in the facts: if we put a stop to political integration, if we are not able to formulate new objectives and if we do not provide institutions capable of implementing them."
"That is even more necessary in the perspective, with which I believe you agree, Prime Minister, of a great Europe that is not closed off to the Balkans and to Turkey."
"What a mess, Mr Blair!"
"You were, just a short while ago, surrounded by esteem and general respect and you managed to produce a by disappointing us before you even began."
"It is deeply shocking on a moral level that the United Kingdom wants to shy away from the solidarity efforts to which all have consented in order to help the enlargement countries."
"It is economically dishonest to claim that farmers are sucking Europe dry when total agricultural expenditure is no more than 1.3% of the European Union’s total public expenditure."
"It is legally and politically abhorrent that you are arriving at a system in which you want to make the reform of a common policy dependent on the choice of a budgetary arbitration."
"It was at the request of the United Kingdom that the Court of Justice said that it was the legal basis that should determine expenditure, not the other way round."
"Finally, let me say, as a defeated Frenchman who is unhappy to have lost the referendum, that I do not think it is very magnanimous, or a very good example of fair play, to choose the moment when my country is on its knees to attack it."
"You know, six months will not be too long to repair the damage you have done in three days."
"I am delighted that defeatist talk of a crisis has given way to such courageous notions as opportunity, modernisation and change, and that Tony Blair is prepared to tackle the glaring discrepancies that exist between the arrogance of EU politicians, the real lives of our citizens and overall developments in the world economy."
"Our citizens are not interested in dreams; they are interested in standards of living, and whether they will have jobs in the future."
"The real impact of the EU’s policies can be seen from the following figures, which relate to two current examples based on the past year."
"Firstly, there has been a 3.5% rise in workforce costs for entrepreneurs."
"Secondly, the cost to the public of electricity has risen by 5%."
"Neither of these figures gives any cause for celebration whatsoever."
"I believe that the British Presidency will make the leap from extremely cogent speeches to decisive measures, in so doing reversing the EU’s slide into stagnation, providing it with a new direction and enhancing its standing throughout the world."
"I should like to conclude with one final comment. Much has been said in this House about the need to bring the EU closer to its citizens, and so I would propose that we start doing so here and now, in this very Chamber."
"We should reject the proposal for a common statute, as it would guarantee Members from all 25 Member States the same high salary and pension benefits, even though there is absolutely no justification for this."
"I believe that this makes a mockery of our voters, and that it corresponds in no way to their wishes."
"Prime Minister, I would like to say firstly that I am delighted by what appeared to annoy the Socialist spokesman: that many Members from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats applauded your speech this morning."
"Many of us believe that we must not only begin a period of reflection in the European Union, but that we must begin what you have called a period of ‘renewal’ and what others of us may call a period of ‘rectification’, and we cannot leave the renewal or rectification in the hands of those who do not believe in the European Union."
"The difference is that the rectification must be profound and must be ordered, led by our conviction that the Union is needed and that we must not act hastily."
"Your problem is that you only have six months in the Presidency to carry out a profound and ordered rectification."
"In the end, when we act hastily, we always blame others for the Union’s problems, we blame the other Institutions, and that always leads us to confirm our own positions, and that is contrary to the European spirit."
"An ordered rectification is required."
"Each Institution must be able to diagnose what is keeping Europeans at a distance from the Union, and plan its work accordingly."
"The Council must do it, the Commission must do it and Parliament must do it."
"And each Institution must focus in particular on what is alienating Europeans today."
"It will not be the approach of one country that will lead the future recovery of confidence amongst Europeans; it will be a few European political projects, a few, but they will be important."
"The European Union cannot carry on talking about everything and saying nothing."
"We must be able to identify those political problems associated with Europeans’ real security, economic growth and cohesion problems."
"I will end by saying that step-by-step progress was the key approach of those exemplary Europeans who established the Union; we must not take a step backwards today, we must raise our sights, we must go beyond the routine, which is the worst fault of the European Union’s bureaucracies."
"Mr President, I am French, but I come from Brittany, as distinct from Britain, and I even come from Cornouaille, the counterpart to Duchess Camilla’s Cornwall, so perhaps I can be forgiven."
"The 100 Years’ War has already been mentioned."
"You have even been told to do the Tour de France, even though it is an American who will win that."
"Myself, I say to you, ‘Turn your Presidency into Austerlitz, not Waterloo.’"
"When Europe experiences a crisis, it always talks about its values."
"The great crisis is war."
"The great value is forgiveness."
"It was forgiveness that made the treaties of the 1950s."
"The other crisis, of the year 2000, was greater Europe."
"It was the aftermath of the Cold War."
"The great value was sharing."
"And if we want to talk to the people about the British rebate, about this cheque, fine."
"Let us talk about values first, and then define policies."
"This is right in the case of employment, particularly for those who have none, as long as we do not damage employment law."
"This sharing is true for those who have just joined the EU and those who are going to join."
"They need our support."
"It is true for the developing countries."
"Bravo on cancelling the debt of poor countries."
"It is true for the common agricultural policy, because, for my part, I am not very happy that about a quarter of French farmers are pocketing three-quarters of European money."
"If you can bring some order to all that, I take my hat off to you."
"There is not just the Duke of Bedford; we, too, have our little dukes, in this case."
"However, you will not be able to do all that with 1%; it is not enough."
"There is not enough in the bank account."
"I therefore suggest that you travel to Paris."
"Go to see Mr Chirac."
"Buy him dinner."
"You will see, you will be reconciled."
"Both of you, however, and four other partners, make more of an effort, otherwise you will find that it is the ‘every man for himself’ attitude that will regain strength."
"And that must not happen."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, a fortnight ago, Mr Blair, we had the opportunity to visit you in London and to find out something about how you saw the Presidency."
"You made it clear to us on that occasion that it is objective facts that interest you, that your concern is with the matter in hand rather than with how to exploit a situation."
"It may well be the case that the EU was once supported by the pillars of coal, steel and agriculture, but it is not that vision that drives people onward."
"That is not the Europe that we imagine today."
"You are right to put the emphasis on research, innovation and Europeans’ competitiveness."
"The time for the old narrative, the former vision, is past, and now we need a new one."
"Jacques Chirac and Chancellor Schröder have described themselves as ashamed of the way you behaved."
"My dear Mr Blair, I have to tell you that I am ashamed of the way my Chancellor behaved at this summit, not to mention ashamed of the behaviour of Jacques Chirac, for neither of them can see that we need a new vision, and what this in fact means is that we are obliged to go down your road."
"You chose the right moment, and so I would like to congratulate you and bid you carry on as you have begun."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, we had a dream, a dream of a free and generous Europe of solidarity."
"It was a dream for 50 years."
"We are disillusioned by the present disputes."
"We in the Parliament have succeeded in coming up with a budget in which we have reconciled national sensitivities with the general European interest."
"Our budget may not be ideal but it is a good compromise."
"The problem is not linked specifically to any particular government – French, British or German or anybody else."
"It is linked to the wrong philosophy pursued in the budgetary negotiations by the one per cent club."
"It is simply impossible to have more Europe for less money."
"The Union should resist the temptation to make enlargement a scapegoat for or victim of all the problems facing the European Union, be it of constitutional or budgetary nature."
"It is the other way around: the new Member States provide dynamics and stimulus for reforms, which are indispensable anyhow."
"These countries are idealistic about Europe to the point of self-sacrifice."
"The Union needs more resources if we are to realise our ambitions."
"If we are to build a political and economic Union we have to move beyond the accountant-type approach, pared down to thinking in net contributor terms."
"We, the countries of central and eastern Europe, know very well what the price of our European dream was."
"We lived through decades of hardship, violation of human rights, paying the prices of life, jail, gulag and deprivation."
"We are coming from the cold of Yalta, but the climate in Europe is becoming chilly and egoistic."
"How much is Europe worth?"
"Are there two ways of fixing the price for Europe?"
"On the one hand, is it one per cent of GNI, is it the rebate, or is it direct payments?"
"Or on the other hand, is it not the price we paid, the price of commitment to European values and a community of destiny?"
"But we place a higher value on Europe."
"Let us not put it at risk."
"The price we paid for it is not convertible into euro."
"One year after joining the EU, how do we explain to our citizens the gap between promise and performance?"
"How do we put more soul into the European project?"
"Mr President, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome your passion for the debate, Prime Minister."
"But we are not beginning the debate today; we are — to put it in sporting terms — at half-time, and we must win the second half."
"With regard to the Constitution, I must point out that more than half of the European citizens and 60% of the euro zone have approved it and I cannot understand why the positive vote by 75% of Spanish citizens is worth less than the negative vote by 66% of the Dutch."
"That makes no sense mathematically."
"You are a man of principles: you have approved a Bill of Rights in Great Britain and you have lifted the veto on the Social Charter."
"What are you going to do about the Constitution?"
"Are you going to act or are you going to wait-and-see?"
"This is a question I would like you to answer."
"With regard to the euro, you have had the grace not to speak about it."
"You will agree with me that, when we talk about the social model, we must also talk about the economic model."
"What are you going to do with regard to the euro?"
"With regard to the financial perspectives, and since we are in a Parliament, I would like to inform you that the Constitution grants this Parliament the power of codecision over agricultural spending, a power that we do not have at the moment."
"Furthermore, if this is a Parliament that is to be respected, we must apply the ‘no taxation without representation’ principle and we must not go even further than Soviet planning; to produce financial perspectives for a period of seven years would go further than the Gosplan, and that is unsustainable."
"The President of the Commission is right when he says that we must opt for a transitional solution until 2009."
"Furthermore, we must stand for elections on the basis of a defence of our options."
"That is the way to act democratically and I hope that you will help us actively to consolidate a more democratic and transparent Europe."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, regrettably it becomes clearer day by day that the present Constitutional Treaty will not be brought into force."
"The current text must be seen as a good first draft and the famous period of reflection should be exploited to prepare for a renegotiation through a fresh convention with a new mandate."
"The renegotiation should focus on Part III and should carry through the modernisation and reform of the EU’s common economic and social policies of which you so properly speak."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the French and the Dutch did not say ‘no’ to the Constitution, they did not give the thumbs down to the values of Europe, but they did, however, pass a negative judgment on today’s Europe, which is too far removed from the people and often a prisoner to a style of bureaucracy that is deaf to the voice of the citizens."
"That is the reason why the Europe of politics and values that you mentioned cannot put a stop to its progress, and cannot give up on developing its role as a major international player and as the representative of peace in the face of a number of setbacks."
"In order to achieve the objectives that we are working towards, a number of important changes are required, significant reforms designed to provide tangible answers to the people of Europe; in short, a Union is required that does not meddle with absolutely everything, issuing scores and scores of incomprehensible directives."
"On the contrary, what is needed is a Union that addresses the issues that, in the era of globalisation, cannot be resolved by nation states: from foreign policy to defence policy, from immigration crises to the fight against terrorism, to the trade challenges with China."
"Progress must also be made in the economic sector by means of the reforms leading on from the Lisbon process: the aim is to drastically reduce unemployment by means of support given to SMEs."
"We agree with your analysis, we welcomed your intervention in support of Europe as a major player, able to keep abreast of the times and upholding the commitments it has made."
"We have one year in which to approve the budget; we can achieve the objective that we failed to meet last week and, at the same time, we must not abandon the commitments that we have made with the countries that are keeping a close eye on the Union."
"Bulgaria and Romania can enter our shared home in 2007 and negotiations can be started up with Turkey, in order to have a Union that looks to the East, but also to the South, to the South also in terms of Africa, a continent that harbours great hopes of receiving important answers from Europe: we cannot turn back."
"Prime Minister, we agree with the approach of your Presidency, and with this in mind you can depend on the cooperation of the Italian delegation of the party, on active cooperation in forthcoming months, with the certainty that the British Presidency will ensure progress is achieved by the Europe of the citizens."
"Prime Minister, above all, I would like to express the determined support of our group for the action plan against human trafficking."
"Mr Juncker reminded us yesterday that we were able to eradicate slavery and that we should be able to eradicate poverty."
"We also emphasise that the elimination of sexual exploitation and violence against women should also be a top priority for the European Union."
"We absolutely must eradicate this scourge that is unworthy of our society, and this aspect must form an integral part of the fight against illegal immigration."
"The fight against organised crime and terrorism is also a priority."
"We therefore support as rapid an implementation as possible of the European evidence warrant and of joint investigation teams, but we are still cautious with regard to the exchange of sensitive data, including biometric data."
"The fragile balance between security and freedom must be maintained."
"Our fellow citizens want a protective, generous Europe that shows solidarity."
"If we keep this in mind at all times, we will be able to meet their expectations."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, the United Kingdom’s control order regime brought into force by the forthcoming presidency, flouts the presumption of innocence and cannot reasonably be described as sitting squarely with any accepted European notions of fairness and basic human dignity."
"These draconian measures leave EU citizens who have never been charged with a recognisable offence, confused and disenfranchised with no knowledge of why they are under suspicion, leaving the individual under a constant fear of imprisonment for breaches of the broadest and vaguest of laws; all decided by a politician, flying in the face of the separation of powers and the rule of law."
"The holders of the presidency should be setting the human rights standard for the world, yet only this month the Council of Europe’s own Commissioner for Human Rights confirmed that here we have a government which is prepared to suspend the human rights of its own citizens under Article 5 of the European Charter."
"The international community is facing a defining moment in its response to terrorism and we, as Europeans, will ultimately be judged by the way we treat our citizens."
"Will this presidency not recognise that its actions have led to victimisation and effective isolation of a large section of its own population?"
"Mr President, Prime Minister Blair, Europe today is better than ever."
"I say that because a large proportion of the current debates concern the view of enlargement."
"I am among those who believe that enlargement to include the 10 new Member States has made Europe safer and more stable and has created better preconditions for peace and prosperity than ever before."
"For me, this is an argument for positively accepting continued enlargement and not an argument for trying now to close Europe’s borders."
"One of the most important tasks for the new leadership in Europe will be that of firmly establishing and developing the view of how Europe can bring about increased security and greater prosperity by embracing those countries for which enlargement is now in the offing."
"Prime Minister Blair, I believe that the problems we now face in the EU have to do with the fact that Europe is better than ever."
"That also means that the European Union is a greater challenge than ever."
"It is not a question, as is sometimes said, of a conflict between the old and the new Europe or between a free-trade Europe and political union."
"The European Union is a political union and must fulfil its task on that basis."
"It is a question, instead, of moving on from the old European Union of 6, 9, 12 or 15 Members to today’s EU of 25 Member States."
"This requires respect for variation and diversity and also an ability to take advantage of the dynamism that exists throughout Europe."
"It requires openness towards the new Member States."
"It requires an ability to find the common denominators, to pin our hopes on the knowledge-based, instead of subsidy-based, society and to put our faith in the new enterprises instead of making agricultural aid an obstacle to the research and development we need."
"I hope, on behalf of the Swedish Moderates, that you will lay the basis for the new leadership needed by the new Europe and the new European Union."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Prime Minister Blair for an inspiring speech."
"I share his view that the EU needs to be changed."
"I share his view that the EU needs to become more active in the world."
"I share his view that the EU is not only a free trade area but also a political union."
"I also share his views on the Budget."
"The British rebate is out of date, but so too is agricultural policy and those aspects of agricultural policy in which we currently put our faith."
"That too needs to be changed."
"We need to invest, for example, in research and development and in developing people’s skills. What we talk about during and after important meetings must be put into practice."
"I also share Prime Minister Blair’s view of the social Europe."
"It is true that he was involved in introducing the Social Chapter, as well as the employment strategy and the active labour market policy in EU cooperation."
"All that was good, but we must go further and find a balance."
"That is why we must obtain a draft Services Directive that balances the trade in services, for that is something we need."
"At the same time, we need sound conditions in the labour market, consumer rights and high environmental standards."
"We also need a working time directive that takes account of precisely what you just said about being able to combine family life and working life so that the one party does not work him- or herself to death and so that we do not compete on the basis of long working hours."
"We need a recruitment directive, not in order to pull the rug out from under the recruitment companies but in order to create a framework."
"If you succeed in opening the door to trade and in opening up the borders and, at the same time, in developing the social Europe, we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament shall support you."
"Mr President, I welcome the Prime Minister’s historic speech."
"It bodes well for a highly successful UK presidency."
"During his time in office, will he build on the already agreed enlargement programme?"
"Will he give special emphasis to ensuring a timely entry into negotiations for Turkey, since so much hangs in the balance in early October on reforms in Turkey?"
"Will he support Romania in the final stretch of what has been a major endurance test, leading to early entry in January 2007, and for Bulgaria too?"
"Will he build on the success of yesterday’s unique conference on Iraq, which demonstrated the profound endurance of British policies?"
"Will he build on that success with the elected Iraqi Government and parliamentary assembly to continue to foster the growth of democracy in the Arabian Peninsula, the Persian Gulf and the Euro-Mediterranean region?"
"Mr President, Mr Blair, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the same House that, yesterday, gave the outgoing President-in-Office of the Council, Jean-Claude Juncker, a standing ovation, today gave you, Mr Blair, a convincing round of applause to welcome you into office."
"That amounts to a huge pledge of confidence in you on the part of this House, whose Members are the representatives of the citizens of this European Union – the true representatives, because they are the only ones to be directly elected."
"At a time when this European Union is going through an identity crisis – and you yourself, Mr Blair, spoke of a crisis of leadership – it is vital that we remember that this Europe of ours, having been in existence for 50 successful years, needs a ‘bottom-up’ rather than ‘top-down’ approach."
"What that means is that we have to carry the public with us rather than alienate them, and whose vocation is it to do that if not their directly elected representatives?"
"This is not just about Europe’s need for better regulations; most of all, it needs fewer of them, and that I say not only to the Commission, but also to the Members on the left of the political spectrum here in this House."
"In many respects, Mr Blair, your speech was persuasive; you were particularly convincing when you spoke of the principle that some changes are necessary if what is good is to be retained."
"That principle is one that your future successor as President-in-Office of the Council, Austria’s Federal Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel, has chosen as his watchword."
"I also welcome your desire to resolve the dispute about the European Union’s objectives that has ensued from the constitutional crisis."
"I have to say, though, that your presidency will be judged not only by what it intends to do but also, and especially, by what it actually does."
"I therefore hope that you will not mind if I ask what practical steps you intend to take in order to get the Financial Perspective completed under your presidency; secondly, what you propose to do to keep the constitutional process alive; and, thirdly, what answers you would give to those members of the public who fear that the European Union is over-extending itself."
"Do you not think there is something paradoxical about mentioning Turkey and Croatia in the same breath?"
"Many members of the public have misgivings about a large country like Turkey, but not about a small one like Croatia."
"Mr President, Prime Minister Blair's presentation has been more a series of interesting reflections than of precise commitments for his six-month Presidency."
"In terms of assessing his intentions in the field that concerns me as the Socialist Group’s spokesman for development and humanitarian action, I must comment on the approach announced by his government in this area."
"I will express my satisfaction at the fact that the British Presidency’s main priorities include increasing the European Union's action and resources in the field of solidarity with the developing world: achieving the Millennium Objectives — they will be classified as a priority goal — with eradicating poverty as the main concern and Africa as the main focus, because Africa is one of the main elements of the problem."
"I would like to make two further comments."
"Firstly, I would like to acknowledge that the Luxembourg Presidency set very high standards with the decisions of the Development Council in May; let us hope that the British Presidency understands that these decisions provide a good launching pad for promoting its action over these six months."
"I would like secondly to highlight and welcome the fact that the British Presidency’s priorities in the field that I have been referring to coincide with those of the Socialist Group."
"This is natural, not just because our values coincide, but because for months we have been cooperating intensely with our colleagues in the British Cabinet, Hillary Ben and Garret Thomas."
"Let us hope that the British Presidency intends to maintain a close relationship with this Parliament over these six months in this field; I am sure that, in that way, we will make more and better progress."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, excellent goals, very good speech, you have my support."
"I have got one minute so I want to make one point."
"In the French referendum President Chirac got 45.3 per cent of votes in favour."
"In the UK General Election last month, you got 35.3 per cent, which is 10 per cent less than Jacques Chirac got."
"You are only there because of a distortion in the UK electoral system; you had a manifesto commitment in 1997, but it seems to have been forgotten."
"The point is that neither of you have majority support in your own countries."
"After eight years of leadership of my country, the hostility and ignorance about Europe in the UK is shocking and terrible and needs to be corrected."
"Please will you start to make positive speeches and explain … I am sorry to see you are not even listening!"
"Will you start to make speeches explaining the European Union in the country you and I know best?"
"Mr President, I welcome Mr Blair and thank him for staying for the entire debate here this morning."
"Last weekend’s political sparring and lack of conclusion to the summit was not worthy either of you, Mr Blair, nor of Mr Chirac."
"Where was the Tony Blair of the Good Friday Agreement, a man of understanding and goodwill, who could bring both sides of an intractable conflict to the table; a man who showed singular courage on the Iraq question, regardless of our views of the right or wrong."
"It may well be good for you and for your image at home, Mr Blair, to stand up to the French and to play to the residual, historic emotion that finds resonance in British chemistry."
"But remember the 100 Years War in the Middle Ages: the British came out of it with much less than they went in."
"Fontainebleau was Margaret Thatcher’s Agincourt, when she walked away with the British rebate, and now, 20 years on, that rebate is worth a farthing in the pound of British GDP."
"Yet, Mr Blair, you are prepared to sacrifice Europe’s budget agreement and the European project to continue being the populist servant of Mr Murdoch and his newspapers."
"If Kohl or Mitterrand had been at the table last weekend, we would have had a conclusion."
"We are politically rudderless in Europe and the real crisis in Europe is the lack of political leadership."
"Mr Blair, you were right to say that we must modernise Europe’s social model on the basis of a strong economy and not at the expense of it."
"It is true that we urgently need to peel back regulation and that China is investing threefold in research and innovation."
"However, splitting hairs over decimal points on the budget last weekend has put Europe’s ambitious Seventh Framework Programme for doubling funding on research on ice."
"So much for the Lisbon mission."
"What about the common agricultural policy, Mr Blair?"
"What exactly is your intention in relation to that?"
"Do you understand the income crisis that exists among the vast majority of our farmers across the Europe of 25?"
"Have you forgotten the unanimous agreement on radical reform of the CAP that you personally endorsed and your government signed up to only 18 months ago?"
"Mr President, the EU is in crisis in terms of direction and legitimacy, and Mr Blair is now under challenge to fill the leadership vacuum, with Mr Chirac and Mr Schröder weakened domestically and probably on their way out."
"The UK is right to question the entire EU budget architecture based on a distorted, wasteful common agricultural policy, which harms developing world farmers."
"Our rebate will never be given up until the CAP is radically reformed, with the funds freed up, used to address modern priorities like research and development, combating climate change and external action funding to stabilise the Western Balkans, help Eastern European countries like Ukraine and fledgling democracies in the Middle East such as Iraq."
"This is happening at a time when the US is anxious to mend fences with the EU and needs our help."
"As a priority, I hope that Britain will put the roadmap for Arab-Israeli peace back on the agenda and combat nuclear proliferation in Iran and North Korea."
"I support EU enlargement with a wider, looser flexible Europe."
"I welcome the proverbial Polish plumber and recognise that the new countries are driving the economic reformist agenda."
"We are now committed to Romania and Bulgaria."
"As much as I support Ukraine’s EU aspirations, we have not carried Europe’s public with us on enlargement."
"I hope the UK will emphasise human rights violations in brutal regimes such as Burma and Zimbabwe."
"As a Commonwealth country, we have a very special influence on these countries in Africa."
"At the summit meeting with Russia, it will need reminding of its obligations in Chechnya and must be made to understand that it must respect the sovereignty of its former satellites such as Ukraine."
"In the case of Moldova and Georgia, it should be encouraged to withdraw its troops."
"Mr Blair, you might also might want to use some of your goodwill with Turkey to resolve the Armenia embargo and border issue."
"Lastly, we must maintain the arms embargo on China, with its lamentable human rights record and threats to Taiwan."
"Certainly, building a multi-polar world with China and the EU as a counterweight to the US should play no part in this issue."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr Blair, the European Union’s Heads of State or Government have prescribed a period of reflection, and you are participating in it by deferring the United Kingdom’s referendum."
"It is because I know from my own experience that the enlargement issue played a particular part in the debate around the referenda in France and the Netherlands that I believe that the present period of reflection must include consideration of it."
"What we have here is a new situation."
"After adopting the Treaty of Nice, we discovered that it would not function adequately if we had 25 or 28 Member States, and so we summoned a convention and compiled a draft Constitution, which you, Mr Blair, support."
"We know too, though, that there is no very great likelihood of this draft Constitution seeing the light of day in its present form."
"That is what makes this situation new."
"There is also a fourth criterion for accession, one that is of very considerable significance, and it is the one adopted in Copenhagen, which states that consideration must also be given to the Union’s own capacity to cope with further accessions."
"In the absence not only of a constitution but also of any financial settlement, we have to ask ourselves the very serious question as to whether it really is well-advised to start accession negotiations with Turkey on 4 October."
"We have to ask ourselves – that is, the European Union itself – whether we really are in a fit state to handle another enlargement."
"Along with many of my friends, I take the view that this question has to be answered, and firmly, in the negative."
"– Prime Minister, your speech was inspired and I trust that your European actions will be equally inspired."
"However, I must point out that the Union has entered a period of crisis, a credibility crisis, and I shall explain why:"
"- In March 2000, the European Council agreed on the Lisbon Strategy."
"During the review last March, it was decided to give greater emphasis to research and innovation."
"- In Brussels in October 2002, the European Council agreed on the 2007-2013 financing framework for agriculture."
"- In Athens in April 2003, all the Heads of State agreed to and endorsed enlargement."
"That brings us to today."
"The Lisbon Strategy: the Council proposal for financing the strategy cancels it in practical terms."
"Agriculture: Prime Minister, you yourself have questioned the compromise on agriculture."
"Enlargement: you have welcomed the 10 new Member States, but with less money."
"By contrast, the European Parliament, in adopting the Böge report, has shown that it is consistent in what it professes."
"Prime Minister, I share your views about the need for reforms which will make us more competitive on the international stage, but we need to combine the validity of this position with respect for what has been agreed."
"I ask you:"
"- Firstly, taking account of the fact that the compromise on agricultural spending was achieved after reciprocal and painful concessions, taking account of the fact that the basic principle of international law is the ' principle and, finally, taking account of the fact that a new compromise will be impossible to achieve today with 25 Member States and the current institutional framework, do you consider it advisable that we exhaust this issue?"
"- Secondly, with what budget do you intend ..."
"Mr President, I was very interested in the reference made by the Prime Minister in his speech this morning to the Europe of values."
"And, as well as this legitimate vision, there is another complementary vision of Europe (I would be grateful if Mr Blair could put on his headphones), there is another legitimate Europe which is complementary to the former, which is the Europe of the tangible, the Europe of hard cash, and the Europe of the net contribution and the net beneficiary, and the Europe of the British rebate."
"I am pleased that you believe that we in Europe no longer see ourselves simply as consumers in a big market, but as citizens of the Union."
"There is a qualitative social leap from the notion of a consumer to that of a citizen and from the notion of a common market to that of a project of political union."
"It is clear that leadership is needed in order to propel the project in the right direction, in order to bring Europe closer to the citizens, in order to recover the path of sustainable growth and job creation and in order to give Europe a role on the international stage in accordance with its economic, commercial, financial and industrial weight."
"Europe, Prime Minister, is not the problem, it is the solution."
"And we need more Europe rather than less Europe."
"And the important thing is to move on from words to actions."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is important to move on from words to actions and leave behind purely rhetorical statements, because you have signed a document reducing the European Union’s ambitions and budgetary resources."
"Or do you believe, Mr President-in-Office, that we are going to be able to deal with the priority of doubling funds for Africa if we have less resources?"
"Do you believe that we are going to be able to deal with the priority of introducing the necessary economic reforms if we have less resources?"
"Do you believe that we are going to be able to deal with the challenges facing the European Union with less resources?"
"Mr President, I wish the British Presidency the best of luck in its task of bringing together wills and creating consensus so that the European Union can move forward, but it will only be able to do so on the basis of two perspectives or two premises: firstly, by providing the money required to realise our ideals; and secondly, Mr President, by everybody seeking advantage on the basis of a common advantage."
"Do not lose heart, Prime Minister, I am the last, though I hope I will not be the least."
"Following a Luxembourg Presidency led with honour by Mr Juncker, you are taking on the Presidency at a very delicate moment for Europe."
"At a time when the draft European Constitution, based on a careful rebalancing between politics and economics, appears to be stillborn, I hope, despite everything, that we will not bury its content too hastily."
"The financing of the EU cannot be decided by a confrontation."
"Enlargement must be financed fairly and reasonably."
"Is it fair for the United Kingdom to be the only one of the 15 to have reduced its net financial contribution following enlargement, thus excusing itself from all efforts to reunify Europe?"
"You have declared that the British rebate is not non-negotiable, and we take note of that."
"Do not forget, though, that the CAP has already been reformed three times."
"You will allow me to express my surprise at the UK’s reaction with regard to European farmers."
"The United Kingdom is well placed to know the extent to which European solidarity expressed itself during the two major health crises that we underwent with BSE and foot-and-mouth disease, and to evaluate the costs borne by the European Union to deal with those two disasters."
"The future of Europe depends on our ability to guarantee to 450 million Europeans that they will all be able to feed themselves at a reasonable price and completely safely."
"We will not forget that you have declared that you do not want to reduce the EU to a huge, dehumanised market."
"Your predecessor stated that he wanted an integrated, political Europe of solidarity."
"May the UK Presidency share the same vision of our common future."
"Listen, I am not going to give Prime Minister Blair the floor until you sit down and be quiet."
"The complete lack of respect you have shown to your fellow Members who were speaking before ..."
"Mr Martin Schulz, I am perfectly aware who is changing the order."
"I would ask you all to sit down and be quiet."
"We are not going to continue the sitting until you sit down and be quiet."
"And if you do not do so, I am going to call on the ushers to ask you to leave the Chamber."
"Would the honourable Members who are in that aisle please sit down?"
"Please be kind enough to listen to what the Presidency says and not to disturb the sitting any further?"
"I would ask you to hurry up."
"Alright."
"Are you ready to listen to Mr Blair?"
"Then be quiet please."
". Mr President, I thank you for that excellent discipline you have imposed."
"It would be interesting to see how you would get on in the British House of Commons at Question Time!"
"I thank everyone who has contributed to this debate."
"One thing, for sure, is that I have not been short of advice, for which I thank you."
"As you may know, some of our colleagues in the gallery today are from Kuwait, and have just passed a law, as was indicated earlier, giving women the vote for the first time."
"They are an excellent example of how progress and change can happen."
"It is good to see you here, Sir."
"In addition, many speakers have asked me to try to achieve a consensus across Europe."
"It must be said, given the broad range of views, that is going to be quite some challenge."
"Perhaps the most interesting suggestion was that we made Welsh one of the official languages of the European Union."
"It could indeed be the way to achieve a consensus, but we shall see."
"One thing is certain: our debate today has provoked enormous interest not just here in this Parliament but also outside."
"I will try to respond to some of the specific comments made by the leaders and then make a short summary."
"In respect of President Barroso, I thank him very much for his kind words."
"I agree with the agenda he has set out."
"There is much in common we can work on. The only point I would make on the review clause in respect of the next financial perspective is that it has to be very clear, it must not be ambiguous."
"Let us work on that together."
"In respect of Mr Poettering, I thank him for his kind sentiments and we will do our very best to reach agreement on some of the difficult issues, in particular the financial perspective."
"He reminded me of John Major’s negotiations in 1992, so I was rather grateful for Mr Schulz reminding us that we defeated both him in the 1997 election and three subsequent leaders, but that is perhaps a point to make in a different forum."
"On the Constitution, I had not appreciated that you said this yourself, Mr President, but if you said, as was reported in the course of the debate, that it was not the text but the context, then I entirely agree with that."
"There will be a time when we have to return to the discussion of sensible rules to govern our working as a European Union of 25 – and even larger numbers in the future – rather than 15."
"The truth is that we need a new framework of rules for Europe and, therefore, the impulse that gave rise to the Constitution was entirely correct."
"It is, however, necessary to get the political direction firm in order to get the Constitution supported in the way that it should be."
"Mr Watson challenged me over Council transparency and, certainly in relation to legislating, there is a strong case for that."
"Let us consider that under our presidency."
"It is good to see Mr Cohn-Bendit after all these years."
"A long time ago I used to listen to your speeches, and now you listen to mine."
"Only history will tell whether this is progress or not!"
"I apologise for not spending more of my speech on the issues of the environment and climate change."
"I hope that at the G8 summit we will have at least a chance for these issues to dominate the discussion."
"They will be a major aspect of our European Union presidency."
"In respect of what Mr Mote said about the rebate, I repeat that we must look at all of this in the round."
"These issues all need to be resolved together."
"All I would point out is that without the rebate we would have been contributing about 15 times as much as other similar sized countries over the past 10 years, and even with it, we are contributing more."
"Without it in existence at all, over the next financial perspective we would be the largest net contributor."
"I understand your concerns and I repeat that Britain will pay its fair share of enlargement."
"We support enlargement and will contribute towards it."
"However, the issue has to be resolved in a way that is satisfactory for everybody and in the context, particularly, of the point about the review that we discussed earlier."
"I apologise for not dealing with every single individual point."
"In some contributions there has been a sense that this is just a dispute between leaders based on personality or disagreements between countries."
"I want to make it clear that, in general terms, I think I have shown over the past eight years that I have always tried to reach consensus at a European level and it is important that we do so."
"Obviously I have not reached consensus on that statement!"
"The difficulty we have at the moment which I just want to describe to you is: why is it that I feel so passionately about the reform agenda?"
"It is because of a sense of urgency."
"We do not quite realise in Europe the competitive economic challenge we face today."
"It is serious and it is urgent!"
"It is strange how things happen but just now everybody has mentioned China, India, etc. in their speeches."
"Now, however, people understand the seriousness of this situation."
"It is not simply China and India: take countries like Vietnam or Thailand today."
"The changes they are making in their economies are amazing and dramatic."
"The trouble is that in today’s world you have to adapt constantly to that process of change."
"My worry is that if we do not, two things will happen."
"First, the very social model and the idea of social solidarity that we, and I, believe in is put at risk."
"Second, if we cannot handle the challenge of change and if we are unable to adapt to do so, then as a result support comes about for the policies that Mr Farage outlined for the UK Independence Party."
"I have to tell him that I completely disagree with those policies."
"I do not want Britain to be in the position of leading a charge against the European Union."
"That is not my determination at all."
"The difference between you and me is very simple: you see the problems of the European Union as an opportunity to wreck the European Union, I see them as the necessity for reinvigorating the European Union."
"There is a big difference between the two."
"I am well aware, as I have said in my own Parliament and country, this debate for change and reform cannot be led in any other way than from a pro-European perspective."
"That is something I understand."
"It is not enough for each person to simply claim Europe for themselves and to say that if you challenge what I am saying, it means somehow you are against Europe."
"The question, as was rightly put by several speakers in the debate, is not whether Europe should change or whether we believe in Europe, but how Europe should change and what type of Europe we believe in today."
"That is the issue for us and it is the issue we have to address with a genuine seriousness of purpose."
"I want to make one other final point."
"I have said why I support the Constitution."
"But I will be frank with you."
"The one thing that worried me during the course of all the debates about the Constitution was this: there is a tendency that I have noticed over my eight years as Prime Minister for Europe sometimes to go back over institutional questions when the questions are really about policy direction."
"We can debate some of these institutional questions for a very long time."
"Sometimes you also find it in leaders – and I do not absolve myself of responsibility on this – who, when there is a problem, want to blame a European institution rather than refashion a European policy."
"It is true that we all have a tendency to do that."
"My point is that when we decide the direction of Europe – and that is what the coming months have to be about; when we have the debate about how Europe copes with these great challenges, we should always keep our minds focused on the daily concerns of the people we represent."
"You are the directly elected part of the European institutions."
"You know how important it is when you go out into your communities to respond to what they talk about."
"They talk about jobs, security, crime and immigration."
"They worry about the change in their daily lives."
"We must have the clear, tough, proper policies to deal with these challenges."
"If we do, they will respond to us and tell us that they agree it is sensible to have a new European Constitution, because they will then understand the political context in which that constitutional debate is happening."
"This is a big moment of decision."
"In conclusion, I would only say that today’s debate in the European Parliament has been excellent."
"I am honoured to have sat through it, I know there have been many different views and some critical things have been said about me and my presidency."
"That is part of a healthy democratic debate."
"I would just suggest to you that if we could replicate this debate in our individual countries and go out and engage with our people and talk to them about what we believe in, why we think Europe is necessary for today’s world, why we want to make the changes necessary to bring it into line with people’s priorities, then in the very act of debate we will help Europe; in the very reaching out to people we will show our relevance; in the very satisfaction of being in a position to answer their concerns, we will reinvigorate the European project."
"I have found today’s debate immensely impressive."
"It has been a genuine privilege to sit through it, and I thank you for listening to me."
". Mr President, Members of this House, Prime Minister Blair, I agree with you that it was a very interesting and useful debate."
"We all understand that this situation is a very special one."
"It should not be seen as business as usual."
"I understand that there is a real appetite for a frank debate."
"There were, of course, different views, but this debate has shown that there is a will for the search for consensus."
"In that search for consensus, it is important to avoid simplifications: the idea to put those who are in favour of a free market against those who are for social commitment; the idea to put political integration against economic integration."
"The truth is that we need economic integration and political integration."
"We need a consensus, but not one that ignores the need for the hard choices that Europe must make."
"There is now a risk in Europe: the risk of populism."
"Sometimes populism on the left against globalisation and foreign competition; sometimes populism on the right, just against foreigners and against the very idea of Europe."
"That is why it is important that all those who have some responsibility in Europe – be it at national or European level – fight that populism and show, collectively, their commitment to the values that make Europe a great project."
"That is why it is important that responsible politicians fight that populism and do not resort to tabloid politics."
"That is why it is important that we should not be blocked now by the institutional problems we have."
"We must go ahead with our programme."
"The European Union must avoid paralysis."
"That is why it is very urgent to have a solution for the financial perspectives."
"That is why we have to respond to the expectations, namely of the new Member States that are looking to us for solidarity."
"That was their expectation and we should be committed to meeting their expectations."
"That is why Europe needs ambition for reform and solidarity."
"The way forward for Europe is not to avoid the very idea of solidarity."
"Without solidarity and cohesion there is no such thing as a Union."
"A Union requires the mechanisms of solidarity."
"I am looking forward to working with you, Prime Minister Blair, in what I hope will be a successful presidency."
"You can count on us."
"We are going to our work every day."
"We have been doing everything to avoid the idea that Europe is paralysed."
"After that very difficult European Council, Prime Minister Juncker and I attended the successful summits in Canada and the United States."
"Yesterday we had a very successful conference here on Iraq."
"Yesterday the Commission took very important and courageous decisions: the Green Paper on energy efficiency; a new sugar market reform – which shows, by the way, that the common agricultural policy can also be reformed."
"This evening I leave for Africa because, like you, I attach great importance to the African agenda and our solidarity with that continent."
"I hope that I will also help your G8 presidency for the goals for Africa and our solidarity."
"To conclude and to summarise, we have to reform and change."
"However, when we speak about reform and change we are speaking about reforming our economy and making it more competitive."
"We are not speaking about changing or reforming the old values of the European Union or of Europe, the values that were those of our founding fathers for a European Union that believes in solidarity with ambition for all our citizens."
"Thank you very much to all of you for participating in this important debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is voting time."
"Mr President, I just want to point out an error in the Swedish version."
"What, in other language versions, is Article 23.2 is Article 12.7 in the Swedish version."
"Mr President, very briefly, it is clear from the voting list, but I have learnt from experience that it is very good to point it out at length."
"This is not an amendment to amend the Statute but an amendment to the legislative resolution."
"Irrespective of the rumours that have been going around the House, it refers to the expense regime that was agreed to in the Members’ Statute, namely the travel expenses at real costs, not all the expenses."
". Mr President, I should just like to say that this vote is the outcome of a long debate that took place in Parliament, and that you have the honour of having brought this itinerary to an end."
"I therefore thank you on behalf of the whole of Parliament and I also thank the Commission and the Presidency-in-Office of the Council."
"We did not reach agreement on one item alone, but I believe that an overall balance has been reached."
"I also thank my colleagues in the committee and Mr Lehne in particular, who provided a tremendous contribution in terms of achieving this important outcome, which places Parliament – as we said this morning – at the centre of attention of a united Europe."
"Mr Gargani, thank you very much for your constructive words."
"Thank you very much to everybody and in particular to the Luxembourg Presidency."
"Mr President, as we seem to be the only group to be holding fast to the compromise that we hammered out together, I have consulted at least some of the other groups and am now able to ask, on their behalf too, for the vote to be deferred in accordance with Rule 170 of our Rules of Procedure, irrespective of whether we will be voting at a later date."
"Under Rule 170, therefore, I move that the vote be deferred."
"Mr President, I move that we should, if at all possible, vote on the individual amendments , but not, of course, on the final resolution."
"Mr President, whilst I can very well understand the general desire to get the vote over with, that cannot be done so quickly, as there are a whole range of different items to be voted on."
"I have a procedural suggestion to make, that being that we vote on Amendments 1 to 21 in a single block, while we really do have to vote on the other items on a one-by-one basis."
"That concludes the vote."
"Mr President, I have voted against this Statute, and have done so for five reasons."
"The first is that I think this is not the right time for it; while Europe as a whole is grappling with its future, we are concerning ourselves with the future of our financial arrangements."
"The second is that I am opposed to tax privileges."
"The third is that I see our having our pensions paid by the taxpayer as sending the wrong message."
"The fourth is that I do not think we should be getting a percentage of what judges are paid; rather, things should be the other way around, with judges being paid a percentage of what the freely-elected representatives of a sovereign people earn."
"After all, it would also sound much better if judges were to be paid 250% of an MEP’s salary."
"Finally, all this involves us looking into the future; we are taking decisions on behalf of future Members, and I do not find that exactly proper either."
"As I do not regard this as a particularly favourable result, I have voted ‘no’."
"I am sure that many of my colleagues who have voted ‘yes’ today have done so not out of conviction, but in response to pressure from the media, and that, too, is a pity."
"Mr President, I, too, have voted against the Members’ Statute, which I regard as sending the wrong message – that is what we are doing if we adopt it in such haste while the current European crisis is raging around us."
"I also feel that it rather amounts to a load of eyewash, and to putting wine in old bottles, as I cannot see much of a difference in comparison to the draft with which the Rothley report presented us."
"There has been a lot of talk in the past few days about the setting up of citizens’ forums to address the crisis situation in Europe."
"Why are we not setting up citizens’ forums to discuss the Members’ Statute?"
"Why is there no consultation on the Internet?"
"If we can have a pause for reflection during the process of ratifying the Constitution, why can we not have a pause for reflection on the Members’ Statute?"
"I still do not think it right that it should be combined with travel expenses."
"These things can be dealt with separately; for that we do not need this Members’ Statute to be adopted so over-hastily and in such a headlong rush."
"I would, though, ask for a vote to be corrected."
"I am of course in favour of not reducing the retirement age."
"That, too, is something there is no way we can get across to the public at a time of austerity measures and cutbacks in the social budget."
"I think we have done Europe a disservice today, and I do not believe that we will, in so doing, be able to rid people of their suspicions of the European institutions and of their weariness with our politics."
"Mr President, I think that we sent an entirely wrong message today by voting on the Gargani report on the Members’ Statute, not least because the impression is once again being created that this House’s real principal concern is with its Members’ benefits."
"Moreover, I think that what is described as the elimination of a number of abuses is a mere pretext, at best a palliative."
"In reality, Members are being endowed with new privileges, which nothing and nobody can justify, the planned pension fund scheme being one example that springs to mind."
"Another reason why this message is the wrong one is that nobody in the whole of Europe is waiting for a common statute for all MEPs except a few MEPs themselves."
"We represent our peoples and our Member States here."
"Why should we be so insistent on having a statute that is different from that of our counterparts in the national parliaments, unless, of course, Europe is to be thought of as a superstate, which is not what I want it to be?"
"If this report is a new stunt to bring even more people to resist what we are gradually referring to as the Eurocracy, then it has achieved its object."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the EU is mired in a profound crisis, when agreement on the European Constitution eludes us, when we are unable to decide on the EU’s future financial basis, at a time marked by great economic problems and high levels of unemployment in the EU, yet again, we in this House are focussing our attention on ourselves."
"European politics could hardly appear more distant from the real world!"
"I voted against the Members’ Statute on the ground that I am opposed to us MEPs enjoying tax privileges."
"I want to be taxed in the same way as those who vote for me and my fellow German citizens, and, as a German MEP, I want to be paid in the same way as my counterparts in the German national parliament, the Bundestag."
"Mr President, having taken note of the result of negotiations between Parliament and the Council, we in the Austrian People’s Party delegation voted to adopt this Members’ Statute."
"We find it regrettable that the Council should have dictated to Parliament conditions in respect of the Rothley report, one of which was that the cut in salary should be compensated for by the pension scheme being made non-contributory."
"Every amendment that we have tabled here today would, from the Council’s point of view, have caused the Members’ Statute to fall."
"It was high time, following 10 years of negotiations, that this House should endow itself with a Members’ Statute, and for there to be equal pay for equal work."
"To this compromise we have agreed, even though there is without doubt room for improvement in many areas."
"The June Movement is a strong opponent on principle of a common Members’ Statute, which would turn Members of the European Parliament into the EU’s representatives in the Member States instead of Denmark’s representatives in the EU."
"The June Movement’s representative has proposed approximately 50 times that travel should be as per account rendered, and the present compromise now offers the chance to have this put into practice."
"We in the June Movement are therefore voting in favour of this compromise, at the same time as holding to our opposition on principle to the Statute, which was unfortunately approved by the Treaty of Nice."
". I am in favour of enacting a single statute for all Members of the European Parliament."
"A functioning European Parliament depends to a large degree on a good uniform statute being in place."
"Any such statute must, however, have at its heart modern, EU-wide rules on MEPs’ immunity from prosecution."
"In Parliament’s present motion for a resolution, the Member States are requested to revise the provisions laid down in a protocol in 1965."
"No such rule is to be found in the draft Statute itself."
"Regarding this as a fundamental defect, I have – as I did in December 2003 – voted against the draft Statute."
"In the event of the Statute entering into force in 2009, I very much hope that this defect will have been, by that date, remedied by means of a rule on the immunity of MEPs that shall be binding, equal and uniform across the EU."
"It was not only in this respect that Mr Rothley’s original draft was markedly superior to the present text, for it embodied a parliamentary law that was, in a whole range of other areas, more modern and more comprehensible to the public than national rules, including those obtaining in Germany, not least in such matters as the requirement that Members make a contribution to their own pensions, for which no provision is made in the regulations of many national legislatures."
"Today, Parliament has voted on the long-debated Members’ Statute."
"There are some doubtful features, but it overwhelmingly constitutes an improvement on current rules applicable to, for example, travel expenses, taxes and pensions."
"Actual travel costs will be reimbursed, rather than a standard payment being made."
"The Statute also means that all MEPs will receive the same level of salary from 2009."
"That is especially important if our fellow MEPs from the new Member States are to receive reasonable salaries and if the earnings gap is to be reduced between those who earn least and those who earn most."
"Quite a few constructive amendments were tabled before the vote, demanding, for example, a common statute for MEPs’ assistants and the opportunity for those MEPs who wish to do so to receive back only their actual expenses from as early as 2007."
"We have for a long time supported developments towards a statute for assistants and the reimbursement of actual expenses."
"That is something we shall continue to do in the future too."
"In order to ensure that the Statute arrived at by compromise with the Council goes through, we have, however, chosen to vote today against all the amendments tabled in plenary and have voted in favour of the committee’s report."
"Any change to the compromise would jeopardise the unity in the Council and, thus, the possibility of being able to agree at all on the Members’ Statute."
"Following the commitment made on 3 June 2005 by representatives of the Member States and the Council regarding the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, plenary amended its decision of 4 June 2003, and called for the creation of a monthly parliamentary salary, set at a flat rate for all Members regardless of the country they represent. The salary will, in current terms, come to around EUR 7 000 per month, which is around twice the amount earned by members of the Portuguese Parliament."
"This would widen the gap between the Members of the European Parliament and politicians in the Member States, when in fact their work and their day-to-day functions are similar, and this is something to which we are opposed."
"This decision has undergone one or two amendments, which we welcome, not least the call for greater transparency in reimbursement of travel expenses, indicating that the payment will be based on actual expenses."
"Members of the European Parliament are elected nationally and are – and must continue to be – accountable to their national electorates."
"We are opposed to the federalist concept of the mandate of Members of Parliament, as it overlooks the differing social realities in EU Member States – in terms of workers’ salaries, for example – and consequently widens the gap between the politicians and the people that they represent."
". We wish once again to indicate the position of principle we adopt on this issue."
"We believe that Members of the European Parliament should receive their salaries from their respective national parliaments."
"The principle of subsidiarity should serve as guidance."
"It is up to each Member State to decide what salary is to be paid to its parliamentarians."
"The national salaries paid to Members of the European Parliament are adjusted according to the actual situation regarding salaries and expenses that applies in each Member State."
"MEPs should be remunerated by their own countries, where they should also pay tax."
"It is important for Members of the European Parliament not to be regarded as a privileged elite by the voters in their own countries. Instead, salaries should be more or less the same as those paid in those countries to people in corresponding positions."
"The present system of travel expenses, which takes no account of actual costs and is based on standard payments, is, in our view, quite unfair."
"MEPs should only be reimbursed for the actual costs that arise in connection with journeys made."
"The travel expenses system can be reformed without a common Members’ Statute being adopted."
"We have voted against the proposal for a common Members’ Statute."
". This House has for many years been calling for a single Statute for its Members."
"We have, on innumerable occasions, been critical of the extreme divergences in the remuneration of those who represent Europe’s people."
"The process of making the EU more democratic must be of equal value to all its Member States."
"Now, for the second time, the Council has presented us with a compromise proposal, which we, the elected Members of this House, are supposed to agree to."
"It envisages basing MEPs’ income on a good third of the income of a European judge."
"Absent from this proposal, in my view, is any clear statement about what value Europeans themselves attach to the financial independence of their MEPs, and these same MEPs are instead exposed to an unworthy media campaign."
"At a time when all pro-European forces are concentrating on overcoming the problems involved in modernising the new, enlarged Europe, I do not intend expending any energy on ‘Project Statute’ if it means that we are reproached for feathering our own nests."
"I will be abstaining from the final vote."
". In adopting a Statute for Members of the European Parliament, we are having the wrong debate at the wrong time."
"At the present time, we are all well aware of the urgent need for the EU to discuss its fundamental objectives."
"The popular votes in France and the Netherlands clearly indicated, among other things, the need for the EU to draw closer to its citizens in order to restore credibility to the European project, and, in view of that, I am not in favour of a debate on the Statute for MEPs being on the agenda."
"To say the least, the time is not well chosen."
"I welcome as an improvement the proposal that travel costs be reimbursed on the basis of the expenses actually incurred, and that the current payment of fixed amounts should cease."
"I nevertheless take the view that it is difficult to have a statute for MEPs that differs from those binding on their national counterparts."
"How is the difference between the earnings of an MEP and those of a member of a national parliament to be explained and justified?"
"Current events lead me to abstain from voting on the Statute for Members of this House."
". We have always expressed our opposition to the creation of a monthly ‘parliamentary salary’, set at the same rate for all Members of the European Parliament regardless of the countries and the people that they represent."
"Members of the European Parliament are elected nationally and are – and must continue to be – accountable to their national electorates."
"The creation of a single ‘parliamentary salary’ financed by the EU budget and subject to a Community tax, forms part of a federalist concept of the mandate of Members of the European Parliament, with a view to turning the current ‘national Member of the European Parliament’ into a ‘European Member’."
"The social situation in the different Member States also varies markedly. A monthly ‘parliamentary subsidy’ set at around EUR 7 000 (around 1 400 000 escudos) would undoubtedly lead to deep inequality and disparity between the salaries earned by workers, national politicians (such as Members of the Portuguese Parliament) and local politicians, especially in Portugal, and we find this utterly incomprehensible."
"Furthermore, we wish to restate our commitment to pursuing the fight for strict accountability with respect to the Members’ use of resources to perform their duties."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues have argued consistently for greater transparency and accountability with regard to Members' salaries and expenses."
"The package proposed by the Legal Affairs committee represents an important step forward in achieving a fair and open system."
"Conservatives have always believed that we should be taxed at the same rate as our UK constituents (article 12, point 3), that our salary is equal to that of our colleagues in Westminster (article 29, points 1 and 2), and to ensure that travel expenses are only reimbursed for the actual amount incurred (article 20, point 2)."
"Indeed, it was Conservative amendments, adopted in committee, which will allow Member States to adopt additional measures in order to place MEPs on an equal footing with members of national parliaments."
". On 17 December 2003, our party, the Dutch Socialist Party, voted against the then draft for a Members’ Statute."
"We were not opposed to a unified salary, but what was suggested at the time was far too high."
"Moreover, we considered it important that it should be possible to make this salary liable to national taxes and that the reimbursement of travel expenses should be restricted to those actually incurred."
"In our experience, on an annual basis, more than half can be recouped that way."
"In the Dutch parliament, we asked the government to reject this document in the Council."
"The proposal that was amended as a result, on which we are voting today, is still not entirely what we want."
"Salaries must be below EUR 7 000 and we simply reject Article 9.3."
"We realise that voting ‘no’ at this stage will not yield any further improvements."
"Now that the maximum has been obtained, we consider this to be a victory in our long-term battle against inappropriate proposals."
"Acceptance of this proposal represents a defeat for those who for years resisted this Statute, thinking it beneath their dignity, the salaries and reimbursements of travel expenses too low, and the financial monitoring too intrusive."
"By voting against it, they will make it quite clear that they want, shamelessly, to line their own pockets."
". The issue before us is an important one that needed to be addressed, given that the fact that the Statute for Members had not been standardised following the last enlargement had created unacceptable inequality."
"My vote was therefore based on what I feel to be the most relevant aspects of this proposal on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"There are two aspects, however, on which I feel I should enlarge."
"The fact that this proposal does not cover the current legislature, and that it provides for a very long transitional period, has enabled me to act with freedom, in the knowledge that I am voting on an issue that does not affect me directly."
"Lastly, there is the question of timing."
"When the report was put to the vote, I supported it, yet had the timing of the debate been put to the vote, I would have voted against."
"Among other things, politics is about symbolism, and the fact that Parliament decided to vote on this issue at a time of major crisis for the European institutions is not something that I welcome or applaud."
"I am voting against Mr Gargani’s report because the proposed Statute would involve unacceptable salary increases, unduly generous pensions and an unduly long transitional period of two terms of office."
"The voluntary pension fund should also have been abolished with immediate effect."
"Instead, the Conference of Presidents should implement plenary’s decision concerning the reimbursement of actual travel expenses instead of, now as before, blocking this reform so as to be able to use the issue of travel expenses in its negotiations with the Council."
". The Left Party believes that it is wrong in principle to vote on our own salaries and other remuneration."
"The Left Party is in favour of proposals finally having been made to do away with the standard reimbursement of MEPs’ travel expenses."
"It is good that, in the future, reimbursement should be on the basis of actual costs."
"The Left Party is not, however, in favour of the proposed salary, the level of which is too high."
"High salaries must not turn elected representatives into a financial elite."
"Tax must, of course, be paid on a national basis, and there must be no EU tax."
"An unduly favourable pension system should also come in for the same criticism."
"For these reasons, I shall abstain in the final vote."
". Mr President, despite the worst possible timing for handling this persistent problem that has been around for years and years about a uniform Members’ Statute, I took part in the vote and pressed the ‘plus button’."
"I voted in favour, not because I think this is such a wonderful Statute, for it is not."
"The degree of uniformity is not sufficient for starters."
"From all the times, though, that we have voted in Parliament and had to establish subsequently that the Council was incapable of reaching agreement, I have learnt that the communality we seek is not feasible and that there is no such thing as an ‘ideal’ Statute."
"The Statute proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which apparently received the stamp of approval from the Council, is better than what we have at the moment in the sense that it provides the necessary transparency and that it gives us the only acceptable travel expense scheme, namely one that reimburses only expenses actually incurred."
"I am convinced that this alone is reason enough to vote in favour, even if this is done at the wrong time."
".– The report on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, by which we mean the creation of a new framework of privileges, is an insult to the peoples of Europe, while the recent rejection of the so-called European Constitution by France and the Netherlands expresses the general opposition of the peoples to the anti-grass roots policy of the ΕU."
"Consequently, the EU and the European Parliament do not have the credentials to take such decisions."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report, because they consider that Members of the European Parliament should be paid by the countries in which they are elected and which they represent and to which they answer and not by the ΕU."
"It is also an insult to the workers being crushed by the new EU anti-grass roots tempest to set the monthly salary of MEPs at EUR 7 000 while the monthly salary in Greece, for example, is EUR 572.30."
"The working and grass-roots classes must draw their own conclusions from the common stand of the conservative and social-democrat parties, who are speeding up the attack on grass-roots incomes and their standard of living in order to increase the profits of big business and, at the same time, secure privileges for the political representatives of the plutocracy."
".– I wish to explain my abstention from the vote on the Gargani report."
"I am in favour of transparency on the subject of Members' salaries and expenses: of full transparency which is the product of dialogue which highlights the realities on which any decision must be based."
"In the present instance, there was insufficient dialogue."
"Account was not taken of all the objective data."
"For example, the proposed reimbursement of travelling expenses does not take account of travelling time or inconvenience."
"The ratio between the salary of a Member of Parliament and a judge does not take account of Members' loss of income."
". I am in favour of the Members’ Statute being adopted without delay."
"All Members of the European Parliament should, as soon as possible, be subject to uniform terms and conditions."
"I will not, however, be participating in the vote, as I shall not be availing myself of the new arrangements."
"I took my seat subject to the former conditions and will continue to regard myself as bound by them."
". I welcome both the implementation of the codecision procedure in connection with these proposals and the fact that the Court of Justice has issued rulings on areas relating to the border code, most importantly on the introduction of internal border controls."
"One of the greatest triumphs of European integration has been freedom of movement without people being subject to internal border controls."
"Consequently, to reintroduce such controls would have to be an exceptional and temporary measure, and without prejudice to the normal police controls that may take place anywhere in the territory."
"External borders must act as an effective filter to stop people who are a threat to our society from entering, without interrupting the normal flow of people."
"For border controls to be efficient and effective, Member States must be equipped with the necessary human and financial resources, and at the same time must ensure that human rights are upheld in full when these controls are taking place."
"I therefore endorse this report by Mr Cashman, which supports the thrust of the Commission’s proposal aimed at communitarising the management of external borders, with a view to ensuring the same standards and the same conditions of entry for third-country nationals are complied with across the board when controls take place."
"The June List broadly supports the compromise agreed between the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"On many points, the Code clarifies previously unclear rules derived from a range of legal sources."
"We particularly welcome the increased protection against discrimination in the implementation of border controls, as well as the opportunities for third-country citizens who have been refused entry to a country to appeal against the decisions made."
"We do not, however, share the rapporteur’s view that the EC Court of Justice should be given the power to give judgment on issues concerning the reintroduction of internal border controls, and we therefore welcome the fact that the Council has not accepted these proposals."
"The June List believes that each Member State should be allowed to reserve the right to reintroduce its border controls if it considers this to be necessary in order to combat drug smuggling and illegal human and other trafficking and if it is required to withdraw from Schengen cooperation."
".– The Community Code on movements across internal and external EU borders applies the racist and anti-immigration decisions taken in Seville and Thessaloniki, in order to turn the EU into a fortress which is hostile and inhumane towards the victims of the policy of imperialism and international monopolies who try and cross its borders."
"It is not enough for foreign nationals wanting to enter and remain in the ΕU for no more than three months to be in possession of the necessary documents, to convince the authorities that they have legitimate reasons and enough money to survive for that period and to give detailed information on where and how they will live; they must also not be nationals 'for whom an alert has been issued in the Schengen Information System' and must not be considered 'a threat to public policy, internal security, public health or the international relations of any of the Member States'."
"Given that 89% of the entries in the Schengen Information System concern persons with no criminal record (they are based on unconfirmed accusations by 'informers'), this is an immensely arbitrary and repressive approach towards foreigners."
"The anti-immigration policy of the ΕU is also reflected in the plummeting numbers of requests for asylum approved, in the preparations for the creation of immigrant concentration camps and so on. The ΕU is opening its borders just wide enough to serve the interests of big business in cheap labour."
"The Communist Party of Greece voted against the Cashman report."
". Freedom of movement is one of the freedoms that the citizens of the EU hold most dear."
"At the same time, immigration is one of the political questions that we must address seriously and with cool heads."
"That being said, I feel that the crux of the question addressed in the report, which in part verges on the technical, is, nonetheless, equally important."
"The practical rules governing both ‘internal border controls’ and ‘external border controls’ are of considerable significance."
"First and foremost, along with security and the exercise of authority comes respect for the citizens, be they nationals of EU Member States or otherwise."
"Nonetheless, I agree that there are exceptions, whereby a Member State may waive the rules, for perfectly valid reasons. I also back both the report’s support for the right of appeal against a decision to refuse entry, without prejudice to the immediate effectiveness of such a decision, and a set of rules on the procedures mentioned here."
"The report is designed to create a legal base for cooperation and commercial relations with the following industrialised countries: the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand."
"Cooperation is partly about supporting EU Centres."
"Trade cooperation is partly about exchanges, conferences and executive training."
"We support the EU’s common trade policy but have difficulty justifying the budgeted costs of the efforts required, amounting to EUR 17 million between now and 2007."
"The results of the referenda in France and the Netherlands show that the EU bureaucracy must be slimmed down, so unnecessary expenses must also be dispensed with."
"In the light of all this, we are voting against the report."
". Commercial relations and cooperation with the countries involved in the programmes covered by this regulation are of major importance to the Union."
"For the purposes of workable and fruitful commercial relations, we must continue to support initiatives of this nature, which help to coordinate support for research activities, exchange programmes for young people and business missions. These programmes benefit today’s Europe and will benefit future generations."
". This report forms an integral part of the package of reforms of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP)."
"Statistical issues, such as the harmonisation of accounting rules and macroeconomic aggregates in the context of calculating the public deficit, were among the areas dealt with in most detail in the report entitled ‘Improving the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact’ submitted to the Spring European Council of March 2005."
"The plan to improve the European statistical system goes hand in hand with the attempt to restore credibility to the SGP, following cases of statistics being manipulated and numerous examples of creative accounting."
"For us, the crux of the matter is not so much the SGP’s credibility; we feel that the SGP should be scrapped in view of its social and economic effects."
"The regulation before us, which has been improved upon by the amendments that have been tabled by Parliament, increases the powers of the Commission and Eurostat, both to define and certify the quality of statistical data and to verify and standardise calculation procedures. The most worrying aspect of this is that the Commission can put direct pressure on governments to implement monetary policies in the Member States."
"Our vote against is thus consistent with our overall opposition to the so-called reform of the SPG."
". All actions that help to improve the governance of the EU should be supported and properly taken on board."
"The report by Mr Gauzès forms part of the efforts that need to be channelled into reforming the Community’s statistical system, within the crucial context of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"It is of paramount importance that exchanges of information be governed by transparency and trust between all of those involved in the process."
"The collection, exchange and analysis of data must therefore be guided by the principles of accuracy, coherence and quality, within the context of the trust and transparency on which relations between Member States and the institutions must always be based."
". I support this much-needed initiative to address the breach of the cease-fire agreement signed at N'Djamena on 8 April 2004."
"The purpose of this proposal, following UN Security Council Resolution 1591(2005), is to impose certain restrictive measures against Sudan, with a view to:"
"- freezing the funds and economic resources of persons impeding the peace process and"
"- preventing the entry into or transit through the territories of persons who may represent a threat to stability in that region."
"We cannot allow violations of human rights, and of international humanitarian law, to continue. Nor can we stand by while all manner of atrocities are being committed."
"We must take all steps available to us to endeavour to re-establish peace in Darfur."
"It must not be forgotten, however, that special attention must be given to one-off humanitarian emergencies."
". The attitudes shown by countries and by international institutions are always worth more than the words that they speak."
"When it comes to conflicts, the victims know this better than anyone."
"Consequently, as well as voting in favour, I should also like to state that I hope that these measures will prove effective, and for this to happen we need the commitment of each of the 25 Member States."
"There is no national interest that comes before peace and human rights, and nor must there be."
". The June List supports the two UN resolutions on Darfur and Congo whereby those who impede the peace process, commit violations of humanitarian or of human rights law or violate the arms embargo shall be prevented from travelling within the territory of the Member States, with funds, financial assets and economic resources that can be linked to them also being frozen."
"We do not, however, wish to help develop a common foreign and security policy for the EU."
"All the Member States are obliged to implement those measures decided upon by the UN Security Council pursuant to Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and a joint decision at EU level is therefore unnecessary."
"The June List has therefore voted against the reports."
". The importance of this issue is in inverse proportion to the speed with which the international community has acted in response to the tragic situation in Darfur, Sudan."
"Although I have consistently called for Parliament to address this issue, I still feel that this report deserves my vote in favour and my hope that it will prove effective."
". As I said at first reading, the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) fell short of what was required."
"The same objectives and criteria were reaffirmed and indeed more time was given."
"What was really needed was the scrapping of the SGP and a clean break from the prevalent economic and monetary policies, in order to create a macroeconomic framework capable of fostering sustained economic growth and employment."
"This was not the case."
"The excessive deficit procedures continue to be implemented, not least in Portugal, the worst aspect of which is that it serves to justify the austerity measures contained in the stability programmes put forward."
"This is true of Portugal, where taxes have gone up and where there has been a concerted attack on public administration, and in particular on public officials."
"There is still no desire to learn the lessons that need to be learned."
"Yet in spite of the cosmetic reform of the SGP, I welcome the rejection of the rapporteur’s maximalist proposals, the aim of which was to strengthen the SGP and to attach greater importance to the debt criterion, offsetting the data provided by national governments against the data provided by the central banks."
". Not only is the Council’s refusal to take into account any of the amendments proposed by the European Parliament a cavalier action, it also goes against the spirit of the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Indeed, the balanced result achieved by the Luxembourg Presidency makes the procedure for excessive deficits more flexible, but at the same time includes increased surveillance of budgetary positions, with the simple, but sensible and honest, idea that we need to save during good times in order to face the lean times."
"Only, the affirmation of this principle must be translated into reality in these texts."
"There is the rub!"
"Following the unanimous agreement of the Council, certain Member States seem to be breaking their word and to be trying to go back on the particular attention that should now be given to public debt."
"It is an appalling signal to give in these troubled times."
"The stability of the euro will suffer from it."
"Under these circumstances, the rapporteur proposes nothing less than re-specifying the commitment made with regard to public debt."
"I can only support him in that, even though I hold nothing against the Presidency, which is irreproachable in this matter."
". I supported the report by Mr Karas, because I feel that the problems that have surfaced in recent years with regard to the revision of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) must be resolved."
"The reform of the SGP calls for more emphasis to be placed on debt and for comparisons between statistics provided by the national central banks to the European Central Bank and the data provided by the Member States to Eurostat to be taken on board."
"The reform of the SGP must involve all those involved in the process and all information relating to the development of the economies of the Member States must be clear and transparent. As such we will be in a position to act promptly with economic measures and reforms aimed at helping our economies to grow and develop healthily."
". The report by Mr Duchoň addresses areas of major importance to the future of economic activities in Europe."
"It is vital that we protect the Community’s financial interests when combating fraud and other illegal activities with the potential to harm its financial interests."
"I therefore feel that this report strengthens the existing measures for cooperation and exchange of information that are key to combating illegal activities of this nature."
"I also wish to highlight the key role played by OLAF, a body that is at the Union’s disposal, in facilitating the exchange of information."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report."
". Almost half of funds earmarked for helping poor countries comes from the EU and its Member States, making it the world’s biggest donor bloc."
"The Union also makes use of trade to foster development, by opening up its markets to goods from poor countries and encouraging them to step up trade amongst themselves."
"The proposal for a regulation is designed to further untie Community aid in areas covered by tendering procedures for goods and services for the purpose of external aid."
"The purpose is to ensure that suppliers have access to all development assistance programmes financed from the EU budget and to set down rules governing the eligibility of persons and goods under instruments, laying down criteria and derogations."
"I therefore endorse the report by Mr Gahler, which points out that fully untying this aid could make it USD 2 to 3 billion more effective."
". The most relevant aspect, to my mind, of the issue before us, and the aspect that led me to vote in favour, is the belief that untying Community aid makes it more effective."
"Beyond political considerations is the expectation – backed up by studies – that greater success can be achieved without enlarging the budget, simply by greater economic streamlining, and this is something that I welcome."
"Regarding the matter before us, we believe that NAFO is right in stating the need for a rebuilding plan for Greenland halibut."
"We are not, therefore, voting against legislation by the EU."
"Nor, however, can we vote in favour of this, for it is extremely improbable that this rebuilding plan will work, any more than other rebuilding plans in the EU’s fisheries policy have worked."
"We believe that the EU’s fisheries policy has foundered for, in spite of extensive measures and bureaucracy, stocks are still threatened."
"This may be due to a situation in which an isolated intervention in the form of quotas has led to increasing numbers of discards. Then there is the hidden transfer and sale of quotas and rights and, in addition, the great uncertainty attached to bycatches in other fisheries."
"That is why we cannot vote, either, for a report that would have the EU’s fisheries policy continue unamended."
"We believe that there is a need for Parliament to demand a review of the EU’s fisheries policy, including the rebuilding plans."
"The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) scientific council has adopted a 15-year rebuilding plan for Greenland halibut, which provides for a reduction of the total allowable catch (TAC) level of this species. Already provisionally transposed into Community legislation, the plan is now waiting for binding permanent status."
"Although I feel that the legislative proposal is consistent with the new common fisheries policy, I do not agree with some points in the version tabled by the Commission, which I feel would penalise Community fishermen."
"I refer specifically to the reduction by 20 to a 5% margin of tolerance between the estimation of the quantities retained on board and that of the logbook figure."
"As this level has not been adopted by NAFO I have always felt that adopting this measure would have a detrimental effect on Community fishermen."
"I therefore welcome the removal of Article 8 and feel that Parliament has given the document a better balance and made it fairer."
"We oppose the EU Common Fisheries Policy."
"We have, however, chosen to support this report because Parliament’s position is closer to the rebuilding plan adopted by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) than is the Commission’s proposal."
". This fishing zone, managed by the regional fisheries organisation in question, is of major importance to the Portuguese fleet."
"The plan provides for a reduction in the total allowable catch (TAC) level and for additional control measures, which will obviously have social and economic repercussions."
"As with other rebuilding plans for fish stocks, we feel it is essential that, beyond the need to ensure that fisheries resources are sustainable and that scientific data is reliable, we implement much-needed social and economic support measures for the fleets affected by the reduction in fisheries or the temporary suspension of activities."
"We welcome Parliament’s proposals improving on points on which we disagreed with the Commission’s proposal:"
"- the fact that fleets of EU countries that are bigger than other fleets working in the same waters do not impose their own limits (it is impossible to understand why the Commission seeks to be ‘holier than thou’ in adding further measures to the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, and as such we object to a unilateral limit of tolerance margins);"
"- the guarantee that TACs can be adjusted upwards if that fish stock is deemed to have been restored."
". The report by Mr Kristensen addresses an issue that is without doubt of key importance to Portugal."
"I voted in favour of this report on fisheries-related issues in an area in which the Community vessels operating are almost entirely Portuguese or Spanish."
". It is appalling that most Members of this House insist on turning a blind eye to the crisis of confidence between the citizens and the European institutions, as evidenced by the recent referenda in France and the Netherlands on the ex-draft of the so-called European Constitution."
"Similarly, they continue to press ahead with proposals such as the revision of the Lisbon Strategy, including the Bolkestein proposal for a directive, the organisation of working time and access to the port services market, rather than demanding that the Commission and the Council remove them."
"They also support the Council’s decision on guidelines for employment, which, disgracefully, overlook equal rights and opportunities between men and women, with specific regard to access to jobs, salaries and career development."
"They also continue to promote projects such as the Stability and Growth Pact and the flexibility of labour, to which we are opposed."
"The true crisis eating away at Europe is unemployment, uncertainty and the destabilisation of public services."
"The people are reminding their leaders of their existence."
"Those who voted ‘no’ in France are calling for a major change of direction for European integration and a renegotiation of the Treaty."
"The pause for reflection must be used for that purpose."
"The first requirement is social: to create growth and employment without making working conditions too flexible, and without pulling our social model down."
"The guidelines for growth and employment adopted during this Summit, however, run completely counter to this objective."
"At a time when employees are demanding guarantees and an end to ultraliberalism, ‘we are carrying on as normal’."
"We should have withdrawn the Bolkestein directive and the Working Time Directive and proposed a social Treaty in their place."
"The Council is deaf to the expectations of the people."
"In order to extricate ourselves from the budgetary deadlock, we must increase the European budget in the interests of revival and cohesion."
"As long as the budget depends on revenues from the Member States, the blockages will be stronger than the general interest."
"The alternative to a European tax is European borrowing."
". I was not able to support the resolution on the result of the European Council (Brussels 16 – 17 June 2005) as a result of its excessive formality and use of general officialese."
"It is couched in complex bureaucratic language that is practically devoid of meaning."
"The individual points made are not formulated in a clear and sensible manner which would provide comprehensible answers or ways out of the complex situation, in which Europe finds itself after the two unsuccessful referenda on the constitutional agreement and the failure to adopt the budget for the years 2007 - 2013."
"There was no mention of basic principles relating to the internal market, such as the approach to the Directive on services."
"It failed to mention the importance of a regional policy and the structural implements that are essential if the differences between the developed regions and those which are lagging behind are to be gradually removed."
"The Lisbon Strategy is once again a series of empty phrases and there is no mention of how it should finally be put into practice."
"If we want politics to be comprehensible to the citizens of Europe, we must change the bureaucratic rhetoric in our resolutions and word them in a language that is comprehensible to the people."
"Only then will we be able to regain their trust."
". The fact that I voted against the resolution tabled on this issue is not, in any way, due to any dissatisfaction on my part with the Luxembourg Presidency."
"Indeed, I feel that we can all see how the widespread praise for the Luxembourg Prime Minister is justified."
"Recent events, however, such as the double rejection of the Constitutional Treaty by the French and the Dutch and the inability to adopt the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013, cannot have gone unnoticed by Members of this House."
"Reality is no mere passing detail."
"Nevertheless, anyone reading the adopted resolution could be forgiven for thinking that either Parliament has had its mind elsewhere or that the citizens have."
"In fact neither is true, at least on my part and on the part of the group to which I belong."
"The last European Council should have responded to the current crisis in Europe with great lucidity and a proper understanding of the feelings of the citizens. Unfortunately, it was not to be."
"One can only hope that this crisis can give rise to fresh, more appropriate, solutions."
"I believe that this is possible."
". The Moderate delegation has today voted in favour of the report on security research."
"We think it important to develop a structured and appropriate security research programme with a view, for example, to guaranteeing the EU’s credibility and an advanced intelligence capability within the framework of the European Security and Defence Policy."
"We are, however, opposed to certain wordings in the report: firstly, those applying to the budget appropriations for security research, linked by the rapporteur to a percentage of GNP; and, secondly, those applying to worldwide observation and data collection."
"The report is aimed at developing a European Security Research Programme (ESRP), to be introduced in 2007."
"We are not opposed on principle to joint research efforts at European level, but we object to the ESRP’s aim of contributing to an integrated European defence market."
"We therefore choose to vote against the report as a whole."
". This report concerns a European Parliament initiative to support the creation of a ‘European Security Research Programme’ by 2007, and the Community financing of that programme, within the framework of the ‘European Security and Defence Policy’ and what are referred to as the ‘European Security Strategy’ and ‘The Hague Programme’."
"The aim is therefore to step up research in areas such as the gathering and storing of information, vigilance, spying, security and ‘crisis management’. It will be a further cog in the wheel of the current militarisation of the EU and its drift towards securitarianism, under the pretext of the ‘fight against terror’, conducted in conjunction with the USA."
"Hence our group’s vote against."
". In light of recent world events, the issue of security has taken on major importance, and Member States must address new threats to security."
"There has nonetheless been a marked under-investment in research and development in the defence sector, in which spending has either remained unchanged or has in fact gone down over the past ten years."
"I therefore congratulate Mr Klich on his report, which supports the Commission’s proposal to set up a European Security Research Programme (ESRP) by 2007, in order to address current security challenges, while contributing towards the growth and competitiveness of the European economy."
"The ESRP will involve relevant security research stakeholders and will enjoy appropriate funding, so as to secure the greatest possible continuity over time and the best results."
".– The report also puts the research sector at the service of the imperialist policy of the ΕU and, at the same time, secures funding for big business in this sector by making EUR 1 billion available from taxes paid by the working and grass-roots classes in the Member States of the ΕU."
"On the pretext of 'security' and 'threats', it promotes the further militarisation of Europe and improved technology to support the aggressive actions and enhance the military power of the ΕU, so that it is better placed to compete with the USA for control of markets and countries."
"At the same time, taking the view that the distinction between internal and external security is difficult to make, it also uses research to improve internal repression of the grass-roots movement in the Member States."
"Every system, even in space, even the satellite positioning system, is being put at the service of the programme for security research."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report."
"The peoples of the ΕU must step up their fight against the ΕU and their disobedience to its imperialist policy."
". It is really no progress towards peace that the Klich-Report calls for a minimum annual community budget of €1 billion for armament and so called security research."
"The Parliament's Resolution is even worse than the Commission proposals."
"It is preposterous to try and aim to close the gap on armament spending between the EU and the United States."
"This would mean require the EU to spend still much more each year on armament research."
"The EU is becoming more and more militarised."
"The spending of an additional one billion Euros on armament research would be yet a further step in this direction."
"In rejecting the Constitutional Treaty, the people of France and the Netherlands also rejected the EU militarisation envisaged in that Treaty."
"It is a scandal that the protagonists of this militarized EU are simply going ahead with their plans regardless."
"Instead of pretending to create jobs with huge spending on armaments, the EU should spend more on civil research programs - and not follow in the footsteps of the United States."
". Europe must get used to the idea that security comes at a price and that our need for security justifies paying that price."
"Without prejudice to our partnerships and alliances, especially with the United States, Europe needs to invest in the security of its citizens, and this cannot be done without investing in research, an area in which Europe has sadly proved lacking in commitment and competence."
"In the context of the world in which we live, I feel that this report addresses the concerns that I have expressed, and advocates action that meets our needs."
"I therefore voted in favour."
". We live in an age of headlong technological change, and, at the same time, criminal activity is developing with equal speed."
"One example of this is the latest theft of credit card data, which may well affect some 800 000 Europeans."
"The electronic health cards that we intend introducing may well end up being the next thing that the criminal gangs will have their eyes on."
"Cybercrime – in the shape of illegal downloads, spamming, spyware and child pornography – is flourishing, and only some 1 or 2% of the offences committed on the Internet ever come to light."
"What makes this particularly disturbing is the widespread ignorance of such crime."
"Far too many users are still falling prey to e-mailshots that trick them into disclosing their bank details, thus credulously giving fraudsters access not only to sensitive data, but also to their own bank accounts."
"The latest Eurobarometer survey showed that 40% of Austrian parents had no idea where to get information on safe use of the Internet and where to report prohibited material."
"In that, though, they are not alone, for investigations have revealed that the US authorities are equally ignorant of when and to whom they should report cases of cybercrime."
"Tracking down cyber-crooks is like looking for a needle in a haystack."
"This makes it all the more important that we should mount an information campaign that would enable users not only to avoid the traps in the Internet, but also to play their part in combating the crime that goes on there."
". I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Trautmann."
"I feel that issues of Internet governance and mechanisms for financing the new technologies should be at the forefront of political debate in Europe and the rest of the world."
"The information society is of twofold importance in meeting the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy: firstly because it will help to fulfil the aims of economic growth accompanied by major investment in the new technologies and secondly because a Europe that seeks to be at the cutting edge of technology needs to be a regular presence and a proactive player on the international stage."
"I believe that any initiative that fosters the exchange of ideas and information and puts us on the road to technological development should be supported. Initiatives of this kind can only help to achieve greater growth and economic development in Europe."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 23 June 2005."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a terrible tragedy has struck the family of our fellow Member Filip Adwent: as you know, he, his daughter, his father and his mother died in a traffic accident on Saturday 18 June."
"Parliament has lost a colleague, an excellent Member of Parliament, a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, vice-chairman of the Delegation to the Parliamentary Committee on EU-Ukraine Cooperation and deputy in the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"I believe that all of those who have worked with him in these committees and all of us in general remember his serious work and his dedication to Parliament."
"Filip Adwent was a doctor by profession."
"He was known for his sense of justice and the conviction with which he fought for what he believed in."
"For many years he participated in the organisation of humanitarian aid for the poor and disadvantaged in Poland."
"At this painful moment, Parliament would like to express its condolences to his wife, Mrs Adwent, and the whole of his family — the remaining members of his family."
"I would ask, ladies and gentlemen, that we observe a minute’s silence in memory of our colleague."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to make a further statement relating to certain events of this weekend."
"On reaching the Chamber, you may have been surprised to see that there is a large white band encircling the Chamber."
"I believe that this is the first time that we have used a symbol in this building for a campaign, such a large symbol, and I would like to tell you a few details about the significance of this white band."
"I would like to remind you that this band symbolises the ‘Global Call to Action against Poverty’ which was launched by the President of Brazil, Mr da Silva, in Porto Alegre, in January 2005."
"Since then, more than 600 non-governmental organisations throughout the world, including the largest organisations, have joined this campaign and are trying to secure the support of governments and public figures."
"It is now our turn, the turn of the European Parliament, and to this end we have chosen this week of plenary sittings, which coincides with the beginning of the G8 summit on Wednesday in Gleneagles."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we will all agree that the fight against poverty is objective of the Union’s development policy and that this year offers a great opportunity to make progress in this regard, since during this year several high-level conferences will be held on this subject."
"You are also aware that, this year, the European Union will contribute EUR 46 000 million in development aid, and this means that the European Union is the world's largest donor in this field."
"We can certainly take pride in this, but we should perhaps consider the relative significance of this figure — of this EUR 46 000 million."
"Please bear in mind that the EUR 70 that each European pays per year in the rich countries for the purposes of development aid is equivalent to the price of one cup of coffee per week."
"This is what our effort means in relative terms: the price of a cup of coffee per week for each inhabitant of the rich countries; our generosity goes no further than that."
"The Council in June approved the decision to increase the EU’s development aid to EUR 66 000 million in 2010, that is to say, from 46 to 66, the price of one and a half cups of coffee."
"However, we would have to wait five years for this."
"I believe that this is the ambitious message that the European Union is sending to the G8 summit this week, but we must also remember that for this purpose we will need a budget that we do not yet have."
"The objectives of this campaign are fair trade, debt reduction and an increase in aid, both in terms of its quality and its quantity."
"I would also like to remind you that, outside this Chamber, there are a series of stalls set up by the NGOs, and until Wednesday you will be able to obtain more information from them."
"On Wednesday morning, a debate will take place on Africa, on the challenges of globalisation and also, of course, on this campaign against poverty, in which Jack Straw, Hilary Benn and Louis Michel will participate."
"The white band is the symbol of this campaign and, following the debate, everybody who has spoken in it and myself, on behalf of everybody, will sign a second white band as a sign of our support; this band will be cut and Hilary Benn will take it to Gleneagles."
"However, we also need the support of all of you, and to this end I would ask you to sign the white band at the entrance to the Chamber as a sign of your action and your will to combat poverty, so that Hilary Benn can present a vigorous message from this Parliament in Gleneagles."
"When you sign it, however, I would ask you to bear in mind that we are citizens with more powers than the ordinary citizens, we are budgetary authorities, we vote for and allocate resources and we approve policies; when you sign it, bear in mind that over the coming years, we as parliamentarians will have to approve the Union’s budget, with or without financial perspectives, and that the commitment represented by your signature is also a commitment to use this Parliament's power to make a genuine effort to eradicate poverty in our world."
"Thank you very much for participating in this campaign."
"The final version of the draft agenda for the present part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 30 June pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"There are several proposed amendments that we shall consider day by day."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has requested that the reports by Mr Lauk, on the 2004 Annual Report of the European Central Bank, and Mr Maaten, on the implementation of an information and communication strategy on the euro and economic and monetary union, be debated jointly."
"Mr President, the two items – the Lauk report on the European Central Bank, and the report on the communication strategy on the euro – were originally to be debated jointly."
"That made sense, because President Trichet of the European Central Bank would have been present at the debate."
"When, at a later stage, the two items were separated, it meant that President Trichet would be present only for the Lauk report and therefore would be unable to discuss the communication strategy on the euro with us."
"That is a pity both for us and for President Trichet who, I understand, is keen to be part of that debate."
"It makes more sense to have a joint debate on the two reports to enable President Trichet to participate on both reports, rather than on the annual report of the European Central Bank alone."
"That is the reason for our request."
"Mr President, allow me to reassure you and to reassure Mr Maaten: I feel very much part of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and, therefore, it is not on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that I will speak, but as the Chairman of the committee concerned with the two reports in question."
"Basically, the request that we are going to examine to change the agenda is slightly paradoxical, because the entire strategy carried out by the rapporteurs and the Commission was aimed at having a joint debate on those two texts: the policy of the Central Bank and the information and communication strategy regarding the euro."
"The agenda as it is envisaged, with the one report following the other, very much reflects this intention."
"There is, however, something strange in all of this: how did the idea of holding two separate debates instead of one joint debate come about in our agenda?"
"I hope that the plenary vote will allow things to be returned to normal as good sense would dictate."
"During the sitting of 10 May, the report by Mr Busk, on the proposal for a regulation on exceptional market support measures, was referred back to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, pursuant to Rule 52."
"That committee is now asking that it be referred back to committee, pursuant to Rules 52 and 168 of our Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, we have referred this report to the committee."
"The rapporteur agreed with the commissioner concerned to put forward a fresh proposal on the matter at the September part-session."
"We therefore request a further postponement with the consent of the Commission."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that Questions to the Commission be removed."
"Mr President, let me first of all express my group’s condolences to the late Mr Adwent’s family, and also wish Mr Laschet all the best in his new role."
"We will miss him as an adversary in the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"I wish to move – and it is not a pleasant task to do so – that Questions to the Commission be again adjourned to another day, as we have a lot of things in mind for the Structural Funds, and so we are very keen to take part in the debate on them."
"Even though this debate will probably make few changes of any substance, a lot of Members would like to speak in it."
"We will be in a similar situation on several occasions over the coming months – the services directive and REACH are two examples that spring to mind – and so I would ask you, Mr President, and the services, to give some thought to what arrangements we should be making for them."
"I have no desire to make the same request every time and deprive Members of something they are entitled to."
"We need to join together in considering how we can retain Question Time and still allow more time for important debates."
"Today, though, I wish, on behalf of my group, to move that Question Time be dispensed with, and, as I have said, that the services give some thought to these matters."
"Mr President, I should in fact like to offer the support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for the proposal put forward by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, as the debate on the Structural Funds is so important that the agenda, as it stands, would not allow a large number of Members to speak."
"I therefore believe that it is very important that we can take advantage of an extended debating time."
"Withdrawing the time dedicated to questions to the Commission and the Council is, however, regrettable."
"It would therefore be desirable, Mr President, if you could consider organising the debating time within plenary in Strasbourg more efficiently."
"We would like the time for questions to the Commission and the Council to be reorganised, with a number of my fellow Members even proposing that the debate be held on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings."
"I do not know if that is possible."
"Be that as it may, we very much hope, Mr President, that you will give fresh thought to the matter."
"In the meantime, we are in favour of the proposal put forward by the PSE Group."
"Mr President, at the last part-session, at exactly this time, Mr Swoboda proposed the abandonment or the curtailment of Question Time."
"Here we go again!"
"This is quite intolerable."
"Questioning the executive – questioning the Commission, rather than giving our little speeches – is one of the most fundamental things we do in this Parliament."
"It is not acceptable to do this two part-sessions running."
"I am very much against this proposal."
"Although the two big groups are proposing it, so it looks as though it will go through."
"I plead with colleagues to vote against the proposal by the two leaders."
"Let us keep Question Time."
"Mr Karas and 38 other Members have requested that a Commission statement be added on the Situation in Bulgaria after the elections Progress made towards accession by Bulgaria and Romania with a view to the next progress report."
"They call for progress towards their full and effective accession, naturally."
"Furthermore, they request that a resolution be voted on in this regard."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the avoidance of doubt, I would like to start with three prefatory remarks."
"The first is that most members of my group voted in favour of Bulgarian and Romanian accession on 1 January 2007."
"Secondly, there has been a debate in the Conference of Presidents as to when observers from these countries can be invited to join in the work of this House."
"I regard this as an issue for debate in the plenary and believe that no date can as yet be set."
"Thirdly, as the states that joined us in 2004 were allowed to send observers to the European Parliament a year prior to their accession, we believe that the same rule should apply, with exactly the same timeframe, and that an accession date cannot yet be named, quite simply because the ratification of the accession treaties has not yet been completed."
"Nor has the Commission yet produced its progress report."
"The consequences of this are not yet known; it would still be possible to delay accession until 1 January 2008, and we have not made financial and organisational preparations for observation to begin earlier."
"We therefore want the Commission to make a statement on the state of play as regards its planned progress report, enabling us to come to our own conclusions, rather than put the next new Member States, as regards observation and cooperation, in a more advantageous position than that formerly enjoyed by the last ten Member States to join us."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this House is not in any doubt about the fact that Bulgaria and Romania will join the European Union. What is still an open question is at what point in time they will do so."
"The Conference of Presidents has decided to invite observers in September, and, although we all, of course, accept its ruling with the utmost submissiveness and reverence, the plenary might perhaps be allowed to decide these things for itself from time to time."
"There are three reasons why the date set for the sending of observers was too early."
"For a start, never before have observers been invited so early on; secondly, the treaties explicitly provide for the accession date to be delayed, and, if that were to happen, the observers would be here for rather more than two years; and thirdly they would be with us when the Commission presents its next progress report, in which we can expect an answer as to whether accession is to take place at the beginning of 2007 or of 2008, and debating with observers present is not a good idea."
"We therefore ask that this item be put on the agenda, thus enabling us, on the basis of the plenary’s decision, to consider the matter carefully."
"Mr President, in 1993 in Copenhagen the Union agreed a strategy of ten plus two for enlargement."
"We have pursued it to the huge benefit of those 12 countries and of the other Member States in terms of greater stability, greater prosperity and greater opportunities for our citizens."
"Whatever the position of the EPP’s Prime Ministers, within the EPP Group there has always been a history of opposition to Bulgaria and Romania."
"Two months ago they moved to delay our approval of the accession treaties."
"More recently they tried to delay the appointment of observer MEPs and now they are trying to stop observers coming although you, Mr President, have already written officially to the presidents of those parliaments inviting observers."
"We all know the weakness of the EPP in those two countries."
"We know that the EPP Group in this House would appear smaller after the arrival of these observers."
"But it takes a unique combination of political cunning and willingness to destabilise things in those two countries to make such a cynical move now and I hope the House will reject it."
"I would like to inform you that during the last two part-sessions two legislative proposals by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs have been rejected by plenary and have therefore been referred back to committee pursuant to Rule 52 of the Rules of Procedure."
"With regard to the initiative by the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg with a view to adopting a Council decision adjusting the basic salaries and allowances applicable to Europol staff, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs asks that plenary confirm its rejection during the present part-session by voting for the legislative resolution closing the consultation."
"If there is no objection the vote on this issue will take place on Thursday."
"With regard to the proposed decision on the retention of data — the Álvaro report — which was referred back to the Commission on 22 June, I must inform you that that parliamentary committee would like more time to allow the European Commission to present an alternative or additional proposal on the same subject."
"Do you think that we should allow that committee more time and that, once its proposal is presented, Parliament should then decide on the most appropriate procedure for dealing with this issue in accordance with the Treaties?"
". Mr President, you have just explained everything in fact."
"If I have correctly understood, therefore, the entire matter will be put to the vote on Thursday."
"I thank you and I thank my fellow Members."
"Allow me to provide some details in relation to what we have just voted on: motions for resolutions can be presented until 10 a.m. tomorrow Tuesday and amendments and joint motions for resolutions can be presented until 10 a.m. on Wednesday."
"Mr President, can you please again tell us precisely when this debate on Bulgaria and Romania is to be held and how long it will last?"
"That debate will take place at the end of Wednesday’s agenda."
"Following that laborious rearrangement of the agenda, we shall proceed to the next item, which is the one-minute speeches by Members."
"I shall continue to apply the procedure that I communicated to you by letter, to which nobody has expressed any objection and which was applied during the last part-session."
"In recent weeks there has been a new and unprecedented series of raids in Germany organised at the government level."
"These actions have been going on for more than a year now with unabated intensity and according to press reports, are brutal, unjustified, unlawful and in violation of the presumption of innocence and other fundamental human rights, and have as their aim to collectively crush Hungarian firms and squeeze them out of the German market, in other words, out of the internal market of the European Union."
"The Hungarian Government has protested and demanded an explanation, those affected have written to the Commission, and indeed as a Member of this House, I have also submitted a question to the relevant Commissioner."
"The matter has not, however, been resolved."
"Now my parliamentary colleagues and I are again writing to urge the Commission to take action, and indeed we intend to propose that Parliament should debate these and other such discriminatory practices by Member States that seriously contravene EU regulations."
"Mr President, please follow these events closely, as I am convinced that by obstructing the free movement of services we are not moving closer to achieving our Lisbon targets on competitiveness; on the contrary, we are going in the opposite direction."
"Mr President, the European Parliament has passed 83 Lisbon directives, 63 of which should have been implemented."
"In fact, only ten have been fully implemented by all the Member States."
"I wish to continue my practice of naming and shaming Member States that fail to implement EU legislation."
"Today the issue I am concentrating on is being discussed at the G8 Summit: the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Allowance Trading Scheme Directive, which should have been implemented by the end of 2003."
"Estonia, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Sweden have yet to notify the Commission of their legislation implementing this directive."
"There is no point in passing these laws if they are not implemented."
"Such lax behaviour by Member States jeopardises the Lisbon directives and economic liberalisation."
"Mr President, could you please write to these countries and ask them when they intend to initiate this law?"
"Mr President, on 26 June our colleague Filip Adwent, a Member of the European Parliament, passed away following a tragic car accident."
"His closest family members, his parents and his daughter, also died in the accident. We have held a minute’s silence in their memory."
"We have lost a Member of Parliament who was kind-hearted, extremely hard-working, noble, friendly and compassionate to others."
"He was known for his active participation in Parliament’s work, for example within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and during plenary sessions, when he championed farmers’ interests."
"His enthusiastic involvement and magnanimity meant that we joined forces to promote common causes and the common good, in spite of our political differences."
"We recently spent a great deal of time together working to end the European Union’s extremely unfair treatment of Polish producers of soft fruit."
"Mr Adwent is unfortunately no longer with us, and we will doubtless find it harder to find solutions to such problems without him."
"My memories of Mr Adwent are fond ones, and I should like to thank him by means of this speech for his friendliness and cooperation, while sharing in the grief of his family."
"Mr President, I, along with a quarter of a million people, marched through Edinburgh – my home city – over the weekend to protest against poverty in the developing world."
"Sadly, today we hear that a few hundred rioters are currently under the control of the police in Edinburgh and that they are intent on making trouble in my home town."
"I hope that the police will take firm steps against them."
"As you said earlier, it is our turn in this House."
"We must reclaim the agenda from these rioters, from these protesters."
"I would refer the House to the activities which will be taking place this week."
"I would urge colleagues to support them."
"I would ask you also to sign the written declaration in my name on ‘Making Poverty History’."
"At a time when expectations of politicians in general are running so high, I would urge colleagues to demonstrate and prove to the citizens of Europe that we are in step with them, as we were in step with them over the weekend, and play our part in making poverty history."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like everyone else, I too am impressed with the wave of solidarity engendered across the whole of the Western world by the organisation of the Live 8 event."
"By watching the concerts in Hyde Park, Versailles or Toronto, which they were able to do via 140 television channels, millions of people across the globe have sent a clear message that we should not turn our backs on Africa."
"The question is, though, whether the proposed solution is the best one."
"It remains to be seen whether the cancellation of Africa’s debt by the G8 is the best way of getting Africans to take responsibility for improving their lot."
"We should also be critical towards quite a few African leaders and, as the brother of the South African President, Muletsi Mbeki, did in the , have the nerve to say out loud that Africa’s problem resides in the plundering of the continent, and is being inflicted by its own leaders."
"As a Fleming, I know only too well that in the past, Belgian politicians nurtured Mobutu, who was a common thief, and also that the French Africa policy was often one of unscrupulous complicity with political figures who did not give a damn about the misery of their own people."
"I cannot, therefore, agree with Bob Geldof when he says that we should not dwell on corruption too much."
"Africa deserves our all-out support, but not when our money ends up in the pockets of corrupt politicians."
"– Mr President, the British Prime Minister, having barely taken over the Presidency of the Council, has said that he does not care about the 4% of the population who are farmers, who produce 2% of gross income."
"However, not every European lives in Mayfair in London or on the Champs Elysées in Paris or on the Via Veneto in Rome."
"There are a great many Europeans who live in the regions, in rural areas."
"In my country, which was one of the first to join the European Union, the situation is tragic."
"Factories are closing, people are shopping in neighbouring countries, unemployment has reached peak levels in Europe, we have two and a half million illegal immigrants, more than Italy, which has a population of 45 million; the situation is dramatic."
"We are not begging."
"We are asking that you secure the borders of Greece, the borders of Europe."
"There are 40 to 50 illegal entries a day."
"This has forced us to spend USD 5.2 billion on equipment."
"If we had spent this money on agriculture, if we had spent it on factories, we would not today need to ask Mr Blair for money."
"Save us, please, from the threats from Turkey."
"Mr President, a journalist, Mr Akbar Ganji, and a lawyer, Mr Nasser Zarafshan, are being detained in extremely critical conditions in Iran."
"You are going to receive a precise update on the situation concerning them and I should like you, on behalf of Parliament, to contact the competent authorities in order to request their release on medical grounds."
"All of the large humanitarian organisations are doing so, as is the Nobel Peace Prize."
"It would therefore be a significant step for our Parliament, through your voice, to intervene in support of the release of these two intellectuals."
"Mr President, last week five farmers were thrown into jail in Ireland because they resisted the laying of a potentially dangerous gas pipeline through their land and close to their homes."
"The five men were sent to prison because they refused to give assurances that they would not obstruct work on their land."
"These men have legitimate concerns and we should share those concerns on environmental grounds."
"The Shell-led multinational consortium, including Marathon and Norwegian Statoil, intend to place a pipeline across residential land and beside homes, without an independent safety audit being carried out."
"We see multinational companies with no regard for local communities or the environment and a compliant government that allows these potential hazards to communities."
"Local people argued that the pipeline should be laid out to sea."
"The pipeline operation has not been shown to comply with the necessary safety precautions."
"Mr President, I wish to express my sincere gratitude – and, I am sure, all European parliamentarians from the Baltic States will join me – for your recent statement commemorating the 65th anniversary of the occupation of our three sovereign states in 1940 by the totalitarian Soviet Union."
"The truth about that should be made known and remembered by everybody, and even recognised by some with a feeling of apology, as it was such a bloody and long-lasting tragedy."
"The memory calls for justice."
"Therefore, I am sure that a new special Nuremberg process or a special Hague Tribunal will also be established for Soviet war crimes and their perpetrators."
"Let many among us here share this hope: the hope in the future of having a Russia of shared values."
"Mr President, I wish to ask you to raise urgently with the United Kingdom Government the issue of its failure to properly and fully carry out its obligations under the Euratom Treaty and European directives on nuclear safety."
"Persistent failures at the BNFL Sellafield nuclear facility put at risk the health and wellbeing of those who work there, their surrounding communities and those living on the east coast of Ireland."
"Recently, it was revealed that, over a period of eight months from August 2004 to April 2005, 83 000 litres of radioactive material containing 20 tonnes of uranium and plutonium leaked unnoticed from a broken pipe into a containment tank."
"This is not an acceptable level of safety in an industry where safety failures can have catastrophic outcomes."
"Mr President, approximately 58 000 people die each year in the European Union as a result of suicide or self-inflicted injury."
"This figure is far higher than the number of people killed in traffic accidents."
"The Commission’s Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection published a paper last year on the state of mental health in the European Union."
"One of the important points to emerge from the research was that, with the exception of Ireland, the elderly have the highest suicide rates in the population."
"Suicide rates increase with age."
"Since the number of people who reach old age is increasing, the absolute number of suicides is expected to rise."
"We know that the majority of suicide cases are linked to mental health, particularly depression."
"One might also think that there would be a relationship between suicide and major economic factors such as unemployment and poverty levels."
"The Commission’s paper acknowledges that, even though standardisation of most mental health instruments has been completed through many studies, definition of mental health states is one of the most difficult tasks."
"Therefore it is always difficult to interpret any differences."
"Would it now be prudent to establish a central European register for suicide cases so that an EU-wide analysis of data could take place?"
"We could thus try to identify the causes and trends of this terrible phenomenon and see which Member States’ best practice could be benchmarked in the other Member States."
"Mr President, Mr Hans-Peter Martin, a non-attached Member of this House, is now, in the Austrian media, delivering himself of sweeping, foul, unqualified insinuations and slurs, aimed no longer only at this House and the European Union’s institutions, but also at those who assist us in our work as Members and the officials of the European Parliament."
"Among other things he has written in a daily newspaper, I will quote the following: ‘The assistants, mainly young graduates, quickly get used to a three-day week, enticed, seduced and spoiled by Brussels.’"
"He goes on in similar vein, as follows: ‘In this place, heaven help any MEP who expects hard work; practically all of them find it far beyond them."
"Performance and responsibility are not in their vocabulary; sloppiness comes as standard."
"Most of all, the staff can neither concentrate nor see things through.’"
"I firmly repudiate these sweeping denigrations of our staff and of the staff of this House."
"I wish to thank all our staff, without whom we would not be able to make such a good job of serving the people, and without whom we would be unable to cope with so many parties of visitors and so much legislative work."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last week, the Council adjourned the vote on the directive introducing a uniform drivers’ licence across the EU, and this decision I regard as extremely irresponsible, short-sighted, and, indeed, incomprehensible."
"One reason why many members of the public reject the EU is that they believe that it lays down rules and regulations on everything, conceivable and inconceivable, but to put on ice, for fear of prompting even more Euro-scepticism, a directive that makes the roads safer, strikes me as utterly, excessively rash as a course of action."
"I also see it as betraying a communications failure on the part of the ministers responsible for the delay, who did not attempt to communicate the directive’s significance and purpose to the public, and perhaps did not have the nerve to do so."
"This directive could do a great deal to put a stop to ‘driving licence tourism’ and make the roads a good deal safer."
"An Austrian government minister – the transport minister, in fact – recently gave it as his opinion in an Austrian newspaper, that the European people should not be treated in such a condescending manner."
"That, though, is precisely what the Council is doing with this decision and the minister in question was one of those responsible for it doing so."
"Mr President, one of our colleagues and a fellow Member of the European Parliament, Dr Filip Adwent, has passed away."
"He died together with his parents and daughter following an accident which occurred in unexplained circumstances."
"I should like to take this opportunity today to share my memories of our dear colleague, who was a magnificent, honest and good-natured man, as well as a social activist and a patriot."
"It is fitting that I should say these words before the European Parliament in Strasbourg, as this was the city of his birth and his home for 40 years."
"I should like to express my sorrow at his death."
"I should also like to say that Dr Filip Adwent was a fine example of a believer."
"He had discovered the priceless evangelical jewel that is love for one’s homeland, and this love filled his life with new value and meaning."
"He left the fine city of Strasbourg for Poland, motivated by a desire to serve the homeland of his ancestors, and disregarding not only the many objections, but also the distance separating the two countries and the affluent life he led here."
"In the belief that life changes but never ends, let us pray that Mr Filip Adwent and those closest to him enjoy eternal life."
"Mr President, Africa has featured a lot today in the debate, and rightly so."
"Last Saturday, the people of the world – in particular the young people – called on the G8 nations to sort out the economic problems of Africa. Live 8 was a tremendous success."
"Hopefully, the collective will of the young people in particular will be listened to at Gleneagles."
"However, Africa has more than economic problems: it has political and human rights problems."
"In particular I refer to Zimbabwe."
"Mobutu has already been mentioned; we have had Amin and Bokassa."
"We now have another dictator in Mugabe: not content with the purge of white farmers, he has now turned on the black population, who have been uprooted from the land and are living in hovels with no food."
"We are now facing another human catastrophe in Africa."
"The United Nations wrings its hands, the EU has stood back, but South Africa – the model of peaceful ethnic resolution – surely should take the lead."
"That is why I am heartened by the fact that Thabo Mbeke has met with Morgan Tsvangirai, the head of the opposition in Zimbabwe."
"I would like to draw the House’s attention to one statement in particular: Zimbabwe’s police chief said yesterday that they must rid their country of ‘the crawling mass of maggots’."
"What an indictment of his own people."
"We must act."
"Mr President, during the dramatic hours of the battle conducted by Luxembourg, in the course of the Summit, six new Member States – Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia and Hungary – proposed a compromise aimed at reducing the aid granted to them, in order to save the 2007-2013 budget."
"It was neither a purely symbolic gesture, nor a sacrifice: as new Member States, it was in fact entirely in our interests for a budget to be adopted for that period."
"Without that new budget, Europe as a whole would lose out, but the biggest losers would be the ten new Member States."
"We continue to contribute to drafting a compromise for the budget."
"The Budapest solution proposed by the Prime Minister of Hungary, Ferenc Gyurcsány, is working towards the same objective."
"It is not a question of a new budget but of a kind of ‘lifebelt’, based on the proposal of the Luxembourg Presidency and intended to save this year’s budget."
"If it is unable to reach a compromise, the Council will thus have to draft a three-year budget."
"Mr President, the European Union, or more precisely Poland and Lithuania, shares borders with Russia."
"The region of Russia in question, which was formerly known as Królewiec (Königsberg), has been called Kaliningrad for several decades."
"A much-publicised ceremony recently took place there, yet although the highest representatives of France and Germany, or in other words the French President and the German Chancellor, played a prominent part in proceedings, the EU Member States of Poland and Lithuania were not invited."
"Kaliningrad is a symbol of Russia’s imperialist policies."
"To tell the truth, I have no idea what kind of message these top EU leaders were trying to convey, given that they committed themselves to a common foreign policy for the European Union in the draft Constitution."
"There is no indication whatsoever that such a policy is in fact being pursued."
"The general reaction to gestures of this kind is one of complete incomprehension, since they not only misrepresent the historical significance of this region, but also give the lie to the idea of a genuine community of interests."
"Mr President, a written declaration on rheumatic diseases has been put out today for Members of this House to sign. It is one that I urge you and all Members of this House to support."
"The reason why I am doing this is that rheumatic diseases affect 50% of the European Union’s population, and 50% of those treated for them will become unemployed within ten years, accounting also for 450 million days of paid sick leave in Europe every year."
"This adds up to a heavy burden on our social security and health systems and is also an obstacle to our achieving the essential Lisbon goals."
"I therefore urge you to support this declaration, which calls for the Commission to acknowledge once and for all that rheumatic diseases are among the major diseases and should therefore be included in a special category in the Seventh Research Programme."
"– Mr President, trafficking in women and children as commodities from third countries within the Union for the purpose of sexual exploitation and forced labour is a constantly burgeoning phenomenon."
"The situation, which has taken on the proportions of a scourge, has preoccupied the Union and the institutions responsible without, however, achieving any substantial reduction in absolute numbers."
"In Greece in particular, we have hundreds of children arriving illegally every year, children who do not enjoy any of the rights which adult refugees enjoy, who are housed in mixed centres for both minors and adults, who are detained beyond the stipulated three-month limit and who have no care once they are released."
"The lack of systematic identification and recording of minors, the lack of information about their rights in a language which they can understand is reflected in the fact that asylum has not been granted to a single child in recent years."
"Hundreds of them are roaming around and few reach non-governmental organisations."
"The modern slave trade, which moves 40 000 women and children a year in Greece alone, must be given our attention and addressed."
"Mr President, the week before last we were addressed by the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair."
"Mr Blair knows that the European project is in crisis."
"He knows that further political integration cannot be sold to the peoples of Europe, still less the British, unless there are at least some cosmetic changes to the worst excesses of the budget."
"We in Britain have endured New Labour for the last eight years."
"Now it is your turn to endure New Europe at least for the next six months."
"Mr Blair hopes that he can reform the European Union in order to make it more palatable to the people."
"He will learn the same lesson as Mrs Thatcher did, namely that the European Union is unreformable."
"It is likely that it will be even more apparent to the British people at the end of the British Presidency that the British Government should adopt UKIP’s policy of unconditional withdrawal."
"Mr President, before we go off on the summer break I wanted to talk about a problem that has arisen in my country."
"The problem is that, after nine years of refusing to sign a border agreement with Estonia, Russia finally did so last month, but the Estonian Parliament, following typical parliamentary procedure, added a unilateral non-binding declaration saying that the legal continuity of the State is enforced even when territory is given up."
"The Russians have now said they are going to withdraw from the border treaty."
"This is a problem not just for Estonia but for Europe as well, because the border between Estonia and Russia is also the border between Europe and Russia."
"Since everyone is about to go off on vacation and the Council will not be dealing with this until September, I thought it would be appropriate to raise the issue at this point."
"Mr President, the way Members of this House are treated at European summits has for years been a cause of annoyance, and this last summit in Brussels was no exception."
"The simple fact is that the bunker mentality in the Justus Lipsius building is so pronounced that nobody – not even the media – can make contact with the representatives of the people."
"A number of passes were issued to us."
"I heard that three chauffeurs got passes, whilst three Committee chairmen – of the Committees on the Budget, Citizens’ Freedoms and Constitutional Affairs – could not get in at all."
"I would ask you to devise a system for future summits enabling representatives from this House to get access to these events."
"We shall review the system we are using in a manner that is satisfactory to everybody, but the number of passes is limited by the Council."
"The Presidency distributes those available amongst the political groups."
"We shall examine the issue in light of what you have said in your speech."
"I wish to inform this House that during this week the Maltese Parliament will be adopting a resolution to ratify the European Constitutional Treaty."
"By this vote, which is expected to be unanimous, Malta will be aligning itself with the eleven other countries that have already ratified the European Constitution."
"For Malta, though, the ratification of the European Constitution has a very particular meaning, as this will be the first time that the two major parties in Malta will have joined together in voting the same way on an EU issue."
"After fifteen years in which Malta has been divided by the issue of the European Union, and by whether or not it should become a member, this week will at last see this division healed as soon as both sides of the Maltese Parliament vote in favour of the European Constitution."
"In this way the European Constitution means, for Malta, not only a step towards European unity, but also a new chapter of national consensus in Malta about Europe."
"Thank you."
"That concludes this item."
"The next item is the report (A6-0210/2005) by Mrs Wallis on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs on the request for defence of the immunity and privileges of Mr Bossi (2004/2101(IMM))."
"Mr President, we are dealing here with four cases referred to us by the Italian authorities concerning the immunity of Mr Umberto Bossi and whether this House should lift that immunity or not."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has considered these four cases over a long period of time and is now in a position to make recommendations to the House."
"Parliamentary immunity is of course a matter for this Parliament, it is not for us as Members."
"It is to protect the institution as we carry out its proper work and it is therefore a very serious matter."
"With regard to Mr Bossi’s cases, I will approach them separately with reference to the name of the court from which they have been referred."
"First of all, there is one case which I think provided us with very little difficulty or discussion."
"That is referred from the Milan court. It refers to an incident where Mr Bossi actually used physical violence."
"In that particular instance, we felt, as a committee, that this was not a proper instance for us to be, as it were, protecting immunity."
"If a Member uses force or violence, then that is not something that is a proper carrying-out of the duties of this House and therefore we were unanimous that the immunity should be lifted in that case."
"There then follow two other cases which are perhaps more difficult and more complicated to get to grips with."
"They are referred respectively from the courts of Brescia and Bergamo."
"Both these instances refer to speeches made by Mr Bossi on various occasions but speeches where, on one interpretation, he appears to be using inflammatory language which could be encouraging other citizens to act in a way that perhaps would not be appropriate."
"Clearly, this House would wish to protect the freedom of expression of its Members when they are carrying out their duties and their right to speak freely as politicians, and in this respect we have to consider Rule 9 of our Rules of Procedure."
"However, this must be viewed against the background of the fact that in both these cases, the Italian authorities – the parliamentary authorities – had come to the conclusion that in Italian terms Mr Bossi’s immunity should be waived."
"However, the Legal Affairs Committee felt, taking everything into account, that it was right in these two cases to maintain Mr Bossi’s immunity."
"These were rather difficult cases for us to consider, but that was the final recommendation of the committee."
"All three cases involved prosecutions by the Italian authorities."
"The fourth case, on the face of it, again seemed to be straightforward."
"This involved civil proceedings between Mr Bossi and another Italian politician."
"It appeared to be presented to us on the basis that it was the other politician who was taking proceedings against Mr Bossi on the basis of words that he had spoken."
"On that basis, we were prepared to accept that the immunity should be maintained."
"It was, however, pointed out to me over the weekend that in fact Mr Bossi was the plaintiff in this action and the action was introduced by the other party as a counterclaim."
"I have a concern that in this instance, therefore, Mr Bossi does not come to us, as we would say under English law, with clean hands."
"The result of the committee vote was that we should maintain the immunity, but perhaps, we should bear in mind the type of litigation here, where it appears that the plaintiff himself is trying to use the immunity of this House in a manner which may be questionable."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say, first of all, how very grateful I am to Mrs Wallis for her report."
"Having said that, though, please permit me to say something quite fundamental."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs discusses immunity issues ."
"As a rule, these are highly sensitive matters concerning individual Members personally."
"As I think it would be wise for this House to dispense with public debates on these immunity issues, I shall say nothing about the substance of this case, but will limit myself to stating that my group endorses the position taken by the rapporteur in her report."
"At the same time, I will point out that the same applies in the case of Mr Marchiani, on which Mr Speroni is the rapporteur, which we will be dealing with next;"
"I am aware that, by doing so, I am contravening this House’s Rules of Procedure and so you are welcome to strike my intervention from the record."
"I would also ask that this debate be conducted briskly and with dispatch, as Mr Trichet has already been waiting here for over an hour, and we do, I think, have more important things to do than going on in public about Members’ private affairs."
". Mr President, I, too, would like to say how surprised I am that we are actually debating these immunity cases."
"My recollection is that we have always, in the past, had a different way of doing these things."
"I would like to thank Mrs Wallis for considering these cases with such care."
"If you are going to read these documents and find out to what depths some Italian politicians sink, you will need a pretty strong stomach."
"I share her view, which we, in Committee, also endorsed in Case 3, which is due to be heard by a court in Milan."
"I believe that the cases to be heard in Brescia and in Bergamo are on the borderline, and involve a Member of this House using his immunity to the utmost, even to the detriment of others."
"Although I regard that as being as far as one can go, I would say that this case is an example of the rule that the accused enjoys the benefit of the doubt."
"Turning to Case 4, which the Committee on Legal Affairs found particularly problematic, I would be particularly appreciative if we could again review our opinion and our recommendation."
"I believe this to be a case in which the machinery of protection that this House has at its disposal is being improperly used."
"As a whole, not only this case but also the next, show the urgent need for revision of the laws on immunity."
"My saying that absolves me of the need to say anything about the next case."
"We do indeed hope that the Statute will bring this about, for I do believe that the current regulations are too vague, in that they fail to protect those Members who need protection, while allowing others to exploit the system."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0208/2005) by Mr Speroni on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs on the request for defence of the immunity and privileges of Mr Marchiani (2004/2105 (IMM))."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out that immunity, over and above safeguarding the parliamentary symbol, safeguards Parliament and the parliamentary function within it."
"I would therefore not make such a personal case of it."
"As regards Mr Marchiani, however, I am genuinely appalled by the ruling of the French Court of Cassation, which completely repudiates the Protocol of 1965 on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Community, stating that the rules on the issue that apply to Members of the European Parliament are not the same as those that apply to members of national parliaments."
"As that was a patent example of a failure to apply the law, the Committee on Legal Affairs instead upheld the legitimacy of applying the rules of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities, in accordance with which the same procedures that are applicable to members of national parliaments apply to Members of the European Parliament."
"It was on that basis that the report that I recommend to this plenary session was drafted."
"No other Members have asked to speak."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the report by Mr Lauk on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (A6-0203/2005) on the 2004 Annual Report of the European Central Bank (2005/2048(INI))"
"and on the report by Mr Maaten on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (A6-0197/2005) on the implementation of an information and communication strategy on the euro and Economic and Monetary Union (2005/2078(INI))."
". Mr President, I would like to make a number of comments on the European Central Bank’s annual report."
"Perhaps I might begin with the general observation that the report is agreeably presented and is worth reading."
"What is particularly pleasing is that various sections are clearly distinguished from each other, and that complex financial matters are discussed in readily accessible language."
"This makes it possible for the subject matter to reach a wider audience."
"If I may turn to the substance of the report, I will start by saying – and I am glad that the President of the ECB is here to hear me say this – that the Bank has, overall, acted throughout a difficult year with a great deal of acumen."
"In the first half of the year, there was evidence of slight growth, with inflation expected in the medium and longer term, whilst the opposite happened in the second six months."
"Mid-year, the ECB was generally successful in resisting the temptation to raise interest rates, opting instead to keep them stable."
"Last year was not only a year in which we experienced price stability, but also one of ten in which the global economy grew by an average of 3.7%."
"The only sad thing is that Europe has cut itself off from this growth."
"As the ECB itself points out, poor economic growth is not least the result of the Member States’ failure to make the structural reforms that are necessary, and cannot therefore be blamed on the ECB, which, contrariwise, points out that the Member States need to shoulder more responsibility in this respect."
"This makes it very important to note that the ECB has in fact delivered itself of a number of brief but clear and notable statements on the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"While the debate on this subject is at an end, and we do not have to have a re-run of it today, we should be clear in our own minds about the consequences."
"As a result of the new agreement, the criteria have lost their rigour, and this weakens the ECB."
"As a result of responsibility for stability having been returned to the Member States, its job has become more difficult in three areas in particular: it has become immensely more difficult to maintain discipline in the Member States, firstly as regards the size of the national budgets, secondly in terms of the way in which the state’s functions and outgoings are structured, and, thirdly, as regards the structure of tax revenue."
"What that means is that the greater laxity with which the Stability and Growth Pact is applied has enabled the Member States to achieve a renationalisation of responsibility and hence, in fact, to make it more difficult for the Bank to do its job."
"The ECB advocates the use of the preventive mechanism."
"It is very much an indictment of the Member States that they were unable, in good times, to strengthen the preventive mechanism; that is now a matter of necessity."
"While the Bank is in favour of this, it also warns against the corrective aspect of the Pact being weakened."
"It is for that reason that we have to consider the issue of enlargement."
"The ECB guaranteed that the integration of the ten new Member States would proceed without a hitch."
"Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia have been part of the European exchange rate mechanism since 28 June 2004, and were joined on 2 May 2005 by Latvia, Malta and Cyprus."
"One explicit demand that we make of the ECB is that, reform of the Stability and Growth Pact notwithstanding, the Maastricht criteria should continue to apply unchanged when countries join the single currency in future, and that there be no laxity in insisting on them."
"When countries join the single currency in future, the situation that we had with Greece and its statistics must be avoided."
"Our final request of the ECB is that its information policy, which is generally good, be further improved, for there is room for improvement."
"We welcome the publication of statistical information and the increased regularity with which it appears."
"Dialogue with the Bank is good, although one might well admit in private that there is plenty of room for improvement and that it could happen on a more regular basis."
"We do, however, urge the Bank to follow the US Federal Reserve’s example and publish something along the lines of its in future."
"Let me conclude by saying that last year saw the ECB taking a great stride towards the clearing of payments and the settlement of securities."
"The Target II system is up and running, facilitating automated real-time high-speed fund transfers across Europe, and hence opening up the way to universal real-time settlement in the Central Bank’s currency."
"This would in turn open up the possibility of a single system in Europe rather than a patchwork."
"The ECB has shown boldness in taking the necessary steps to this end."
"This report is complete in itself, and so I ask that it be adopted as it stands and the amendments that have been submitted rejected."
". Mr President, Mr President of the European Central Bank, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has made this debate on the communication strategy on the euro rather broader and turned it into a discussion of the euro’s current state and what we should actually do with it."
"After all, this debate is taking place at a time when the entire political debate on Europe is under pressure, something to which I do not think we can afford to close our eyes."
"I believe that many of us, certainly myself included, at the time when the euro was introduced in 1999, and especially in 2002, had the feeling that it would bring Europe closer to its citizens, who – certainly those in the euro zone – would be clutching Europe in their hands on a daily basis and would thereby be helped to have a sense of closer connection with it."
"I think that it has to be said, though, that this has not been the case."
"Not only in my own country, but also in other countries in the euro zone or countries that could join, I have seen that the euro has, in some cases, proven to be a millstone."
"This is something which I very much regret, but it is a conclusion that we have had to draw."
"That is, in actual fact, a crazy situation in the light of how well the euro is functioning, There are cheaper financing options available, the interest rates are lower than ever, which promotes investments and consumption and offers the consumer real benefits, for example in the shape of low interest rates on mortgages and cheaper loans."
"The ECB’s stricter approach to managing monetary policy has brought increased price transparency, and hence a stable environment for the euro and low inflation."
"Just look at the success stories of the countries involved in the 2001-2002 switch, where inflation was only 2.3%."
"The euro has given the economies in the euro zone increased resilience against financial crisis."
"Without the euro, 11 September 2003, 11 March 2004 or indeed the 2002 accountancy scandals would have caused far greater turbulence."
"That has not happened. We owe this to the euro."
"The exchange rate risk has been removed, travelling within the euro zone has become easier, all kinds of paperwork has become redundant, as well as the cost involved in exchanging currencies."
"Consumers benefit from the strong euro."
"Raw materials and oil on the global market are paid in dollars and the favourable exchange rate, in any case up to the referenda in France and the Netherlands, has resulted in relatively low fuel and food prices for European consumers."
"Trade has increased within the European Union: 10% across the board and 17% in countries such as the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium and Austria."
"I have not even mentioned the fact that the euro commands great respect on the international financial markets, as is evident from its important role as an international reserve currency."
"Despite all these successes – and I think that this shows that the euro may well be one of the EU’s most successful, if not most successful, project to date – we notice that many regular consumers do not seem to be in agreement with us."
"That means that we have a big problem comparable to that we encountered in the debate on the Constitution."
"To what is this attributable?"
"I think, above all, to the problem of inflation."
"Mr Trichet, in our monetary dialogue of 14 March, you said something I thought was very valid."
"I think that because we did not communicate well with the public about inflation, we lost some credibility in countries where the euro has now been introduced."
"I notice in contacts with citizens that this is nearly beyond repair."
"When I say: ‘Inflation has been very limited’, the response is ‘you are lying’."
"When I say: ‘yes, but there are statistical offices and Eurostat that can back this up’, they respond: ‘yes, but they are lying too’."
"Credibility is in short supply."
"It appears that we were unable to explain how inflation, which was real in 2002, has disappeared."
"Consumers were not born yesterday."
"Since we failed to explain to them what caused this inflation, everything is dumped on the euro."
"We have only ourselves, with all our institutions, to blame."
"This is all exacerbated, of course, by all the commotion surrounding the Stability Pact, and so I am delighted with the amendment on that subject from the members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has also tabled a sound amendment relating to the carry-on surrounding the ongoing failure of the Lisbon process to get off the ground."
"It is important that we should solve these problems, because the new Member States will soon be joining the euro."
"I think the report has been improved by the large number of amendments that have been tabled on this subject, also in the committee and by the Members from the new Member States."
"It is important that we strike the right note with them when the euro is introduced in those countries, but also with the citizens of the Member States currently in the eurozone, for it is their verdict that we will have to face."
"That is also the reason why I would ask the European Central Bank to submit reports to us annually – not to talk only in bankers’ jargon and in economic terms about how well the euro is doing, but also about what the euro has really meant for ordinary consumers."
"It is unfortunate that, according to the ECB, or at least to Mr González Páramo’s letter to me, this would entail a huge number of methodological problems."
"I appreciate that this may be the case, and this letter was also written before the current crisis."
"I would still appreciate it greatly if the European Central Bank were to reconsider this request."
"Speaking personally, I would not mind if the Commission were to intervene."
"It is easy to think ‘the euro is there, we have to put up with it now’. The responsible citizen refuses to accept this."
"It is a problem that we can solve."
"Given the way in which you, Mr Trichet, always come across to the committee, I think that you are ideally placed to solve that problem and, above all, that we – Parliament, the ECB and the Commission – would be able to do this quite easily if we joined forces."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour of presenting to you today the 2004 Annual Report of the ECB."
"The European Central Bank is aware of the crucial importance of its democratic responsibility and has always stressed that its independence must go hand in hand with a strict obligation to justify its actions."
"The ECB therefore attaches the utmost importance to holding regular dialogues with the elected representatives of the European citizens."
"Allow me to say that I listened with the greatest interest to Mr Lauk’s report and to Mr Maaten’s report."
"In my introductory remarks, I shall first review the economic and monetary developments in 2004 and set out our view of our economic prospects and of the monetary policy strategy."
"I shall then have something to say about a number of comments and proposals in the draft report on the ECB Annual Report for 2004."
"Allow me to begin with the economic and monetary issues."
"In 2004 the ECB’s monetary policy operated in an environment of gradual economic recovery in the euro area."
"Real GDP growth for the year as a whole stood at 1.8 %, compared with 0.5 % in the previous year."
"During the first half of 2004 economic activity showed relatively dynamic growth."
"In the second half, however, economic growth was only modest, partly on account of rising oil prices."
"As regards price developments, underlying domestic inflationary pressures in the euro area remained contained, reflecting subdued increases in labour compensation and well-anchored inflation expectations."
"While the appreciation of the euro exchange rate in 2004 contributed to lower inflationary pressures, increases in administered prices, indirect taxes and rises in the oil price visibly affected headline inflation rates."
"Overall, the annual HICP inflation was 2.1 %, unchanged from the previous year."
"Against the background of subdued domestic price pressure and a favourable outlook for price stability over the medium term, key ECB interest rates remained unchanged throughout the year at historically low levels."
"Interest rates remained low over the entire maturity spectrum, thereby lending considerable support to economic activity."
"As a matter of fact, our long-term rates are at their lowest level for 100 years."
"Fiscal developments in the euro area in 2004 were, as has been said by the rapporteur, far from satisfactory."
"The average fiscal deficit in the euro area broadly stabilised at 2.7 % of GDP."
"This is a level which not only implies a rising debt ratio which could become unsustainable, but also leaves little safety margin for short-term budgetary relief in the event of adverse developments."
"Discussions on a revision of the Stability and Growth Pact continued in 2004, resulting in a report adopted in March 2005."
"The budget implementation in 2005 and the preparation of the budget for 2006 both provide the first opportunities for all parties involved to rigorously implement the provisions of the Pact, so as to show that the Pact remains an effective framework for fiscal policy coordination and discipline."
"As the rapporteur said, everybody in this Parliament knows what was the ECB’s position throughout these discussions."
"Finally, 2004 saw significant revisions of past deficits and debt figures in a few countries, undermining the effectiveness of EU fiscal surveillance."
"It is of vital importance that the reliable compilation and timely reporting of government finance statistics is ensured."
"Turning to the crucial issue of structural reforms, the ECB welcomes and supports the renewed impetus for economic reform as a result of the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy, its stronger focus on growth and employment, and the new governance framework aimed at improving the delivery of reforms."
"The new Integrated Guidelines for 2005-2008, comprising both the new Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the new Employment Guidelines, should now set the stage for concrete action at EU level and by Member States."
"I shall now say a few words about monetary policy in a vast and diversified euro area."
"The magnitude of inflation dispersion across euro-area countries is similar to the dispersion observed in the 14 US Metropolitan Statistical Areas. In a monetary union inflation and labour-cost differentials across regions or countries are the natural way of adjusting relative prices in the face of asymmetric demand or supply developments."
"Such adjustments within the euro area have been larger and more frequent than anticipated."
"From that standpoint the euro area is more flexible than had been expected by many observers."
"Whilst generally adjustments of relative prices are economically justified, there are cases where inflation differentials may be due to inappropriate national economic policies and rigidities in labour and product markets."
"For these countries structural reforms are very highly advisable."
"I was pleased to note, whilst listening to the rapporteur, that you share our view that the regular dialogue is a very important part of the overall framework."
"The ECB is grateful for the suggestions made by the European Parliament and considers them with great care."
"In this respect, I can report that last year the ECB decided that it would henceforth publish its Financial Stability Review, in line with a proposal made by the European Parliament."
"I note that on many important issues the views expressed in the motion for a resolution are very close to those held by the ECB, such as the statements regarding the ECB’s monetary policy conduct in 2004 and the diagnosis that the relative weakness of economic activity can be attributed to lack of structural reform."
"Your position with regard to the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact was also very close to the ECB’s views in this respect."
"I also welcome the fact that the motion for a resolution compliments us for the work we undertook to prepare for the enlargement of the European Union, which marked another milestone towards an ever closer Union."
"The thorough preparations for this enlargement enabled the smooth entry of the ten new national central banks into the ESCB."
"We share your view on this particular point that the best possible preparation for adopting the euro is a high level of sustainable convergence, in accordance with the Maastricht criteria."
"Although there are many topics on which we entirely share the views expressed in the motion for a resolution, there are some issues where we have a slightly different opinion."
"The motion for a resolution urged the ECB to consider the publication of 'summary minutes'."
"Yet I must say we continue to see great advantages in the communication channels chosen by the ECB."
"The approach chosen by the ECB to communicate its monetary policy decisions to the public almost in real time facilitates expectation formation and thus enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy."
"The ECB approach has achieved a high degree of monetary policy predictability and has allowed long-term inflation expectations to be anchored at healthy levels."
"We have provided the European Parliament with extensive and up-to-date information through various channels and stand ready to continue to do so as regards the very important question of clearing and settlement."
"Should a directive on clearing and settlement be adopted at a later stage, these standards would have to be amended accordingly, if necessary."
"Let me also tell you that we have read with the utmost interest the motion for a resolution on the implementation of an information and communication strategy on the euro and EMU."
"Amongst the measures suggested in this resolution is for the ECB to undertake a yearly quantitative analysis of the benefits of the single currency for citizens."
"I am not sure at this stage that such a yearly quantitative report would be the most appropriate means, for reasons of methodological and data constraints."
"But we will reflect on all appropriate means to enhance communication on the interest of the single currency for our fellow citizens of the euro area through the widest possible range of tools at our disposal – press conferences, publication of the annual reports and monthly bulletins, and speeches delivered and articles published all over the euro area."
"Mr President, if I may, I should like to conclude by adding three remarks on Europe’s current situation, following the outcome of the French and Dutch referenda."
"First of all, the development of Europe has a rhythm of its own, which can only be evaluated with the passage of time."
"The European Central Bank and its President have confidence in Europe’s ability to overcome the current difficulties, and I fully shared the feeling of confidence and determination immediately expressed in the statement signed by your President, Josep Borrell Fontelles, and Jean-Claude Juncker and José Manuel Barroso."
"My second point is that the challenges and the opportunities offered to Europe at the present time by European and world history, demography, technology and the economy are so significant that they make it even more urgent to implement the necessary programme of reforms devised in Lisbon and relaunched in Brussels during the March European Council."
"On this issue, as on many others, I fully agree with the rapporteur’s conclusion."
"Finally, everyone can be sure that in the future, as in the past, we will fully adhere to our mandate: the draft Constitution does not comprise any changes to the operation of the European Central Bank and of the single currency, which are based on the extremely solid foundations bestowed upon them by the Treaty of Maastricht."
"Europe can rely on the European Central Bank and the euro system to remain, in all circumstances, anchors of stability and credibility, and on the ECB, within the limits of its responsibilities, to preserve confidence."
". Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mr Lauk and Mr Maaten, on the excellent work they have done on their respective reports."
"I believe that this Parliament’s decision to discuss them jointly this afternoon is a wise one, because it is clear that the present and the future of the euro are very closely linked to the activities and correct decisions of the European Central Bank."
"Both the euro and the Central Bank have been under attack over recent weeks."
"The criticisms made within the public debate have been logical and positive."
"If these attacks are based on a lack of arguments or on demagoguery, we must respond to them."
"I believe that this debate offers a good opportunity to respond to some of the unfounded criticisms levelled at the single currency and the European Central Bank over recent weeks."
"I would like to begin, like Mr Maaten’s report, by insisting on the advantages of the euro, on the positive aspects of the single currency since it was launched: it has given us stability in the face of possible monetary turbulence and crises, such as those we have experienced in the past; it has given us price stability, largely thanks to the correct monetary policies of the European Central Bank; thanks to that stability, it has provided us with low interest rates and protects us from risks which we must not assume are behind us."
"The euro allows us to deal with the risks that we were subject to before, but we must not forget that those risks may appear again unless we maintain confidence in, and the credibility of, our currency and our Economic and Monetary Union."
"It has been said that, during the two referenda held in France and in the Netherlands, some of the criticisms of the ‘no’ camp treated Brussels as a kind of ‘scapegoat’."
"They intended to criticise elements of the world situation or the strategies of the respective national governments, but when making those criticisms, they pointed the finger at Brussels."
"I have the impression that the same thing is happening with the euro and with monetary policy."
"The low growth of the European economies is not a problem caused by the single currency or by monetary policy; it is essentially a problem of the lack of structural reforms, the loss of dynamism, flexibility and the capacity of the European economies to adapt in a globalised world in which, for some time now, economic borders have not had the same meaning that they had a century ago."
"If we are to propose correct economic policies to our citizens involving strategies for progress, growth, well-being and employment, therefore, we cannot indulge in nostalgia for the past or focus on the wrong adversary."
"The past is not going to return and the adversary is not the euro or monetary policy."
"At these difficult times for the European Union, therefore, from both economic and political points of view, we must take particular responsibility for taking the correct decisions."
"I believe, as I have said inside and outside of this Parliament on many occasions, that the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, which has very significant support from this Parliament, is a correct decision that is starting to be applied rigorously, as President Trichet has just called for."
"Next week we will debate the proposed recommendations adopted a few days ago by the Commission in the Ecofin Council with regard to Italy; in the coming weeks we will do so in relation to Portugal and before the end of the year we will do so with regard to other countries: some of the founding countries of the European Union and also some of the new member countries of the Union."
"Those rules must be applied with credibility and energy, but also rationally, in order not to provide support for the arguments of those people who want to set economic stability and budgetary discipline against economic growth and job creation on the grounds that they are incompatible; they are perfectly compatible."
"Following its reform, the current Stability and Growth Pact allows that compatibility to have practical consequences in terms of the decisions adopted by the Commission and the Council."
"As President Trichet has just said and as the report says, we must strengthen the dialogue of the European Central Bank, whose independence must be respected, with the Commission and the Council and, in particular, with the Eurogroup."
"I have the privilege of observing the important dialogue held each month within the Eurogroup between the President of the European Central Bank and the Finance Ministers of the euro zone."
"We must deal with a very important issue with which I would like to end this speech the enlargement of the euro zone to the new Member States, which will be in a position over the next few years to join the 12 current member countries rigorously and at the same time taking a broad view."
"Over the coming months we will have to analyse rigorously, frankly and with full dialogue with the countries in question, whether Estonia, Lithuania or Slovenia — which were the first three enlargement countries to join the exchange rate mechanism in 2004 — next year comply with each and every condition laid down in the Treaty in order to join the euro zone, as their authorities wish."
"In this respect, with regard to information on the euro, I would like to inform this Parliament that, over recent months, I have begun a programme of visits, that will continue over the months between now and the end of the year, to all the new Member States to discuss in detail with their authorities, both with their governments and with the Presidents of their respective Central Banks, their degree of preparedness for joining the euro zone when the time comes."
"We have learnt a lot since the nineties: we can and we must communicate this experience to the authorities of the countries which will eventually join the euro zone and we can use these successive enlargements of the euro zone to explain to all of the European citizens, of the new and of the old member countries, the great advantages of the euro, and dispel some of the false ideas expressed about our single currency."
". First of all, before going into specific aspects of the communications strategy, I would like to thank Mr Maaten, the rapporteur, for his excellent report, and also for good cooperation."
"I also agree wholeheartedly with many of the previous speakers regarding the introduction of the euro in the old Member States."
"This was carried out at a time of reduced economic growth in the Eurozone, with insufficient structural reforms and with poor implementation of the Lisbon Strategy."
"This has indirectly had a strong impact on the negative perception of the euro by our citizens."
"I agree with Mr Maaten that despite the fact that the process of introducing the euro in the twelve Member States has been one of the most successful projects in the history of the European Union, the inhabitants of individual countries have a very different perception of this fact, and we have to acknowledge that with this process we have not succeeded in winning over the citizens, who regard the introduction of the euro as the reason for increases in consumer prices."
"This has evidently had a generally negative effect on public opinion of the introduction of the euro."
"How can we prevent this from happening with the new Member States, which are making efforts to introduce the euro soon?"
"Even now the predominant opinion in the new Member States is of the negative effect the euro will have on consumer prices."
"We will have to rely decisively on a more convincing, and in particular permanent publicity campaign tailored to the needs of each individual country and region."
"The new Member States should also make use of any experience, mainly positive, of the old Member States, particularly within the framework of twinning programmes."
"Although it is by no means a requirement, the Member States should find partners with whom to exchange their experience in spreading the good news about the introduction of the euro."
"– I shall naturally focus exclusively on the report by Mr Lauk, although I do believe that both can be discussed together."
"I shall begin by commending you, Mr Trichet, on the outstanding quality of your report and on the way in which the information has been set out before us, in keeping with the rapporteur’s speech. Yet I also wish to say to the whole House that that is frankly not the point of this debate."
"What Parliament is set to adopt or reject is Mr Lauk’s report, and we must therefore give our opinions solely on Mr Lauk’s report."
"It is abundantly clear to all of us that the main objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), as laid down in the Treaties in force, is to maintain price stability."
"We all know, however, that even within the scope of the current Treaties, the monetary authority is also responsible for fostering economic growth, for properly sustaining job creation and for boosting internal demand."
"The rapporteur has focused almost exclusively on the bank’s main objective of maintaining price stability, thereby overstating its importance; he has also sought to drum home, needlessly and , the institution’s position as regards the recent changes to the Stability and Growth Pact. In so doing, he has, in my view, put himself in a delicate and isolated position, one that we obviously cannot support."
"During the debate in committee, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament sought to remedy this shortcoming, but unfortunately the blocs that formed during the voting process prevented our points from being adopted."
"We therefore hope, in contrast with the rapporteur’s call, that these mistakes can be corrected in plenary. After all, there is no point in stressing positions and opinions that may be justifiable on the basis of one-dimensional economic thinking, but which say nothing to the citizens and which fly in the face of the day-to-day reality faced by businesses."
"The current EU crisis is not solely, nor even predominantly, an institutional crisis."
"Without any shadow of a doubt, this is a crisis of policies that have proved incapable of solving people’s actual problems, incapable of sustainably promoting economic growth and incapable of creating high-quality jobs."
"The constant refrain that economic and social success can only be achieved by carrying out structural reforms is looking increasingly like empty rhetoric."
"This is firstly because structural reforms cost money and are payable per head, which means that expenses are incurred before any benefits are felt; secondly, because the nature of national public finances is increasingly less predisposed towards public investment, particularly the least visible kind of public investment that has difficulty attracting party support in the short term; and thirdly, because the restrictive and blinkered implementation of budgetary consolidation policies blocks any kind of effort focused exclusively on this reforming area, which, given the crucial nature of this area, is clearly an inadequate state of affairs."
"To criticise the minor amendments made to the Pact by the Council, as the rapporteur does – and this places him alongside the most hard-line critics of those amendments – is, in my view, to overlook the wider picture in Europe and the EU’s economic and social problems. It is obvious that the ECB’s activities must be seen in the context of the absence of a European government model, which is a positive thing and is not the issue at hand."
"Mr Lauk attaches great importance to this – and it is indeed something that we can also think about – but what I am referring to is the conservative position, with which I cannot possibly associate myself."
"I therefore ask this House, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to correct some of the mistakes contained in the report by Mr Lauk."
". Mr Trichet, Commissioner Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, the story of the euro and of the European Central Bank is one of undoubted success."
"Despite political upheavals, the euro is proving itself to be quite stable, is becoming more and more a major reserve currency, and, as we have heard, the EU’s new Member States are keen to introduce it at home without delay."
"The ECB’s work has not exactly been made any easier by various economic developments in the eurozone and by political pressure, but it has nonetheless, from the very outset, maintained its independence and behaved in a professional manner."
"I would encourage the European Central Bank to maintain its commitment to independence and continue to regard the defence of the euro’s stability as its primary function."
"This, as you can see, is where there is a great gulf between the groups in this House, and Mr dos Santos and I are not of one mind."
"One reason why the conditions under which the ECB operates are problematic is that the reform of the Stability Pact largely did away with the second pillar of the euro’s stability, leaving the ECB with principal responsibility for currency stability."
"This House has proposed various ways of improving the implementation of the reform in practice, all of which the Council has disregarded, thereby indicating that, although the finance ministers may well not see the relaxation of the Pact as desirable, they do at any rate acquiesce in it with a degree of approval."
"Why this should be so is explained not least by the fact that the big countries in the eurozone – Germany, France and Italy – have been breaching the terms of the Pact for years without being called to account for it."
"Germany will be unable to comply with the Pact’s requirements over the next two years, and certainly not this year."
"As we have just heard, Italy breached the Pact as early as 2003, and it, too, needs another two years to get back in the clear."
"As I draw to my close, let me say that the ECB Board should avail itself of the option provided for by Article 10 of its statutes to take decisions by simple majority rather than seeking consensus at any price."
"Consensus often represents no more than the lowest common denominator, and the Bank should not be satisfied with it. I can well understand how, at a time of great political pressure such as the present, the ECB is unwilling to publish minutes, let alone records showing who voted for what, but I do hope that the day will come when the minutes can be published, along with indications of the way the votes went."
"Last but not least, I would like to endorse what Mr Lauk said about the need for you to follow the US Federal Reserve’s example and publish a containing a detailed analysis of the ways in which individual countries’ economies develop."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all of a month ago, in France and the Netherlands, people voted overwhelmingly against the Constitutional Treaty, with which vote they expressed, above all, their opposition to ‘more of the same thing’, more of the same neo-liberal policies in Europe, and, not least, their opposition to the so-called Stability and Growth Pact."
"What has come out of this Pact?"
"Price stability is only one facet of it; it has also brought mass unemployment and an immense increase in poverty in Europe."
"Rather than growth, it has brought blatant social breakdown; in place of stability, record profits for big business."
"Mr Lauk, however, in this report, is unmoved by either the social upheavals or the self-evident problems involved in the implementation of the Pact, and continues to sing its praises."
"Even worse, and absurdly, the report posits a link between working times in Europe and economic crisis, as if the problem would be solved if those still with jobs to go to were to work longer and longer hours, driving themselves to the point of collapse, while more and more people do not even get the chance to make use of their skills!"
"Those who understand European politics in this way and present it in this light must not be surprised when more and more people turn their backs on them."
"What the abortive constitutional referenda in France and the Netherlands clearly showed is that most Europeans want something else – new politics, with a social orientation."
". Mr President, EU institutions keep telling themselves that the euro is a success."
"If only the public realised what a success it is, euroscepticism would vanish and people would all come to love the euro."
"The problem, we are told, is lack of knowledge."
"Hence the drive to spend EUR 16 million on a communication and information campaign giving neutral and factual information."
"Unfortunately, the neutral and factual information is not likely to persuade EU citizens in the desired direction."
"All the large eurozone countries, and several of the smaller ones, are struggling with poor growth and rising government debt."
"The rules of the Stability Pact have been flouted all round and no honest observer can try to claim that the new flexible pact has any teeth, although the Commission has recently been pointing the finger at Italy."
"Yet we all agree that fiscal discipline is necessary if the euro is to endure as a multinational currency."
"So how do we measure success?"
"Easier travel, says Mr Maaten; lower interest rates, says Mr Trichet."
"But lower interest rates are more a response to poor growth than a sign of success."
"While the ECB must be applauded for its achievements with consistently low inflation, Mr Trichet’s deputy admits that the euro may have been part of the problem, accepting that the ‘one size fits all’ interest rate is not appropriate for countries with different inflation rates and business cycles."
"The euro has not succeeded in its aim of binding EU citizens in ever-closer union."
"The euro has not succeeded in forcing countries to adopt the structural reforms that are necessary for the long-term health of eurozone economies."
"Is that the information that will be provided under this initiative?"
"It should be, because that is what is relevant to people’s wellbeing."
"An objective appraisal would admit that in creating the euro the EU has tried to create a silk purse from a pig’s ear."
"It is now obvious that what we have is indeed the pig’s ear – perhaps not something we should be boasting about too loudly."
"Have we learned nothing from France and the Netherlands, where the efforts of governments to obtain a ‘yes’ in their referendums on the Constitution merely hardened opinion against it?"
"To spend money now promoting the euro would be foolish and irresponsible."
"It would also be typical of the head in the sand arrogance that we have come to expect from the European Union."
". Mr President, the European Central Bank fulfilled its objective of maintaining price stability and, in doing so, it managed to steer Europe through the many challenging economic and financial developments of 2004."
"However, the challenges are on-going and they are worrying."
"The consumers are bearing the brunt of that particular worry."
"Mr Trichet, only a few weeks ago you called upon European consumers to open up their purses and spend more, but there is not enough certainty in the current economic climate to facilitate the surge in spending that you call for."
"I speak for many of my constituents when I tell you that people purchasing houses are worried about whether the interest rate is going down, about house prices going up, when and where, and what the long-term outlook is."
"They are uncertain as to what the current hike in oil prices will mean, how long the side-effects will last and what to expect in the long term – their future."
"Last week, business confidence in countries such as Germany was on the increase."
"However, while benefiting from a fall in the euro, they were turning the other cheek within days to be hit with record high oil prices."
"Companies and consumers are finding it difficult to gauge whether their prospects are good or bad."
"Such an environment does not cultivate consumer confidence, domestic demand or domestic growth."
"The predominant risk to growth is the high energy prices."
"For businesses and consumers dependent on oil, that is detrimental."
"Our dependency on oil is proving too costly in every respect."
"We need to look at the long-term energy issue from the perspective of economic viability and sustainability."
"Dependency on any single resource leads to market vulnerability."
"Real energy alternatives are needed to combat this."
"Let us take the reform of the sugar sector, for example."
"Countries such as Ireland are to be badly affected by the reform of the sugar sector."
"However, we need to take initiatives both nationally and at European level to counteract the inevitable negative impacts on these reforms."
"Irish and European industries need to be assisted in turning a declining sugar industry into a profitable alternative energy source, such as biofuel."
"There are many fledgling industries, such as the rape-seed oil industry, that need to be financially promoted and supported."
"Such measures, Mr Trichet, will assist in creating economic stability, environmental sustainability and consumer confidence."
"All policies are interdependent and no economy should have a higher rate of dependency on any one energy source and no amount of increase or decrease in the interest rate can change that fact."
"Mr President, those who want power, who want to shape the way things are, must envy you, for you, right now, are guiding a vitally important vessel through heavy seas, and I am sure you are aware of the responsibility involved in that."
"I would like to join those who are briefly reminding you of a couple of mirages by which you should not allow yourself to be led astray."
"Particularly under the present political conditions, I think it would be mistaken to make too great haste in enlarging the eurozone."
"I think that the transparency of your own institution would be of great value particularly when difficult decisions have to be taken and it would be useful to know who had been on what side."
"I ultimately believe that it is the credibility of your own House that is at stake;"
"I suggest that you look at its structure, its superfluous positions and privileges, before they become the subject of public debate and your House ends up going the same way as so many others."
"Mr President, Mr Trichet, Commissioner Almunia, I would like to start by thanking you, Mr Trichet, for your work over the past year."
"At a time when the Stability and Growth Pact has been under fire, you contended in splendid fashion for the stability of the euro, facing down the Member States, the Council and the Commission too."
"For that you have the warm thanks of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which wishes to encourage you to keep on doing the same thing, for things are not getting any easier."
"The Stability Pact was softened up, loosened up, or – according to some – abolished; that is something on which I do not propose to comment right now."
"We are, of course, currently seeing to what extent it is applied, and what effect it has, in Italy, and there are doubts in some people’s minds about that."
"What has happened over recent months has not, though, done away with the risk of inflation, which has, on the contrary, increased."
"To Mrs Wagenknecht, who seems, unfortunately, to have a more pressing appointment to go to, and who spoke of ‘new poverty’, I would say that real poverty is present when money loses its value."
"As you, Mr Trichet, said, we should, in future, take constant care to require the reforms at national level, which are so necessary."
"I would have liked the Commission to respond appropriately when your own country’s Mr de Villepin proposed the eventual establishment, alongside the ECB, of an economic and financial government, which would be responsible for both economic growth and job creation."
"This is the logical second step."
"The first was to fundamentally change the Stability and Growth Pact or do away with it altogether, and the second step, now, is to give the European Central Bank equal responsibility for both price stability and other measures, not least for economic growth and job creation."
"I can do no other than warn of the need for the nation states to do their homework, for the most irresponsible thing we can do at present – and it is something I hear from members of the other political group – is to suggest to people that there is no need for change, that no more than a different policy on the part of the ECB is needed, and that social standards can remain as they are."
"That is irresponsible, particularly as those who indulge in this sort of talk, are those who ought most to be aware of the fact that reforms at national level are more urgently needed than ever."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the debate on Mr Maaten's report coincides with a period in the European Union in which the course of its institutional cohesion has been disrupted and in which many of the policies which form the backbone of its functioning have been criticised."
"The recession, slow growth rates, restrictions on social policies, rising unemployment, inflexible financial perspectives and higher inflation have led European citizens into an impasse or to some degree of difficulty."
"This has resulted in their voting for a different Europe, because they had been given the impression that bad Europe and the bad euro are to blame for everything."
"That is why this Commission communication and, more importantly, Mr Maaten's balanced report, have an important role and can send a message to the European citizens."
"The European citizens must be informed in depth about the contribution of the euro to their everyday lives and about the functioning of the European Union as regards financial prosperity, social solidarity and the organised and decisive implementation of the Lisbon Strategy policies."
"The analyses by the Central Bank and by the Commission may help in this direction. This revised communications policy about the euro should be clear to the new countries from the point of view of their integration into the eurozone."
"In order to improve the information and communication strategy, it would be better to emphasise the following points:"
"focusing efforts to make the single currency more popular on special groups of citizens, on consumers, on towns and on small and medium-sized enterprises, so that they have the facility to adapt better."
"To close, I should like to say that, in all events, the message which needs to be given is that the euro and EMU in general are perhaps one of the most successful achievements of the European Union and should be seen as such by all European citizens."
"Every difficulty and every new vision of the future of Europe must be based on its conquests, which must not be bartered away."
"In order to achieve this, we need properly informed and enlightened citizens and reliable Community policies."
"We must thank both rapporteurs for their reports."
"Although at first glance they perhaps appear somewhat different, they are united by one thing: now the European Central Bank's monetary policy and the euro are both the subject of intense criticism."
"It is clear that while the economic evaluation of these factors, that is, monetary policy and the euro, may vary, we must surely recognise that the communication strategy as regards the common monetary policy and the euro is really not a success."
"We ought to conclude that this communication strategy should be reviewed, and that this is particularly relevant now, during the on-going discussions on the future of Europe."
"Based on the experience of Lithuania, I can say that when you introduce any economic reform, it has a different effect on various groups of residents."
"Thus when we talk about Europe's monetary policy and the euro, we must appreciate that the effect of this or that decision will vary greatly depending on the group of residents;"
"I welcome the European Central Bank's intention to analyse the influence on resident groups."
"In addition, we ought to mention not only the positive aspects, but also the problems that appear in the short term when introducing one economic reform or another, as there is no such thing as an economic decision that acts as a miracle drug with immediate positive results."
"This means that while informing residents, it is also necessary to report problems, let us say when prices increase in the new Member States, as without doubt we are witnessing price convergence between the old and new countries."
"Thirdly, the information campaign and communication strategy must be of a permanent nature."
"Short-term campaigns are not effective."
"Every day we will be exposed to the influence of the European Central Bank's decisions, and every day we will use the euro and all those problems will be with us constantly, meaning that the process of explanation must be constant and active."
"– Mr President, the European Central Bank, which is a staunch advocate of the anti-grass roots policy of the European Union, the Maastricht Treaty and the Lisbon Strategy, has – in all the years it has been operating – been characterised as a grim executor of the interests of big business, to the detriment of payrolls, social achievements and the workers' standard of living."
"The incentive behind this policy is to strengthen the competitiveness of the monopolies of big business by reducing the cost of the workforce."
"The European Central Bank is the institution of the European Union which has full and exclusive responsibility for monetary policy and zealously defends its social indifference, maintaining that its sole objective is price stability."
"The price stability and low inflation in the eurozone cited by the rapporteur have done nothing to protect the workers, for whom they do not even apply, from high prices and poverty, which are increasing still further following the leap in the price of oil and the fall in wages."
"In the name of competitiveness and in order to respond to the demands of big business, a new anti-grass roots assault is under way in the Member States."
"A new package of anti-grass roots measures is being promoted."
"In addition, paragraph 11 of the report welcoming the commitment by the European Central Bank to the ratification of the so-called European Constitution is an insult, given that it was recently voted down by the peoples of France and the Netherlands."
"This sort of thing shows disdain at the very least for the peoples of Europe."
"The workers have run out of patience."
"Regrouping and stepping up their fight is the only way out if the contemporary needs of the working and grass-roots classes are to be satisfied."
"I am convinced that the introduction of the euro and the creation of the Eurozone is one of the best and most convincing demonstrations of the viability of the European Union."
"The European Union has become stronger, more stable, and internally more open."
"However, we must get used to the fact that for various reasons our citizens do not always react positively to new things, particularly if they do not bring clear positive benefits in the short term."
"It is said that good things grow of their own accord."
"In my opinion, this will also be true of the euro in the historical perspective."
"The older and middle generations may indeed yearn wistfully for the old currencies, but the younger generation will regard the euro as their currency."
"In the same way the younger generation will no longer be affected by the various prejudices resulting from the decades of a divided Europe."
"A stable and reliable euro will undoubtedly be both a condition for, as well as a reflection of, the fact that both the European Central Bank as well as individual Member States are conducting a responsible policy."
"However, an objective judgment is necessary."
"The European Parliament should not waffle on and delay amendments that have been duly passed on the first reading, which was what happened at the June plenary session, when discussing mechanisms for more effective control over the budget deficits."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, apart from the Court of Justice, Mr Trichet, yours is the least controversial institution in the European Union."
"It has a clear mandate, and you and your team do what is expected of you."
"For that we are grateful."
"You are predictable, consistent, reliable, and foster trust and confidence."
"Your policy is characterised by calmness and a steady hand, and all I ask of you is that you keep it that way."
"At the same time, of course, I also bid you step in when public statements, statistics or actions go against your convictions and the facts."
"As a global player, you need to do more to explain to the public the events that occur on the global stage, the ways in which we are dependent on them and their consequences for us, and I urge you to help policy-makers convey the objective necessity of structural reforms and the balancing of budgets, and the fact that sustainable growth and rising numbers of people in work are dependent on them."
"You, Mr Trichet, should have more input into information on what is happening in economic and monetary affairs, for awareness is dependent upon information."
"I urge you to keep on stressing the preventive dimension of the Stability and Growth Pact, to keep on denouncing every infringement of it, and to defend the flanks of the Commission and of the countries that remain stable as they go about their work."
"I would also urge you, though, to deter countries from running up deficits – if need be, by means of higher interest rates and poorer internal ratings."
"People need to know about the value the euro adds in terms of growth and employment, in terms of lower credit interest, about the ways in which it benefits the EU’s stability and the good it does in the wallets and purses of ordinary members of the public."
"There is a great deal for us to do, for public sentiment does not reflect the facts."
"Mr President, Mr Trichet, Commissioner, I believe that examining the annual report of the European Central Bank provides the opportunity to analyse the coherence of the monetary policy conducted on behalf of the entire eurozone by the European Central Bank."
"From that point of view, people are, however, today led to wonder about what economists call the balance of the policy mix."
"There must be a defect in this famous policy mix since growth has not materialised."
"With regard to the policy of the Central Bank, we have for a very long time been particularly attached to the need to establish the authority and legitimacy of the ECB and confidence in the decisions it takes."
"I would say that, in a way, this was an institutional quest."
"It appears to me that we must now reach the age of maturity and refrain from simply passing the blame on to the governments that delay in implementing the structural reforms, failing which we will not move the debate on."
"Progress is necessary, however, in order to rediscover growth and employment."
"From that standpoint, I should like to make three observations."
"Firstly, Mr Trichet, I am told that the quality of your listening skills and of your contribution to the work of the Economics and Finance Ministers of the eurozone is extremely high and that the latter are pleased to have you by their side when they debate the situation in the zone."
"I believe, however, that dialogue comprises an idea of reciprocity and that if you intervene on the reform of the Pact and on the required structural reforms, others must, in return, be able to tell you how things stand with regard to monetary policy."
"Secondly, with regard to the method of decision-making, I agree with the observations of my colleague, Wolf Klinz."
"In all likelihood, the method of decision-making laid down in the treaties is the right one."
"From the beginning, however, this Parliament has, as you know, requested transparency, or in any event information, concerning the nature of the debates taking place within the Council of Governors, and I believe that that request is a legitimate one."
"In the absence of the necessary information, in actual fact, one gains the impression that it is perhaps the absence of consensus among the members of the Council of Governors that prevents decision-making and that stops matters from developing."
"With your permission, Mr President, I will make a third observation in the space of a few short words."
"It is about evaluating the economic policy and the economic situation."
"The Central Bank is too obsessed with structural reform, without recognising that there will be no structural reform without growth."
"From this standpoint, the objectives in terms of inflation, as they were evaluated at the start of the period, ought perhaps to be reviewed."
"Perhaps you ought to begin consultations so that, in future, people have access to an assessment of inflation that is more in line with the needs of an economy that has to assume transition costs."
"These must not become the responsibility of future generations but, rather, be to their advantage, since, on the basis of a boost in growth, future generations will be able to fund the repayment of this inflation."
"Mr President, I would first like to commend Mr Lauk for his thorough report and also to thank President Trichet for his presence."
"Europe’s prospects for economic success are bound to structural reforms; many of our colleagues have mentioned this."
"In an economic climate characterised by unsatisfactory budget deficits and widespread unemployment, several points deserve special emphasis."
"First, we cannot avoid referring to the Stability and Growth Pact once again."
"The new framework for the future of the SGP has now been adopted; it has some good as well as some bad new rules."
"I would like to encourage the ECB to do its utmost to ensure that all reforms to the pact are interpreted correctly and increase transparency and efficacy along with expediting the structural consolidation process."
"It is important to remember that any weakening of the corrective arm of the SGP would render what was once a powerful mechanism for growth a casualty of flawed political judgement."
"Second, we can harness the energy of European competition by adopting and implementing the Services Directive as soon as possible."
"Likewise, vast benefits for citizens should compel us to push for full regulation of cross-border retail payments, and to work towards a Single European Payments Area by 2010."
"This is what citizens expect from us."
"Third, the reforms undertaken by national central banks to adapt their structures to the new institutional framework are paramount to reversing our current downward trend."
"I am proud to say the Bank of Finland – my own central bank – is one of the central banks which has made impressive moves towards reaching this objective."
"It has really tried to reform its structures in order to achieve an improved balance in the eurozone."
"Lastly, I congratulate the ECB on its sound decision to support ratification of the Constitution."
"The choice to integrate under a constitution can only lead to a stronger political union."
"This is what our voters in France and the Netherlands want, even though they rejected the Constitution; they still want more political union and the Constitution is one way to achieve this on the economic front."
"Mr President, it is sometimes hard to identify with the European Union, and the same is true in the case of the euro."
"The past and present products of our minds must be better communicated and discussed, and that goes for the euro too."
"Before it was introduced, there was a need for people to be persuaded; now that it is there, people have come to a positive view of it, and that needs to be reinforced and confirmed if it is to be sustainable and people are to identify with it, and that is what we want communications management to do."
"It also has to be said that, both before and after the event, prices in both currencies were, and are, among the most important measures to help with the introduction of the euro."
"Consumers’ organisations and the economic and social partners have a crucial part to play in this."
"At the end of the day, though, confidence in money and the currency will not be fostered merely by rattling off the reasons why price stability must take priority."
"It is when people find work and enjoy social protection that confidence is built up."
"I wish to thank Mr Maaten for the even-handedness of his report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by extending the warmest of thanks to my colleague from Baden-Württemberg, Mr Lauk, for his report, in which he has rightly drawn attention to the good work done over the past year by the European Central Bank and by you, Mr Trichet."
"Despite the apparent inflation, many members of the public see the euro as a success story, and, while I am on that subject, I would like to say how much I agree with Mr Ettl that it is certainly not price stability alone that brings Europe economic growth, but rather – as Mr Trichet pointed out – economic policy that responds to the present need for reform, and that is what we need to see at the national level."
"There is one point that the rapporteur addressed and which continues to be seen as a major problem by many members of the public, by which I mean the high costs involved in transferring funds across borders."
"I hope – indeed, I am sure – that the Commission will continue its efforts to implement a single payment area in Europe once and for all."
"Like Mr Radwan, I do not believe that we need a single economic government in Europe to witness the European Central Bank – whose independence is, as it must be, guaranteed – rendering an account of its policy to the ministers of the economy and of finance."
"It is my belief that the European Central Bank, by commenting on the relaxing of the Stability and Growth Pact, assumed a political role, which it is of course entitled to do."
"The younger generation in particular find it absolutely unacceptable that the Member States should, year in and year out, spend several hundred billions of euros more than they collect in tax, and that it should be a matter of European policy – through the alteration of the Stability Pact – that this practice should in some sense be defended."
"It follows that I am very grateful indeed to you, Mr Trichet, for not mincing your words when speaking about such changes to the Pact, and, with the interests of the younger generation in mind, I ask you to continue, in future, to keep a close eye on everything done in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact, constantly bearing in mind the needs of monetary policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Trichet, I can imagine how satisfied you must be reading Mr Lauk’s report, and I will not criticise you for being so."
"To begin with, the consensus emerging within this Parliament on the subject of the monetary orthodoxy of the ECB can legitimately fill you with glee."
"Then, by observing the extent to which Mr Lauk’s report falls into line with your recommendations and stresses the de facto political power of the ECB, you must be overjoyed!"
"You have nothing to fear from the representatives of this Parliament as they are zealous defenders of the solutions that you recommend and that have, however, with tragic consistency, failed to restore growth and confidence in Europe."
"So rejoice!"
"Mr Lauk’s report puts forward better proposals than the social security system reforms that you commend, better proposals than the pay restraint that you suggest, better proposals than the reduction in public spending that you oversee. It calls for an increase in working time in Europe."
"This is my first term of office in this Parliament."
"As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I have intervened on several occasions in this Chamber to express my concern, among the empty benches, about the poor economic and social results of the economic guidelines decided on by the Commission and by your institution."
"I note in passing that those on whom this report is going to impose the burden of additional working time have been more effective than you in fighting against the overvaluation of the euro by voting no, in France and in the Netherlands, to the policy that you support."
"I am a fervent supporter of Europe. As such, I am in favour of monetary stability and I defend with conviction a greater convergence of the European economies, but I call on you to acknowledge that there is not just one possible economic and monetary policy and to remember that the effectiveness of your term of office is first and foremost assessed in the everyday lives of Europeans and in what they have to say about their lives."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commission and Mr Trichet."
"I shall confine my remarks to the Maaten report."
"That the euro may suffer from a popularity deficit in some countries in the eurozone should come as no surprise."
"There are two main reasons for this, neither of which has anything to do with the lack of a communication strategy."
"First, the perception that the introduction of the euro has resulted in increasing inflation in Member States has done serious damage to its image, even though, according to official figures, only 0.2% of the increase is attributable to the euro."
"However, this macroeconomic average disguises large price increases in a long list of everyday items such as coffee, vegetables, bread, hairdressing and parking meters, largely due to opportunistic marking up or rounding-off during the changeover period."
"Second, our citizens’ attitudes to the euro reflects the economic situations in their own countries and their insecurity about their futures, pensions, jobs for their children and many other issues."
"Whilst the euro can help promote economic growth, it cannot do that on its own without sensible fiscal policies and sound economic management in each Member State."
"We urgently need to focus on economic reform, especially in countries with unacceptably high unemployment and abysmal growth rates, in order to deliver on the Lisbon promises and not just come out with the same old Lisbon rhetoric."
"The new President-in-Office, Tony Blair, in his speech to the European Parliament – and what a marvellous production that was; obviously the diplomats had got at him, or it, since the summit – rightly focused on this as a priority and on the illiberal so-called European social model, which protects the privileged and does nothing to create jobs and investment or increase economic growth."
"Any PR or information campaigns will be an uphill struggle, a waste of money and time, unless they are in the context of sound economic management."
"The euro will just continue to be the scapegoat for Member States’ own failures."
"When it comes to the Stability and Growth Pact on which EMU was founded, I trust that, under the revised and hopefully robust pact, the lack of even-handedness in chastising errant Member States will be a thing of the past."
"The credibility of our single currency and its public image and acceptance depend on all Member States adhering fully to it and the rules being applied evenly under the Stability Pact."
"It is no coincidence that the euro has been fully accepted in my own country, Ireland."
"It is true that we had a very successful changeover programme but, more importantly, we have 4% unemployment, less than half the EU average, and our economic growth is approaching 6%, three times the EU average."
"We are very willing to help new Member States with their changeover preparations."
"We already have twinning arrangements in place with Cyprus and Malta."
"In conclusion, the EMU and the euro are a most successful pan-European project for trade, travel and price transparency, and overnight the euro has become an international reserve currency."
"The euro can be the icing on the cake of sound economic management, but no amount of propaganda or spin can ever sell it on its own."
"Mr President, President Trichet, Commissioner Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the Annual Report of the European Central Bank as a demonstration of transparency, and its presentation and debate in Parliament as an exercise in democratic responsibility."
"During 2004, the year of enlargement to 25, interest rates have been maintained and prices have not changed when compared to the end of the previous year."
"There has therefore been a situation of stability, but also one of a lack of dynamism."
"The economic results of the eurozone have not met with prior expectations: there has been little increase in economic activity within the context of the greatest world growth of the last 20 years, market share has been lost in international trade and the productivity differential with the United States has increased, while there has been no significant change in the labour market."
"It is not just necessary to reflect, therefore, but also to make a great commitment: sustainable growth and employment are the main concerns of the Europeans."
"The reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is a good response, since it replaces a mechanical approach with rationality."
"At this time, Mr President, we wish to stress the European Central Bank’s special ability to provide financial conditions for everybody."
"We particularly welcome the reference in its report to the situation of small and medium-sized businesses and we would point out that, at this critical time when it is necessary to increase confidence in the common project, you will continue to enjoy our support in carrying out your duties"
"Mr President, I for my part very much agree that my country, Poland, should meet the conditions for joining the euro as soon as possible."
"At the same time, however, I am very much opposed to the idea of an EU-backed pro-euro propaganda campaign."
"This idea stems from the mistaken belief that societies are incapable of understanding the facts by themselves, and that they need the enlightened elite to help them do so."
"This belief has recently been discredited in the debate on the draft Constitutional Treaty, and I am quite sure that it will be discredited once again."
"I come from a region that is home to the largest German minority in Poland."
"These people travel to work in Germany every day, and they noticed the difference the euro made to their own financial circumstances."
"They do not live in a social vacuum, but communicate with their neighbours."
"What kind of theoretical arguments can we put forward that will override their personal experience?"
"How much money will we have to spend to convince them that prices would not rise if the euro was introduced, given that they have already experienced such rises once before?"
"I would call on the EU to admit that it has taken a wrong turning, and to abandon its attempts to use expensive promotional strategies, whether well or poorly formulated, to change the facts."
"Such strategies will not change people’s minds."
"What would change their minds, however, is a strong and stable European currency that needed no accolades."
"We should create the economic conditions that would allow the euro to become just such a currency in reality."
"Although the introduction of the euro was one of the most important events in the history of the European Union, mistakes were made; they were not small ones, and they resulted in a decrease of the euro's popularity amongst Europeans."
"We, as new Member States, have the advantage of being able to learn from these mistakes."
"First of all we have to see the effect on the cost of living; statistics do indeed show that the average cost of living only increased minimally with the introduction of the euro, but, as colleagues of mine have remarked, when one delves deeper into the subject one realises that there were substantial increases in the prices of objects and services which European citizens use everyday."
"Secondly, rather than focusing on superficial issues, a campaign on the euro should concentrate on consumer protection and on preventing abusive increases in prices, for we cannot allow the change in currency to become another occasion for a few irresponsible businessmen to take the opportunity to increase prices more than they should."
"Thirdly, where the adoption of the euro is concerned, there is a need for broad consultation between social partners."
"In Malta, for example, the decision that we should join the ERM2 now, was taken unilaterally by the government without any kind of consultation, not even about the base rate."
"This is the ideal recipe for further increasing resistance in the future."
"This is not how things should be done."
"I believe that the euro project is very important for the European Union and for the new Member States, but this should be done without unnecessary haste, for as they say, haste trips up its own heels, and from this haste it is only the poorer classes who suffer."
"Mr Maaten’s report gives us the opportunity to evaluate a number of benefits of membership of the Economic and Monetary Union as a prominent symbol of European integration and a means of bringing the people of Europe closer to the ideals on which the Union is founded."
"What makes it even more relevant is the fact that, on the basis of their undertakings in the accession treaty, ten new countries are preparing to adopt the euro as their legal tender when they have fulfilled the five main Maastricht criteria."
"Despite the fact that the benefits of the single currency and the accompanying mechanisms cannot be challenged, a certain segment of the European population take a negative view of the euro, associating it also with price increases."
"They are wagering on the sentiments of the inhabitants of 12 EU Members, which ultimately failed to come true."
"They also reflect the concerns of the inhabitants of three of the old Member States who did not adopt the euro."
"Even if I do meet some colleagues who are of the opinion that information campaigns are money thrown to the wind, the recent experience of the two unsuccessful referenda in France and the Netherlands make me believe that the architecture of the most important project of the EU, the European Constitution, foundered because of the lack of information."
"And a coherent, ambitious and long-term communications strategy about the euro can help us to get back in touch with the citizens and convince them of the benefits of the EU that they enjoy in their daily lives."
"The campaign needs to be clear and comprehensible, but above all straightforward and aimed primarily at more remote regions with limited opportunities for spreading information among the public."
"It should be aimed at people in employment and, in particular, at groups at risk, such as pensioners, the unemployed, people with disabilities and minorities."
"It should be used to explain to consumers the underlying principles, to prevent them from associating changes in price levels directly with the introduction of the euro – for instance, the introduction of dual pricing, and proper rounding up."
"In the spirit of the project of monetary stability in the EU, which is its most successful project to date, we should express our agreement with this report, so that the right procedures and know-how obtained in the previous introduction of the euro, explained in a successful campaign, also bring benefits in the introduction of the euro in the new Member States, as well as in the future enlargement."
"The draft resolution is of particular significance for those European Union countries that will soon join the Eurozone."
"At present, the members of the Exchange Rate Mechanism II are Lithuania, Estonia, Slovenia and Denmark."
"The first three countries have a good chance of introducing the euro and taking advantage of its positive merits in 2007."
"Lithuania and Estonia are the only European Union Member States whose currency has already been pegged to the euro for several years."
"For this reason, joining the single currency should go smoothly."
"Nevertheless, the rumours circulating that the introduction of the euro in the twelve states was followed by a large jump in prices may do some harm."
"Panic may be aroused unnecessarily by artificial demand for certain goods and traders' aims to greatly round off prices for their own benefit; thus, as described in the resolution, a timely and accurate information campaign is particularly important, as well as a study of both the positive and negative experiences of those states that have introduced the euro."
"The Twin model may help greatly, but with 18 months remaining until the introduction of the euro, as far as we know the three countries mentioned do not yet have partners in this Twin Programme."
"These states should be urged to find partners as quickly as possible and work even more energetically."
". Mr President, in one of the first speeches, Mr Klinz said that the introduction of the euro has been a success, and I share that view, as Mr Klinz and this Parliament are well aware, but I also share the concern of those people who have said during the debate that we must continue to adopt clear decisions and guidelines to ensure that it continues to be a success, because it is important to us, both as citizens and as defenders of the project of European integration."
"With regard to the conditions under which the euro was introduced, it is true that there was abuse, in some countries more than others, in terms of taking advantage of the change of currency to round up and increase certain prices."
"It is also the case that the countries that were more and better prepared were able to prevent practically all the kinds of abuse that took place in countries that did not sufficiently prepare their lead-up to the single currency through information campaigns, but also through negotiations with the sectors affected, through transparency by means of displaying both prices for a reasonable period of time prior to the actual introduction of coins and notes, and also through information during the days immediately following the entry into force of coins and notes."
"It has been said that both the European Central Bank and the Commission have studied the general impact of the abuse on price indices, which did not exceed 0.2% - 0.3%, but the negative perception of many citizens remains."
"I agree with Mr Doyle’s view that now, several years after the introduction of coins and notes, the citizens who express scepticism about the euro do so much more because of the situation of the economy, the increase in unemployment, the inability to promote investments or generate employment, than because of their memory of abuses that took place a few years ago."
"The issue of abuse must not be exaggerated."
"Today in the Danish press, the Danish Finance Minister, Mr Pedersen, says that in Denmark, a country that is not in the euro zone, the rises in the prices of certain services — bars, restaurants and certain services provided directly to citizens — during January and February 2002 were practically identical to the increases that took place in the countries that introduced the euro."
"So we must not exaggerate, but we must learn from experience, particularly in the case of the new Member States that aspire to integrate their currencies into the euro over the coming years, and that is what we are doing."
"Naturally, the citizens’ opinion of the economic situation, their confidence in it and in political and economic leaders goes much further than simply whether or not there has been abuse in the rounding up of certain prices."
"We have to talk about this, as we have done in this debate and as we will continue to do in others, about the implementation of the necessary structural reforms that we have discussed and that we are discussing within the context of the revised Lisbon Strategy, we must continue to talk about how to apply the Stability and Growth Pact and I referred earlier in my first speech to the Commission's commitment to apply the new Pact rigorously and I would like to ask some of you, who have called into question the possibility of applying budgetary discipline rules in the future within the framework of the economic and monetary union now that the Pact has been reformed, to take account of the reality of its application."
"We have been discussing how the Pact should be reformed."
"That debate is now over."
"The two new regulations have entered into force and we are now applying the new Pact."
"And I would ask the honourable Members to give their opinion on how the rules are applied rather than how you would have liked the rules to be, because the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact also depends very much on your opinion, and when some of your citizens or some politicians in the Member States hear some of you express the opinion that there are no longer any budgetary rules, they believe it, and I do not want certain Finance Ministers to believe that there are no budgetary rules."
"Thank you, Mr Trichet."
"You are always welcome in the European Parliament.The debate is closed.The vote will be on Tuesday."
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending for the twenty-second time Council Directive 76/769/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (phthalates in toys and childcare articles) (5467/1/2005 – C6-0092/2005 – 1999/0238(COD)) (Rapporteur: Antonios Trakatellis) (A6-0196/2005)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Germany we have a saying to the effect that ‘it will be worth it in the end’."
"When, in 1999, the Commission forwarded to the Council and Parliament its proposal for restrictions on phthalates in toys and childcare articles, it did not expect so much time to elapse before this directive was eventually adopted."
"It did not at first appear possible to bring together in a compromise the divergent views held at Council level, and so the Member States decided to defer their decision until a series of risk assessments had been carried out in accordance with Regulation 793/93."
"I do, however, think it is important that it be said that the children of Europe were not, at this point, in any sort of danger, as the Commission, in a decision under the General Product Safety Directive, had called on the Member States to ban certain toys and babycare articles containing the six phthalates in question, although this decision had to be extended on a regular basis in order to remain valid."
"It therefore gives me a great deal of pleasure that the Council and Parliament have now reached agreement so soon after most of the risk assessments have produced results and the relevant scientific committee has delivered its opinions."
"This compromise, which will serve as the basis for what will now be a permanent rule, takes the precautionary principle into account without, however, losing sight of the principle of proportionality."
"Speaking on behalf of the Commission, I would like to state that it is not minded to accept Amendments 22 and 23, on the grounds that they do not reflect the compromise reached between Parliament and the Council."
"In the course of the negotiations between the Council and Parliament, the Commission had offered to make two statements in order to facilitate the reaching of a compromise, and that I shall now proceed to do."
"The first statement has to do with the compilation of a handbook and reads as follows:"
"As soon as a directive on restrictions on the marketing and use of phthalates in toys and childcare articles has been adopted, the Commission, in consultation with Member States’ experts responsible for the management of Directive 76/769/EEC and stakeholders, will prepare a guidance document in order to facilitate the implementation of the directive."
"The document will address in particular the provisions relating to restrictions on certain substances in toys and childcare articles, insofar as they concern the condition “which can be put in the mouth”, as in the annex to the directive.’"
"The second statement deals with the use of fragrances in children’s toys, and reads as follows:"
"The Commission confirms its intention to address the issue of fragrances in toys within the framework of the revision of the directive on the safety of toys."
"This will have the advantage of identifying exactly what should be understood as fragrances, of considering the appropriate measures to deal with the risk identified and of ensuring consistency with the other provisions of the said directive.’"
"Let me conclude by congratulating Mr Trakatellis and the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council."
"Without the efforts both of them have made, it would not have been possible to reach agreement on this highly problematic and weighty matter."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council waited five years before delivering to Parliament its position for second reading stage, and I regard it as having demonstrated a great sense of responsibility in so doing, having waited for the results of the comprehensive assessment of the risks presented by phthalates, notably by DNP."
"The EU’s assessments of the risks of DNP do not show any risk as being associated with its use by all categories of the population including infants."
"Despite that, the Council, drawing on the study carried out by the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment, extended restrictions on phthalates in children’s toys to the age range from 0 to 3 years."
"The precautionary principle, on the basis of scientific results, was thereby sufficiently reflected in practice."
"I therefore regard the Council’s proposal at second reading stage as even-handed and realistic."
"It takes account of the need for our children’s health to be adequately protected and gives businesses in the toy industry clarity about their prospects."
"It is also a good thing that we have been able to broker agreement between Parliament and the Council, and so I am addressing my fellow-Members of this House when I say that I am not entirely satisfied either with the way this debate has gone or with the result that has emerged from it."
"Let me explain what I mean."
"For a start, the approaches we are currently taking are characterised by an excessive emphasis on the precautionary principle."
"What is the point of warning notices if there is nothing to warn against, and what is the point of bans on fragrances that are meant to neutralise smells?"
"If we carry on like that, we will end up as a breeding-ground for prohibitions and panic."
"Contrariwise, although hardly any deaths are attributable to phthalates, 380 people a day die as a result of smoking, despite which we have not yet managed to ban smoking from the sittings of this House."
"People puff away to the point where it makes one’s eyes water."
"Secondly, by submitting these compromise amendments, we are abandoning our most fundamental function – the drafting and enactment of legislation – into the hands of the Commission."
"What Commissioner Verheugen has said encourages me to have confidence in the Commission, and so I can do no other than urge continued adherence to the risk assessment with the Council’s position for second reading; then, I believe, we will end up with a positive outcome."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Professor Trakatellis, who, in my opinion, has shown a unique ability and a unique willingness to bring about compromises."
"I should also like to thank the Council, which has also exerted itself in some really basic areas, thereby showing that it takes Parliament seriously. It deserves to be thanked."
"Particular account should be taken of the fact that it is more than five years since this legislation was embarked upon."
"Almost six years have had to go by before we have been able to get such important legislation affecting our children’s health adopted."
"We are concerned here with carcinogenic substances and endocrine disrupters."
"This is an issue that affects everyone in Europe every single day and is very much on people’s minds, and yet such a long period has elapsed."
"I am therefore all the happier about the result that we have obtained and that is now before us."
"It is a genuinely positive result."
"Firstly, the three most dangerous substances are completely banned, and that is of course a big step."
"Secondly, we are to have the three second—most dangerous substances banned in all forms of toys that can be put in the mouth, and that is of course at the heart of this proposal."
"There are also other positive points, to which Professor Trakatellis has already referred and which I shall not repeat."
"I would, however, emphasise that this is a basic and significant example of legislation on which Parliament has stuck to its guns."
"We have not allowed ourselves to be influenced by the huge lobbying effort from industry."
"Industry has not been allowed to force through its position."
"We have maintained our stance that, in such an important area, it must be the precautionary principle that applies."
"Naturally, a sense of proportion must also be kept, but it is our children’s health that is at issue here, so the precautionary principle must be applied."
"On quite a few occasions during the negotiations, I could not help but wonder if I was hearing correctly – indeed, I almost had to pinch myself to be sure – when draftsmen – albeit only a few of them – spoke against this proposal."
"Our children’s health was at stake, yet people were unwilling to apply the precautionary principle."
"I also see that a number of amendments, to which Mr Verheugen referred, were tabled."
"I presume that there was a translation error, as I had understood them to be parts of the compromise that people were unable to support."
"These amendments are not part of the compromise."
"The compromise does not include the parts to be found in Amendments 22 and 23."
". Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I should like to take my turn in thanking Professor Trakatellis for his excellent work and for the quality of the compromise, negotiated with the Luxembourg Presidency, on the ban and restrictions on the six phthalates used as plasticisers in children’s toys and childcare articles, classified into two categories to which I am not going to refer again here."
"This directive concerns the daily life of European families and sounds the death knell for these six substances that pose a danger to health and to the environment, since they are reprotoxic and particularly harmful to the immune and hormonal systems."
"The scientific evidence is accumulating. I am not going to mention all of it here, but all of the signals are turning to red."
"It is completely logical that the ministers for trade and industry of the 25, in accordance with the proposal put forward by our former Dutch Liberal colleague, Jan Brinkhorst, in September 2004, wished to withdraw these six phthalates from the market."
"They did so on the basis of the recommendation of the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment."
"They also did so for practical reasons, as they know that a very large number of substitutes exist and are already on the market, such as citrate for instance."
"For its part, Parliament wished to strengthen the common position for two main reasons: firstly, because it made better sense since, from now on, with the compromise, no distinction is any longer made between a child over three years of age and one less than three years of age who puts toys in its mouth; and, secondly, because it is our responsibility as elected representatives of the citizens of Europe not only to say no to these phthalates in toys but also – if need be - to gradually regulate or ban all phthalates."
"As far as I am concerned, I believe that protecting the health of our fellow citizens deserves better than this fragmented ban."
"It is difficult for me to explain to the voters that, as we decree it, a dummy plasticised with DEHP is dangerous to newborn babies but that, on the other hand, a needle used for drips that contains the same DEHP is harmless to a premature baby."
"The danger is strictly the same."
"That is why this legislation must be considered as a first application of the precautionary principle to phthalates."
"The Commission, Mr Verheugen, has to act swiftly in the area of medical arrangements and in the areas of food packaging and floor coverings."
"That is the sound legislation that the people of Europe are waiting for."
". Mr President, it is remarkable that it has taken eight years, three European Commissions and eleven Council Presidencies for us to actually reach this point."
"It is long overdue, but we are at last able to take action to protect children from these high concentrations of toxic substances in their toys."
"Toys are meant to be fun and they are meant to be safe."
"Soft PVC toys containing hazardous substances are neither fun nor safe and that is why this ban is so important."
"It is scandalous that children’s toys containing phthalates could weaken the immune system, cause liver damage and affect the hormone balance, especially when there are other alternatives."
"I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur, Professor Trakatellis, for his work on reaching this agreement and I echo his call to Parliament to support the compromise amendments in the vote tomorrow."
"I am pleased that we have agreed on the ban, rather than labelling for children under three years old, which would not have been effective."
"The fact that this will cover all toys that can be put into the mouth is also vital as are the Commission guidelines on exactly what this will mean and what products will be covered to ensure the highest level of protection."
"We have heard about that from the Commissioner."
"I believe that this is a real achievement, despite the fact that it has taken so long and despite the lobbying by the industry."
"I believe we have come to the right conclusion and that this legislation will protect the health of young children."
"Mr President, I believe that the recommendation at second reading that we have before us is a success as far as consumers are concerned."
"It is a success in terms of children’s health and an extremely good example of the way in which the precautionary principle should be applied."
"Faced with practical warnings from scientific experts that there is a threat to public health, it is our duty as politicians to take action."
"An important reason why we have achieved this success in Parliament is that the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, was so tough and determined in the negotiations."
"I should like to thank him for the way in which he carried out this work, as a result of which we have been able to achieve this agreement whereby it will be possible also to ban the last three disputed phthalates in toys intended for children of between three and six years of age."
"There has been a lot of discussion in the committee as to how much scientific evidence is required for it to be possible to take a decision such as this."
"I believe that we have sufficient knowledge when a number of the recognised committees say that these products are dangerous and involve risks."
"We then have an obligation to take action."
"That is what is entailed by the precautionary principle."
"There is another aspect of this decision that I also wish to point out, namely that it is now more comprehensive because childcare products, for which there is quite a large market, are also included."
"It is important that we have successfully pushed this dimension through in the negotiations and that the products concerned are included in the decision."
"Obviously, the whole of our group will support the draft compromise with the Council of Ministers."
". Mr President, phthalates are added to products, especially those made of PVC, in order to make them more flexible."
"The many products involved are used as packaging, cosmetics, bathing accessories and, unfortunately, toys."
"These toys are squeaky, soft and particularly fun for small children to play with, which means that they often put them in their mouths."
"Research has proven that phthalates can cause allergies as well as liver, kidney and lung damage."
"They can also have a harmful effect on the endocrine glands, and are reprotoxic and carcinogenic."
"The rules currently in place, which ban the use of phthalates at levels exceeding 0.1% by weight in childcare articles and toys, go some way towards protecting children."
"They are an inadequate safeguard, however, particularly since the liberal economy and the laws of competition mean that legislative provisions are sometimes nothing but wishful thinking."
"The need to inform and educate people about these threats is a major problem."
"It would be preferable if products made from PVC were to be replaced by those made from wood, rubber, ceramics, leather or other natural materials."
"We should remember that the uncompromising reaction of any organism, and of babies and small children in particular, to any such detrimental compromise, is disease."
". Mr President, we have been warned by the World Health Organisation that global cancer rates could increase by 50% to 50 million new cases by 2020."
"With cancer rates across the world growing at this phenomenal rate, citizens are depending on governments for help, protection and information."
"Phthalates, as we now know, are used in large quantities."
"In some cases, a proportion of up to 45% is used to increase the pliability of toys or childcare articles made from plasticised material."
"I support the legislation, but before welcoming the compromise package agreed between the representatives of the European Parliament and the Council, which goes further by extending the ban of concentration in toys and childcare articles to children in general – as opposed to the original wording referring to children under three years of age – we must first obtain clarification as to the exact nature of the risk posed by DINP, DIDP and DNOP to children."
"I note that there are divergent opinions as to the danger they pose and would appreciate clarification to that effect as soon as possible."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, on the balance of this report and support the general call for more labelling and information for the consumer."
"I also agree that more research is required to take account of the exposure of children to risks from sources other than toys."
"In addition, we should certainly be researching into restrictions on the marketing and use on the European market of dangerous substances to which newborn babies, children, pregnant women, elderly persons, workers and other high-risk sections of the population are heavily exposed."
"In conclusion, we should also be encouraging the production of safer medical alternatives and encouraging their markets as they become available."
"The role of children’s toys is not only to amuse, but also to teach children and help them get to know the world."
"Toys should give children pleasure, and not harm them."
"And it is for the reasons of safety, and of not harming children under any circumstances, that I greet the report and would like to congratulate above all Mr Trakatellis, mainly for the fact that as a doctor he respects the rule of , above all do no harm."
"The report distinguishes between three toxic phthalates which should definitely be banned, and three others about which there are doubts, and which should be replaced by non-toxic substitutes."
"In my view there is little benefit in distinguishing between toys designed for children under three and those for children over three, because as a mother I know that often the older children play with the younger ones and with the same toys."
"It is important to point out that phthalates can enter children’s bodies not only via the mouth, but also through the skin, and can thus cause other illnesses."
"Furthermore, attention should also be paid to the toys that children put in their mouths."
"For this reason I propose that such toys be clearly marked, and above all that the phthalates that a toy contains, or its constituents, are marked on them."
"Using such unsuitable toys as toys for animals is not the answer."
"Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mr Trakatellis for his excellent work, and for his tenacity in pursuing this matter and achieving suitable compromises."
"Our absolute priority should be to protect the health and safety of children."
"This holds particularly true in cases where we have a direct influence on the issues that are at the root of a problem, and where we are in a position to take decisions and impose legal restrictions that minimise the suffering of our youngest citizens and the incidence of disease in this group."
"A policy of this kind would be proof of the EU’s good intentions, as well as being easy for the public to understand."
"Research and analysis have shown that toxic phthalates are widely used in the manufacture of children’s products and clothes, and that levels of these preparations greatly exceed the safety standards that have been adopted."
"Phthalates are chemicals that are added to plastic products, in particular those made of PVC, to make them more pliable."
"In the majority of cases, these are toys for small children."
"As rightly stated by Helen Perivier, a Greenpeace campaign coordinator, some manufacturers are fully aware that they are adding compounds that pose a threat to children’s health, but they fail to take into account that it is children who are most susceptible to the effects of these chemicals."
"For as long as governments fail to force companies to use safe substitutes, children will continue to be exposed to the effects of substances that can cause long-term damage."
"Research has proven that phthalates can cause allergies and serious kidney and liver damage, and that they are carcinogens."
"It has also been confirmed that phthalates have a negative impact on levels of the male hormone testosterone, which is essential for normal male development."
"At the same time, they cause other tissues in the human body, including those in the brain, to develop abnormally."
"Current regulations governing the use of such chemicals leave much to be desired, and immediate action should be taken to change this state of affairs."
"This is a major problem, and so it is to be welcomed that the Luxembourg Presidency and the European Commission have drafted a compromise proposal extending the ban on the use of phthalates to all toys that children could place in their mouths."
"The question of imports from third countries still needs to be resolved."
"Toys imported from the Far East have traditionally contained high levels of phthalates."
"Mr President, I am very pleased that we have this balanced compromise and I am glad that we have rejected the idea of a ban only on products designed to go in children's mouths."
"Anybody who has spent any time with young children and babies will know that they put anything in their mouths so that false division had to go – as did this idea of children aged under three and over three, which we discussed in our committee."
"I am very pleased that the common position has been changed and we now have a compromise."
"What swung it for me, when I looked at this for the first time in detail, was that there is an alternative."
"It is possible to use alternative chemicals so it is quite right that we ban these dangerous chemicals."
"I have a question for the Commission regarding the compromise talks about a review of the use of phthalates in medical devices."
"Does the Commission now have a timetable for that review and any idea of the scope?"
"I have been concerned about a recent study from Harvard which shows high concentrations of DEHP in young babies, new-born babies, who have had intravenous drugs, possibly because of the chemicals leaching from the intravenous tubing and the fluid bags."
"Finally, I would like to thank Mr Trakatellis."
"He stood his ground."
"He would not give in despite a lot of lobbying and I think that we have got a very good compromise."
"Mr President, the intention here is to take action to prevent harm to children and who could disagree with such sentiments?"
"Very few politicians will wish to speak out against such proposals, for fear that their words may be misinterpreted, but there is some concern that the link between the use of phthalates in toys and a risk to children has not been firmly established."
"Phthalates are dangerous chemicals."
"So are pesticides, but we still eat food containing them every day."
"Our actions here are guided by the precautionary principle and on balance I accept that its use is appropriate."
"None of us want harm to come to children."
"However, some of my colleagues feel this is the wrong judgement."
"They argue that the precautionary principle is being applied more on emotional than on scientific grounds, that harmful links have not been indisputably established and that this is an inappropriate basis for making legislation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that tomorrow will see the beginning of the end for soft PVC in toys."
"The existence of safe alternatives means that this start on abandoning softeners is long overdue."
"There were worrying results from tests in Germany on scoubidou cords and plastic dolls, and these precipitated widespread alarm by demonstrating a high concentration of softeners, although it does have to be said that they made it clear that the legislation already in place, which provided for checks during production, was inadequate."
"The European Toys Directive does not cover the softeners that are suspected of damaging the liver, kidneys and reproductive organs."
"Reference has already been made to the fact that the toxic cocktail is unleashed not only by spittle but also by fat in the skin and by sweat."
"Poisoning children in this fashion is no way to start them out on life."
"The ban on softeners that damage the reproductive system is a milestone in terms of the protection of consumers and particularly of children."
"I would like to see us venture a quantum leap in the second category too, for we could then demonstrate that the internal market is not just in the interests of industry, but also exists to benefit and protect children."
"Such hazardous substances as phthalates have to be taken out of circulation and replaced by safe ones."
"Phthalates in soft PVC, though, are no more than the tip of the iceberg."
"I hope that the Commission will produce, as soon as possible, a proposal covering medical materials such as infusion tubes and blood bags, for alternatives are available to these too, and here too we cannot jeopardise the health of children and the newborn in particular."
"Mr President, phthalates are used for softening plastic in toys and can harm foetuses, cause liver damage and impair people’s reproductive ability."
"That is why phthalates should be banned in all toys. The directive is concerned with six different softeners divided into two groups."
"It is proposed that there be a complete ban on the first group for children of all ages."
"That is a tightening-up of the Danish rules, in which the ban only applies to toys intended for children under three years of age."
"It is proposed that there be a ban on the second group of phthalates in connection with some, but not all, toys intended for children under three."
"This would involve a relaxing of the Danish rules, which impose a complete ban on that group of substances in all toys intended for children under three."
"The directive permits a limit value of 0.10%, compared with Denmark’s figure of half that amount: 0.05%."
"There is no sense in distinguishing between children under and over three years of age, for it is difficult for the EU to monitor whether baby sister borrows her big brother’s toys."
"In order to ensure a high level of protection, I have tabled two amendments involving a health guarantee so that we can be sure that there is a place for all the pioneering countries in the EU."
"If the proposal is implemented without a health guarantee, some countries, such as Denmark, will have a lower level of protection in some areas than they have at present."
"The 2004 ‘Chemicals in Toys’ project, which lasted for eight months with the participation of consumer organisations from nine European countries and the support of the Danish Technological Institute, came to some disturbing findings."
"The international research which measured the content of various chemicals in toys also produced something interesting."
"Of the 83 toys sampled, in just 15 were there no traces whatsoever of these chemicals."
"Among these 15 ‘clean’ toys, the majority, nine to be precise, were from a group of plastic toys that did not contain phthalates."
"Perhaps this was a side-effect of the ban on the use of phthalates introduced at the end of 1999."
"The industry has also replaced other chemicals in toys, since the regularity of the legislative direction could be approved on the basis of the precautionary principle."
"Mr President, we believe this report to be a step forward in the recovery of the future stolen from our children."
"The Trakatellis report on phthalates in toys represents a victory for the health of children in Europe, who have been suffering from their effects for decades."
"After years of insistence too many years the European Parliament has ensured that the precautionary principle be applied by prohibiting their use, a use that has probably already caused health problems for millions of children, as demonstrated by a recent Swedish study which, having analysed more than 11 000 children of up to six years old, concluded that their chances of developing asthma and various allergies are three times higher than those of non-exposed children."
"We are talking about linoleum floors with these effects."
"We now have to deal with the debate on REACH and on preventive research and research in favour of public health within the seventh framework programme, which should include these issues."
". Mr President, I shall try to respond to Members’ questions."
"Firstly, in reply to Mr Schnellhardt, neither labelling nor fragrances is included in the final package."
"I can confirm to Mrs Jørgensen that Amendments 22 and 23 are part of the compromise package."
"For that reason, I urge Members to reject the two amendments."
"In response to Mrs McAvan, the Commission is aware of the recent study she mentioned, published by the United States National Institute of Environmental Health Science on 8 June 2005."
"We have, therefore, requested the opinion of the newly established Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly-Identified Health Risks."
"This will allow us to decide the future of EU policy on phthalates use in medical devices."
"I promise you that we will do that very quickly."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday."
"The next item is the report by Riitta Myller, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on stimulating technologies for sustainable development: an environmental technologies action plan for the European Union (2004/2131(INI)) (A6-0141/2005)."
". Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to say a sincere thank you to all of you who have been involved in preparing this parliamentary report."
"Your cooperation has been quite seamless."
"Environmental technologies are one of the strongest bridges linking the three pillars of the EU’s strategy for growth and competitiveness."
"They will provide an encouraging opportunity simultaneously to strengthen European growth, competitiveness and employment prospects, and to improve environmental protection."
"The ecoindustry is just as important a branch of industry in Europe as, for example, aviation or pharmaceuticals, and its growth rate is more than 5% a year."
"The eco-industry at present provides employment for over two million people in the European Union."
"There is a growing global market for ecotechnology."
"Japan, Canada, the United States of America, and China are all aiming for a share of this market."
"Despite growth and fiercer competition, however, much ecoindustry potential remains unrealised."
"The Commission’s communication on an environmental technologies action plan is an attempt to show the direction in which the EU and its Member States should be moving for new insights and feasible ideas to come into being, and it will also show how we might create impartial and competitive market prospects for eco-efficient innovations."
"As rapporteur, I believe the basic principle here is that merely sufficient demand will give rise to innovation and create a sustainable market."
"Environmental legislation should be adequately ambitious, clear and sustained, so as to develop new environmental technology."
"The basic principle should be that environmental costs are fully included in the price of the product."
"An important factor here is the abolition of damaging subsidies."
"The true and competitive price of a product, commodity or service, is arrived at when a price tag is also put on the harm to the environment it causes."
"It can be applied through eco-taxes, for example, or with other charges."
"Often the mobilising power of several factors is also necessary."
"Prices for oil and other limited natural resources are so high now that we have to find new and sustainable forms of energy."
"Europe needs to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources."
"In the action programme, the Commission has quite rightly stressed the need to find ways of speeding up the practical application of the results of research."
"Here we need investment not just in research but also venture capital."
"The entire European Union budget is approximately 1% of the Gross Domestic Product of the Member States."
"This imposes restrictions on direct financing by the EU."
"The EU should obviously increase its investment in ecotechnology, nevertheless."
"This should be visible as a clear area of emphasis in the Framework Programme for Research and the EU’s future Framework Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation."
"Rural development, cohesion and regional development funds need to be harnessed for the development and utilisation of ecotechnologies."
"The European Investment Bank should also participate in financing."
"Many Member States have good systems. These should be made known to, and adopted by, all of them."
"Citizens should also be advised, through the clearest possible labelling and reliable certificates, of the environmental sustainability of products and services throughout their lifecycle."
"The goal of the Lisbon Strategy of sustainable growth, improved competitiveness and quality jobs linked to high standards of environmental protection is attainable."
"This will require, however, unbiased investment in eco-technology research, product development and market access promotion."
"The European Union needs, then, to aim for a 50% share of the eco-technologies market, a market which is growing globally, as part of the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy."
". Mr President, the environmental technologies action plan is one of the instances in which the European Council, the Commission and now the European Parliament are on the same track."
"They do, of course, sometimes emphasise different aspects, but on many counts they are striving towards the same objectives."
"I wish to thank Mrs Myller for the detailed and constructive report which she has prepared."
"The report will be a valuable contribution to the implementation of the action plan and an incentive for considering the next steps."
"Support for environmental technologies is a policy which creates benefits for all sides, in that it strengthens the competitiveness of the European economy and reinforces sustainable development."
"That is why environmental technologies and ecological innovation are now recognised as basic components of the reinforced Lisbon Strategy."
"The specific actions planned in the action plan cover the supply and demand of environmental technologies."
"As Mrs Myller has just emphasised, demand for environmental technologies must be stimulated by determining objectives with respect to the performance of basic products, services and methods."
"These objectives must be an incentive for innovation and for opening up the market to technologies which benefit the environment."
"The cornerstone will be the concept of the environmental life cycle and this will also address one of the concerns formulated in Mrs Myller's report."
"At the first pilot stage, this concept will be more suitably processed and tested on the ground before being implemented in a more organised proposal."
"Another concern formulated in the report concerns the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the action plan."
"It should be stressed that a number of these actions are addressed specifically to small and medium-sized enterprises, even if they are not mentioned, such as the action for improving the tests and verifying the performance of environmental technologies and support for small and medium-sized enterprises, especially with the development of ecological innovation and the promotion of products on the market."
"Of course, support with Community financing programmes, as proposed in the framework programme for research and technological support which is expected to be approved, is very important to the development of new technologies."
"In the present case, I should like to refer to the contribution of the European Environment Agency, which has developed a new Internet portal for environmental technologies linked to numerous databases which are useful to anyone developing technological applications, as well as to simple users."
"The future implementation of the action plan will depend on the active participation of the Member States."
"I hope that the preparation of roadmaps at national level, which was approved by the Spring Council in 2005, will give the Member States a new opportunity to study the specific national measures needed in order to implement the action plan."
"Action by the Member States is equally important on the subject of public procurement, given that ecological, green procurement makes an effective contribution to the creation and extension of environmental technology markets."
"The promotion of environmental technologies worldwide through international trade and of cooperation on development supplements the cohesive set of measures provided for in the environmental technologies action plan."
"I am convinced that the political support of the European Parliament and its constructive proposals will help the European Commission to achieve the objectives of the action plan."
". Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Myller, my group has, in the course of discussions, made it clear that we endorse one hundred per cent the opinion expressed by the rapporteur, Mrs Myller, and, with the debate – since this morning – revived in the pages of European newspapers, I would like to again encourage the environment Commissioner, Mr Dimas, to keep a continued firm grasp on the positions enunciated in the Commission communication."
"Reading these documents, one finds no evidence of any renewed discussion within the Commission about the point, or lack of it, of an ambitious environmental policy."
"I think you really should take the figures in your own report for the Commission on environmental technologies and put them in front of Commissioner Verheugen."
"As long ago as 2003, the global market in environmental goods was worth EUR 500 billion – more than the markets for air and space travel, and growing since then at the rate of 5% per annum, which is more than the rate at which the gross domestic product is growing."
"What more, then, do we want?"
"This successful development is the success of a very ambitious environmental policy, and I can do no other than encourage you, Mr Dimas, not to allow yourself to be led astray and to be every bit as ambitious as your predecessor in office."
"Mr President, the newspapers today are full, once again, of stories about the need to reduce burdensome regulation upon industry, but there is at least one sector that not only welcomes new regulations, but thrives upon them: environmental technology is promoted and advanced as a result of regulatory requirements demanding improvements in current performance."
"Such requirements can bring about changes in investment priorities, ensuring that money is channelled into research and innovation, with great potential for the future."
"Indeed, if we listen to President Bush, the world will only be spared the consequences of climate change if such investment is stimulated."
"In preparing its proposals, the Commission is now committed to making impact assessments, but the environmental industries do not believe that these properly take account of the real stimulus to innovation derived from setting high environmental standards."
"They say that the Commission should look again at its methodology."
"Its impact assessments need to be adjusted to take full account of the huge economic benefits that this stimulus can give to our economy."
"Mr President, this document is worthy of praise and I believe that it is appropriate that technologies relating to the environment should be supported."
"Nevertheless, I would have liked rather more specific details because, so far, the environment is being identified with just two or three aspects of what we may call sustainable development — I am referring to climate change or the view that environmental technologies are those that improve the industrial processes for preventing emissions."
"Nevertheless, I believe that there are many other extremely important environmental technologies that are not integrated in a systematic manner and that are not treated in the same way within the European Union's research projects: examples are conservation of existing resources and combating disasters."
"I am talking about extremely important aspects, such as the fight against the problem of forest fires, the fight to maintain our heritage and the fight to maintain nature."
"But there is something else that I believe must be raised at this time."
"If Europe is to behave consistently, both with itself and with its projects, we must consider developing a line within environmental and sustainable development technologies dedicated to water and to the administration of the most scant resources."
"Specifically, we must make an effort in relation to all technologies that can be applied in Africa."
"We are talking about the fight against poverty."
"In Johannesburg, many people criticised the fact that the importance of all technologies dedicated to the supply of water were being emphasised, on the grounds that it would lead to the development of large multinationals."
"That is not the problem: we must provide the parts of the world living in poverty with instruments for conserving water and conserving the environment."
"That is what I am calling for on this significant date."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Members for their constructive remarks."
"Development of the wider use of environmental technologies is not only a task for technology developers but also requires the full involvement of all EU companies and citizens concerned."
"The European Parliament has an essential role in explaining the importance of this project and mobilising the necessary public support."
"Before I say a few words about funding and investment, I would like to say that I fully agree with Mr Davies regarding the importance of impact assessments, extended correct state-of-the-art impact assessments for environmental technologies and for environmental policies in general."
"Regarding funding, as with many technologies, the development of environmental technologies requires substantial investment."
"Bank financing has an important role to play."
"This is why the European Investment Bank is involved in implementing the action plan and has urgently developed facilities such as its support for low carbon investments related to the European Union emission-trading scheme."
"This is one of the cases where regulation has led to the emission-trading system and is a very important incentive for developing new technologies."
"Risk capital is also crucial to support small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In the future framework programme for competitiveness and innovation, the Commission has proposed a continuation of the venture capital fund, with particular emphasis on investment financing for eco-innovation."
"Other Community programmes also have a role to play in support of investments in environmental technologies and eco-innovation."
"This is particularly the case for the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund."
"I would call on Member States and their regional governments to seize the opportunity and include eco-innovation in their programming in order to maximise the synergies between environment protection and economic development."
"Naturally, all Commission proposals are highly dependent on the issue of the discussions on the financial framework for the period 2007-2013."
"Finally, fighting the fires in Spain and elsewhere, especially during this period of drought, is very important."
"I know that rain has not fallen in certain areas in Spain and Portugal for more than a year."
"I am sure that new technologies to fight and prevent forest fires could be developed."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday."
"The next item is the Commission statement on thematic strategies on air pollution."
". Mr President, I am most grateful for the opportunity to inform you about the thematic strategy on air pollution."
"This thematic strategy is the first in a series of seven strategies which represent a new way of preparing coordinated environmental policy."
"The strategy on air pollution is now in the final stages of preparation, having passed through the extensive consultation procedure in which the European Parliament was actively involved."
"It is a known fact that air pollution has very harmful consequences on human health: respiratory problems, bronchitis, lung cancer and premature death in both young and elderly people."
"Nowadays, approximately 350 000 premature deaths a year are linked to air pollution."
"Even and when the present policies and current legislation have been fully applied, we shall still have over 270 000 premature deaths in 2020."
"Air pollution has an adverse effect on the environment and on ecosystems."
"Thus, up to 1 million square kilometres of natural ecosystems will continue to be at serious risk."
"In short, the damage to health and the environment is so acute – over EUR 200 billion a year in repercussions on health alone – that we need to step up our action."
"We need to bear in mind that well prepared environmental policies can make a positive contribution to competitiveness and to the creation of high quality jobs."
"Air pollution has serious adverse financial repercussions."
"The health problems which it causes and the poor quality of the air that we breathe lead to the loss of 150 000 million working days a year, to losses in productivity and, as a result, to serious health spending."
"The agricultural sector loses 2.5 billion a year from the damage caused by ozone."
"Nor should we forget that the environment is an issue which attracts constant support from European citizens."
"In addition, European citizens themselves judge that, in the environmental sector, Community action performs better, providing and creating added value."
"Action such as this in connection with air pollution will have direct benefits for European citizens."
"It will bring about an important improvement in the quality of air that we breathe."
"It is something we owe European citizens."
"I trust I can count on your support at this new stage of environmental policy now starting and I hope soon to be able to present the strategy on air pollution."
". Mr President, this is of course the case of the disappearing strategies and the debate has come about because we wonder where they are."
"Under the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, all thematic strategies were supposed to come to the European Parliament and Council within three years."
"Commissioner, the three years are up on 22 July."
"In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety we were given a splendid outline on 21 June of which strategies would be coming in which months, all of them by 5 December: one in December, two in November, one in September, two in July, three in June."
"Five – on air, waste, sustainable use of resources, marine and aviation – would be with us before the summer."
"Then we were told that we would be starting with air pollution and the marine environment by July."
"Now we are into July and we have none of them."
"There have been rumours in the media – which we always believe – of dark deeds in the Commission: ‘Barroso mugs Dimas’, we read in the headlines."
"Then DG Environment confirmed that there had been no withdrawal, but that there was to be an orientation debate."
"Well, I thought orientation took place before you started on the journey, but apparently the journey has been interrupted while we work out where we are trying to go."
"If we are to assess compatibility with the Lisbon Agenda, I wonder why that was not done before."
"The Commissioner has rightly drawn attention to the problem of air pollution."
"There are some 370 000 premature and preventable deaths a year from outdoor and indoor, industrial, traffic, farming and dust pollution."
"Of course there is a cost to be considered, but I think Parliament believes that we should be working on the strategy with the Commission and the Council now and that, at the very least, we need a stated timetable on when each of the thematic strategies is going to come to us."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I am very disappointed that we have failed to make progress in the area of air quality."
"Action is really desperately needed."
"Air quality must improve."
"The Commission has worked very hard on a sound strategy, but is now, in the final stages, bowing to industry, and its most conservative section at that."
"The world needs clean technology."
"The Chinese, Indians and Koreans are also struggling to meet air quality standards."
"European industry could capitalise on this with a sense of renewal and urge for innovation."
"As Mr Bowes said a moment ago, the environment is an important part of the Lisbon strategy."
"Environmental innovation helps the European economy move forward, something that the Commission recognised back in February, but which has not, unfortunately, found practical expression."
"How can the public have confidence in a Commission that refuses to urge polluters to produce in a more environmentally-friendly manner?"
"How can they have confidence in a Europe that tolerates 370 000 premature deaths annually as a result of air pollution?"
"What kind of Europe is it that refuses to take action in order to vastly improve this situation?"
"Is that the Europe that you want?"
"To improve air quality is not an easy thing to do."
"In the Netherlands, it is evident how difficult it is to meet the standards."
"The Netherlands has made huge efforts, albeit somewhat belatedly, to comply with the European agreements, but it is abundantly clear that, in order to be able to guarantee clean air, measures are needed that get to the root of the problem."
"We need clean cars, clean diesels, clean production processes, but we also have to conclude, unfortunately, that the internal market rules get in the way of bold policy, and sometimes even make it impossible."
"Given the seriousness of the situation and the Commission’s inability to take action, the interests of public health are so serious that I call on the Member States to set aside the internal market rules."
"That is not an easy appeal for me to make, for the internal market is very close to my heart, but I am convinced that it is necessary to put public health before the market, certainly now that the Commission refuses to take the lead."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it would seem that there is literally a dirty war being waged against the health of the public and the environment, as the Commission has postponed its proposal for a thematic strategy on air quality."
"This delay goes against what we jointly agreed when we drew up the Sixth Environmental Action Programme."
"This is something we cannot accept."
"Air pollution causes illness and kills."
"According to the latest information, up to 300 000 people a year are killed by just small particles."
"Right now, in the wake of the French and Dutch referenda, the Commission’s decision is very unfortunate."
"It will tend to weaken the people’s confidence in the EU even further."
"Opinion polls show that the public wants special action from the European Union to improve the environment."
"According to press reports, the postponement has been promoted in particular by Commissioners Verheugen and McCreevy."
"If they and the President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso, believe environmental protection weakens competitiveness, I would ask them to show us the proof."
"All the public surveys and the experiences of people that have come to my attention suggest it is just the opposite."
"Environmental protection promotes competitiveness."
"Studies of what the environmental protection reforms implemented thus far have cost show that they have all been cheaper than expected."
"The costs have been four times, and even ten times less than the estimates made beforehand."
"President Barroso is not present, but I would like to remind him, nevertheless, that we also pay a price for inactivity."
"Merely in terms of medical expenses it costs between 200 and 600 billion euros per annum."
"The price is also paid in as many as 300 000 untimely deaths every year."
"These figures are not imaginary: they are actual costs."
"We would like to know when the thematic strategies are to be proposed."
"The promotion of environmental protection would represent just the sort of leadership that Europe at present sorely needs."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen."
"Although I, along with my fellow Members, endorse the Commissioner’s analysis of air pollution, I also share Mrs Corbey’s disappointment that the thematic strategy has not yet been published."
"Our Members now want a date for this publication."
"I was pleased to read in the newspapers that Commissioner Dimas was furious, but have in this debate noticed very little of it so far."
"Commissioner, you can count on our support provided you persevere and have this thematic strategy published shortly."
"If the Commission fails to do this, then you have a problem."
"There is no time to lose now before the introduction."
"Euro-5 PM two-and-a-half is an exceptionally good strategy and has a place in the thematic strategy."
"If you want to regain the confidence of the public, you will need to ensure that you pull out all the stops in order to actually tackle cross-border air pollution and fight it effectively."
"This can be done by means of this thematic strategy, but we should not wait any longer, get down to brass tacks and persevere."
"Commissioner, you can count on our support, you have my word on this, but we expect you to make an all-out effort."
"Mr President, while taking the Commissioner’s goodwill as read, I cannot refrain from quoting to him a few figures on air pollution: 370 000 premature deaths per annum in Europe, which is many times the number killed on the roads."
"In over 60% of all Europe’s ecosystems, biodiversity is under threat."
"If nothing is done by 2020, we will see 292 000 premature deaths and over 90 000 admitted to hospital with breathing problems."
"Moreover, 650 000 square kilometres – an area twenty times the size of Belgium – of Europe’s ecosystem are under threat of azotic pollution."
"You yourself announced to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety that we could look forward in July to the thematic strategy on air."
"Your Director-General, Katherine Day, joined us a fortnight ago and told us the same thing, that this thematic strategy would be in place in July."
"It now appears that industry has gained the upper hand and is trying – I think, blindly – to delay the air strategy."
"As I see it, we need together to strive towards this particular Lisbon goal in order to make ourselves more competitive."
"While stressing, as one must, the need to remain competitive, we cannot forget the need for sustainability, for it is sustainable growth for which Europe is known."
"In the long term, or so I believe, this is our only chance on the world stage to ensure our ability to compete in the long term with India and China, and so I ask you, as a matter of urgency, to get your fellow-Commissioners round to your point of view and to produce this thematic strategy by autumn at the latest, which we enable you to do as you have promised."
". Mr President, first of all I would like to thank you for your comments on thematic strategies."
"As Mr Bowis says, thematic strategies 6 and 7 are provided for in the Sixth Environmental Action Programme."
"They are supposed to be presented within three years of the programme’s adoption."
"You said that I was furious with Mr Blokland."
"I very rarely get furious."
"I always stay calm, even when something is unpleasant or difficult for me."
"I shall try with all my power to overcome any difficulties that arise, with your help."
"The contribution of the European Parliament remains very important."
"Parliament has participated actively in the preparation of the air strategy."
"With continued cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, we will be able to provide the European Union with an effective and efficient way of addressing the impact of air pollution on human health and the environment."
"Mr Seeber quoted figures which are really very impressive and which supplement the figures I quoted previously."
"In terms of timing, the air strategies are ready, the preparatory work is completed and the inter-service consultations are over."
"The Commission will now have to take its final decision."
"Given the scale of the health and the environmental problems caused by air pollution, I expect that decision to be reached soon."
"I have heard some concern expressed that the air strategy is not ambitious enough."
"I fully agree that the effects of air pollution are serious and the strategy must ensure further substantial improvements."
"The strategy will be ambitious, but it should also be achievable."
"We know that environmental policies can promote competitiveness and create high-quality jobs."
"Interestingly, the countries that have come closest to meeting the Lisbon targets are those with the most ambitious environmental policies."
"In any event, the potential impact for Europe’s competitiveness has been analysed and we are satisfied that the impact of the air strategy will be very limited."
"Moreover, our competitors in China, India, Korea, the United States and Japan are also taking serious action on air pollution."
"Let me finish by reiterating the importance of an ambitious and forward-looking air strategy."
"Cleaner air will reduce the human suffering that air- related diseases cause: asthma and bronchitis, lung cancer and increased infant mortality."
"Air quality reduces the life expectancy of the average European by eight months."
"It destroys our lakes and forests and this is our overriding challenge."
"The air strategy has been thoroughly prepared; it is based on sound science and economics."
"It has gone through extensive stakeholder consultations and full impact assessment, as well as cost benefit assessment."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the report by Giles Chichester, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to safeguard security of electricity supply and infrastructure investment (COM(2003)0740 – C5-0643/2003 – 2003/0301(COD)) (A6-0099/2005)."
". Mr President, at this point, it is well worth remembering why the Commission put forward this proposal back in 2003."
"In the long, hot summer of that year, the electricity systems in Europe could not cope, and a blackout in Italy and some problems elsewhere meant the Commission deemed this proposal necessary."
"This proposal should give transmission system operators the tools to balance supply and demand in a much better way."
"The elements of the proposal concentrate on cementing good regulatory practice, to open the electricity market and to encourage investments in infrastructure in a more competitive market."
"Furthermore, the proposal clearly requires the necessary steps to be taken to meet the needs of the electricity industry."
"I wish to thank the rapporteur and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their commitment to security of supply and infrastructure."
"In his report, Mr Chichester has introduced many important and positive amendments to the Commission’s original proposal."
"The Parliament has contributed a great deal to the improvement of the text."
"The compromise amendments set out clearly the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders regarding the delivery of secure electricity supplies and the upkeep of the networks."
"The Commission is therefore in a position to accept most of the amendments."
"However, the importance of cross-border interconnector projects has not been reflected sufficiently in the amendments made by Parliament."
"There is a clear regulatory gap in this area and the directive as drafted by Parliament does not fill this gap adequately."
"At this stage, the Commission takes note of the agreement between the European Parliament and the Council while regretting the change concerning Article 7."
"The Commission maintains its position as to the need to strengthen the regulator’s role with regard to infrastructure investment."
"Consequently, the Commission maintains reservations about Compromise Amendment 23."
". Mr President, I am sorry the Council is not here tonight."
"I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their cooperation in the work on this report and on this proposal, which has enabled us to come before Parliament with a clear and united position."
"I also wish to compliment the Council on working with us in informal trialogue towards an agreement at first reading."
"Picking up on the comments of Commissioner Piebalgs, whom I naturally welcome here this evening, I should like to console the Commission for the way in which we and the Council have cut back its text and therefore some of the proposed powers that were envisaged, which we deem unnecessary."
"When it came to us originally, this proposal reflected a certain element of split personality, because it addressed physical security of supply – keeping the lights on, and investment in infrastructure – but also market measures aimed at the same thing."
"It is not possible to underestimate the importance of energy in general and electricity in particular to our way of life, to our quality of life and to our standard of living."
"It is a vital element in a modern society and economy."
"Consequently, it is ironic that Parliament has chosen to put this item of primary legislation as the last item on Monday evening, although, naturally, I hope that we have saved the best until last for your edification."
"Security of supply is about keeping the lights on."
"It must be admitted that we had quite a debate with the Council about whether to include a definition of security of supply in this proposal and, if so, what that definition should be."
"I am glad to say that we have prevailed and that a definition has been included in Article 2."
"The question arises: how does this directive help address security of supply – keeping the lights on, avoiding blackouts and outages – and what have we in the European Parliament added to it?"
"The objectives are quite clear: it is about establishing measures to safeguard security of supply and ensure proper functioning of the internal market – these two elements of the proposal."
"It is about ensuring adequate generation capacity, an adequate balance between supply and demand and appropriate levels of interconnection."
"That is referred to quite clearly in the text."
"Then we in Parliament have insisted on the definition of the roles and responsibilities of a full list of players – stakeholders, if you will – in the electricity supply industry."
"We have sought to make Member States define those roles in the cause of security of supply so that everybody knows who is responsible for what."
"That includes Member States themselves."
"We have achieved the inclusion of a requirement for a report on overall system adequacy for operational network security for the projected security balance of supply and demand over the next five years and prospects for the security of electricity supply over the next 15 years beyond that, thereby flagging up what investment requirements will be needed."
"We can also claim credit for slimming down the original proposal and giving it more focus."
"This directive will not guarantee that there will be no more blackouts: that would be impossible."
"But it points out where responsibility rests and it will be for Member States to spell that out in detail so there is no uncertainty."
"Primary operational responsibility must be with the transmission system operators and, to some extent, the distribution system operators."
"But we should all recognise that a whole range of factors are involved in maintaining overall security of supply, not just transmission and interconnection."
"We must remember that the primary responsibility for that at present rests with the Member States."
"I commend this proposal to the House."
". – Mr President, safeguarding the security of the electricity supply and ensuring an adequate level of interconnection between the infrastructures of the Member States is absolutely essential, particularly at a time when we are planning to set up and enhance the single market for energy."
"In this context, I felt, when it came to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs drawing up its draft opinion on this report, that the Commission and Parliament should offer us a global perspective on this issue."
"It is clear that a sound single market for energy cannot be created in an environment in which there is major inequality in the conditions of supply, in terms of price, regularity and indeed taxation."
"This crucial market will also be incapable of growing stronger unless there is a shared vision of the use of the various forms of energy production."
"The issue of safety – of the energy supply and the interconnection of infrastructures – must not merely be as a consequence of, and in response to, the sudden shutdowns that have happened in recent times and that have had a highly detrimental effect on the development of the European economy."
"These elements must be – and I wish to stress this point – the building blocks of the common energy policy and must be the catalyst for the much-needed policy of increasing energy efficiency and of diversifying sources of energy."
"Unfortunately, some of the proposals that I tabled in my committee did not receive the required majority, despite the fact that they are based directly on the philosophy that I have just detailed, a philosophy that, I am sure, is shared by most Members of this House."
"Stepping up investment in the distribution network and in the interconnection of networks will help to improve the competitiveness of the Member States’ economies and to drive forward the European economy. It will also make it possible to strike the necessary balance between supply and demand, within a framework of excessive differentiation."
"Mr Chichester’s report takes these points on board and, accordingly, represents a positive step towards improving upon the Commission’s proposal."
"Nonetheless, the report needs to be adopted so that the codecision process can be closed at first reading."
"The main priority, however, is that the European institutions must be seen to be capable of reforming the energy market from a European policy perspective, taking a global view of every aspect."
". Consumers generally have two main expectations with regard to this special commodity, electricity: that it should be cheap and that it should be available at the desired time and in the desired quality and quantity."
"The citizens of the Union likewise expect guaranteed security of supply, along with stable prices."
"Let us therefore ask the question: does this directive fulfil these expectations?"
"Certainly in itself it does not."
"But there is a good chance that we are now taking a step in the right direction, bearing in mind considerations of competition and sustainability, and reconciling rules and objectives already negotiated and those to be negotiated in future."
"We certainly agree that reconciling these different perspectives is no easy task."
"But we also have to agree that there is a great need to ensure security of supply, reasonable prices and sustainability, because many European citizens have not yet been able to feel the benefits of market integration."
"We could no doubt mention many examples of this, but allow me to cite, as one such example, central-eastern Europe’s power generating units, which are not infrequently more than 40-50 years old, or the fact that, in purchasing power parity terms, a Hungarian citizen today pays twice or three times as much for electricity as the citizens of some of the older Member States."
"This directive is an opportunity."
"It is an opportunity to expand transmission network capacity, an opportunity to develop new, cross-border connections and an opportunity to renovate production capacities."
"We will have to seize this opportunity, however, to ensure that this new legislation does not mean increased administration, more and more complicated licensing procedures, in short, a greater burden, but that it means genuine help for the sector and ultimately for consumers."
"This is what the citizens of Europe expect of us, so we should not content ourselves with less."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank my colleague, Mr Chichester, for his excellent work."
"We have become so dependent on electricity now that we even switch on lights during daylight, such as now."
"The power cuts in recent years have clearly shown how vulnerable we are."
"As always, the greatest harm affects the less fortunate, the poor and those of limited means."
"That is why the Member States and the Union should stress the importance of the security of supply, even though we still have no viable internal electricity market."
"This is just what is being emphasised in this proposal."
"Unquestionably, investment needs to be made, for example in transfer capacity, so that congestion can be eliminated."
"This way the internal market can be developed for the benefit of the consumer."
"Congestion should therefore be eliminated, which will make exchanges of electricity more effective and the network more stable."
"It will also facilitate market access conditions."
"We have to ensure that the same is also true of cross-border networks."
"There are significant bottlenecks associated with them, of course."
"The reliability of operations, so important for the public and for business, and the non-discriminatory nature of the market are compatible goals."
"Member States should ensure that competition is opened up and that existing legislation is implemented."
"Sluggish implementation of laws slows down Europe as a whole."
"It is a train that we find difficult to keep running at speed."
"I would like to remind you all that the Barcelona European Council asked for an assessment at the European Council next spring of the extent to which the internal market for energy has been implemented, and thus the extent to which this proposal has been made part of national legislation."
"Of course, we also need investment in infrastructure and interconnections."
"In addition, and in line with the Lisbon Strategy, we should enhance cooperation with the business and scientific worlds."
"Ecologically speaking, the primary focus should obviously be on energy efficiency and the latest environmental technology."
"Mr Chichester’s report is in favour of these basic principles of the Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, my group supports Mr Chichester’s whole position."
"We are left with just one task, which is to secure the reliability of this, our common resolve."
". Mr President, the report that we are debating underlines the importance and strength of this House."
"If we compare the draft directive as presented by the Commission with the compromise that we hope to adopt tomorrow, what becomes apparent is what this House is capable of achieving in the field of energy policy."
"That this House has been able to exert considerable influence is attributable in no small degree to the unambiguous stance taken by the rapporteur."
"The Commission’s original proposal tended to exemplify a planned economy in which the administration would have determined in which parts of their infrastructure businesses would be allowed to invest."
"Parliament has succeeded in bringing out of this document an approach guided by competitiveness, which will do a far better job of addressing the problems of security of supply, something made all the more important by the fact that Europe’s current development is characterised by an increasing demand for electricity, which has caused renewed attention to be given to the need for new power stations."
"The right conclusion to draw from the power cuts in Italy in 2003 would have been that the blame for these lay primarily with the lack of competition in the clapped-out infrastructure."
"Particularly where public services are concerned, privatisation and competition are invariably two sides of the same coin."
"The Commission took a step in the wrong direction by assuming, as it originally did, that state bodies could make good the lack of competition and would, in cases of doubt, be more competent to judge which parts of the Member States’ network infrastructure were in need of investment."
"What, now improved, is left in the proposal for a directive itself shows how increased competition can be a winning strategy."
"By promoting the conditions under which a wholesale market can function adequately and send appropriate price signals for investment in production capacity, the EU is taking the right approach to dealing with the issue of security of supply."
"Its most important objective must be the creation of viable energy market structures in which businesses can make money, that being the right incentive for the creation of an investment climate in which infrastructure can come into being."
"This directive is not one of those that are toxic to enterprise, and a good thing too."
"We therefore agree with the rapporteur’s proposal and congratulate him too."
". Mr President, Commissioner, the rapporteur, Mr Chichester, is right in assuming that we are all unanimously agreed that energy consumption is growing and the share of electricity in our use of energy is increasing."
"The uninterrupted production of electricity and its secure supply are therefore important."
"It is the rapporteur’s opinion that the Commission has been too preoccupied with market mechanisms, instead of which it should have proposed some concrete action."
"Neither does our group believe that the market alone can solve all the problems of production and ensure the security of supply."
"We in the Nordic countries have bad experiences of the effects of market mechanisms on the price of electricity consumers pay."
"Electric power passes freely between the Nordic countries: Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark."
"Its price in the Nordic network is determined in their common electricity exchanges."
"The price reflects the fact that it is determined by marginal power produced at its most expensive, in other words, according to the highest possible price."
"This market mechanism is very unfavourable for consumers."
"The fact is that nuclear and hydro-electric power plants obtain the same price for their electricity on the coldest winter days as what is paid for the electricity that comes from coal-fired power stations, which are the last to be connected to the network."
"When the price of electricity from coal rises still further due to emission rights, the emission-free nuclear and hydro-electric power stations will receive compensation accordingly."
"For consumers a price mechanism of this nature is totally unsatisfactory."
"The Nordic electricity markets are a good example of the market not being able to solve all the problems."
"They are furthermore able to put up the price of electricity in a way that cannot be regarded as acceptable."
"We need government measures to safeguard different areas of investment."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the excellent outcome of his work on the report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to safeguard security of electricity supply and infrastructure investment."
"The report contains a number of considerations, the majority of which I agree with and believe to be of great value."
"At the same time, however, I should like to alert the House to three aspects of this issue that have a direct bearing on what we mean by safeguarding security of supply."
"The first of these is the need to take greater advantage of renewable energy sources. The environmental benefits of the latter are obvious and indisputable, and we should promote their use."
"The second aspect relates to an issue that has also been highlighted by the rapporteur, namely the importance of ensuring a balanced use of the various primary fuels in electricity generation."
"The third aspect, and one which I regard as absolutely crucial, is the need to secure diversified supply sources for each type of primary fuel."
"Here I mean not only electricity-related matters but also energy security in general."
"In my opinion, it is intolerable that certain aspects of the European Union’s energy policy mean that Member States are entirely dependent on one source, as in the case of crude oil or, most importantly, Russian gas supplies to Poland, which are guaranteed by means of projects."
"I should like to take this opportunity to call for the construction of the second leg of the Yamal gas pipeline to be speeded up."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Chichester for his objective report on safeguarding the security of electricity supply."
"The report deals with issues relating to cross-border supply and the main energy grid."
"Small-scale power generation, which involves a small number of electric power plants fuelled by water, wind or geothermal energy and gas power plants fuelled by biomass energy, is also of enormous significance for energy security in individual regions."
"There are a great many reasons why small-scale power generation of this kind should be encouraged."
"As well as being environmentally friendly, it reduces transmission costs and minimises the impact of outages in the main grids."
"Investment is needed to develop regional grids and small-scale power generation, however, and this includes investment in research."
"The small power generators frequently encounter problems relating to grid connection and the synchronisation amongst themselves."
"In my opinion, these problems should be given more emphasis in the directive."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Chichester, ladies and gentlemen, we have a programme and can expect the Member States to produce precise regulations by 1 December 2007."
"The Commission could do a great deal to support them in this, notably by adopting regulations to create financial incentives, perhaps in the form of projects to support the establishment of best practice and benchmarking by that date."
"Even if that goal cannot be achieved in that time, it is certainly possible to create a stable environment for it by means of a further framework directive."
"I believe that the increasing demand that is to be expected means that we need, first and foremost, a stable investment environment."
"Energy efficiency needs to be promoted, and I would like particularly to congratulate the Commissioner on regarding that as the first priority."
"Another primary requirement is for distributed generation, which will make the network more stable, and this will require proper maintenance and the development of a true internal market."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have learned that monopolies are inefficient."
"We have also learned that a deregulated market demands quality controls both on the variety of producers needed to guarantee the electricity supply and to meet demand and on the network itself and the network’s structure."
"We have also learned of the need to check that these investments in actual fact take place."
"In Sweden, we had a very long power failure after the big storm last winter."
"It became very clear then that none of these quality controls had been fully implemented."
"When this happens, not only does industrial production come to a halt, but other functions important to society are also affected and people’s quality of life is dramatically reduced."
"I should like to congratulate both the rapporteur and the Commission on some excellent work which has been pioneering in terms of value for voters."
"Ladies and gentlemen, at this point in time I regard the Chichester report as a good compromise, which is why I too will vote in favour of it."
"Security of supply can naturally be viewed from a number of perspectives, but in my opinion we should not concentrate solely on back-up systems and other technical aspects."
"After all, optimising the flow of electricity at critical times, or should I say peak load times, could have a considerable impact on the reliability of electricity supply, as well as reducing necessary reserves and costs, and, most importantly, providing greater security at times of potential crisis."
"I therefore believe that now is the time to set up some sort of independent international coordination centre."
"Systems are being connected and electricity trading is moving at a faster pace, which means that there is an increasing need for timely and more detailed information about electricity flows."
"Regional coordination is already in place between the Czech Republic and its neighbours, for example, and the same is true elsewhere."
"Why should we not provide a framework for such activities in the shape of an independent coordination centre for the EU as a whole?"
". Mr President, I should like to start by commending the rapporteur on the job he has done."
"The method used to find the best possible solution for the proposal made by the Commission is very admirable."
"The result is extremely good."
"At the same time I should like to say that we have faced the same objective."
"All of us would like to strengthen the security of the supply of electricity."
"That means that we should find a way to secure long-term investment, stability of investment, conditions for investment, standards for transmission system operators and also inter-connection capacity in the European Union."
"Strategically the Commission has agreed with all discussions going on in the Council and Parliament."
"The only difference we have is on how to strengthen the connection capacity."
"From that point of view I very much hope that the proposal based on the collaboration between the Council and Parliament will work."
"If it does not, then perhaps we will need to find other methods to strengthen inter-connection capacity, because it is the link in the European energy supply."
"In general, as already mentioned, this directive definitely cannot rule out blackouts in some places in the European market."
"It definitely decreases the risks of such a blackout and strengthens the role that the energy sector plays in the well-being of European citizens."
"Even though the Commission expresses a reservation on one particular issue, if the directive is agreed on this basis at Parliament's first reading, the Commission will welcome this directive."
"I ask the House to support the compromise amendments tomorrow."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions [11979/1/2004 – C6-0058/2005 – 2002/0047(COD)] (Rapporteur: Michel Rocard) (A6-0207/2005)."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the final stages of a long and fine parliamentary battle."
"I have to remind you what is at stake, although five minutes is an absurdly short time for such a complex problem."
"There are three issues."
"The principle of the free movement of ideas, respect for competition and the rejection of the monopoly effect of patents, and finally the protection of individual inventors and small and medium-sized companies against the overwhelming might of a few very large corporations."
"Everyone here wishes to clarify the law and believes that a directive is needed."
"No one here wants all software to be patentable."
"So, there should be no problem, except for the fact that a recent development, scarcely more than 20 years old, has complicated matters."
"In the earliest days of the IT industry and when the first computer software was developed, no one ever thought of patenting it."
"Silicon Valley, Mr President, operated on this basis and developed for 20 or 30 years without patents."
"Software was protected by copyright, which was quite sufficient."
"Then, from the US, where there is no law on these matters, the idea emerged of extending patentability into this area."
"The starting point is the idea that the immaterial is not technical and that everything that connects to the material world and that uses matter, energy or tools is patentable."
"To be patentable, something must be new, inventive and capable of industrial application and must make a technical contribution."
"Everything that is a carrier or handler or that presents information to a software program which then processes it or that extracts the results of the software program's calculations in order to transfer them to the real world via a moving component or a signal – all of this is patentable, while the software program itself is not."
"Later on, software programs were embedded inseparably in an invention in which carriers, software and handlers were again linked and inseparable."
"Then, inventions appeared in which only the software was new, while the carriers and handlers were old."
"We have therefore seen a number of courts and certain national patent offices, as well as the European Patent Office, committing the error of considering everything as technical, with the result that there are now 200 000 patents of this type, or more, in the USA, and 30 000 granted by the European Patent Office, notwithstanding Article 52, paragraph 2 of its basic charter, which stipulates that software programs are not patentable."
"The abuses are well known and must not be forgotten: patents have been issued for teaching methods, commercial methods and guides for surgeons."
"In all these cases, if the software programs had been free, the whole of Africa could immediately have benefited from them, for instance in the fields of teaching or medicine."
"However, they are patented in the US, with the result that they are extremely expensive and out of the reach of the modern world."
"We have all condemned these abuses, including those of the European Patent Office, but its error has meant that the dividing lines are not clear."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you are being asked to go back to first principles and to the law."
"However, some of our most prestigious industrial companies have not understood what we are doing."
"They are afraid of losing their protection, which we can understand in the short term, because the removal of protection will disturb the equilibrium in some areas."
"What do the largest companies do today?"
"They swap portfolios of patents among one another to avoid the drawbacks of patentability suffered by anyone unable to take part in this game – namely anyone not as large as they are."
"Legal costs in all these companies’ research and development budgets are increasing relentlessly, and now exceed 20% just about everywhere."
"Two thirds of patents in force in the European territories are American or Asian, not European."
"Finally, when Siemens, GEM PLUS or Alcatel sell their mobile telephony divisions, these divisions go off to Asia, taking their patents with them, thereby depriving Europe of any chance of developing in these areas."
"We therefore feel, Mr President, that, in the long term, the defence of our European industry is better served by liberty and by freedom of access than by patents."
"Moreover, China is training 2.5 million IT professionals every year."
"How can we face up to this challenge?"
"The best way is freedom."
"Our leading industrialists should have grasped this, instead of which they have tried to use ridicule. What is more, this debate has given rise to a number of insults."
"For instance, it is a ‘man of the Middle Ages’ addressing you now."
"This is an indication of just how weak their position is."
"Our industrialist friends should admit that, just because an error has occurred, there is no reason to adapt our principles and law to fit in with it."
"Turning now to the final problem, the TRIPS Treaty, ADPIC in French, can be interpreted in two ways."
"Either all software programs are patentable, in which case there is no problem: they all fall within the TRIPS (ADPIC) Treaty and WTO panels, but that is not what we want."
"Or alternatively, no software program is patentable: they all fall under the international laws of copyright."
"They also depend on the WTO panels, but with other rules."
"In the second case, we are also complying with the TRIPS treaty, although we are aware that the only thing prohibited by that treaty is the grey area."
"If there is a difference of opinion as to why a particular piece of software is patentable, the dividing line has ceased to be effective and the situation where ‘everything is patentable’ is possible, or at least is permissible."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you are being invited here to reconcile principles, the law, consistency and clarity and merely to ask our major industrialists to make an effort to adapt – an adaptation which everything suggests will be much less painful than they believe."
". Mr President, as Commissioner McCreevy is unable to be present today, I will represent the Commission in this debate."
"I wish to begin by thanking Michel Rocard, the rapporteur on this complex and technical file, for his hard work on this dossier."
"I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, who have also made a major contribution to the work of Parliament on this issue."
"This proposal is not only relevant to inventions implemented on a standard computer – a laptop for instance – it covers many everyday consumer goods and devices increasingly important in our daily life, such as cars, washing machines, mobile phones, cameras, DVD players, TV sets, vacuum cleaners or medical equipment like scanners."
"The proposed directive neither aims to abolish the current practice of the European Patent Office nor to extend it to cover the patenting of pure computer programs, as many of the opponents of the proposals have claimed."
"Indeed, many have equally – and mistakenly – claimed that the directive is introducing the notion of patentability of software inventions in EU patent practice for the first time."
"The proposed text clearly excludes patents for pure software, as well as patents for business methods as such."
"Only technical innovations embodied in a computer program and meeting the patentability criteria of novelty, inventiveness and industrial applicability can be patented."
"A legal framework ensuring patent protection in this area is of key importance in enabling European industries, including small and medium-sized enterprises, to be competitive in a high-tech environment."
"Patents can guarantee a return on R[amp]D investments, attract venture capital and provide bargaining power."
"This has a spin-off effect which boosts innovation."
"The Commission believes that the common position meets the requirement of introducing a predictable legal framework that promotes and rewards innovation."
"Amendments seeking rejection of the common position have been tabled."
"I would like to point out that this would only increase legal uncertainty with respect to the inventions in question."
"Lack of harmonisation in this field would prejudice the competitiveness of the European undertakings and continue to be an obstacle to the smooth functioning of the internal market."
"In this spirit, the Commission continues to support the line taken in the common position."
"We can accept amendments that introduce useful technical or contextual clarifications, subject to minor fine-tuning or interpretative statements where necessary, but the overall balance of the proposal must be maintained."
"The current definition of technical contribution in the directive is taken from existing case-law so, while it might be possible to word it more elegantly, we cannot turn it around."
"Instead, it seems more useful to focus on the scope of patentable subject matter in Article 4, bringing the exclusions out more clearly."
"Changing them in contradiction with the European Patent Convention would, however, simply cause confusion."
"In addition, interoperability concerns can be addressed by allowing access where possible to necessary technologies while protecting the legitimate rights of inventors."
"The report prepared by the Committee on Legal Affairs generally maintains the balanced approach of the Commission’s proposal."
"Nonetheless, there are some changes that should be made to bring the definitions and criteria into line with general patent law."
"The Commission can accept additional reporting requirements, including the establishment of new advisory committees, provided that resource implications are borne in mind by Parliament."
"The Commission cannot accept amendments which relate to the Commission’s right of initiative, or the relationship with non-Community institutions."
"On key issues of substance, the Commission is strongly committed to promotion of interoperability as a means of fostering innovation and competition and to ensure that Community legislation does not act as a hindrance to different software development models – ‘proprietary’ or ‘open source’."
"It therefore maintains a certain flexibility as to the solution found to deal with interoperability, provided that our international obligations are respected."
"On the scope of patentability, further clarification of the common position is acceptable but not significant changes departing from the current situation or from general patent law solutions."
"I should signal here that we see particular drafting problems with certain amendments relating to technical contribution and inventive step."
"On claims to computer programs on a carrier, where such programs implement a patented invention, the Commission can accept any solution between the common position and the Commission’s original proposal, including alternative formulations to achieve the same objective of enforcing valid patents."
"The Commission has noted the high number of amendments tabled in addition to the Legal Affairs Committee’s report."
"I will set out the Commission’s overall position on all amendments at the end of this morning’s debate."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is most important in tomorrow’s vote to ensure that the Council common position which broadens the scope for the patentability of software does not pass through Parliament without amendments."
"There has been an extraordinarily large number of problems with this proposal."
"The Commission and the Council have taken no account whatsoever of the amendments to the proposal for a directive that a majority in Parliament tabled at first reading."
"The most glaring example of this can be found on the Commission’s Scadplus website."
"To quote directly from there: ‘the Council's common position of May 2004 did not retain any of the substantive amendments introduced by the EP’."
"Parliament was therefore bypassed with a shrug of the shoulders."
"This is not the right way to proceed, neither here nor in any other matters relating to the codecision procedure."
"I hope that a majority in Parliament will support the reasonable amendments made to the Council common position, and which render the requirements for the patentability of software more stringent than they are now."
"It is most important to prevent the granting of what are purely software and business designs in Europe."
"To some extent, current practice at the European Patent Office has drifted too far into a grey area, with patents being granted on flimsy grounds."
"The scope for the patentability of software in Europe should not be broadened further."
"On the other hand, the majority of present-day technological products make use of software and patents granted for a technological product should not be rejected simply because the software forms a component of it."
"It is also important, however, to ensure that patents cannot be used to hinder the creation of compatible software."
"It is good that we share the Commission’s opinion on this."
"The directive should support European innovative research and product development in the software sector."
"This means that unnecessary barriers to open source software development should not be erected, nevertheless taking into account the fact that patents are crucially important to many European companies."
"Academic research, both here and around the world, has shown, however, that research and development input is not dependent on patents or geography."
"Businesses should carry out software development where the best environment for innovation is available, regardless of the extent of patent protection in a geographical region."
"Nothing indicates that this patentable software has to be produced in Europe: it can be produced perfectly well in India, China or elsewhere in the world and then patented somewhere else."
"The aim of the directive is to harmonise the way software patents are registered at the European Patent Office and in Member States, when they are granted."
"For that reason, I am in favour of the directive becoming law."
"The common problems associated with the patent systems, slowness, high cost, and so on, are not relevant to this debate, but it has now become obvious that there is a need for Community patents."
"A European Community patent should be speedily drafted."
"I think it is likely that the amendments that Parliament adopts tomorrow will lead us to conciliation."
"I would like to remind everyone that if Parliament is not satisfied with the outcome of conciliation it can always reject the entire proposal even after conciliation."
"On no account should a bad directive be allowed to get through."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to start by extending warm thanks not only to our rapporteur, Mr Rocard, but also to Mrs McCarthy, who was our rapporteur at first reading stage, for both of them have done a very good job of guiding us to where we now are in this very difficult legislative process."
"I was able to follow the proceedings from the very beginning, and none of the things that have gone on in relation to this draft directive on computer-implemented inventions can be described as everyday legislative work at European Union level."
"We have all experienced the sort of lobbying that one either finds intolerable or can regard as democracy in action, along with a lot of people assuring us that they, like we, want to see a high degree of willingness to be innovative on the part of European businesses."
"Despite this, there is scarcely one single definite form of words on which we have agreed."
"We have just been presented with further confirmation of the fact that the Commission’s stance is extremely inflexible and that the Council’s Common Position is not in fact common to all its members."
"The longer we give this matter our attention, and the greater the depth in which we do so, the greater the clarity with which two things become apparent."
"Legislation has its limits, and I am sure that with this draft we have come up against them."
"Either we want to create clear and unambiguous definitions and rules for implementation, in which case there is the danger of us not going far enough and hence leaving no room for future developments, or we leave room for negotiation, and so legal certainty and legislative consistency lose out."
"In the normal way of things, such a conflict would be resolved by way of a legal system that worked and gave everyone, whether small or large, a more or less fair chance of legal protection and scrutiny."
"It is an unfortunate fact that we, in Europe, cannot take that for granted."
"It may be that we need, even more urgently than this directive, a truly European patent system and a working system of legal protection at European level that allows equal access to all, whether small or large."
"This evening will see my group determining its final position, and I can at any rate assure you that we are very much of one mind in backing the amendments that our rapporteur, Mr Rocard, has tabled."
"Mr President, Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my gratitude to all of you, particularly Mr Rocard and Mr McCarthy, who have performed a small miracle with this directive – one that has caused so much tension and in respect of which a number of currents can be discerned that represent the different opinions in this House."
"The key aim of this directive is to put a stop to the trickle of trivial patents through the European Patent Office in Munich in recent years, including for pure software that can apparently be patented."
"I have understood, and we are all agreed on this, that this directive’s common goal is to render this impossible."
"In principle therefore, this directive aims to improve and shore up Article 52 of the Munich Convention."
"Being a lawyer, I went and looked up the relevant article."
"Legislation could not be expressed any more clearly than in Article 52 of the Munich Convention."
"Although this article is worded in very simple terms, it has, unfortunately, been interpreted incorrectly, or at least differently, in every Member State, and the result of that has been enormous legal uncertainty."
"It is crucial to put a stop to trivial patents, because we have to protect and reinforce innovation and research, and with it competition and employment, within Europe."
"If there are no rewards, nobody will invent anything, and so I believe that a fair reward scheme should be introduced for inventors, and that they should be able to protect their ideas, their intellectual property."
"If not, I fear that, after labour-intensive production, which is already leaving for China, a huge number of corporate research and development departments will follow suit, particularly the multinationals, followed by the small and medium-sized enterprises."
"If that happens, then I think that we will live to regret the fact that it is so difficult to draft legislation in Europe, that we display a desperate lack of decisiveness and that we do not have the nerve to draft legislation which would strengthen our competitiveness globally."
"I think that it is regrettable for our children, as well as future generations, if we do not dare go ahead."
"I therefore hope that a strong directive will be drafted, and that seems to be the case."
"What is the biggest problem?"
"The biggest problem is that this House, the Commission and the Council have no democratic control over the European Patent Office, and that is what we want."
"That is why we Liberals have tabled Amendment 65, in which we ask for the whole of this directive to be rejected and ask the Commission to come forward with a European Community patent, so that this House can monitor the European Patent Office, which will then fall within the scope of European rules, and I think that we would have legal instruments and a legal organisation at our disposal."
"We would then be able to put harmonised legal procedures in place and shed light on the whole issue, which would mainly benefit the medium- and small-sized enterprises."
"At the moment, if a small business wants to take legal action because of a patent infringement, it will cost them millions, which a small business can never afford."
"I hope that we as the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe reach a well-considered position, but I also hope that the entire directive will be voted out tomorrow so that the Commission can table a sound and well-founded proposal for a European patent that is incorporated in a directive such as this one, so that we can avail ourselves of a harmonised and well-considered directive."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are deciding today is whether innovation will be possible in the IT sector and whether small and medium-sized businesses will have the freedom they need in order to develop."
"All and sundry – the patent’s opponents as much as its advocates – are currently asserting that that is what they want."
"Nobody is openly admitting that they want to patent software."
"The difference is to be found in the amendments themselves, and in the number of back doors to be opened up to the patenting of software."
"What makes a difference is whether there is a clear dividing line between technical inventions, which will of course continue to be protected by patents, and software, which is, in any case, already protected by copyright."
"The question is whether we opt for ten to fifteen back doors and the attendant legal uncertainty or for small and medium-sized businesses’ freedom to develop?"
"If, today, you decide in favour of the Council’s Common Position, you will be choosing to leave the barn door wide open to the patent business as a whole, which will progressively take over the European market."
"You will thereby be voting for software to be fully covered by the TRIPS agreement, and in favour of ideas becoming tradable commodities on a market in which small and medium-sized businesses will have no chance whatever to keep up, because the costs involved in developing patents and defending them in court are too great."
"It is not acceptable that every small or medium-sized business should be required to seek out a patent attorney to defend its own innovations."
"If, though, you add your support to the broad support that already exists for the 21 amendments, you will be giving innovative and creative SMEs room to move, that is to say, the space and opportunity to develop."
"These 21 amendments represent our attempt at correcting the mistake made by the governments, who had obviously taken the wrong boat and had bowed to pressure from the industry."
"Let us not harbour any illusions about the fact that industry wants full patentability for software, as a good source of additional income with which to fill up the cash till and, of course, as a way of driving small and medium-sized businesses, along with innovation, out of the marketplace."
"That much is quite clear from some of the advertisements placed in and elsewhere by such companies as SAP and the like."
"Take a look at them, and you will realise just what the Council’s Common Position really adds up to."
"The 21 amendments will enable us to have a free market, with companies competing in the market rather than in a court of law, and so I ask you to support these 21 amendments, which we urgently need if European innovation is to develop."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is indeed of huge importance because the stakes are extremely high."
"Intellectual freedom, technological innovation and Europe’s economic competitiveness are all in jeopardy, as scientists, professors, the student community, a number of organisations and small and medium-sized enterprises have all correctly pointed out."
"The common position adopted by the Council on 7 March of this year is as unacceptable as the proposal for a directive tabled on 20 February 2002."
"Parliament had its say on the matter on 24 September 2004, yet the Council completely disregarded its opinion, and that is unacceptable."
"As we said at the time, it is wrong to award patents to ideas, to knowledge and – who knows where it will end – to life itself."
"Accordingly, as we proposed at the time as regards the proposal for a directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, we advocate that the Council common position be rejected."
"This is the most appropriate course of action at this time, and the only one that will prevent innovation and knowledge from following a very dangerous path."
"As we know, the current copyright system already provides substantial protection for authors of software, giving them control over how their work is used."
"Yet it is wrong to jeopardise the idea that any person who knows how to do so should be able to sit at a computer and write the software that he or she wants to, or that businesses should be able to develop specific software to cater for their needs."
"To concentrate the right to create software in the hands of the few would lead to dangerous restrictions."
"As we have seen, software has contributed towards the development of economies and has made it possible to make many tasks automatic and simplified at relatively low cost."
"Under a legal framework in which software is governed by patents this would not be possible."
"A business or a person at home would be forced to hire a team of specialist lawyers before designing new software to check whether the idea might infringe a patent."
"This is therefore very dangerous ground."
"Unlike normal patents, which protect an invention, software patents actually encourage the improper use of ideas."
"In other words, software patents are tantamount to an attack on intellectual freedom and on European industry’s ability to create and develop new ideas."
"What this boils down to is that software patents are simply legal mechanisms for concentrating the development of knowledge and the capacity for innovation into the hands of large multinational corporations such as Microsoft and others."
"Individuals and micro- and small and medium-sized enterprises would not have the wherewithal to compete in the courtroom with large companies over an abstract idea."
"It is therefore crucial that we reject this Council position."
"As far as our Group is concerned, there is no need for any directive in this area, but were such a directive to exist, let us ensure at least that people’s rights to create innovative ideas and their intellectual freedom are safeguarded, and we trust that the proposals for amendments to which we put our name will be adopted."
". Mr President, computer entrepreneurs are amongst the most independent spirits in the world."
"I know how they feel, faced with the prospect of this directive."
"They, as much as anyone, reject the concept of restrictive monoliths."
"They know that the EU is just such a monolith."
"The directive is typical of the monolithic actions that they seek to reject."
"I have worked hard in recent weeks to help computer SMEs resist this directive."
"However, I have come to realise that the amendments proposed by the rapporteur do not change the fundamental problem."
"Mr Rocard is trying to remove non-technical features of computer-controlled inventions from the scope of the directive."
"That in itself is laudable, but he is not seeking to stop the directive overall; in fact he is supporting it."
"As such, small computer companies are left, one might say, between a Rocard and a hard place."
"Mr Rocard goes as far as to state in his explanatory statement that he supports the Council’s position in principle."
"His amendments do not reject the concept of harmonisation."
"They explicitly support it."
"One of them even says that the objective of the directive – namely to harmonise national rules on the patentability of computer-controlled inventions – cannot be properly achieved by the Member States."
"Sadly, Mr Rocard is one of those people, typical in the EU, who increasingly seem to think that the European Patent Office is some sort of subsidiary of the EU, when in fact it covers non-EU countries as well."
"I reject this directive completely."
"That is why I will vote against it and Mr Rocard’s version of it."
"I have always said that, if the EU is the answer, it must have been a silly question."
"Today that is patently obvious!"
". Mr President, at the outset I would like to pay a personal tribute to the rapporteur, Mr Rocard, who has had a very difficult task in trying to find compromises and agreements on this."
"However, it also saddens me to say that there have been many times when I have listened to the debate on this issue both in the committee and here in the Chamber and it seems that we are totally unconnected with the reality of what is happening outside these walls."
"Innovation is the very key, the very engine that will drive our economies."
"When people speak about ensuring that other people can use software patents, they seem to think that everybody can come up with these ideas themselves and do not need any protection or grounding in those ideas."
"However, from what we see from some of the people proposing some of the amendments and from some of the lobbying that has taken place on this issue, they simply want a free-for-all: no protection within the European Union, and what would that lead to?"
"That would lead to American companies, Japanese companies, or other companies patenting the very ideas that European software developers, European innovators, have come up with and forcing those same European innovators to have to buy them back."
"Patents are not a sword."
"Patents are a shield."
"They are there to defend ideas."
"We should ensure that the rules and regulations that we set down guarantee that those innovators have those protections and have those rights."
"Some of the speeches in the Chamber here and some of the lobbying material I have received over the last few weeks on this issue concern protecting small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I shall give you one example: In the innovative computer technology sector in Ireland, there are 100 00 jobs, 62 000 of which are in small and medium-sized enterprises."
"They fully support the common position on this issue, and that is why we would urge all Members to think with their hearts, but most importantly with their minds, about what protection they would like to see if they have ideas."
"This is not about harmonisation; this is more about mutual recognition of 25 varying and different regulations in the Member States to ensure that small companies, small innovators, can be guaranteed legal certainty and financial certainty with regard to the protection of their ideas and the promotion of them."
"– Mr President, are computer programs patentable?"
"The giants in the IT world, such as the US companies IBM and Microsoft, have no doubt about it."
"For the majority of innovative SMEs, but also for professionals linked to the software industry, such as programmers, researchers and independent developers, the patentability of computer programs will be tantamount to a death sentence."
"This weighty issue has shuttled back and forth between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers for over two years now."
"The result of this parliamentary marathon could be the approval of a Bolkestein Directive – yet another – on the patentability of computer programs."
"The European Patent Office, contrary to both the letter and the spirit of the law, has issued over 30 000 patents to projects for mathematical calculations or methods of processing or displaying data."
"Often, these patents are as wide-ranging, trivial and damaging as their equivalents in the USA."
"I believe that the patentability of computer programs must be rejected for many reasons, the main reason being that computers use languages and that the words of a language cannot be patented, as this would prevent others from using them freely."
"It is the specific combination of these words that is protected, a protection achieved by copyright in precisely the same way as copyright in music covers a score, not the musical notes themselves."
"Moreover, this is precisely the principle established by the Munich Convention."
"Why revise this part of established law?"
"Why abolish copyright?"
"Abolishing it would make it impossible to write new computer programs."
"How can we imagine life in a country where a company could be granted exclusive rights just because its document contained letters in bold script and sub-titles in italics or used the progress bar, the double click or the electronic shopping basket - things that have already been patented in the USA?"
"We must refuse the Commission and the Council this licence to kill off innovation by the small software producer."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while I am obliged to the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs, I particularly wish to put the spotlight on our own group’s shadow rapporteur, Mrs Kauppi, who has endeavoured in a quite splendid fashion to hammer out sensible compromises and reach a sound solution, thereby demonstrating expertise to an extraordinary degree."
"The work she has done on this leads me to hold her in the highest regard."
"Let me once again spell out something that became apparent from the debate in the Committee on Legal Affairs: nobody, that is no political group, wants software patents, although I cannot exclude the possibility of private individuals doing so."
"That, in any case, is not what this directive is about; it was in fact intended to prevent the law developing in Europe in the way it has in the USA."
"That is its purpose, a purpose that the Common Position fulfils."
"At the end of May, we received a position paper from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Munich and Upper Bavaria."
"Rather like the Irish situation that Mr Crowley described earlier, the greatest concentration of small and medium-sized software developers in Germany is to be found in this area around Munich."
"They organised a hearing, the result of which left no doubt about the fact that they believe that the Common Position – capable of improvement though it is, of course – meets the conditions laid down and resolves the problems."
"In the Committee on Legal Affairs, we made a whole array of vital improvements to the Rocard report by way of 39 amendments, making some things clearer – such concepts as ‘interoperability’ and ‘technical definition’, for example – and creating options."
"What the Committee on Legal Affairs has produced, then, is a report characterised by moderation and making it possible to resolve any problems that still remain."
"Mr Rocard’s amendments, and those put forward by the other groups in this House go well beyond what is intended."
"A few months ago, we sat down together here and renewed our commitment to the Lisbon Process, at the heart of which – among other things – is a knowledge-based society in Europe."
"Having no raw materials, we have to rely on our brains, our knowledge, and the skills of our people."
"If we were to allow a situation, brought about by excessive amendments, in which most of Europe’s high-technology could no longer be patented, we would be jeopardising the means for future generations in this continent to earn a living, and so this position is indefensible and the overwhelming majority of my group will not countenance it."
"Let me touch on one other point, and a significant one, that being the issue of what people are calling motions to reject the Common Position."
"This is an option that our group will, this evening, have to consider, and two factors make it worth our while to do so."
"The first is that we gain nothing if, as a result of the Committee on Legal Affairs’ amendments, we have to endure a long conciliation procedure, only to see the directive lost at third reading by simple majority."
"Secondly, we do not want to end up with a directive that is so warped by Parliament’s amendments that it ends up being detrimental to the Lisbon process and to Europe itself."
"If that is what it is going to be like, then we would rather not have the directive at all."
"This issue, then, is one on which our group will be reaching a decision this evening."
"Mr President, the introduction of patents for computer software will not only be damaging for European small and medium-sized enterprises, scientific research and the IT sector as a whole."
"It would above all be damaging for the average citizen, who has a computer on his or her desk and who already pays through the nose for expensive, protected software."
"Assessments by independent experts have shown that the Council common position would enable the patenting of computer programs."
"The text that Parliament received two years ago, however, can be said to sneak this possibility in through the back door."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted amendments that fail to ensure that a proper compromise will be reached, and that do nothing to remove the most important areas of controversy and doubt, especially with regard to the most pressing issue, namely the definition of what may be granted patent protection."
"They will do little to help us move away from the overly liberal practices currently employed by the European Patent Office when assessing applications involving the use of computer programs."
"They lack the useful provisions of the Draft recommendation for a second readingof 29 April and 4 May 2005, which could have contributed to making a clear distinction between what is and what is not an invention."
"There is a real threat that the directive will not have a harmonising effect, since not only does it not clarify the most controversial issues, but it even strengthens existing doubts."
"It can also be interpreted as evidence of the overly liberal practice of considering solutions involving the use of computer programs to be inventions, pursuant to Article 52(2) and (3) of the European Patent Convention signed in Munich."
"It is our duty to vote in the spirit of the first reading and in the spirit of the ideas put forward by Michel Rocard, and to support the decisions of our colleagues in the previous parliamentary term."
"We must do so not only to ensure that their work does not go to waste, but also, and primarily, in order to protect the free software market, to protect small and medium-sized enterprises and to boost the development of innovation."
"At the same time, we should not forget that intellectual property must be guaranteed proper protection within the common market."
"Mr President, the issue of the territorial limitations of contributory infringement is the reason why software product claims were originally written and permitted by the European Patent Office."
"The new approach in my Amendment 66, eliminates software claims and therefore the concerns they raise, but extends contributory infringement provisions that already apply within most Member States so as to cover imports from China, Russia or elsewhere."
"This proposal, along with those for monitoring the European Patent Office, sits more conveniently in the context of the Community Patent and how it may be properly administered, which is where this whole matter really belongs."
"Mr Rocard, your amendments really focus on little more than programs on personal computers rather than the vast array of important technology that depends on computer-implemented inventions."
"Almost all areas of technology are linked with use of programmable apparatus."
"From fermentation control for antibiotic growth to aeronautics or telecommunications, the list is endless."
"Programmable devices are everywhere, in almost everything you can plug in or switch on, and your amendments interfere with them in apparatus and method terms, not just software."
"Your simplistic exclusions of data processing exclude signal processing and digital technology."
"Information is a term used since the earliest times of radio to distinguish signals from noise."
"Applied natural science excludes engineering."
"The expression ‘controllable forces of nature’ is a legal nightmare for many Member States."
"Collectively, your terminology wipes out patentability throughout huge areas of technology, not just programming."
"If you wished to construct a series of amendments to cripple and disperse Europe’s industry, large and small, you could not devise anything more mischievous."
"I am sorry but, for the real world of industrial technology, your blunderbuss amendments are simply not good enough."
"Mr President, this misleading and ambiguous Directive is a dream for patent lawyers and at the same time a nightmare for small software companies, consumers and freedom of expression on the net."
"Because we are dealing with a Directive that is rejected by more than 90% of small software companies in Europe."
"We are dealing with a monopoly directive – a genuine monopoly directive – since it is an anti-liberal directive."
"It is a Directive that promotes a world like that of the Rockefellers and Morgans at the beginning of the last century."
"It is a world that does not benefit small European companies, whose number is increasing, often in the least-developed regions of Europe, such as Extremadura, in Spain, where hundreds and hundreds of new software companies are being developed."
"These companies are under threat, as are those being developed in Poland and in all the enlargement countries."
"There have been many lies here."
"It has been said that we are against patents on technical software: that is not true."
"We are of course in favour when it comes to the physical world, the forces of nature: a washing machine, a car ... nobody is against those patents!"
"But we are obviously against patents that truly threaten the flow of information and innovation."
"Much has been said about innovation."
"There has been confusion between patenting freely in an unrestricted fashion and innovation, which are two entirely different things."
"What we are defending is the right to develop software, to develop the industry."
"And this Directive is going to create restrictions and many obstacles to true innovation within this continent called Europe."
"We believe that we deserve a world of software, a world of enterprise, a world for consumers, that is open to true innovation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although it is stated in the common position that there is a desire to exclude the patentability of pure software, the conditions are, in fact, being created for eventually patenting software algorithms."
"Unlike copyright, which protects the whole program, software patenting would allow a monopoly on the use of general instructions."
"By patenting those algorithms, in a complex program that is nothing more than a combination of thousands of instructions, hundreds of patents could be simultaneously violated."
"Linux, for example, which is now used in various programs including those used by governments, is said to violate 283 US patents."
"Introducing patenting rules could therefore mean the end of a free and open source software, at least in Europe."
"If the patentability of software were approved, as US multinationals and the European countries that profit from the US monopoly very much want, a shift in costs would occur from the technology and innovation sector to the legal and insurance sector."
"All of that would contribute to excluding small and medium-sized enterprises from the process of software development because of the costs and the legal complexities."
"All in all, there would be less competition and less innovation and European consumers would have to put up with increased costs and reduced choice."
"The Lisbon Strategy on the European economic model combines together technological innovations, competitiveness and solidarity."
"The Council position is at odds with that, however."
"The software patentability directive, attacks the right to the free transfer of knowledge and calls into question the objective of an information society that is accessible to all."
"For that reason, the battle against the patentability of software that we are conducting in this House has become a battle for freedom and democracy."
"Mr President, the reason why we have a proposal on patents for software-related innovations to consider is that current practice leaves something to be desired."
"Differing opinions about whether software can or cannot be patented make the legal framework ambiguous, and so the logical way forward would seem to be to introduce fresh legislation in this area."
"The question remains whether the common position offers a balanced solution that is appropriate for both large and small companies."
"It is unfortunate that even experts have been unable to state whether the directive will promote innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises, or whether it will in fact put obstacles in their way and hamper innovation."
"It has proved impossible to remove the fear of unwanted consequences among small enterprises, to whom the following three aspects are of major importance."
"The first is the accessibility of patent applications."
"The costs involved in obtaining a patent are prohibitive, and to this the directive offers no solutions."
"The second aspect is the extent to which SMEs can protect themselves once they have a patent."
"Is it practically feasible for them to constantly monitor whether another company is infringing it?"
"Moreover, they do not have the personnel or financial resources to cover themselves against accusations of infringing other companies’ patents."
"The directive in this form entails the risk of a considerable level of litigation involving software-related innovations."
"Thirdly, there is the problem of high licence fees when small companies use software produced by patent holders."
"Moreover, it is unclear what the impact of the directive would be on the use and development of open-standard software."
"Although this House has tabled amendments in an attempt to address the areas of concern, these have met with little response from the Council."
"As the common position as it stands is unconvincing and the Council seems unwilling to change tack again, the common position should be rejected."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, innovation and research have to be a shared heritage and not a privilege for the few."
"It must therefore be forcefully stated that the patentability of software as such must be prevented."
"It is important to point out this principle, in order to obtain a directive that represents a legitimate middle way between uncontrolled patenting, which risks paralysing innovation and competition, and the need to adequately safeguard those who, by means of their own inventions, can genuinely present added value in the market."
"We call, furthermore, for patent applications to be assessed with the greatest of attention, account being taken of innovation, originality and industrial applicability."
"This is the only way to prevent an excessive extension of patent rights prejudicing small and medium-sized enterprises, and, consequently, the proliferation of patent disputes, as has been happening for 15 years now in the United States."
"To conclude, we believe that it is a positive idea to create a fund offering financial, technical and administrative support to SMEs moving towards patenting."
"In particular, we believe that it is crucial to draw up an appropriate European patent regime, aimed at guaranteeing equal access for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the space of a few years, the constant flourishing of ideas in the information technology sector has enabled the gaps in technology and information to be reduced."
"Software patenting stifles free invention – which up to now has been possible even without much capital – in order to protect a monopoly on the use of generic techniques, the outcome of mercantile absolutism which is extremely dangerous in political terms."
"It is a serious bar to the freedom of ideas and to their reinterpretation, which serves only to hold businesses and government administrations hostage to the Microsoft lobby and to the small number of non-European multinationals."
"Patents amount to a danger to the development of open source software and a threat to all of the Italian and European information and communication businesses – which are primarily small and medium-sized enterprises or even microenterprises – as well as an economic threat to the diversification of government information systems."
"To defend the freedom of scientific research, the right to the transfer of culture and knowledge, not to say the protection of individuals’ fundamental rights, we have to save Europe from software patenting by opposing the European directive that proposes to introduce it and by supporting the amendments tabled by Mr Buzek, Mr Rocard and Mr Duff."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I particularly feel the need to congratulate Mr Rocard, Mrs Kauppi and Mr Lehne on the work they have done, as well as all of those who have dedicated themselves to these extremely difficult negotiations."
"I have to say that the Committee on Legal Affairs has reached an acceptable balance in keeping with the cultural choices and the debate that has taken place up to now in this Chamber and elsewhere."
"Naturally, it is my duty to uphold this balance, because it is a product of this Parliament."
"Like all of those closely following the issue, I too consider it useful to have a harmonisation directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, the objective of which is to eliminate the ambiguities and uncertainties arising from the adoption of various interpretative practices by the patent offices of the Member States and to precisely lay down the scope of such protection."
"It must, however, also be taken into account that adopting the patenting directive can only spur on the process of technological innovation if two fundamental factors are resolved."
"Firstly, the ambiguity surrounding the concept of technical contribution has to be eliminated, as it would thwart the effectiveness of the directive as a means of harmonising the procedures for issuing patents."
"Secondly, a precise and incisive provision on the issue of interoperability has to be adopted, preventing the development of standardised solutions in the field of ICT."
"The goal of harmonisation cannot be achieved if it conflicts with the principles on which the existing patent regime is based, which, over the years, has proved to be a suitable instrument and an effective incentive for the world of industry, for both small and large businesses."
"One need only think of the increasingly frequent convergence of information technology and telecommunications, allowing businesses to supply and use integrated software packages and computer-implemented services."
"In order to allow these new packages to be suitably developed, we must ensure that it is possible to combine copyright protection with patent protection for computer-implemented inventions, without software being patentable."
"Particularly in these difficult times, Europe has to address the issue of competitiveness."
"Patenting has to aid the European economy and European citizens."
"If the directive were not clear, it would work to the advantage of non-European businesses and we would be failing in our job and in our duty towards the Lisbon Strategy, towards the new social project about which so much is spoken and towards development."
"As I have already said, the Commission has carried out a valuable piece of work because it has been able to go beyond the common position."
"The task of fine-tuning the text by pointing out the unclear points is now the responsibility of Parliament."
"If that does not occur, the Commission will be responsible for a non-sectoral proposal, which is almost impossible to specify, rather than for a comprehensive proposal on patenting as a whole that can satisfy small and large businesses."
"I should like to address this request jointly to Parliament and to the Commission."
"Mr President, the previous speaker, Mr Gargani, has expressed his concern about the balance of the position that we adopt with regard to this proposed directive."
"I believe that the rapporteur, Mr Rocard, and Mrs Berger, in their Amendment 53, have emphasised what the objectives of this balance should be, when they say, ‘the conditions for granting patents and the modalities for enforcing them must be carefully designed. In particular, inevitable corollaries of the patent system, such as restriction of creative freedom, users’ rights or legal insecurity and anti-competitive effects, must be kept within reasonable limits’."
"The amendments presented by Mr Rocard and Mrs Berger are intended to maintain that balance, firstly, with regard to inventions applied by computer: we are not talking here about computer inventions."
"Computer inventions — computer programs — are already protected by a Community Directive of 1991, which established intellectual property rights or, if you like, authors’ rights."
"And that Directive is in force."
"What we are talking about here is something completely different: inventions applied or assisted, as some amendments put it, by computer, that is to say, equipment that uses computer programs."
"We must take enormous care not to confuse the two things and as a result prevent the exercise or development of creativity by computer."
"Specifically, Amendment 50, presented by Mr Rocard and Mrs Berger, aimed at maintaining the right to inter-operability of computer programs, is very important."
"The fact that there may be a patent on a particular aspect of a computer program must not prevent creative freedom or the use of computer programs for continuing development."
"That inter-operability clause, which is advocated in Amendment 50, is also advocated in a slightly different text – Amendment 68 — by Mrs Mann, Mrs McCarthy and Mrs Roth-Behrendt."
"In conclusion, we must prevent any possibility of the development, experimentation, manufacture, sale, the grant of licences and the import of programs that make use of a patented technique in order to ensure inter-operability from being considered a violation of patent."
"In summary, the amendments presented by Mr Rocard and Mrs Berger are aimed at maintaining the possibility of creativity in this field and at ensuring that, where possible, projects such as the LinEx project, implemented by the , in Spain, can move ahead to the benefit of creative innovation within the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, patents are an important factor in technological progress."
"It is necessary, however, to think back to the original significance of the pact between the inventor and society, by which the inventor has a temporary monopoly of exploiting the invention, whilst society benefits from the increased knowledge arising from full disclosure of the content of the patent and therefore the basis for further progress."
"I believe that it is desirable to analyse how certain patents are presented."
"I have the impression that we are witnessing a growing trend towards generic patents, precisely in order to make the claims as broad as possible."
"It appears to me that law firms have gained the upper hand and that the loser in this game is society as a whole."
"That must be particularly stressed with regard to software."
"In actual fact, a great many of the patents granted are nothing more than a vague description of a logical process."
"As far as software is concerned, I believe that copyright protection is sufficient."
"With this in mind, I supported many of the amendments tabled by Mr Rocard, whom I thank for his commitment as rapporteur."
"In that regard, I indeed believe that the period of protection could be shortened."
"If, however, inventors aim for a higher level of protection, such as a patent, they will not be able to waive full disclosure of the invention and they will have to make that the mandatory basis for the claims."
"That also applies more generally in order to limit the possibility of legal uncertainty."
"From that standpoint, I believe that Parliament has to carry out a more decisive role in the context of strengthening the Union, partly by setting out a common position in respect of the European Patent Office."
"Personally speaking, I am in favour of a reform simplifying the procedures, including the adoption of a single language, that is to say, English, by means of rules also allowing small and medium-sized enterprises to utilise this fundamental instrument."
"Mr President, I have to tell you that the whole debate in this House about software patents largely gives the lie to the constantly-repeated mantra disseminated by the European institutions throughout the continent, not least by means of Commission and Council initiatives, to the effect that we want to do all we can to protect the vital interests of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The software industry has grown well and prospered in Europe, and it has done so on the basis of perfectly adequate rules on copyright andreverse engineering, those in some areas derived from patent."
"Why, then, do we need these new rules in the first place, when over-regulation is so much in the air?"
"If what is now proposed for software patents actually goes through, it will benefit only two or three big firms, mainly Microsoft and SAP, one American and the other a major German firm, and perhaps also Siemens and firms of that kind."
"It will, however, damage the vital interests of many small and medium-sized enterprises that have been very successful over recent years."
"The rules on software patents that we are debating here today could well turn out to be a job-creating measure – the jobs in question being created for lawyers, who will have a lot to do if we do not reject the demand made of us today."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over and above the official statements, a change has been added to Article 2 allowing patent protection to also include the software contained in a computer."
"That opens the door to the patentability of software."
"It is as though it were possible one day to patent scales, notes and chords."
"It is as though the pentatonic scale were patented, as a result of which all of a sudden a large proportion of blues music would be in violation of such a patent and all writers would have to pay royalties to whomever had registered it."
"Patents have already been requested for ideas that are not new, such as the mouse click to carry out a command or the inequality operator in open source software, and for other unoriginal ideas that are today used in practically every software package in circulation."
"Furthermore, if interoperability were to be obstructed by patents on programs and consumers were forced in all cases to only purchase and use products made by the same company, there would be huge consequences, mainly of an economic nature."
"No company must be able to build a monopoly through patented software."
"A small business would find itself having to sustain enormous expenses, on the one hand in order not to carry out any violation of the patent, and, on the other hand, to defend its own actions in court."
"Competition would therefore no longer just be a market issue, but would also become a legal issue."
"Let us think about all of the university and hospital research institutes that today, thanks to the absence of this directive, carry out research by saving on software because they use programs devised by the institutes themselves, and which are therefore free of charge, or alternative software costing much less than Microsoft products."
"Without patents on software, Europe could keep costs low, stimulate innovation, improve security and create employment."
"To the title of the ‘Patents are smart bombs’, I would add ‘against the prospect of enabling the future interaction of different cultures and worlds’."
"Mr President, software programming is of enormous importance to my constituents in Ireland."
"So much so, I have received literally bags of correspondence asking me to vote one way or the other."
"Understanding the nuances and repercussions of our decision is certainly not an easy task."
"Today, what we are talking about, to put it simply, is the ownership of ideas."
"In software, the great ideas of yesterday are the building blocks of the great ideas of tomorrow."
"These ideas can be used by all to further the science and to drive progress."
"One of the beauties of the software industry is that a lone programmer can sit down and write an interesting program."
"He can give it to others in exchange for a fee or he can put it on the open source domain where everyone is free to use it and to add to it."
"By its nature what he has done is straightforward and millions of people do exactly what he has done."
"That is what has driven innovation to date and has propelled forward the information society and the state of the art."
"How much innovation do you think will occur if that lone programmer needs to contract a team of patent lawyers?"
"If we here tomorrow decide to add patentability to software, programmers all over Europe might be breaking the law without even knowing they were doing so until it was too late."
"If we allow patents, how much of the creativity and freedom to think will be stifled by the fear of infringement of one of the hundreds of thousands of patents that will exist?"
"Patents that are registered or bought will control the very tools the programmer must use to exist as a programmer."
"I urge Members to support every amendment that retains freedom from patentability."
"This will give us the strongest position when we negotiate with the Council."
"Mr President, in the same way that a doctor should not harm his patients, this Parliament should not harm the societies that have elected it."
"Our first concern should be for freedom, and in particular for freedom of economic activity."
"This begs the question of whether any rules are needed in this matter at all."
"Given that we have witnessed the unprecedented development of computer software over the past decade or so, do we now really need to introduce detailed rules to regulate it?"
"Things were going well, so why spoil them?"
"The economic success that has been achieved is obvious, and any new rules we adopt now would only stand in the way of further success."
"Competition is absolutely crucial, since it is the ‘yeast’ of economic success, or rather the driving force behind it."
"On the one hand, it is true that large companies have opportunities to conduct new research that are not open to small companies."
"On the other hand, however, once large companies gain a monopoly they have a tendency to fall victim to lethargy and stagnation."
"Monopolies are never conducive to economic success, whether they are state monopolies or monopolies held by large companies."
"When we vote on this report, and above all when we vote on the amendments to it, we must take care not to bring about a monopoly held by large companies, as this would be extremely damaging."
"Above all, we must remember that we should not harm small or medium-sized enterprises for the sake of economic success."
"Most importantly, we should not harm the average users of computer programs, since this would turn out to be in no one’s interests."
"We are in favour of protecting freedom and economic success, rather than oppression and lethargy."
"The only directive that comes into consideration is one that clearly establishes the criteria necessary to distinguish between patentable inventions implemented by computers from non-patentable inventions, thus providing effective protection for such inventions in the EU Member States."
"The directive should bar the attempts to patent unpatentable items, such as trivial non-technical procedures, trading methods and the patenting of pure software."
"The main point is the draft amendments whereby the phrase is to be substituted by the phrase or , and which define the concept of and, more precisely, which also define the terms that are important for judging the technical nature of the invention, and clearly establish that the rights to pure software, or even to media, are not inadmissible."
"Otherwise we will be unable to support the draft regulation."
"Mr President, although it is claimed that we are debating one of the most controversial pieces of legislation, that would be the case only if half of us were in favour of it and half against."
"The proportions are, however, quite different, for the overwhelming majority in this House endorses the objective of this legislation, embodied in the unambiguous principle that software alone is not capable of being patented."
"This legislation does no more than to protect software by way of copyright."
"Just as not just individual sentences are protected by copyright, but rather the book as a whole, so it naturally follows that not merely individual lines of software are protected, but rather the work as a whole."
"What our economy does, of course, need, though, is patents, for patents denote and indicate a knowledge-based economy, which produces such things as technical advances, inventions with such additional requirements as novelty, whether they be computer-based, computer-implemented or computer-managed."
"Why do we need this legislation?"
"We need it in order not to end up in the situation that pertains in the USA."
"We are well aware that over 30 000 patents have already been taken out on software, and we want to stop that going on in the future. The legislation is needed if we are to do that."
"We are in fact protecting ourselves by having the Commission monitor this and report back to us in three years’ time as to whether, despite our efforts at closing them by way of the latest compromises, there are still loopholes, and if there are, it must report them to us, while also giving us an account of the ‘open source movement’ that will enable us to turn our attention to that in three years’ time and close any loopholes that may have opened up."
"This is not, therefore, the end of the story, and not just because we have yet to reach agreement with the Council; we will also be continuing to observe the way in which our legislation is put into effect and will reserve the right to take further action in three years’ time on the basis of what emerges from that."
"We have the opportunity to lead the world with good patent law, but are we up to the task?"
"The legal framework is clear: Article 52 of the European Patent Convention states that software as such cannot be patented."
"All of us believe that we must set clear limits to patentability."
"We simply do not agree on how best to do that."
"We need to tighten up the law and ensure that examination practised does not permit the patenting of software or business methods."
"However, let us not forget that it is our inventiveness and capacity for innovation in software and dependent technologies that can help Europe to meet its objective of being the world’s most competitive economy by 2010."
"At a time when our traditional industries are migrating to China and the Far East, we have to rely on our inventiveness to earn our living."
"The revenue secured by patents and by licensing out our inventions to our global competitors gives us a return on the investment and assists us in creating jobs and growth."
"SMEs that are inventors argue that without patent protection they are in no position to negotiate with big business or protect themselves from larger companies ripping off their inventions."
"They need patent protection that is affordable and enforceable against industry giants."
"But we must also ensure that small software developers are not faced with a minefield of trivial patents."
"They must be able to innovate, write and develop lines of code and produce software processes without violating or breaking patent law."
"There are a number of amendments that could solve this problem so we can have a balanced, workable EU law which will not permit backdoor patenting but will ensure that, in an increasingly cut-throat and global arena, Europe’s most inventive companies can have access to patents and challenge US dominance in this field."
"Mr Crowley said that we could find ourselves in the perverse situation of paying out licence fees to US and Japanese companies for the very patents and innovations that we have invented."
"In fact, add India to that list."
"In its new Patents Act of 2005, India now allows embedded systems to be patentable."
"Are we seriously saying that here in Europe we value our inventiveness less than those countries new to innovation and inventions?"
"Mr President, Parliament faces a great strategic challenge to create a regulatory framework that will stop the spread of patentability of software."
"Tactically, our first task tomorrow must be to defeat the simplistic proposals to reject the second reading."
"We must ensure that we are able to progress steadily to amend the common position."
"It is simply through the conciliation procedure that a first-class piece of law will be created."
"To fail to legislate at all would leave the industry at the mercy of the EPO, the courts and the panels of the World Trade Organization."
"I am afraid that would be a costly, legalistic and confusing situation."
"Mr President, the way in which the software patents proposal came about is, to my mind, scandalous."
"Big businesses, such as Microsoft, see software patents as a means towards financial gain and, through the , they have had a hand in drafting the Commission proposal – a fact discovered by accident, as a result of the name of the author being left in the document by mistake."
"The Commission’s proposal bears the stamp of the incestuous culture of patent office managers, big companies’ patent lawyers and the Commission’s patent managers."
"Even though this House took corrective action in 2003, the Council of Ministers managed, by dint of dubious voting procedures, to put the proposal back on the table."
"There was no qualified majority of Member States and requests by various Member States to reopen negotiations were rejected out of hand."
"Even in the Netherlands, the debate about software patents is dubious."
"While parliament was misinformed by the government, the Dutch officials continued to work on the proposal within the EU committees."
"The Dutch minister ignored parliament when decisions were taken in the Council of Ministers."
"I therefore support the amendments to reject this proposal."
"In my view, this House is making itself a laughing stock if it tolerates the way in which this legislative proposal came about."
"Mr President, in 1991, Microsoft was a small company that had to compete against the bigger ones."
"Then Bill Gates told us that industry would grind to a halt if all our old knowledge were subject to patents, with a handful of giants able to impose unlimited payments on newcomers."
"Now that his firm is one of the giants, his lobbyists tell an entirely different story."
"The campaign against software patents has been going on for a long time."
"Their opponents persevere and have sound arguments."
"I agree with the ‘Foundation for a free information infrastructure’, which claims that software patents put the freedom of software development at risk, and that software patents, by promoting monopolisation and pushing up prices, are detrimental to innovation."
"That, in turn, impacts on software companies, Internet shops, schools and consumers."
"Do we want to create a situation in which computers are in the hands of one, or a few, software providers?"
"Tomorrow, we need at least 367 votes to amend or reject the Council’s text."
"I urge all those opposed to software patents to be present in force."
"We will then choose open source and creativity rather than the concentration of power and monopolisation."
"Mr President, I wish, today, to address those who are not here – not all the 450 million Europeans, but those who are waiting outside this Chamber, and those who pestered us with -mails, faxes and telephone calls."
"I think it is wonderful that they did so."
"What we are seeing happening today and will see happening tomorrow is important in terms of what democracy will be like in the Europe of the future."
"People are getting worked up about things that will affect them."
"We have seen for ourselves how the multifarious arguments put forward in this House are often far more astute, far more detailed, and far more precise than what we ourselves are capable of coming up with amidst the deluge of other decisions that we have to take."
"After five years in which Members moved 5 500 amendments and voted on 50 000 additional items, none of us can claim to have really got to the bottom of it all."
"The input we received was good; it won me over."
"I am persuaded that we will be doing democracy, small and medium-sized enterprises, even, indeed, economic prosperity a favour if we vote against these software patents."
"As for those standing outside with their whistles and T-shirts, I would like to encourage them to stick at it, to publish the results of the vote, to show how each one of us actually voted."
"That way we will see whose bidding the Members of this House have done: that of the parties with their resolutions, that of the lobbyists, or that of their own consciences."
"Mr President, it is still persistently asserted that the proposal we are debating today would affect mainly small and medium-sized enterprises, and in a negative way at that, but it is mainly SMEs that stand to gain from greater legal certainty and a uniform application of the legal rules on the internal market."
"I have always believed, and I am still convinced, that SMEs do not have a specific problem with this proposal, but a general problem with the patent system as such, both in terms of access and justification."
"At first reading, we voted on an amendment in which the Commission was requested to report on the effect of computer-implemented inventions on SMEs."
"At that time, I specifically asked the Commission to carefully reconsider the way in which, via a European approach, SMEs can be guaranteed a more advantageous position as regards patents."
"I was delighted to find another four amendments in the Rocard report in which particular attention was drawn to this sector of industry."
"Many SMEs, though, consider this to be mere lip service, far from sufficient, and something in which they no longer have any confidence."
"They want facts and results, and so there are several things I would like to be told."
"Why has the Commission, since it became aware of this issue and these concerns among SMEs – which was back in early 2002, three years ago now – not taken any concrete measures that would benefit SMEs?"
"Surely there is plenty of material to work on, since tens of thousands of computer-implemented inventions have already been patented in Europe."
"Secondly, will the Commission be doing something concrete for SMEs and what does it have in mind?"
"I would like to have a clear answer."
"My question expresses the concern of large groups of SMEs and your response, Commissioner, will influence the way I vote tomorrow."
"Mr President, the proposal for a directive by the Commission and the Council is unacceptable for a number of reasons."
"The most important of these is the fact that in Article 4 it does indeed prohibit the patenting of computer programs, before immediately afterwards, in Article 5, leaving the door wide open to such patents if they relate – and I quote – to ‘a programmed computer [or] a programmed computer network’."
"The question arises of what is really at stake here."
"In my opinion, what is at stake is the enormous market for software that exists in the European Union, and the establishment of a monopoly over it."
"What is at stake is at least several dozen billion euro."
"The threats posed by the unamended directive are as follows."
"Firstly, that the software market will be monopolised by major players from outside Europe who are powerful in financial terms."
"This is very dangerous for the EU in the global environment, where everyone competes with everyone else."
"Secondly, that a number of small and medium-sized computer enterprises involved with software in Europe will be made bankrupt."
"Thirdly, that those holding the patents in, and hence the monopoly over, the services sector, by which I also mean Internet services, will dictate the prices."
"Fourthly and finally, that a major threat will be posed to democracy in Europe, given the importance of the Internet as a media form."
"In his capacity as rapporteur, Mr Rocard has put an enormous amount of effort into getting to grips with this complex issue."
"His proposals defend ‘open source’ principles, which is laudable, as well as defending democracy against the dictatorship of monopolies."
"At this stage in the legislative process, they will result in a conciliation procedure, which I believe will give rise to the optimum solution."
"Like mathematical theories and the very process of thought, software cannot be patented."
"What can be patented, however, are inventions created with the help of computers, and indeed this already happens."
"Such patents contain technical ‘independent claims’, which relate to tangible systems, and ‘dependent claims’, which are only valid in the context of a given patent, and which may include references to computers and all aspects of their operation."
"This field of invention, which is key in terms of the automotive, home appliances, mobile phone and other industries, for example, should however be regulated."
"In patent law, an invention is subject to a special form of legal protection."
"It is not the tangible implementation of a particular idea that is protected, but the idea or concept itself."
"Therefore, the invention is always something intangible."
"This dual nature of patent protection gives rise to difficulties with the effects of patent law in real life, when it comes face to face with the interests and rights of the creators of software."
"The problem, therefore, is that on the one hand there are companies wishing to use patent law to protect their investments in research and development, while on the other hand there is society, and the individuals in it, striving to retain a range of common intellectual achievements available to all."
"As lawmakers we must take both sides, of those who believe that the dividing line is beginning to encroach upon territory that has traditionally been the subject of patent protection and of others who stand in opposition to the belief that the common position of the Council does not totally exclude the possibility of the patentability of software."
"The majority of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs come close to bringing about a more balanced definition, so they seem to me to be a useful addition to the common position and a good basis for a final decision."
"Mr President, today is an important day for the European Parliament, as we have a real opportunity to prove that this House does in fact represent millions of Europeans."
"The reason for this is that we can defend – and defend very effectively – the interests of millions of computer owners, as well as the interests of hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"E-mails and letters have been written and appeals made asking us to do so."
"In my opinion, the European public has suddenly realised that a Europe of citizens needs the European Parliament."
"We should not act as the spokespeople or lobbyists of large companies; instead, we should act as the spokespeople of the grass-roots social movement that is campaigning against misguided decisions by EU institutions."
"These decisions may only be put right by another EU institution."
"The issue at stake here is not only, and not even primarily, patents for computer software."
"The most important aspect of this debate is the public pressure, which opens up an enormous opportunity for Parliament to represent citizens not only in splendid theoretical pronouncements, but also in practice."
"We should seize this opportunity."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unlike many Members, I wish to point out that, in the course of our deliberations, all – or at any rate, most – of us have agreed that we want patents in the field of computer-implemented inventions, and that our European industry’s great strength is dependent on us getting them."
"The present situation is schizophrenic in that businesses wanting to take out patents in this field can do so, and the Commission proposal actually did no more than argue in favour of more harmonisation across Europe."
"I think all Members will agree that the second thing we want to avoid where patents are concerned is to go down the road taken by the Americans, which would make possible such things as the patenting of software-to-software, when what we want, to put it quite simply in computer language, is software-to-hardware."
"The great problem we now have is to really tidy up the language."
"With the vote due to be held tomorrow, I would like to again ask the Commission how this can be done in view of the very large number of amendments before us, the main ones being those relating to interoperability, tabled by Mr Rocard and others, by Mrs Kauppi and by me."
"I would like to know where the Commission stands on these various proposals, most especially as regards compulsory licensing or limited exclusions for simple software-to-software."
"Perhaps the Commissioner has something further to say about this?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as radical Members we have been engaged in this issue, particularly with Mr Cappato, since the last parliamentary term, and we have made Parliament’s position very clear, but it has not been accepted."
"Today we find ourselves debating it once again, in a situation in which we have speeches from the far right to the far left of our Parliament in support of the market, something that, as a Member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I particularly welcome."
"It is a market threatened and corrupted by the jungle of the bureaucratic army, which, as a supporter of the large monopoly and oligopoly groups, is prepared to use the language of bureaucratic legal power to prevent the practice of free invention and free trade."
"I believe that if tomorrow we adopt Mr Rocard’s amendments and the amendments that I myself have tabled, together with another 50 fellow Members including Emma Bonino, we will have a strategy and a winning opportunity."
"Failing that, I agree with Mr Duff, when he states that the conciliation procedure will no longer only have to reckon with the failure of Spain, Austria, Belgium and Italy to vote in favour of the directive, as in May 2004."
"I am, in fact, sure that we will succeed in shifting the positions of the Commission and the Council in the direction of liberalism and fairness."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the value of innovations and the importance of the knowledge-based society have often been affirmed in this Chamber."
"We have been told that the intellect will come up trumps for us, that it is the trump card that Europe can play in an increasingly global economy."
"Every bit as important, though, as the development of this intellect is, of course, the prevention of the theft of our ideas by others."
"Imagine an inventor investing, over two years, millions of euros in an invention, only for someone, three months later, to produce a copy of the invention, put it on the market and rob the inventor of the rewards of his labour."
"Patents protect the weak; they protect inventors against those who wield market power."
"Patents decide in the intellect’s favour when it contends with the power of the market, and they do without reference to the size of the business concerned."
"I am far from satisfied with the way this debate has gone over recent weeks."
"We have ended up with an over-heated atmosphere, with an unparalleled lobbyists’ feud, and we have to admit, if we are honest, that what we in essence have to do, even though we have got as far as second reading, is to take decisions about a multiplicity of wordings, and that we are, at this stage, able only to a limited extent to gauge the likely ramifications of the many positions that have been taken up."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has made forty amendments to less than ten articles."
"We have dozens more amendments to consider, and have scarcely any idea what their effects will be."
"It has slowly dawned on me that the time is not yet ripe for a decision on this dossier, and we really should consider the possibility of rejecting the Common Position and thereby bringing the legislative process to a temporary halt."
"If it were possible to do that, that might be the most responsible decision we could take at this stage."
"I have been following the debate on the draft CII directive with great interest, for one thing because of its importance (I am convinced that this is one of the most important drafts before this House), but also because I have never in all my career as a member of a national parliament or the European Parliament seen a piece of draft legislation that has been so misunderstood or misinterpreted by so many people."
"We have heard so many things already in connection with this directive – about Microsoft, about Linux, about the interests of multinational companies and small and medium enterprises, legal software, open source code and copyright – that we have lost sight of what is really important, of what this is all about."
"The important thing is Lisbon."
"The important thing is the knowledge-based economy and society."
"The important thing is that we need to be able to protect the knowledge we create."
"And the primary market means of protecting knowledge is the patent."
"It is a discredit to Europe that the common European patent was not able to come into being, despite the fact that it is indispensable in order for knowledge and innovation to result in investment and profits."
"We now have an opportunity to make progress in the field of patent legislation, and to do something to ensure that protection of knowledge is reinterpreted to meet the demands of the 21st century."
"It would be naïve to think that this directive is a completely new concept offering something in qualitative terms that previous legislation did not."
"It does not represent something new and revolutionary; it represents acknowledgement of the simple fact that this modern world of ours is based on digital information and high-tech solutions, and that these are such an integral part of our everyday lives that it is impossible to conceive of development and technology without them."
"We need this directive."
"Mr Rocard has done an important job in attempting to reformulate the framework of the directive, and he deserves credit for it."
"He is not to blame for the fact that it did not succeed; this is probably as far as it was possible to go."
"It is very important, however, that the software patent directive should come into being in the form proposed by the Commission – or with a few amendments."
"Without this directive, Europe will end up at a competitive disadvantage compared to all those regions that are not afraid to adapt their own systems to the requirements of the modern age."
"There are also other solutions for protecting innovation."
"But patents are the solution that establishes a connection between an invention and its market utilisation, and elevates knowledge to an economic factor."
"Let us not allow this solution to slip away, because only a strong European economy is capable of upholding the European values that every one of us in this House represents."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two worlds are at this present moment calling on the European institutions to be able to outline a more open and more flexible strategy on such an important issue for the development not only of the economy, but also of society."
"They are therefore calling on us to amend the common position in terms of greater openness and flexibility."
"They are two important worlds for Europe and for its future, that is to say, the world of small and medium-sized enterprises and the world of young people."
"Many Members have already spoken about small and medium-sized enterprises and I agree with the demand for greater flexibility, in order to avoid tightening up the directive on patenting. That could amount to an obstacle to the activities of small and medium-sized enterprises, becoming an anti-competitive threat to their development."
"I should like to highlight the expectations of young people."
"I believe that on very few other subjects discussed in this House has there been such strong mobilisation of young people, of movements and of associations using software not only to communicate and to learn, but also as an occupation, as independent work, and for a thousand uses midway between the voluntary sector and the new professions, which are independently managed and are also highly important to the development of a society with a more open economic system that is more closely linked to the ability of young people to organise themselves."
"I believe that we have said many times, for the most part rhetorically, that Europe is in tune with young people."
"Today we have the opportunity – and I hope that Parliament does not waste it – to genuinely be in tune with these demands made of us by young people and with the numerous movements that have expressed themselves, and I believe that Parliament must not let them down."
"With that in mind, I will support the amendments tabled by Mr Rocard and Mr Duff and by other Members, with a view to improving the certainty and clarity of Europe’s common position."
"I believe that we need to be consistent on two points."
"Firstly, if we maintain that software cannot be patented, we must be careful not to extend the scope, because by doing so we would risk contradicting ourselves."
"Secondly, it is important to guarantee patent protection, but we must not let that lead to inflexibility and a concentration in the hands of a few people, since that would hinder development and innovation in Europe."
"Mr President, three years ago, if someone had asked anyone in this Chamber whether they knew what a computer-implemented invention was, most people would have said ‘not really’."
"You all saw the demonstrators outside today."
"Some of them were a little aggressive."
"One of them jumped right in front of our car and a computer-implemented invention called ABS brakes probably saved his life."
"This has been an ongoing story."
"There have been many very interesting turns in the plot."
"First of all, there is a dramatic first reading in the European Parliament."
"Secondly, our position is totally rejected in the Council."
"Thirdly, the Commission refuses to go back to the first reading."
"Fourthly, we have a dubious common position from the Council and now, fifthly, we stand at the end of the second reading."
"I am afraid this piece of legislation is going to be rejected tomorrow, as Mr Wuermeling said."
"I do not know whether that is good or bad, but I know two things and I have two messages."
"One message is to the ‘David’ group, in other words the Open Source and SMEs."
"This would not have been such a bad thing after all, had we worked it through."
"It would not have prevented the Open Source from going on."
"As a Finn, I can say it would not have prevented Linux being invented and developed."
"To Goliath, or the bigger companies, I say ‘get your act together’."
"Your lobbying was miserably bad. The Open Source folk beat you hands down, by 100 to zero."
"The question then is what does this mean institutionally?"
"Institutionally, I have a message for the Commission and Council."
"The European Parliament is a co-legislator."
"You should take it seriously."
"When you see this proposal being rejected tomorrow morning, you should go back to the drawing board and come up with a new piece of legislation."
"Europe needs some form of patentability on computer-implemented inventions, but tomorrow we are not going to get it."
"Mr President, the fierce debate on this directive shows that democracy works."
"Just yesterday on the train to Strasbourg petitions were being pushed into the hands of travellers, and there has been an excessive volume of emails on this subject."
"Things are getting out of proportion, and that is the case here."
"Not even some time in the future will they be able to patent a mere computer programme with no technical impact, and the excellent open source idea will not perish after this directive comes into force either."
"This I would venture to claim, coming as I do from the same country as the Linux system."
"On the other hand, if this new directive should be toppled it could mean a new setback for European competitiveness."
"There will be still less left of the Lisbon declaration if we kill this directive."
"That it would set the big, bad supranationals against SMEs has been exaggerated and is an artificial argument."
"Many SMEs have been in contact with me from my country, Finland, and they say they will benefit from this directive."
"It would at the same time protect them and their innovations from the big companies."
"The big companies will always get by even without rules, but clear rules, on the other hand, always benefit the small ones."
"I am not among those who object to patents in principle."
"The patent is one of the traditions of the European spirit."
"It is the foundation of the modern, successfully functioning market economy."
"It provides certainty and is, moreover, protection against the pirates."
"Why should we not patent computer-implemented inventions, which benefit us all in our everyday lives?"
"At present, there is no harmonised legislation on patents in Europe."
"That creates an uncertain operational environment for businesses and investment."
"Indeed, we need good and transparent patent legislation for the sake of employment."
"Hopefully, this will not turn into another example of how Europe shoots itself in the foot and weakens its competitiveness."
"Mr President, this is a very complicated issue, which is the subject of a huge amount of lobbying by various groups."
"I think it splendid that, for once, people are paying attention to what we are about here in Parliament, a state of affairs that is something of a luxury for us."
"It is important to have an efficient European patent system."
"It is only right that individual inventors and companies should be able to take out patents on their inventions, including computer-implemented inventions."
"However, the current trend is for pure software also to be accorded patents, something that is not to be commended."
"We need researchers, innovators and individual program developers to be able to come up with new ideas without being in danger of infringing trivial patents and ending up involved in interminable lawsuits."
"Firstly, we should reject the whole of the proposal and call upon the Commission to come back with a comprehensive proposal for a Community patentthat covers all inventions."
"It is wrong to isolate software-related inventions as a sector in its own right."
"Secondly, we must amend the common position, which is not a sound legal document."
"It contains far too many ambiguities."
"On the basis of the majority of Mr Rocard’s proposals, we can perhaps bring about a constructive compromise for the benefit of small, large and private companies."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are few directives that have provoked such heated debate."
"In my opinion, there can be no one here today who has not heard the impassioned arguments of both advocates and opponents of this directive."
"The directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions goes a long way towards defining the rules of play in the fastest developing sectors of the European economy, but a fervent debate has erupted over the ambiguous interpretation of the term ‘program as such’, which precludes exceptions from patentability."
"I am in favour of consistent protection for software in the form of protection for the creative solution inherent in a whole program or part of a program, but I am opposed to patents being granted for individual ideas."
"Instead, patentable inventions must be solutions that combine an idea with its technical execution, for example car safety systems."
"Protection for individual formulae, commands or instructions would quite clearly be a step in the wrong direction."
"I am not opposed to patents in general, but I cannot consent to the adoption of this directive in the version proposed by the Council, which in my opinion admits several interpretations."
"It is for this reason that I will only lend my backing to a version of the text that eliminates the possibility of alternative interpretations and that makes the text more precise."
"The set of amendments tabled by my group represents an attempt to rectify the problems I have just mentioned."
"I feel obliged to say that for my part, I regard the position adopted by the Council as most regrettable, since it has ignored the request made by me and many of my colleagues – and backed by Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs – to resubmit the directive for first reading."
"I believe that the Council would do better to listen to our comments, since this would encourage mutual respect between Parliament and the Council, at the same time as boosting cooperation between these two key institutions."
"I should like to finish by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Rocard, and, in particular, our group’s shadow rapporteur, Mrs Kauppi, for their excellent work."
"Mr President, the debate on computer-implemented innovations has been an interesting, passionate debate, but unfortunately most of the contributors have taken either a black or a white position."
"Everybody realises that this is an extremely complex issue."
"Referring to it in biblical terms does not help because it continues to put the various arguments into compartments."
"On the one hand, we have heard, with regard to this directive, that if we do not come down on the side of patents in general, we will stifle innovation and make Europe less competitive."
"Therefore, we will be going against what we have been trying to achieve through the Lisbon Agenda."
"On the other hand, we have heard that if there is regulation of patents, this will add to bureaucracy and affect the consumer."
"According to one speaker, that will be a threat to democracy."
"I personally believe that we have to view the whole issue globally."
"First of all, it is pointless for us to concentrate in Europe on this particular matter without taking into consideration the entire matter of patents."
"Secondly, as regards Europe’s position in a globalised world, it is pointless for us to legislate whilst not being part of an international legislative structure which encourages other continents and developing or developed countries to participate on an international plane."
"Mr President, this is a complex and technical issue and I wish to thank the rapporteur and, in particular, the shadow rapporteur from my Group for her work on it."
"Anyone who has been subject to the lobbying from both sides in this debate will have heard convincing arguments for and against the common position proposed."
"I have a number of points to make in the brief time available."
"Firstly, it should be stressed that the Patents Directive is not proposing the introduction of a new patents system into the EU, but instead harmonising and bringing consistency to patent offices throughout different Member States."
"Whatever your position on patents, you must agree that the current situation, in which 25 national patent offices have no consistent approach, does not contribute to an integrated and functioning common market moving forward."
"However, it is true that in recent years the software and IT industries in the EU have been thriving under the current position."
"So why do we need a common approach?"
"SMEs in particular seem to be split on this issue."
"Some people have decided to create the impression that this is an issue pitching the large multinationals against small SMEs."
"This is not the case from my experience."
"SMEs very much fall on both sides of the argument, some wanting to protect their ideas and inventions and others fearing a patents minefield with the proposed common position."
"Nobody in this House wants to vote for a situation that will in any way harm the future thriving of SMEs."
"I want to focus briefly on two key issues of this directive: firstly, the definition of what we propose to allow patents on."
"We are not proposing the patenting of software as in the US."
"That should be stressed."
"If amendments need to adopted to clarify that point, then so be it, although the current wording is not bad."
"Copyright is there to protect software."
"The second key question is the issue of interoperability, and the McCarthy amendments in this area are worth supporting."
"We must ensure that the equipment or networks required by multiple users to allow innovation are not withheld from the market."
"In particular, this is the case for Open Source and the Open Source movement that has been so successful in recent years."
"In conclusion, people are beginning to take a very pessimistic approach at this stage and, on balance, the overall proposal is likely to be rejected tomorrow."
"That will spell a very serious failure of the institutions to find common ground and agreement on what is a very important area for the European economy generally."
"Mr President, the legal status of computer programs has been clearly defined for a long time."
"Software is protected by copyright, and the European Patent Convention precludes the patenting of computer programs."
"Both legal academics and IT specialists are opposed to there being any change in this situation."
"The only purpose of the Council directive is to sanction the practices of the European Patent Office, and these practices are both misguided and dangerous."
"Speaking on behalf of Professor Buzek and on my own behalf, I would therefore call on the House either to vote in favour of all of the 21 amendments in this package, which restore the meaning the directive had after first reading, or to reject the directive altogether."
"As noted by the German Parliament in its resolution of 17 February 2005, patent inflation brings with it the risk of a swing in public opinion regarding the effectiveness of a patent system as a tool for innovation and progress."
"Given this context, it is therefore Parliament’s responsibility to put on the brakes."
"There is no need for the scope of patent law to be extended to cover computer programs."
"The main argument in favour of patent law was the desire to protect investments."
"Tangible innovations require lengthy testing, followed by capital investment, before any profit is derived from them."
"Investment in IT assets is usually small, however, if at all noticeable."
"There is therefore no need for them to be granted additional legal protection."
"There is absolutely no truth in the claim that software patents, as interpreted by the European Patent Office, represent an opportunity."
"Patents also involve risks, and must therefore be used with care."
"Many myths and half-truths are told about patents, and I shall cite a few examples."
"It is a myth that the economy always benefits when patent rights are granted."
"Officials often measure economic innovation by the number of patents, but these can harm investment by limiting competition."
"There are a large number of leading IT companies that have never applied for patents, and virtually no IT specialists are interested in patent descriptions."
"No one has succeeded in proving that there is a direct link between patent expansion and economic growth."
"Another myth is that patents for programs would help small and medium-sized enterprises, since they would allow these enterprises to gain exclusive rights to their innovative ideas."
"Patents can act as obstacles as well as protection, however."
"It is very hard for smaller firms to obtain protection, since the costs of enforcing a patent are extremely high, and sometimes even 100 times greater than the costs of gaining the patent."
"What is more, it is also necessary to make lengthy enquiries to ascertain whether a certain invention has already been reserved by someone else."
"With regard to the IT sector, where it is especially easy to make small changes, patenting programs would be the equivalent of creating a minefield."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the basic duty incumbent upon EU institutions during the legislative process is to enact good, easy-to-understand and effective legislation."
"I do not need to remind the House of the number of times we have already heard assurances from both the President of the Commission and the representatives of the individual presidencies that this will be the case, and that Parliament is undoubtedly an important part of this process."
"Today’s debate marks the end of our work on a directive that is unfortunately an example of an entirely different approach."
"Both the Commission and the Council believe that their drafts are the only ones that are worth anything, and they have both rejected proposals by Members of this House."
"I would like to believe that things will change this time, and that priority will be given to the interests of millions of EU citizens and of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs."
"The latter provide jobs for 90% of workers, and this is something that should doubtless not be forgotten."
"It is for this reason that we cannot concentrate only on the interests of large and wealthy companies."
"The most serious doubts relate to the lack of any clear distinction between an invention, or in other words a patentable technical solution, and a computer program or an algorithm, be it a calculation method, a mathematical concept or a method of conducting economic activities, especially with regard to the retail trade."
"In view of this fact, the point of this harmonisation is highly dubious, to say the least."
"It is an unfortunate fact that the clause ruling out the patenting of computer programs as such will be nothing but an illusion, as is the case with the current practices of the European Patent Office."
"At the same time, the Commissioner informed us in his speech at the start of today's debate that this directive would not mean any changes in the EPO’s practices, which is an alarming statement."
"There can be no doubt that there is an urgent need for the harmonisation of patent law, among other things with regard to inventions made using computers."
"An essential prerequisite for such legislation, however, is that it is good, and good for everyone."
"Without the amendments of Mr Rocard and Mr Buzek, the directive will reinforce the overly liberal approach to the basic aspects defining the concept of an invention, as well as sanctioning this approach."
"I would therefore call on the House to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by Mr Buzek and Mr Rocard."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, do these two hours of debate give anyone the impression that we have a Common Position that is any use, one that we can adopt?"
"Does this debate give anyone the impression that this thorny issue has been sufficiently debated, that the time is ripe to vote on it, that we can muster the necessary qualified majority for a ‘yes’ to it or to the plethora of amendments?"
"I do not believe that they do, and there is a reason why they do not."
"The first reading was held on 24 September 2004, only to be ignored outright by the Council in its political agreement."
"Mrs Kauppi’s comment on the Council resolution was that ‘it seemed as if the Council wanted to disregard the will of Europe’s elected legislators’."
"The Council is itself unsure."
"On 21 December, at Poland’s request, the vote was dropped from the agenda."
"The German, Spanish and Dutch parliaments have expressed their opposition to the directive as proposed. Votes have been deferred for longer and longer periods of time."
"The European Parliament called on the Commission to produce a new proposal for first reading."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs, the Conference of Presidents, and the plenary itself adopted resolutions to this effect."
"What was the Council’s response?"
"It ordered that there be no debate, declaring that it was of the first importance that there be none."
"Controversial though it was, and even though the Treaty of Nice was in force, the political agreement was simply adopted. The consequence of that is a lack of satisfaction and 178 amendments on the table of this House."
"This Common Position contains things that I could enumerate point by point, and which are mentioned in the amendments, and they lead me to take the view that it does not make for legal certainty, fails to foster innovation, and frightens small businesses."
"We would therefore do well, tomorrow, to reject the Common Position and put all our efforts into harmonising European patent law, rather than adopting, and making do with, regulations that are controversial within the industry in question."
"A year has passed since I became a Member of the European Parliament."
"The subject of the patentability of software inventions is one of the most important subjects we have discussed during that period."
"A huge number of people have been involved in the discussion about this directive in my own country of Slovenia, as well as in other European countries."
"In this respect the proposed directive has already yielded positive results, as large numbers of citizens have become directly engaged in the democratic process."
"They have realised that the European institutions are not as remote as some of their activities might suggest."
"However, here in Parliament it is not the citizens who make decisions, but we parliamentarians who decide for them and make decisions in their name."
"What do I have in mind when I decide how to vote on the directive?"
"The fact that here in Europe we have to follow the goals of the Lisbon Strategy if we want to respond appropriately to the challenges of globalisation."
"We must exploit our competitive advantage over other areas of the globe and base our development on knowledge and research and the implementation thereof."
"We will be able to encourage people to engage in these activities if, amongst other things, we ensure that intellectual property is properly protected."
"Therefore, we must have the courage to provide a proper, uniform European legal system that will reward innovative work."
"I firmly believe that now is the time to adopt the proposed directive."
"In order to remove any anxiety about the patenting of programmes as such, it is right and proper that it is clearly stated in the directive that they should always remain outside patent protection and in the domain of copyright."
"I believe the directive should contain clear definitions of the basic concepts."
"Because of the important role of small and medium enterprises in the European Union, it is equally important that we take full account of the influence of the directive on their activities."
"Mr President, towards the end of what has been an interesting debate, it is time to get back to what we are talking about, the core of the matter."
"This is not an extension of existing patent law; it is not actually taking us into any new fields."
"The whole objective of this is to clarify the existing situation because the current patent law is being applied in an inconsistent way."
"In many cases companies who want patents do not know where they stand."
"They may get a patent from one country but not from another."
"At the same time, I think we are all agreed that we do not want to see the sort of patent regime that appears to be running very fast in the United States and other countries, where patents for what we might call relatively trivial inventions covering business methods or simple software which ought to be covered by copyright will not be covered."
"However, the main issue is: does the proposal in front of us actually achieve that?"
"Put yourself in the position of a patent inspector, where you are having to make a judgement about whether to offer patents."
"I suggest to you that this wording and much of the wording here is not only complex, difficult and opaque but actually goes in entirely the wrong direction."
"Part of the problem – and I sense it in a lot of the discussions here – is that many colleagues are not accepting the fact that in almost every field of technological invention, there is some form of digital technology."
"The notion of a computer aiding or controlling things is actually rather an outdated one."
"You carry in your mobile phone more computing power than a large computer of ten years ago."
"That is programmed by instructions and it is perfectly sensible for companies that have technical innovations encompassing that software to be able to protect it."
"I suggest to you that this is going in the wrong direction: it is not helping small businesses, it is not helping large businesses, it is not helping open source movement."
"We have to decide whether we have not failed completely in this and whether it is not time to start again."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Patent Convention protects the public interest by prohibiting the patenting of anything that is not a technical solution, and in particular of scientific theories, aesthetic creations, mathematical methods, plans or rules for performing mental acts and computer programs."
"Even though copyright makes it possible to prevent abuse in this field, around 20 companies have submitted over 20 000 applications for patents on computer programs."
"The latter include not only control programs for appliances ranging from washing machines to unique medical devices, but also pure software and business methods, such as the use of shopping baskets for Internet purchases."
"It is an unfortunate fact that national patent offices and courts reach different decisions on many cases, and this is why clear rules are needed at European level."
"I regret to say that we are still waiting for an up-to-date and general directive on the European patent."
"This fact makes today’s debate rather more complicated, as it concerns a specific directive that does not deal with concepts, but goes beyond the scope of the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Services (TRIPS) Agreement."
"The fact that large companies are in favour of the directive is doubtless an important factor, but a number of parties, including legal and computer professionals, the academic community, small companies and the Czech Senate, for example, have highlighted the directive’s ambiguity."
"Such ambiguity carries with it the risk that the directive’s provisions will be open to broad interpretations, which would have serious consequences for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and consumers."
"What is more, the Council has regrettably failed to submit an assessment of the directive’s impact on small and medium-sized enterprises and on the new Member States, as requested by Parliament."
"An ad-hoc, cross-party coalition has been formed in this House."
"Our aim is to reach a compromise agreement on joint amendments, and to allow the patenting of firmware, or in other words control programs for technical appliances, only in cases where it exists as part of an overall invention."
"We also want to increase interoperability for consumers, and to prevent the granting of patents for trivial ideas; after all, one patent costs EUR 30 000, and the approval process takes an average of four years."
"Since small and medium-sized enterprises act as the driving force behind the IT sector, accounting for 70% of turnover and 80% of jobs, both these factors act as obstacles to dynamic growth in this sector."
"We are therefore proposing that a clearer distinction be made between patents for machines and those for pure software."
"In conclusion, I should like politely to ask the Commission to state clearly what progress has been made on preparations for an up-to-date European patent."
"Unless the directive is successfully amended, my group as a whole would rather vote against it."
"Mr President, today we can choose whether we want old-fashioned patent legislation with an old-fashioned view of large companies and of development or modern, small-scale and creative development involving modern legislation."
"Everyone says that they do not want to see software patents."
"We have seen how disastrous it was when the United States introduced them."
"The only way of demonstrating our wishes today is to vote in favour of the 21 compromise amendments signed by myself and many others."
"We should then obtain intelligent, balanced legislation in which creativity and sound patent legislation have their place."
"A vote against would show that we were completely in the hands of the big companies."
"It would lead to legislation whereby programs used to run equipment became patentable."
"It would be like giving patent protection to equipment manuals."
"Such a world would emphatically not be modern."
". Mr President, those of you who have been directly involved in working on this proposal know that we are dealing with a very complex area."
"The directive cannot be turned on its head."
"What we need is a proper balance between stimulating innovation and making sure competition is not stifled."
"As Commissioner McCreevy said in his statement of March 2005, the ball is in your court."
"Whatever you decide, the Commission will take account of it and respect it."
"Should you decide to reject the common position, the Commission will not submit a new proposal."
"You should also remember that rejection would stand in the way of many European undertakings and go against our common Lisbon objectives of increasing Europe’s competitiveness."
"In the debate, various Members have raised the question of interoperability."
"On that issue the Commission maintains a certain degree of flexibility."
"Compulsory licensing schemes already exist in Member States’ legislation."
"It is a suitable solution, provided that non-discrimination between different software development models, ‘proprietary’ or ‘open source’, is ensured."
"Companies should be motivated to licence voluntarily."
"However, if rightholders abuse their rights by imposing unreasonable conditions, authorities should step in to ensure fair terms are applied."
"A limited interoperability exception, geared towards the promotion of open standards, could also constitute a sound approach, provided that international obligations are respected."
"Various Members also raised the question of copyright."
"Let me clarify that by pointing out that copyright is a separate and different right from patents."
"Copyright and patents protect different aspects of something which is new and original."
"So patents do not affect the existence of copyright."
"Copyright protects the expression of an idea, but it does not protect any invention and copyright protection does not prevent someone taking an invention and expressing it in a different way."
"With regard to small and medium-sized businesses and their access to the patent system, I should draw attention to two aspects."
"First, Members will be aware of the Commission’s proposals for a Community patent which would reduce the costs of patent protection throughout the European Union."
"Secondly, we have had a feasibility study done on the question of insurance against the costs of patent litigation."
"This study is now in a second phase and consultants have been asked to come up with concrete proposals."
"In view of the large number of amendments tabled, we are providing the secretariat with an overview of the Commission’s position on them in writing for inclusion in the verbatim report of this debate(1)."
"Finally, I hope that the vote will result in a positive outcome."
"However, should further work be needed to reach agreement with the Council, the Commission stands ready to assist both co-legislators towards reaching a constructive outcome."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Mr President having listened carefully to the various arguments presented during this morning's debate, I would strongly urge members of this House to give their support to the 21 compromise amendments which would stop the introduction of software patents in tomorrow's vote."
"If these amendments are not accepted then I and many others will vote against this resolution."
"This draft legislation works against the interests of European Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) operating in the software industry."
"If this legislation is adopted by the Parliament tomorrow it will stifle innovation and stifle vital European SMEs."
"The Parliament must vote against this legislation."
"We cannot afford to stifle vital European SMEs."
"SMEs are the lifeblood of job creation in Europe."
"Copyright does everything that it should do."
"Software patents are not the way to go."
"The Commission can accept Amendments 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,"
"provided the change is consistently applied: 14, 40, 72, 93, 114, 135, 158"
"15, 18, 21, 26-37, 43, 47, 58, 59, 60, 61, 63, 66, 75, 79, 90, 91, 92, 96, 100, 111, 112, 113, 117, 121, 132, 133, 134, 138, 142, 153, 154, 155, 161, 165, 176, 177, 178."
"The Commission can accept in the context of a satisfactory and balanced global package Amendments 5, 25, 48, 50, 67, 68, 80, 82, 101, 103, 122, 124, 143, 145, 166, 168."
"The Commission can accept subject to redrafting or recasting Amendments 4, 16, 17, 19, 22, 23 (repositioned in the text), 53, 85, 106, 127, 148, 171."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments 2, 3, 20, 24, 38, 39, 41, 42, 44, 45, 46, 49, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 62, 64, 65, 69, 70, 71, 73, 74, 76, 77, 78, 81, 83, 84, 86, 87, 88, 89, 94, 95, 97, 98, 99, 102, 104, 105, 107, 108, 109, 110, 115, 116, 118, 119, 120, 123, 125, 126, 128, 129, 130, 131, 136, 137, 139, 140, 141, 144, 146, 147, 149, 150, 151, 152, 156, 157, 159, 160, 162, 163, 164, 167, 169, 170, 172, 173, 174, 175."
"We now come to the votes."
". Madam President, I should just like to inform the House that it has successfully adopted, at first reading, a directive in agreement with the Council."
". – Madam President, just last week the entire world showed its sensitivity by giving a resounding 'yes' to the fight against hunger and poverty in Africa."
"These were not just musical notes; they were messages of humanity and support to a continent where millions of human lives, including small children, are desperately seeking a helping hand."
"Together with the other countries, the European Union was the first to respond to the global invitation."
"This movement highlights the need for both vigilance and attention on our part."
"The report on the exploitation of children in developing countries, with particular emphasis on child labour, is the first action which relates entirely to the phenomenon of child labour, which has taken on worrying proportions worldwide, especially in Africa, Asia and Central and South America."
"To be specific, 352 million children under the age of 18 are working."
"Approximately half of them are in an environment which puts their physical and mental health at risk, while 1 800 000 children are used by prostitution and pornography gangs."
"This phenomenon applies not only to developing countries, but also to the European Union."
"I need only remind you that, in Eastern Europe and in the Mediterranean area, 5 million children are subject to exploitation in the workplace."
"However, it is the 121 million children – including 65 million girls – who never went to school that are sounding the alarm bell."
"In 1990, the conclusions of the World Summit for Children included the objective of ensuring that, by 2000, every child in the world should have access to education and at least 80% of them should have the opportunity to finish a basic education."
"The countries must realise that, if they do not invest primarily in the quality of their human resources, they are condemned to perpetuate their under-development."
"This is the main element which I wish to mention in my report."
"That concludes the vote."
"I am glad to be able to welcome to the House a delegation from the Indian Parliament, who are sitting in the Official Gallery."
"The delegation is composed of four members of the House of the People and three members of the Council of States, led by the Vice-President of the Council of States, Mr Raman Khan."
"On behalf of this House, I welcome this delegation, which is in Strasbourg for the European Parliament’s twelfth Interparliamentary Meeting with India."
"Last year, a working party from this House met with their Indian counterparts in New Delhi, and this visit confirms the renewed interest in an exchange during the present Parliament, both the Indian parliament and our own being newly elected."
"We particularly welcome the ongoing and ever more fruitful cooperation with India, and we will play our part in deepening the cooperation between our Parliaments."
"A warm welcome to you!"
"Mr Ciampi, ladies and gentlemen, it is our honour and privilege to receive in this House today the President of the Italian Republic, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi."
"We all know and remember him as a brilliant Governor of the Bank of Italy, the Prime Minister who had to face difficult times within the Italian political system, the skilful and tenacious Finance Minister in the Prodi and D'Alema governments and today a President of the Republic much loved by all Italians."
"I believe that, at this particularly difficult time for Europe, we should remember that President Ciampi was the minister who made a decisive contribution to Italy’s entry into the euro, and it is good to remember this at a time when some people are beginning to see the euro as an uncomfortable straitjacket rather than an instrument that is fundamental to prosperity and economic stability."
"The first time I had the opportunity to meet President Ciampi personally was last October, in Rome, at the signing of the Constitutional Treaty."
"Your personality, Mr President, and your views on European integration made a profound impression on me on that occasion."
"I already knew the politician, but in Rome I had the opportunity to get to know the person who has always fought lucidly and passionately in favour of a Europe that is a guarantor of peace, democracy and economic and social development."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a man who has always remembered the state Europe was in at the end of the Second World War and who has witnessed the realisation of the dream of those people who laid the foundations for the Europe we have today: a Europe that, in many people's eyes, above all amongst the younger generations, gives the impression that there is no need to mobilise wills in order to ensure its continued existence and progress."
"We Members of the European Parliament know that that is not the case, that Europe cannot build itself, that peace is not certain, peace is never certain and, of course, it would not have been ensured without the success of the European project."
"The Europe we have is not an accident of history, it has not appeared by chance, nor is it written in the stars, and it requires a great effort to make it a reality."
"It is necessary, but in order to make it a reality, the efforts of many people, of you, Mr President, and of all of us, is required."
"It is the result of a slow development during which we have ‘made the path by walking’, which involves commitment, enthusiasm and sometimes disillusionment."
"President Ciampi has come to the European Parliament today at a time when we are experiencing a degree of disenchantment."
"He will help us to understand why, because he is well aware that Europe was a dream based on peace and cooperation."
"That dream is a reality today and, for that very reason, it no longer inspires dreams, it has lost its capacity to make people dream."
"We need to find new elements, new ideals shared by everybody, different to those of a few decades ago, in order to ensure that Europe once again inspires enthusiasm, that it makes people dream, that it makes them want to turn the need into a reality."
"I believe that Mr Ciampi’s presence is extremely appropriate in this debate on the future of Europe and that by being here today, he is symbolising the start of that debate."
"That is how I believe we should interpret his presence in the European Parliament, because we perhaps need to create a new young Europe amongst all of us, in the style of Giuseppe Mazzini, and this year, the bicentenary of his birth, we should remember his idea that democracy and freedom unite people regardless of where they live."
"Mr President, we are convinced that your visit, your example and your words will be of great assistance to us at the difficult crossroads Europe is facing today, so that we can make further progress on the construction of a Europe that is able to guarantee not just peace and cooperation, but also prosperity and security, and that is able to do in the rest of the world what it has done here: create a society based on respect for diversity, on the integration of differences and the construction of a common identity."
"Mr Ciampi, it is an honour for the European Parliament to welcome you and I give you the floor."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for your warm welcome and I thank you, in particular, Mr President, for the cordial words with which you chose to present me."
"It is a deeply felt honour for me to speak in the most elevated surroundings of European democracy, to make the voice of the Republic of Italy heard in the heart of the constitutional system of the Union."
"It is with conviction that I use the adjective ‘constitutional’, because such is the legal system that we have been building together for 50 years, treaty after treaty."
"The European Union is not, and cannot be, just an economic free trade zone."
"It is above all, and has been since its beginnings, a political structure, a land of rights, a constitutional reality that does not contradict our beloved national Constitutions, but connects them and completes them."
"It is a political structure that does not deny the identity of our nation states, but strengthens them in the face of the large-scale challenges of an increasingly broad horizon."
"It is a land of rights, to which every other inhabitant of this planet can look with the confidence that here, more than anywhere else, the values of human beings are respected."
"The ambitious definition given to the Union by the Constitutional Treaty is a legitimate one, that is to say, ‘a special area of human hope’."
"From this position we must all go forward together, whether we be the 11 Member States which, like Italy, have already ratified the Constitutional Treaty, the Member States that are still to do so, or the two Member States that have said no."
"A single institutional framework joins us together irreversibly."
"It is already strong enough to enable us together to do many things for our citizens, in order to regain the popular consensus on the Treaty that has been lacking in many countries and to strengthen our institutions, which we have inherited from a successful past."
"Precisely because we are already a political and constitutional body, we can indeed realistically assess the meaning of the rejection seen in two countries linked from the start to the European project."
"As little as a few months ago, on the occasion of the formal signing in Rome of the Constitutional Treaty by the 25 governments of the Union, the single project met with widespread consent."
"Within the space of a few months, the fear spread that the citizens were excluded from crucial decisions regarding their future and concerns heightened over the lack of economic growth."
"Is it really legitimate, however, to interpret the outcome of the referenda as disaffection with European unity?"
"Is it legitimate to give in to the temptation of completely challenging the very project of the founding fathers?"
"If we raise our eyes, the Treaty of Rome of October 2004 rather appears to be the scapegoat of widespread unrest that does not so much relate to institutional order as to the government policies of the Union."
"We even note a paradox."
"The persistent call for a political revival of the Union, which is more urgent than the also necessary institutional reforms are, bears witness to the awareness of the common destiny on which a Constitution is really based."
"That is why we now have to think about the Union’s policies for the future, without, however, abandoning the constitutional design outlined by the industrious Convention."
"What does the future urgently demand of our Europe?"
"Above all, to borrow from Ortega y Gasset, it demands thatthe backbone of the Union should consist of measures of political cohesion, physical cohesion and social cohesion."
"The fundamental principle of subsidiarity has to be interpreted as a principle of political cohesion, allowing bottom-up participation in Community decision-making, starting from the thousands and thousands of town councils in our Union."
"The European Union has to exist starting from those levels."
"Europe also needs physical cohesion, transport and communication structures, which make Europeans more united while respecting the environment and the countryside."
"Lastly, Europe, which invented the welfare state, needs social cohesion."
"We cannot allow substantial disparities in living standards to persist among countries and consequently among the peoples to whom our international personality offers united representation."
"Europe consequently calls for the historical objective of convergence and cohesion to be achieved by means of appropriate policies for managing the economy."
"I have always believed, first as a banker and then as a politician, that the principle of free trade in the economic culture of the Union means being able to speak to the market in the language of the market, but that it cannot mean indulging all of its whims."
"It is the lack of political will from national governments that prevents their budget policies from being effectively coordinated."
"That makes it difficult for the Union to use a common fund, partly made up of Europe’s borrowing on the international credit market, to finance major infrastructure works of European interest and importantcommon research and innovation initiatives, and to create a legacy of common public assets."
"The Lisbon Strategy is the first link in a chain that should lead to the European economy being governable."
"The national governments must send out a precise message, made convincing by the allocation of public resources."
"The sought-after flexibilities must be utilised by businesses in order to gain in competitiveness and to increase their production base and sales in Europe and worldwide."
"Europe has to revive its own commitment to major Community projects."
"We have been successful on many occasions, including in recent years, for instance in CERN and the European Space Agency, with the ITER and Galileo projects, which have been a decisive step forward in strengthening Europe’s technological capabilities, and with the Erasmus project, which has opened up new European horizons to over a million young people."
"Airbus too is an example of what we can do together if we only unite."
"We can also look with confidence at the resourcefulness of the euro zone, which is now presided over by Jean-Claude Juncker, to whom I send my best wishes, partly on account of our long friendship and collaboration."
"The euro is the greatest demonstration of the united will of the European people, and a driving force of political integration."
"It is an encouraging sign of confidence that six of the ten accession countries have already begun to take part in SME 2, thus taking the first important steps towards joining the euro zone."
"The tangible benefits of taking part in the single currency are there for all to see: protection from imbalances on the exchange market, low interest rates and strengthened competition in those countries of the euro zone that have adopted virtuous policies."
"Would the ushers please remove that symbol immediately."
"Accompany the Member to the door, expel him from the Chamber!"
"Expel him from the Chamber immediately!"
"I said expel him from the Chamber!"
"Would the ushers please remove any symbol or element that may disrupt order in the Chamber."
"Please ensure that no element that may disrupt normal order in the Chamber remains."
"If there are any, remove them."
"I am sorry, Mr President."
"Please continue."
". We must record both the strengthening of the euro on the international markets and the policy of price stability pursued by the European Central Bank as extraordinary success stories, but we cannot settle for this situation in the long term."
"The confirmed, legitimate rigour of the Stability Pact does not in itself guarantee growth if inertia persists."
"It will continue to be difficult to see the positive effects of the euro if there is no coordinated management of either national budgets or the direction taken by the Member States’ economic policies."
"It is only on these foundations that the Union will be able to entirely achieve its potential, bestowed on it by the single currency, of being a global economic player and of consolidating an economic and monetary bloc capable of promoting the interests of the citizens and the rhythms of its balanced development."
"We now also confidently await an agreement on the financial perspectives of the Union."
"An open and frank political debate on the priorities for the Union’s actions is a positive step, but a Community budget needs to be approved as soon as possible that not only reflects a balance among the various requirements of the Member States, but is also based on consistent, inclusive objectives."
"I express in this House the earnest hope that the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, President-in-Office of the European Union, succeeds in the work he pledged to carry out before this Parliament."
"The vitality of the European model will also depend on the ability to mobilise new forces within our countries."
"Only by developing a dialogue and constructive coexistence between European citizens and non-European residents, in fact, will we succeed in strengthening the best aspects of our society."
"Finally, the future of our Europe calls for policies of security and peace."
"The international vision of the European Union, based on the primacy of the law, on trust and on the multilateral system, raises expectations and hopes throughout the world."
"Europe, however, will only be able to influence international balances if it is united."
"By acting alone, we would be at the mercy of events greater than us, events that threaten peace and European security."
"Consistent with that approach, the European Parliament has long raised the issue of the united representation of Europe in the United Nations."
"The resolution adopted in June, like the previous resolution of January 2004, stipulates that a single seat for the European Union in the UN Security Council is the objective that Europe must set itself."
"This clarity of vision is a credit to the European Parliament."
"The awareness of our common roots and the shared memory of the good and bad times of our history bear witness to a higher European interest harmonising national interests, protecting them from the excesses that plagued our past and promoting them within a common vision of our relations with the world."
"Enlarged Europe has now touched the boundaries of its cultural and historical identity."
"Although geography does not enable Europe’s borders to be identified with certainty, the common area of principles, values and rules conveyed by the European Union is today fully identifiable."
"Enlargement of the Union was an historical duty towards peoples who regarded accession to the Union as the guarantee of their regained freedom, the conclusion of nearly half a century’s anticipation."
"We expect the new Member States, which are entitled to live in a Union that is effective and united in relation to them as well, to provide a constructive and enthusiastic contribution, and we have already seen them do so."
"The enlarged Union will proceed as one."
"Precisely because it has become enlarged, however, it will require, more so than in the past, progressive measures indicating the path to follow in order to complete the union of Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is the duty of the European Parliament to reintroduce the European Union as a general feeling among people."
"It is your responsibility to respond to citizens’ requests for even greater democracy, transparency and governability."
"Ever since 14 February 1984, when the European Parliament presented Altiero Spinelli’s draft European Constitution, this House has constantly demanded greater involvement in amending the Treaties."
"Now, the most representative of the European institutions has the historical responsibility not to squander the founding heritage and to ensure that the period of reflection on the Constitution does not fall by the wayside."
"The very conclusions of the European Council of 16 and 17 June encourage a debate designed to generate interest and invite the European institutions to contribute to it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a long time ago now, I had the opportunity, as a university student in Italy and Germany, to witness the extent of the stupidity with which the European Member States, by means of the Second World War, began the slaughter of an entire generation."
"For that reason, I look with concern on every slowing down, on every crisis in the European integration process."
"I hope, however, that you have detected in my words a calm faith in the future."
"Halfway through the last century, great and wise men built a structure that cannot be destroyed, but, like lighthouse keepers, we have to take care to warn young people about new dangers."
"In the not too distant future I will come to the end of my term of office as President of the Italian Republic."
"Six years ago, after being sworn in, I concluded my address to the Italian Parliament with a declaration saluting and affirming my commitment towards Italy and the European Union, to which I believe I have remained loyal in these recent years brimming with history and changes."
"It is a commitment that I am pleased to reaffirm before you now."
"Long live Europe, long live the European Union!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say a few words of thanks to Mr Ciampi. I do not want to forget to do so as I have on other occasions as a result of the emotions of the moment."
"Having listened to you, Mr Ciampi, I believe I can say, on behalf of the great majority of Members of this Parliament, that this institution will remember your words."
"You have shown that you belong to the young Europe."
"Yes, the young Europe."
"Because, as Picasso said, ‘it takes a long time to become young’."
"And you have shown that it is possible to become young at a time when youth is precisely what is needed most."
"I am sorry about the incident, which in no way represents the majority of this House, quite the contrary, and I pray that the ideas that you have expressed here will help us in the debate we must pursue."
"You have said it very clearly."
"Allow me to thank you once again."
"Europe is a success story, but it could die from its success."
"In order to prevent this, we must not allow the most valuable and sensitive elements of our co-existence to become trivialised."
"We must not allow everyday reality to make us forget the value of what we have achieved."
"We must not allow something wonderful to be treated as something commonplace."
"We therefore thank you once again, Mr Ciampi, for being here with us and we hope that your words will be heard outside this Chamber."
"– Madam President, I am basing my point of order on Articles 166, 75 and 83 of the Regulation and on Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union, as Articles 75 and 83 of the Regulation refer us to the wording of the treaties."
"I shall be very brief."
"Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union stipulates that amendments to that treaty will enter into force after ratification by all Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements."
"Since Article 48 refers to all Member States, it is clear that the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty by two of them – France and the Netherlands – and by many more if the people had been consulted, has reduced the Constitutional Treaty to nothing and, therefore, I am afraid – and with all respect due to President Ciampi as a person and to his office – has done the same for President Ciampi’s speech."
"The members of the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy within the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have abstained from voting on the directive on the control of potato cyst nematodes, because they consider this directive to be disproportionate to the seriousness of the issue and as also failing to adhere to the principle of subsidiarity."
"The implementation of this directive will lead to high costs, resulting from the directive’s requirement that many samples be taken."
"The directive will also entail high administrative costs in connection with the data registers that have to be set up."
"We would add that these costs will in all likelihood be divided between the Member States’ governments and the respective sectors in different ways, and this will lead to distortion of competition."
". I voted in favour of this report because I feel that the agreement before us will make a significant contribution towards protecting migratory waterbirds."
"It will therefore address both the environmental concerns specifically on the birds in question as well as the broader issue of environmental conservation."
"The latter is an issue that should be very close to our hearts, in terms of the benefits that individual Member States can derive from their environment and, politically, in terms of the legacy of protection that we will pass on to future generations."
". I voted for this report."
"The proposal for a Council decision concerns the conclusion by the European Community of the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Water-birds signed by the Community on 1 September 1997, in force since 1 November 1999."
"It is one of Conservative of Migratory Species of Wild Animals."
"It protects 235 species of birds which are ecologically dependent on wetlands in particular in Africa and Eurasia."
"It requires coordinated measures for achieving and maintaining a favourable conservation status for migratory water-bird species using African-Eurasian flyways."
". The presence of softeners in plastic toys has, over the past seven years, been the subject of intense and emotional debates in both Parliament and the Council."
"I regret the fact that the debate was dominated by emotions rather than reason."
"This is something by which I was particularly perturbed during the debates at first and second reading."
"The common position is not entirely based on scientific fact."
"The subsequent tightening-up of the common position that Parliament has adopted today, and which has already been adopted by the Council, is even further removed from what can be deemed acceptable on scientific grounds."
"It is for that reason that I cannot endorse this added stringency."
"However, I am also realistic enough to recognise that voting against it now will make no difference, and have therefore abstained from the vote on compromise amendments."
"For more details, I would refer to my contribution to the debate of 5 July 2000."
"The arguments I deployed then are still as relevant as ever."
". A compromise agreement has been reached between the Confederal Group of the European United Left, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, in order to adopt the report by Mr Trakatellis on the use of certain dangerous substances, namely chemical elements added to PVC to make plastic smoother."
"Accordingly, we shall be able to conclude the process at second reading."
"We welcome the adoption of this report because it will lead to a permanent ban on the use of six chemicals in items for children, in the light of scientific studies showing that in some cases they can be carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic."
"This is a welcome decision and a positive contribution towards protecting children in particular and public health as a whole."
"– By voting for the gradual elimination of phthalates from toys, Parliament has finally stood firm against the intense lobbying by the manufacturers of toys and articles for children, upholding the principle of prudence and protecting human health."
"Toys made of soft PVC are all the more dangerous as children are inclined to put any object within reach into their mouths."
"Banning phthalates was therefore vital for public health."
"Today's vote is a success in those terms."
"However, this decision should be the forerunner of other decisions, because toxic substances contained in soft PVC are not only present in toys but also in other everyday objects."
"Parliament and the Council have rightly called for a study of other products made of soft PVC."
"If the industries really want to be as responsible as they claim, they must stop using soft PVC not only in toys but also in other products (medical equipment, floor coverings and food packaging)."
"Alternatives have existed for many years, and there is nothing to prevent our turning to healthy products of natural origin."
". I voted for this report to back legislation aimed at enhancing the protection of children's health and the building of consumer confidence through establishing a stringent regulatory framework to govern the manufacture and marketing of toys and childcare articles containing certain phthalates in order to reduce, as far as possible, children's exposure to substances which demonstrably give rise to or could potentially cause a health risk."
"I welcome the compromise reached in Committee to ban 6 phthalates in toys for children regardless of their age."
". This report has been a long time in coming."
"I fully support the restriction on the marketing of phthalates in children’s toys."
"Children’s health must come first."
"The following are three key aspects of energy security that were not duly taken into account in the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council."
"Firstly, greater use must be made of renewable energy sources."
"Secondly, balanced use must be made of different kinds of primary fuel."
"Thirdly, supplies from different production centres, such as oil and gas fields, must be diversified for each kind of primary fuel."
"I believe that it would have a very detrimental impact if EU policy in this area were to be continued, as this policy results in the complete dependence of Poland on one supply source, namely Russian oil and gas, in the name of security."
"The second leg of the Yamal pipeline, which is currently at an advanced stage of planning, must definitely be continued."
"All other projects, however, such as the pipeline under the Baltic or the ‘Amber Pipeline’, must immediately be suspended, as they represent a direct threat to the newly revived Ukrainian democracy."
"Energy security for the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy must not be achieved at the cost of Polish dependency on Russian oil and gas, and it must not pose a threat to the economic stability of Ukraine."
". The title of the proposal for a directive, and in turn of this report, conceals what it will really entail: namely the creation and functioning of a single market for electricity in the EU."
"Although the report states that its objective is to set up a framework in which the Member States will set out general, transparent and non-discriminatory policies on security of the electricity supply, this objective is in fact lower down the report’s list of priorities than the need for compatibility with the requirements of a competitive single market for electricity."
"The Commission’s proposal uses price rises as the main mechanism for driving down the demand for electricity, and as such the argument that the single market would bring lower prices goes out of the window."
"If you have any lingering doubts, simply take a look at the United Kingdom."
"The proposal also recommends that the Member States and the regulatory bodies intervene to support initial investment and the return on that investment, but restricts their ability to take action in other areas."
"I now turn to the report, which in some areas is a backward step from the Commission’s proposal."
"For example, it fails to provide specific measures for the regulatory body to take in the event of non-compliance on the part of the transport network when carrying out projects."
"Hence our vote."
". ""The draft directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to safeguard security of electricity supply and infrastructure investment regulates many areas of common European energy market."
"I indicate three major aspects of the energy security which are not adequately underlined:"
"· enhanced use of renewable energy sources"
"· balanced use of various types of primary fuels"
"· diversification of supplies from various production centres (oil and gas fields) within one type of the primary fuel."
"I consider it totally unacceptable to maintain the European policy in this respect leading, in the name of security, to complete dependency of Poland on one source of supply, namely Russian gas and oil."
"The well advanced in concept project of the second route of the Jamal Gas pipeline should be continued immediately."
"All the other projects (Baltic Sea bottom pipeline or so called ""Amber Pipeline"") should be abandoned as striking directly in newly emerging Ukrainian democracy."
"Energy security of Great Britain, Germany and Italy should not be achieved at the cost if Polish dependency and a threat to Ukrainian economic stability."""
". I voted for this report which proposes on the whole sensible and worthwhile amendments to the Commission proposal."
"The main provisions of the proposal are aimed at establishing measures ensuring the proper functioning of the EU internal market for electricity by safeguarding security of electricity supply and by ensuring an adequate level of interconnection between Member States."
"It also aims to establish a framework within which Member States shall define general, transport and non-discriminatory policies on security of electricity supply compatible with the requirements of a competitive single market for electricity."
"All these objectives merit support."
". I voted in favour of the report by Mr Chichester, because I feel that the objective of ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market for electricity in the Union and safeguarding the security of electricity supply is a vital one."
"The establishment of a framework setting out a transparent, non-discriminatory policy that is compatible with the requirements of a single market for electricity is crucial to the issue of security of supply."
"We should therefore support the measures taken to improve energy policies, given their vital importance to the quality of our lives, both now and for future generations."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have to defend Members’ freedom of debate from attempts to prevent them from speaking out on political action, irrespective of the party or the movement that they represent."
"That is why I voted in favour of immunity."
"In this particular case, Mr Bossi was prosecuted for having maintained that Mr Comencini was guilty of betrayal and political unreliability, firstly with regard to the (MSI) and secondly with regard to the It is a historically established fact."
"If I declare today that the ministers of the Italian Republic, Gianfranco Fini, Altiero Matteoli, Gianni Alemanno and Mario Landolfi have betrayed the political project and statute of the and have destroyed the alternative to the liberal and communist regime by changing the statutes and the aims of that party and transforming it into a different entity, can I be investigated and prosecuted for such an act or am I exercising my right to political debate?"
"If I commit a crime by declaring their betrayal, I am denounced ..."
". I am delighted with the rejection of this report, and with our contribution to that rejection."
"The report turns a blind eye to existing problems in the EU – namely recession, sluggish domestic demand and slow economic growth, accompanied by high levels of unemployment, poverty and income inequalities – which have been exacerbated by the introduction of economic and monetary union and the introduction of the euro."
"The solution cannot be more of the same acceleration of the so-called structural reforms, namely, making the labour market more flexible, the policy of liberalisations and the privatisation of social security. All of which is done in the name of the holy grail of price stability, or rather, wage moderation."
"This objective is already a reality, with salaries being reduced in real terms and productivity gains being passed on to employers."
"We welcome the rejection of the narrow view of the Stability and Growth Pact contained in this report, which ignores the reform of the Pact and thus displays the kind of blinkered attitude that has class stamped all over it."
"The report also goes as far as to criticise current working time in the EU, comparing it with other regions in the world and making a direct call for it to be increased."
". I regret having to vote against this report because the author chose to focus primarily on the breach and reform of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"This is contrary to an agreement that this report should not duplicate the work of other reports but should concentrate solely on the competences and performances of the ECB."
". Given that the prime objective of the European Central Bank (ECB) is maintaining price stability, it is fair to say that, whilst conditions in the European and world economy have hardly been favourable, the ECB has achieved its key objectives."
"In this respect, I endorse the report before us."
"It must also be acknowledged that the ECB prepared for last May’s enlargement most efficiently."
"I wish to point out, however, that this does not mean that I give total, unreserved support for the ECB’s policies; for example, I feel that the ECB has reacted in timely fashion to the developing economic situation and has managed to adapt in areas such as interest rates."
"Madam President, the euro was originally intended to enable the public to identify more with the EU and to usher in a new era of economic growth, but far from that being the case, it still does not enjoy full acceptance and, by cranking up frustration with the European Union, has had precisely the opposite effect."
"What prompted this downturn was, initially, the fobbing off of public criticism and rejection with the promise of a hard currency and the introduction of the so-called Stability and Growth Pact, the economically and legally dubious means whereby one was meant to be created."
"To date, only Luxembourg and Switzerland have been able to do anything like meet its convergence criteria."
"In order, nonetheless, to be able to participate in the common currency, countries sold off their gold reserves and state property on a large scale, going through the motions of privatisation, divesting and indulging in a great deal of cosmetic budgeting."
"The result of all this was massive price rises in most countries that had adopted the euro."
"If the new Member States are not also to be sucked into this downward spiral, each country should take the decision by allowing its people to vote on it, having first been supplied with frank, honest and objective information."
"We are well disposed towards the European Parliament’s resolution on an information and communication strategy on the euro and Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)."
"At the same time, we voted against the European Parliament’s call to shift Swedish opinion in favour of Swedish participation in EMU and of a transition to the euro."
"We believe that the result of the Swedish referendum should be respected."
"Swedish participation in EMU and the eurozone will not be a live issue for the foreseeable future."
"I have today chosen for two main reasons to vote against the own-initiative report on an information and communication strategy on the euro and Economic and Monetary Union."
"Firstly, I believe that it is up to each Member State to decide how it wishes to conduct the debate on the euro."
"It must not be taken charge of by the Commission."
"Secondly, experience of centralised European campaigns is generally bad. They involve a waste of resources, something that should not be encouraged."
"Discussions of monetary policy and currency should instead take place through a dialogue between citizens and decision-makers."
"I have therefore voted today against this report."
". The British Conservative delegation normally abstains on matters concerning the Euro."
"We have no desire to be part of the single currency but neither do we have any wish to for the project to fail, as we hope to see a strong European economy with a stable currency that provides a good trading environment for British industry."
"Therefore we are usually content to leave the operation of EMU to those who are most concerned."
"Nevertheless, we cannot accept this report."
"The problems that the Euro faces have not arisen because of a failure of communication, and where the Euro is unpopular it is not because the public has been inadequately informed."
"The Euro will only revive in the minds of the public when the necessary economic and structural reforms promoted by the Lisbon strategy have been undertaken, and when the Stability and Growth Pact works in an effective way."
"As the report notes, at least €280 million has already been spent by European institutions on this, apart from that which has been spent by national governments."
"Institutional expenditure of this kind is not acceptable."
". With its information and communication strategy with regard to the euro and economic and monetary union, the EU has one objective, which is to ‘sell’ the euro, in other words to invest more money in the European propaganda machine in the form of the PRINCE ‘information’ campaigns, aimed at convincing the citizens of what are seen as the benefits of the euro."
"Consequently, we reject this report unequivocally, because it is based on the principle that the euro has been positive and beneficial."
"It even considers that this has been the most successful of the European projects."
"What is more, it stresses that the popularity of the euro is crucial to the future ratification of the so-called ‘European Constitution’."
"This suggests that the European institutions are unaware of the growing opposition to the euro among the citizens."
"They base their views on the idea that, if the people are opposed to it, then that is because they are ill-informed or, better still, because they are out of touch with reality."
"Such is the arrogance and the blinkeredness of those who claim to represent the citizens."
"They disregard the fact that the economic and employment situation is worsening, and overlook macro-economic issues, as though a single monetary policy could address the different needs of 25 economies."
"They also act as though the objective of this policy were neutral, when in fact the primary aim is to reduce salaries in real terms."
"We must take stock of the costs of the euro, which is hampering sustainable development."
"– Mr Maaten’s report is, to say the least, surprising."
"It appears to be an attempt to assess the successes and failures of the euro only slightly more than six years after its introduction."
"According to the report, the euro and its accompanying Stability and Growth Pact have been a complete success."
"The only failure has been communication: as usual, it is the Europeans who have missed the point!"
"The solution being proposed is a vast information campaign, or rather an exercise in brainwashing on a continental scale."
"A Potemkin policy!"
"Did the euro cause a substantial rise in the cost of consumer staples and therefore a severe loss of consumer purchasing power?"
"Or was it an optical illusion?"
"The policy of austerity required by adoption of the euro has reduced economic growth by one percentage point each year and cost thousands of jobs, making the eurozone the world’s least dynamic economic region."
"Nonsense!"
"The euro is synonymous with growth and prosperity."
"Anything wrong is the fault of the Member States concerned."
"The Eurocrats of Brussels are, on the other hand, infallible."
"It was precisely that type of attitude, a mixture of lies and contempt for the people, which led to the rejection of this Europe of the technocrats."
"I cannot support the European Parliament’s resolution on an information and communication strategy on the euro and Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)."
"I believe that it is up to each Member State to decide whether it wishes to have an information and communication strategy or campaigns for the euro and Economic and Monetary Union."
"Moreover, I believe that the result of the Swedish referendum in 2003, when the Swedes rejected the euro, must be respected."
"Swedish participation in EMU and the introduction of the euro are not live issues for the foreseeable future."
". The rapporteur seems to be blind to the major disadvantages the euro has brought in its train, not least to his own country."
"In the Netherlands, prices soared after the euro was introduced, something that Mr Zalm, the Finance Minister and a member of Mr Maaten’s party, has denied for years, going on to tell the Dutch parliament a bare-faced lie about the guilder’s undervaluation, and so the Dutch people’s displeasure with the euro should come as no surprise to Mr Maaten."
"Although my party asked for a referendum on the common currency at the time, Mr Maaten’s party blocked this request."
"Mr Maaten now hopes, by means of a propaganda campaign, to be able to make up the shortfall of respect for the people’s opinion."
"The campaigns that are to be launched in Member States that do not yet have the euro must be the last straw."
"Member States decide for themselves what currency they want."
"Surely we would not like it if Russia were to campaign over here to introduce the rouble in Europe?"
"We should let the Swedish, British and Danish people make up their own minds."
"Unfortunately, the Dutch people were not able to speak out in that way."
"I believe that Sweden should participate in Economic and Monetary Union and I share the rapporteur’s positive attitude to the euro."
"I have, however, chosen to abstain from voting on this report."
"One of the main conclusions of the report is that the Commission should conduct an information campaign extolling the virtues of the euro."
"I believe that information campaigns by the Commission are neither helpful nor appropriate if we want to see more people well disposed towards the euro."
"That is not what we should be using taxpayers’ money for."
". I should like to congratulate Mr Maaten on his important report on the implementation of an information and communication strategy on the euro and Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), particularly given the need to explain to the people how the euro and the EMU benefits them in their daily lives."
"The successful creation of the euro zone is not complete – we still have to convince the citizens of Europe that they made the right decision."
"This is the only way in which we can contribute towards consolidating monetary union in Europe and towards enhancing the euro’s credibility and stability."
"It is inevitable that the euro zone will expand to include the countries of Eastern Europe."
"This will entail drawing up an information plan as part of a wider information and communication strategy on the EU."
"We need to keep a closer watch on instances of malpractice and excessive rounding up that may occur during the transition and to warn the population of a slight rise in inflation."
"The Euro has clearly been an economic success in the countries that have adopted it - it has eliminated exchange risk within the euro zone, made travel easier and increased trade within the zone."
"Nevertheless, it is dispiriting to note that despite the objective benefits of the euro and despite the generally smooth change over that occurred, seven years on, a significant section (about one third) of the public continues to have a negative perception of the euro."
"Baffling as this may appear the Commission, Member States and other policy makers need to take stock of these perceptions and undertake steps to correct them."
"This report could make a worthwhile contribution to that effect."
". The only benefit the euro has brought is that people do not need to exchange currency when they go on holiday to another euro country."
"Other than that, the general experience of most people in euro countries has been of the currency’s drawbacks, such as higher prices for consumer goods and a reduction in the value of their savings."
"They are annoyed about the constant cutbacks on public services that are being carried out in order to limit public spending and thus meet the requirements of the Stability Pact."
"In his report, Mr Maaten reveals himself as an enthusiast for the euro, a ‘europhile’."
"It is laughable that he should call the euro ‘the most successful European project ever’."
"Does he realise that the euro gave some people a reason to vote against the EU Constitution?"
"How does he explain that Member States without the euro are doing far better economically speaking?"
"His main concern is to help the governments of Sweden, Denmark and the UK persuade the public that the euro has been a success."
"Such an admission of weakness is comparable to the campaign in favour of the EU Constitution in the Netherlands: the euro is talked up as a fantastic product, yet people have not yet got the message."
"It is short-sighted and patronising to respond to serious public criticism with transparent campaigns."
". The advantages – and the disadvantages, which of course exist – of the euro are there for all to see and it cannot be denied that our highest expectations have been met."
"Whilst it is true that the economic situation in Europe is not a runaway success story, it is also true that the euro cannot be blamed for this situation."
"Indeed, the citizens have taken to the new currency very positively and the speed and ease with which the transition took place should not be forgotten."
"It should also be borne in mind, however, that the euro is in fact a work in progress and as such is an easy target both for genuine popular disenchantment with the economic situation in Europe and for a certain amount of political manipulation."
"This currency is too valuable to be discarded."
"I therefore feel that we should agree on a more wide-ranging and complete communication plan, especially at institutional level."
"It is clear that this is an ongoing transition process. The initial effort needs to be kept up."
". The European Parliamentary Labour Party voted in favour of this report in view of evaluating the European Monetary Union's strengths and weaknesses, to propose solutions and to aid the strategy for other Member States' entry into the Union if they so wish."
"The European Parliamentary Labour Party believes that information on the Euro should be made widely available to all citizens of the EU."
"This however, does not negate the Chancellor's 5 Economic tests set for any future decision on the UK's entry to the Euro zone."
"I have today chosen to abstain from voting on Mr Maaten’s report on a communication strategy on the euro and Economic and Monetary Union."
"I share the rapporteur’s positive attitude towards the euro and believe that Sweden should participate in EMU."
"What I do not, however, support is the Commission conducting an information campaign extolling the virtues of the euro."
"Information campaigns conducted by the Commission are not the right route to go down in order to have more people well disposed towards the euro."
"That is not what we should be using taxpayers’ money for."
". According to this report, sustainable development is based on three pillars: environmental protection, economic development and social cohesion."
"Furthermore, sustainable development cannot be achieved without the development of new environmental technology and innovations."
"It is on these principles that the Commission has based its proposal, which Parliament adopted, although a number of points should be brought to the fore, such as the need for small and medium-sized enterprises to be more involved."
"A further important point to bear in mind is that, in order to foster sustainable development, it is also necessary to encourage research into, and innovation in, new technologies focused on prevention and the restoration of natural, cultural and historical resources."
"Similarly, methods and environmental indicators must be developed for measuring the burden on the environment of different products, services and processes, and a campaign must be launched, based on environmental performance information, to encourage consumers to demand environmentally benign technologies."
"The reuse of materials should also be encouraged so as to enable residue materials from one production process to become the input of other production processes, for example the use of municipal waste to achieve energy savings, whereby economic as well as environmental benefit can be attained."
"I welcome this report on the communication from the Commission on stimulating technologies for sustainable development - an environmental technologies action plan for the EU."
"I see it as a useful basis for discussion and development of more concrete proposals on how to boost environmental technologies but would like to see more emphasis on the development of the demand for such technologies."
"I would like to seem a more systems-based approach to environmental policy using ""life-cycle"" thinking where great importance is attached to the innovation and development of environmentally benign technologies."
"I firmly believe that environmental technologies properly resourced and encouraged have great employment and growth potential."
". I voted in favour of the Myller report."
"I feel that an approach to new technology that facilitates the creation of development programmes with an environmental dimension is a vital factor in meeting the Lisbon objectives."
"The proposed action plan will make it possible to involve all stakeholders in an integrated action to develop the potential of environmental technology, thereby placing the EU at the forefront of that development."
"I should also like to point out that one of the conclusions of the review of the Lisbon Strategy was that the state of the environment and improving employment should be seen as an opportunity to fulfil the objective of creating the most competitive knowledge-based economy."
"It is therefore extremely important that we enhance the environmental dimension in the EU’s strategy for competitiveness."
"The Moderate delegation has today voted in favour of a report in support of the fight against harmful child labour."
"It is very important vigorously to combat child labour, as defined in the ILO’s conventions on child labour, that is damaging to children’s physical or mental health."
"Businesses have an important role to play and a responsibility for combating this type of child labour."
"The proposal to establish suitable protection clauses and mechanisms under Community law for tracking down and prosecuting EU-based importers who bring in products manufactured by children is well meaning."
"We Moderates believe, however, that this would lead to significant legal uncertainty. There is a danger of children’s interests not being protected and of businesses withdrawing instead of playing their part and investing in regions where there is a risk of child labour being exploited."
". Child labour is a consequence of the social injustice engendered by the capitalist system under which we live and by the inequality of wealth distribution and of development levels arising from that system."
"Poverty leads to social exclusion and acts as a justification for families to turn to child labour to supplement their incomes and to survive."
"The poverty endured by families as a result of capitalist exploitation means that some businesses and entrepreneurs have a vested interest in perpetuating a situation in which they can employ cheap labour with no rights."
"As the report that we have just adopted points out, 113 thousand million children of school age are deprived of basic education."
"The fact that children do not attend school leads to a vicious circle, in which poverty becomes more widespread, access to culture and education becomes ever more difficult and literacy levels in society are kept low."
"This is also happening in EU Member States."
"In Portugal, it is estimated that more than 4% of the child population is working in various sectors."
"If we are to combat child labour effectively, the priority is therefore to eradicate poverty, by breaking down inequality in income distribution, by promoting jobs with rights, by increasing access to teaching and culture and by combating capitalist exploitation."
"The European Parliament has today voted in favour of a proposal concerning measures to combat child labour."
"Child labour is something that most people, including myself, think belongs to history."
"Unfortunately, not all countries in the world have kept up with developments."
"That is why I have today voted in favour of a number of additional proposals that divide child labour into several categories, since child labour may, for example, be the only alternative to prostitution."
". At present, 246 million children in the world work in places that are hazardous for their physical and mental health."
"Child labour is not a phenomenon associated exclusively with underdeveloped or developing countries."
"In Eastern Europe and in the Mediterranean, millions of children are exploited in work places."
"Child labour is a complex issue."
"It is primarily the result of poverty, inequality of opportunities and a lack of schooling."
"I voted in favour of the report before us, which proposes a series of measures in the fight to eliminate child exploitation and child labour: for example, creating a special budget line focusing on the protection of children’s rights in the context of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights; calling on the Commission to ensure that the EU’s trade policies are consistent with its commitment to protecting and promoting children’s rights; and looking into the possibility of introducing a scheme for the labelling of goods imported into the EU to attest that they have been produced without the use of child labour."
". I welcome this Report which calls for the fight against child labour to be accelerated through promoting socio-economic development and the reduction of poverty on a wider scale."
"While satisfying for one's own conscience, trade boycotts and other sanctions are an unsatisfactory way of dealing with this unpleasant activity."
"Evidence suggests that children thrown out of factories in desperately poor conditions are subject to even more insidious exploitation such as prostitution and domestic slavery."
". There are 352 million children working in the world, 179 million of whom are victims of what the International Labour Organisation defines as the worst forms of child labour."
"We cannot turn a blind eye to this situation."
"We all know that this is a complex phenomenon rooted in social and economic problems that are difficult to solve."
"Complex and enormously difficult though the situation is, we cannot turn our backs on it or block measures that may lead to an effective strategy to break the cycle of human misery."
"Child labour perpetuates poverty and hampers development."
"It drives salaries down, causes unemployment among adults and prevents children from receiving an education."
"It is therefore of crucial importance that we combat ignorance and promote the development of education for all."
"Education is without doubt one of the most effective tools at our disposal to break the cycle of poverty, and one of the key elements in sustainable human development."
"These are the reasons why I voted in favour of the Mavrommatis report."
". We must do everything that we can to oppose the exploitation of children in the developing world."
"This report links directly into the ‘Making Poverty History’ campaign as child exploitation is so often linked to poverty."
"We must do all that we can to make trade fair, to support debt relief and to secure aid to the poorest."
"I hope that Members will sign our written declaration on the millennium development goals which will deliver on this crucial agenda."
"I also hope that the G8 leaders meeting in Scotland tomorrow will make further progress on ‘Making Poverty History’."
"Today, the European Parliament has adopted a report that presents proposals concerning a variety of efforts to combat child labour."
"The report states, for example, that education for all is crucially important in the fight against child labour and poverty."
"It is my firm view that all children must be protected against work that causes harm to them."
"It is, however, important to remember that general bans are not a realistic alternative so long as widespread poverty exists and there are limited opportunities for education."
"Certain forms of work, for example those through which education is made available in the workplace, may, moreover, have a positive contribution to make."
"The report also deals with the responsibility of businesses and proposes, for example, legal proceedings against businesses that import products manufactured in ways that violate core ILO conventions."
"I believe that full use should be made of the potential that exists for economic players to increase respect for human rights and international conventions."
"I therefore strongly support initiatives such as ‘Global Compact’ and the Swedish Government’s ‘Global Responsibility’."
"Passing legislation and making it possible to take proceedings at EU level would, however, be very major steps that might, rather, be in danger of defeating the objects, namely those of improving the position of children and combating poverty."
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"- the interim report (A6-0177/2005) by Mr Konstantinos Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund [COM(2004)0492 – 2004/0163(AVC)],"
"- the interim report (A6-0178/2005) by Mr Alfonso Andria, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Cohesion Fund [COM(2004)0494 – 2004/0166(AVC)],"
"- the report (A6-0184/2005) by Mr Giovanni Claudio Fava, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Regional Development Fund [COM(2004)0495 – C6-0089/2004 – 2004/0167(COD)],"
"- the report (A6-0206/2005) by Mr Jan Olbrycht, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing a European grouping of cross-border cooperation (EGCC) [COM(2004)0496 – C6-0091/2004 – 2004/0168(COD)],"
"- the report (A6-0216/2005) by Mr José Albino Silva Peneda, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Social Fund [COM(2004)0493 – C6-0090/2004 – 2004/0165(COD)],"
"- the report (A6-0217/2005) by Mr David Casa, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the European Fisheries Fund [COM(2004)0497 – C6-0212/2004 – 2004/0169(CNS)]."
". – Mr President, I think that today the European Parliament, following the Council's failure to reach agreement on the financial perspectives and, obviously, also on the framework for regional policy for the period 2007-2013, is sending a clear message to both the citizens and the Council that we are here; we continue to support cohesion policies and we shall work towards a strong budget which is adequate in all instances for regional policy."
"Within this framework, we call on the Council to immediately re-examine the question and to come to a decision soon, by the end of 2005 at least, so that there is enough time for the Member States and the regions to prepare their programmes and so that we do not have the problems of delays which we had in the present period as regards the starting date of the programmes."
"In addition, I wish to point out that Parliament persists, including within the framework of my report, in the position which it took in the Béguin report as regards the financing of cohesion policies."
"We support a package in the order of 0.41% of the gross national income of the Member States of the European Union, which translates into EUR 336 billion for the period 2007-2013."
"We consider that any cuts in spending on regional policy will undermine its credibility."
"My report, as approved by the Committee on Regional Development, also contains other important forecasts, of which I should like to remind both the British minister present and the Commissioner."
"First of all, we propose to re-use unspent resources due to the strict application of the N+2 rules on regional policy."
"We propose that, instead of being re-entered in the net contributions to the European budget, these resources should be re-used by the cohesion countries and the regions which have proven from their performance that they can make use of other such resources."
"Secondly, we are calling for there to be political decisions, so that compensation can be given to the regions and the Member States which suffer most from the strict implementation of the new rules which the European Commission is proposing regarding the allocation of resources."
"We consider that it is a proposal which needs to be examined by the Council. I imagine that it will be examined, because it bears directly on the fair allocation of resources."
"We must not put mathematics above all else."
"Similarly, within this framework, amendments have been tabled which are supported by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for better treatment of the regions which are subject to the statistical effect."
"We propose support starting at 85% and ending at 60%, which is much higher than the European Commission forecast."
"As far as natural effect regions are concerned, by which we mean regions which no longer meet the eligibility criteria for the convergence objective, but which will receive transitional financing within the framework of the competitiveness and employment objective, we propose that the actions and the financing for them should be the same for these regions, if they so wish, as the convergence objective regions."
"We are also calling for more favourable treatment both of these regions and of the regions subject to the statistical effect as regards state aid and investment incentives."
"We support the creation of a Community performance reserve which is expected to give an incentive to all the Member States to improve their performance and achieve real development."
"Through rivalry we shall have better results both for the Member States and for the Community budget."
"Finally, my report sets accessibility for people with disabilities as an express precondition to the financing of actions via the funds."
"We consider that all projects which are not accessible to our fellow citizens with disabilities should not be financed from the Structural Funds and that their financing should be suspended."
"It is the least the European Parliament can do."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report that I present today has been characterised, in its formal drafting phase, by a method of work firmly rooted in dialogue, even going beyond individual political affiliations, and in intense collaboration, firstly within the parliamentary Committee on Regional Development and then within the Committee of the Regions, with representatives of the Council and the very many associations and non-governmental organisations."
"I felt it necessary to give particular attention to the contact and exchange of opinions with fellow Members, with the shadow rapporteurs for the political groups and with the draftsmen of the other parliamentary committees, not to mention with members of the group to which I belong, that is to say, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"From the outset, I greatly welcomed – and I should like to repeat it publicly in this House – the special attention of Commissioner Danuta Hübner, who, on the numerous occasions on which we met and even as recently as yesterday evening, always demonstrated a great willingness and openness to take account of Parliament’s requests."
"I have, moreover, always regarded with great interest the original proposal of the Commission on a regulation for the Cohesion Fund, which today, like the crisis that has swept across the Union and the failure to agree on the financial perspectives, assumes greater importance, since it provides a suitable response to the needs of an enlarged Europe by aiming at economic and social cohesion."
"I therefore share the hopes expressed by Mr Hatzidakis with regard to the swift resolution of the issue of the financial perspectives before the end of the year."
"Regional policy is the best means of bringing the citizens closer to Europe, and, in order to do so, it must have ambitious objectives and be equipped with the necessary instruments to achieve them."
"I should therefore like to stress the importance of increasing the financial allocation of the Cohesion Fund from the EUR 18 billion estimated for the 2000-2006 programming period to EUR 62.99 billion, in the event that an agreement is reached in the Council on the proposal adopted by Parliament on 8 June."
"Furthermore, the increased scope of the actions of the Cohesion Fund complies with the relevant provisions of the Treaty, is in line with the priorities decided on at Lisbon and falls within the perspective of sustainable development outlined in Gothenburg."
"That will make it possible to meet the major funding needs of beneficiary Member States in the sectors of the environment, transport infrastructures and sustainable development."
"During the work that I carried out within the Committee on Regional Development, I sought to make a number of changes and to enrich the Commission’s text with a series of original points, such as introducing a premium system in the shape of a Community reserve for quality and performance and strengthening exchanges by promoting best practice for national, regional and local authorities."
"I have asked the Commission to draw up a list of indicative priorities in the programming period, with a view to increasing the quality and effectiveness of Community funding."
"I have highlighted the topic of disabilities, calling for an explicit reference to disabled people to be included in Article 2 of the general regulation and for the projects financed by the Cohesion Fund to include the possibility of removing barriers and obstacles of every description. I have also made room for the important issue of the environment, calling for guarantees of greater consistency between the projects financed by the Cohesion Fund and those financed within the scope of other Community programmes."
"Finally, I have made an explicit reference to the island and peripheral Member States, inviting the Commission to take account of their natural and demographic handicaps."
"Mr President, with regard to the amendments tabled I also have to add that I personally do not believe – and I also say this on behalf of my group – that it is possible to adopt everything relating to the issue of the non-application of the N+2 rule to the Cohesion Fund, that is, introducing automatic decommitment."
"My past experience as a local government administrator taught me that that rule contributes effectively to preparing projects correctly and accurately and to managing funds."
"I therefore hope that the Commission allows greater flexibility in applying it and addresses the issue of non-refundable VAT in order that it may be allowed for the financing of the funds."
"On this subject, there exists a rather precise position, to which Commissioner Danuta Hübner wished to once again draw attention in committee yesterday, which says that allowing VAT would mean reducing the financial resources available for the rest of the cohesion policy."
"A very large majority in committee approved my report and I hope that the same thing can happen in this Chamber."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too thank the Commissioner and the other rapporteurs."
"I believe that we have devised a path of work that benefits everyone, including in view of the quality of the reports that we are submitting to the vote in Parliament."
"I am dealing with the European Regional Development Fund, which is without doubt the most important of the Structural Funds in terms of quantity of resources."
"It was set up 30 years ago and has the crucial task of correcting the regional imbalances present throughout Europe."
"It is a task laid down by an article of the Treaty, pointing out to us the requirement for, and the necessity of, a Europe founded on solidarity and on the ability to create equal opportunities and fair conditions, particularly now that we find ourselves faced with the challenge of enlargement."
"The ten new Member States represent a large resource in terms of the quality of policies, a significant step forward in the history of Europe."
"We must also remember, however, that regional imbalances are becoming worse."
"Right now, a third of all of Europe’s resources belong to a geographical area covering only a tenth of the European Union, and we have recorded a doubling in the number of regions eligible to come under Objective 1, that is, regions with a high level of structural imbalances and economic difficulties."
"That is therefore the fundamental task of a policy of engagement and solidarity."
"If the Union were just a free trade area, we could confine ourselves to redistributing the income among the wealthiest regions and the poorest regions."
"In contrast – and for this I am grateful to the Commissioner – we have the choice of a political, social and economic project entrusted to the Structural Funds, or rather the choice of a development model that, in its entirety, benefits the process of European integration."
"It is a development model that makes a number of significant choices."
"It favours the choice of subject matter made in Gothenburg and Lisbon and therefore chooses the path of the knowledge-based economy, knowledge, innovation, scientific research and training, intended as a permanent opportunity throughout people’s entire lives, as well as risk prevention and sustainable development."
"It is an extremely ambitious project that naturally has one objective that cuts across the others, that is, the quality of spending."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we have not always spent everything, and, even when we have done, we have not always spent it well."
"There are regions – including in my country – that have received considerable resources but where there remain the unwavering signs of hardship that they experienced 10, 15 or 20 years ago with regard to employment levels, the quality and interlinking of infrastructures, scientific research and the processes of innovation."
"It is therefore clear that we have to achieve a great improvement in quality in terms of the adequacy of spending, and, in order for this to occur, we have to select objectives by setting a small number of priorities."
"It is for that reason that our group is against the wish – which is understandable but unnecessary – of indiscriminately enlarging the fields in which this structural fund may be used."
"We propose a vote against a number of the amendments that would seek to introduce too many objectives and too many priorities."
"We propose voting against the understandable desire of a number of Members to include VAT among reimbursable expenses."
"We do not wish to reopen a debate that has been thoroughly aired in committee, but we believe that value-added tax, as was pointed out by the Council, the Commission and the Court of Accounts, gave rise in the past to significant misuse when a proportion of VAT was reimbursed."
"We believe in particular that including this would create intolerable inequality among countries with VAT rates varying between 1% and 25%."
"This also relates to the construction of new housing."
"We approved an amendment, which we hope will be adopted by the Commission, relating to the construction of social housing."
"However, to consider that Structural Funds could be generally invested in the construction of housing would mean fundamentally withdrawing resources from such funds."
"We are satisfied with the results achieved."
"We have strengthened the role of the partnership, which we consider a great school for teaching civilisation and democratic practice."
"We have succeeded in ensuring that special attention is also paid to the fight against organised crime and mafia-related crime, laying down the possibility of also using the Structural Funds to create the necessary know-how for tackling the pervasiveness of mafia-related crime."
"We have also succeeded in ensuring that the principal of non-discrimination applies across the board."
"On this subject, the rapporteur has tabled only two amendments, the purpose of which is to enhance the unity and consistency of the entire text."
"I will conclude by pointing out, like Mr Hatzidakis, that the quality of our spending is, however, dependent on the existence of sufficient resources."
"That is why I believe that this Parliament has to ensure that resources are not withdrawn from solidarity, or rather from the ability to create a Europe that all moves at the same speed."
"It is not solely a question of a principle laid down in the Treaties, but it is the principle to which we have to entrust the future of the political and economic integration process in Europe."
". Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Michael, if I may, I should like to make a few comments on the report."
"I will attempt to speak in my capacity as rapporteur, and not as a representative of my political party."
"Cross-border cooperation is one of the most obvious and effective forms of building links between individuals and of promoting good relations between local and regional communities and whole countries."
"Cross-border cooperation already has a rich tradition, and has achieved considerable success over the many years it has been in place."
"Diverse organisational forms have also been developed for such cooperation."
"The EU is aware of the many benefits that can be derived from this form of international cooperation, and therefore supports it both within the EU, along the borders between Member States and between regions that are some distance from each other, and along the EU’s external borders."
"Various kinds of financial instrument are used to this end."
"The present programming period has seen a great many measures implemented on a cross-border, trans-national and inter-regional basis, to use the terminology of the INTERREG IIIA, IIIB and IIIC programmes."
"The regulation under debate is a new legislative proposal, which may help both to boost numerous forms of cross-border, trans-national and inter-regional cooperation, and to make it easier to implement joint initiatives and to ensure that funds for such purposes are used more efficiently."
"The new regulation gives public authorities at all levels the opportunity to establish a new instrument on the territory of one of the chosen countries."
"This instrument will have legal status in the country where it is registered, and will subsequently be notified to all Member States, the European Commission and the Committee of the Regions."
"This corresponds to the proposal in my report."
"The entities making up a European Grouping of Cross-Border Cooperation – the original text uses the term ‘cross-border’, but I have proposed in my report that this be replaced with the term ‘territorial’ – will be able to transfer selected public services to the Grouping, as well as entrusting it with some of their tasks, as provided for in the relevant regulations."
"The establishment of such instruments is perhaps one of the first proposals in the history of the European Union that provides for the creation of a truly European entity, at the same time as providing a practical boost to the enforcement of the principle of subsidiarity."
"In my opinion, Parliament should back this idea, in so doing sending out a very clear and measurable signal that it supports these actions at local, regional and national scale, and also at inter-local and inter-regional level and between the countries that are engaged in the task of constructing a coherent EU, while at the same time strengthening the principle of subsidiarity."
"It is worth stressing that even though this regulation does not contain any decisions relating to financial matters, it is part of a package on cohesion policy."
"This is due to the fact that it is based on the Treaty provisions regarding the creation of forms to promote the use of the Structural Funds, as well as actions to be taken outside the Structural Funds."
"In my capacity as rapporteur, I am aware that many questions and doubts have arisen in the course of work on this instrument."
"This is quite normal in situations where we are dealing with a new instrument which has not yet been tested, and which does not yet have any equivalent in existing legal forms."
"I believe, however, that in this instance the codecision procedure will subsequently make it possible to achieve a position that will boost the cross-border actions that are currently in existence, and that will allow us to create a considerable degree of European added value."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, the European Social Fund (ESF) has a history dating back 40 years."
"It was originally a key factor in developing the vocational training and the relocation of over 2 million people working at the time in sectors affected by major restructuring."
"Following the adoption of the first Social Action Programme and the European Single Act, the ESF became concerned with employment protection, worker participation, equal treatment for men and women, health and safety and preventing social dumping."
"The most important landmarks in the development of European social policy – and, accordingly, in relation to the ESF – came subsequently with the Maastricht Treaty, which enshrined the promotion of a high level of employment as one of the EU's objectives, and with the Amsterdam and Nice Treaties."
"The latest such landmark is the Constitutional Treaty, which enshrines full employment, social progress and action to combat exclusion as EU objectives."
"In light of this development, the Commission tabled a proposal to review the regulation of the ESF, which was based on the following three headings: firstly, the Lisbon Strategy; secondly, the need to simplify texts and procedures; and thirdly, the relationship between the ESF and the European Employment Strategy."
"I shall now deal with the first of those, the Lisbon Strategy."
"With specific regard to the modernisation of the European social model, investment in people, action to combat social exclusion and a set of priority actions such as the establishment of a European Research and Innovation Area, investment in education and training systems with a view to satisfying the requirements of a knowledge-based society and meeting the need to create more and better jobs, I feel that the proposed regulation is an appropriate instrument."
"I now turn to the simplification of texts and procedures."
"Although it is true that the Commission’s proposals already advocate simplification in various areas, such as programming, financial management and cofinancing, it is also true, nonetheless, that there remain many areas in which further simplification and rationalisation are called for."
"As for the relationship between the ESF and the European Employment Strategy I wish to state that, broadly speaking, both are satisfactorily incorporated in the proposal for a regulation on the ESF."
"I should now like to speak about the two amendments that I have tabled to the Commission’s initial proposal."
"The first of these concerns social inclusion."
"I feel that issues relating to social inclusion cannot be resolved exclusively under the employment and labour market umbrella, given that there are situations that, at an earlier stage, call for more wide-ranging interdisciplinary measures."
"I therefore felt that the ESF needed to be more proactive and, accordingly, I proposed that ESF action should not be confined to the sphere of the European Employment Strategy, because it has a broader scope for action."
"In other words, I wanted to emphasise the ESF’s potential contribution towards social inclusion."
"The other significant amendment to the Commission’s proposal currently before Parliament concerns the distinction that was originally made between potential ESF action in ‘convergence objective’ and ‘competitiveness objective’ regions."
"I have always believed that the ESF should have as wide a scope of application as possible, because it is an instrument that is designed to help people, regardless of where they come from."
"Talks between the Commission and the political groups involved have led to a compromise solution that is consistent with policy and that ensures that resources are channelled into regions with the greatest development needs."
"This is the compromise solution that I now put to this House."
"I am aware that there are points on which the Commission and the Council disagree."
"In my proposal, I have made my opinion clear on these issues."
"For example, I share the Commission’s opinion as regards transnational cooperation and innovation, and have proposed that financing by the Member States be compulsory."
"On support for social partners, I also share the Commission’s position, and have proposed that a distinction be enshrined as regards a number of regulatory issues between social partners and non-governmental organisations."
"Lastly, Mr President, I should like to highlight the highly cooperative atmosphere between the Commission and the various interested political groups while this report was being drawn up."
"This dedicated cooperation made my work a great deal easier."
"I am grateful to all concerned."
". – A Fisheries Fund is a fundamental tool for the fisheries sector for the coming years."
"It is universally recognised that the fisheries sector is a very important sector for the European Union; it is an industry that provides a livelihood to thousands of families."
"They are, indeed, dependent on this activity, which is so important to most of the Member States of the European Union."
"The European Fisheries Fund is an innovative project and will achieve the crucial objective of reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, thereby making it possible for the system whereby funds are distributed to be simplified and decentralised, and enabling the European Union to meet the challenges resulting from the accession of ten new Member States."
"The Common Fisheries Fund respects the fundamental principles of all the other structures, namely subsidiarity, multiannual programming and scrutiny, membership and cofinancing."
"One positive aspect to it is aid from the proposed European Fisheries Fund will involve locally-integrated action centred on a relevant territorial strategy, with every local situation analysed separately. First of all it provides a financial instrument forming an integral part of the Common Fisheries Policy, with the specific intention of monitoring the management of resources, helping to improve production structures and to create the ideal conditions for their sustainable development."
"Secondly, it conforms with the principles of cohesion, which permit different treatment in different regions of the European Union according to their level of development and prosperity."
"This House’s Fisheries Committee went through a process of detailed consultation."
"We met all parties involved in this sector, we consulted the fishermen and the representatives of the Member States and we wanted this report to eventually reflect accurately this sector’s needs."
"Although the Member States have given a favourable reception to the creation of a European Fisheries Fund with an objective that goes hand in hand with the reform of the Fisheries Policy, there was some concern about the fact that the Fund does not adequately address the renovation of vessels."
"Representatives proposed that the draft regulation should make provision for fleet renovation and modernisation while at the same time keeping open the possibility of building new vessels without any increase in the fishing effort."
"The general opinion is that the Commission focused too much on the environmental aspect and took no cognisance of the potential risk of certain measures to the fisheries sector."
"We could, perhaps, with the help of scientific research, arrive at a more constructive and balanced compromise and thus create a balance between the protection of resources and the sector’s socio-economic viability."
"I believe that the report on which we will be voting tomorrow takes good account of the needs of all those who work in this sector."
"By this we want to send a strong message both to the Commission as well as to the sector and we want the fisheries sector to remain sustainable and viable in the coming years."
"I believe that it is fundamental for us that there is agreement on the principles which will allocate funds to the fisheries industry."
"Unfortunately the proposed allocation for the European Fisheries Funds remained practically the same, namely about EUR 5 billion, even though the European Union has had to increase its rate because it is now composed of twenty-five Member States rather than fifteen."
"It follows that comparison with the past will reveal that every country will receive a smaller percentage of the funds."
"The protection of the environment is something that causes a lot of concern, and the excessive use of precautions leads to over-protection."
"It is also worth mentioning that assistance will be available through this Fund."
"Our hope is that this report will result in greater flexibility, and for that reason we appreciate that the European peoples expect us to remove unnecessary bureaucracy."
"I believe that all those involved in the drafting of the report had all this in mind and did all they could to eliminate this factor."
"As I have already said, we have reached an agreement on the renovation of vessels, which is a very important point, we have reached an agreement on the modernisation of fleets and the renovation of coastal vessels and we need a fleet which would be competitive and efficient for the future so that the sector really remains sustainable."
"As already said, the Committee for European Fisheries already mentioned various opinions on this subject and different aspects of the proposal were considered, including the problems of sustainable development, aquaculture and questions related to the fleet and implementation."
"As rapporteur, I can say that I am satisfied with the final results."
"I believe that this report has successfully brought together the most important points and, furthermore, that it carries sufficient political weight to enable the fisheries sector to remain viable and sustainable, both financially and from the environmental point of view."
"I will conclude by reminding the House that we had a timetable which was halved in order for us to be able to cover all the items by today, and, had it not been for the help of my group’s coordinator and advisor, as well as a number of other people, especially the representatives of the Commission and my personal staff, I do not think that we would have managed it all."
"I thank everybody for their help."
". Mr President, I am pleased to participate in this very important debate on the future of the structural and cohesion funds because the European Commission’s package of five draft regulations are of great significance."
"They will establish the overarching framework for the delivery of EU regional policy for the full seven years of the next financial perspective."
"It will be very important indeed for the Council and the European Parliament to work in close cooperation to achieve a successful outcome."
"The Committee on Regional Development has produced excellent reports on the draft regulations."
"While there are some differences of opinion between the Council and Parliament on certain issues, we share many common objectives and concerns."
"I wish to thank Mr Hatzidakis, Mr Andria, Mr Fava, Mr Olbrycht and Mr Silva Peneda for their hard work and helpful remarks in introducing the debate this afternoon."
"I ought to point out to Mr Hatzidakis that I am speaking today on behalf of the Presidency and emphasising the need for agreement."
"I say that because he referred to me as the UK Minister."
"Today we are not discussing the level of the budget, though those who argue for a more disciplined budget believe that it would increase the credibility of the Union and lead to the improved targeting of resources to where the need is greatest."
"But it is to the credit of everyone, and particularly to Parliament, that the practicalities of the Commission’s proposed regulations are being discussed and developed in parallel with the budget discussion."
"I know from meetings that Commissioner Hübner takes a very practical view of these issues and I look forward to hearing her contribution and that of Commissioner Špidla."
"I am not ignoring Mr Casa’s report."
"I know that Parliament will also be discussing the draft regulation for the European Fisheries Fund during this debate."
"As the UK Minister responsible for regional policy, I cannot comment on this important dossier, but I will promise to pass on the comments to my colleague, Ben Bradshaw, the UK Minister for fisheries policy, and he will be visiting Parliament next week to engage in discussions on this important subject."
"I would like to emphasise the importance that the UK Presidency attaches to making progress in this very important policy area."
"We recognise that this involves working in effective partnership with the European Parliament."
"A great deal of progress has already been achieved under the Netherlands and Luxembourg Presidencies, but there is still a lot to do."
"Even when the Council and Parliament have reached agreement on the regulations, the Commission and Member States will need to complete important bilateral discussions before the new cycle of programmes can start and before money can start to flow, money that is badly needed to help regenerate the economies of the poorest parts of the Union, hence our wish to move forwards swiftly under our Presidency."
"But, as I have acknowledged, these negotiations are closely linked with the wider discussions on the future financing of the Union."
"The structural funds form the largest area of EU expenditure after agriculture, accounting for approximately 30% of the total EC budget."
"We need to reach agreement on the EC budget before these regulations can be finalised."
"We share the concerns of the European Parliament and many Member States – in particular the new Member States – about any delay in reaching agreement on the budget and the importance of ensuring there is a prompt start to the next cycle of structural funds programmes."
"As Tony Blair said to you less than two weeks ago, we fully recognise the importance of reaching an agreement on the budget and we will make as much progress as possible during our Presidency."
"However, it has to be the right agreement: one that equips the EU to deal effectively with the challenges of the 21st century, one that takes account of the wider debate on the future direction of the Union and one that meets the needs of new Member States in order to ensure that EU enlargement continues to be a success."
"In addition to the issue of financing, there remain a number of other important issues that need to be resolved relating to the treatment of structural funds expenditure and the implementation of programmes."
"We have been discussing these matters in the Council since last September and we have made good progress."
"Our aim during the UK Presidency is to reach a consensus on outstanding technical issues in the regulations as swiftly as possible, so that the package of regulations can be finalised very quickly once the outcome of the future financing negotiations is known."
"That is why I am very pleased that you are having this important debate today and that you will be voting shortly on the five reports."
"That will ensure that the Council has a clear understanding of Parliament’s views."
"Those views will be very important in building a consensus between our two institutions and we will examine them very carefully in the Council as we move towards political agreement."
"I look forward to listening to the remainder of today’s debate."
". Mr President, through many plenary sittings such as this and the unflagging work of its committees, your institution has always played a decisive role in the development of European cohesion policy."
"The Commission appreciates the farsighted ways in which you have helped to bring into being and develop a policy which, besides its economic objectives, forms such a secure link between the European Union and its citizens."
"This debate in which we are discussing the policy’s medium-term future is just the most recent example of these efforts."
"Whilst expressing the Commission’s recognition of your role and its gratitude, may I, on a more personal note, thank the four rapporteurs – Mr Hatzidakis, Mr Fava, Mr Andria and Mr Olbrycht – for the outstanding quality of their reports."
"My thanks also to Mr Galeote Quecedo, who has steered the work of the Committee on Regional Development so efficiently."
"Together they have set the stage for a fruitful discussion today."
"In replying now to your proposed amendments I hope I can be as clear and convincing as the reports themselves."
"As I said, we are discussing the future of cohesion policy until 2013."
"In the years between 2007 and 2013 cohesion policy can build on its present results, but we have to look and move forward."
"We can secure a growth dividend by involving regions more closely in our economic and social modernisation."
"This is what is at stake in the present discussions on cohesion policy."
"The Commission and Parliament see the advantage of having our regions and cities on side and it can only be beneficial if their role as key actors in Lisbon and Göteborg is enhanced."
"It is with these overall objectives in mind that I would like to give you the Commission’s reactions to the proposed amendments, a reaction inspired by our common goals."
"The Commission is grateful for your support on many key points."
"I will list some of them."
"We have a common view on the architecture of the policy, one built around the objectives of regional competitiveness and employment, regional cooperation in a number of forms and of course convergence."
"It is vital to boost the growth of the poorest regions and close the wealth gap between them and the rest of the Union."
"Here EU cohesion policy has a starring role to play in raising aggregate productivity growth in the Union as a whole."
"We have a common view on the imperative of concentrating finance on the poorest regions."
"I fully share your opinion that the national strategic reference framework should be the object of the agreement between the Member States and the Commission."
"This agreement should provide the basis for the final decision of the Commission, in line with Article 26 of the draft General Regulation."
"We also have a common view on the essential role of cohesion policy in the drive towards a modern knowledge-based economy."
"That is why it is important for the Council to adopt strategic orientations for the Union as a whole and why we propose that Member States should draw up national strategies for the pursuit of these objectives."
"The report before you supports this view."
"However, I must tell this House that the battle is not yet won."
"We still have some way to go, therefore, to transform this part of the Commission proposal and the views of the European Council into a political reality."
"The Commission and Parliament also have a common view on the importance of territorial cohesion or, to put it another way, the understanding that economic modernisation will benefit if special attention is paid to particular places in Europe."
"The present urban initiative that was added to cohesion policy at the insistence of this House is a major success and the Commission wants to build on it by creating a special place not only for cities but also for rural areas."
"We have proposed a special programme for the outermost regions and welcome your support."
"These are some of the points where the resolutions before Parliament offer firm support for the Commission’s proposals."
"Others suggested by your rapporteurs will be taken on board by the Commission."
"Perhaps I can give one or two examples."
"Your resolution suggested that cohesion policy will be strengthened by better cooperation between ERDF co-financed operations and other Community policies."
"I fully share your view and I am working to bring this about."
"However, we all need to understand that the pursuit of this goal and the requirement that we concentrate our scarce financial resources mean that some kinds of project can no longer figure amongst our priorities."
"You also suggest the maintenance of a specific strength for inter-regional cooperation within the objective for European territorial cooperation."
"The Commission accepts this."
"You have proposed that the interoperability between the regional and social funds be increased from 5% to 10%."
"This gives greater flexibility to regional and national programme managers and thus ensures a close link in some cases between investment and training."
"The Commission believes this to be very useful and accepts the proposal."
"In the particular case of Mr Olbrycht’s report on European grouping for cross-border cooperation, I am pleased to be able to tell you that the Commission accepts most of Parliament’s amendments."
"Most important is the proposal that the registration of European groupings should be subject to national laws and associations."
"Discussing the amendments that the Commission cannot accept is always a more delicate matter."
"Here I will refer to one or two cases and hope that my explanations of the reasons behind the Commission’s approach will convince the House."
"I have already spoken of the need to focus cohesion policy on economic modernisation."
"I have also said that this is especially important for the regional competitiveness and employment objective."
"In this branch of the policy financial resources are particularly limited and, furthermore, we need to be able to demonstrate the added value to the overall economic situation."
"In that light, I am worried by the amendments that seek to enlarge the scope of the policy, especially the regional competitiveness objective."
"I understand why Members might believe the door should be opened a little wider here and there, but I would ask you to accept that, if we do not take great care, the policy will lose its ability to address key issues and key areas."
"We have to find an appropriate balance."
"For example, I do not believe that it would be appropriate to widen the scope of the policy generally to cover operating aid, or to soften the conditions covering land purchase."
"This is not because of a lack of sympathy; it is an acceptance of the overriding need to concentrate the policy on the main challenges."
"There are two particular points I should mention in this connection: VAT and housing."
"The VAT and housing discussions arise from an effort by the Commission to simplify the regulation by clearly listing elements of expenditure that are not eligible for funding."
"With regard to VAT, the discussions in the Council and the amendments put forward by honourable Members demonstrate that this part of the Commission’s proposal creates some problems, especially in new Member States."
"We want to avoid a position where ERDF cofinance goes straight into Member States’ budgets by cofinancing VAT payments."
"That position is, I am sure, shared by this House."
"At the same time I hear from you about problems: the cost for some beneficiaries, for example voluntary organisations and local governments, because the VAT they are obliged to pay is not recoverable."
"In the coming weeks the Commission will therefore reflect on its proposal with a view to finding a solution to your concerns."
"Much the same is true about housing, although the solution to the problem might not necessitate a change in the Commission’s proposal."
"Again, the Commission does not consider that housing expenditure should be eligible for co-financing under cohesion policy."
"That is not a change from past practice."
"It is merely a clarification."
"It is clear today from the amendments proposed by Members and from discussions in the Council that what was intended as a clarification might lead to confusion, thus complicating the lives of programme managers."
"The way out appears to be to make a common declaration with the Council that spells out the sort of investments associated with housing that are eligible for ERDF co-financing."
"Thus we would make clear, for example, that investments to improve the energy efficiency of housing are eligible for co-financing and that the same is true for investments to improve the environment around social housing."
"Another area covered by Members’ amendments is the automatic decommitment rule known as the n+2 rule, which will become applicable to the cohesion fund after 2007, since the Commission is proposing to move from the present project approach to the programme approach."
"This is the discipline that lies at the heart of the present high-quality performance of official policy programmes and is having beneficial effects on the ground."
"It turns out to be a strong incentive to efficient and rapid implementation of the programmes."
"We recognise, however, that the application of this rule for the Cohesion Fund could bring difficulties, especially in the new Member States, as the major focus of this fund is on large infrastructure projects where the investment cycle and public procurement procedures are considerably longer and more complex."
"We do not underestimate these problems."
"For this reason, we have been working together with the Presidency and the Member States in order to reconcile the requirements of proper financial management and discipline with the specific nature of the Cohesion Fund."
"The Commission cannot accept some suggestions by honourable Members that aim to alter the conditions for the implementation of the policy."
"Here, of course, we have to remember the importance of achieving sound financial management which leads us to maintain clarity and a clear distinction between the General Regulation and the ERDF Regulations."
"We have to remember the importance of decentralised management and the role of the regions and Member States in defining development strategies."
"We also have to ensure that the regulations that emerge can be clearly understood and followed by programme managers and that they do not contain political messages or statements of intent."
"It is on those grounds that the Commission is unable to accept a number of amendments."
"You are fully aware of the difficult conditions under which the debate on the future financial framework is taking place."
"The Commission needs your full support to ensure that an ambitious cohesion policy to achieve Lisbon and Göteborg objectives can be implemented by 2007."
"By adopting your reports, you are giving a clear signal to the Council of your determination to take up this important challenge."
"By choosing to discuss its position on the future shape of cohesion policy now, this Parliament is sending the message that there is no time to lose."
"You are signalling that you want to secure a medium-term future for a cohesion policy before the end of the year."
"The Commission supports you in this."
"We are doing all we can to ensure that the necessary decisions are taken as soon as possible under the British Presidency, so that the Member States and regions have new cohesion policy programmes ready to come into operation at the start of 2007."
". Ladies and gentlemen, if I may I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Silva Peneda, and all those who helped him, for the excellent work they have done."
"Parliament’s backing has been absolutely crucial to our formulation of a common objective that consists in establishing a legal basis that will enable the European Social Fund to promote the creation of more and better jobs."
"The Commission proposals on the reform of the Structural Funds in general, and of the European Social Fund in particular, have a number of underlying principles."
"Resources will be targeted at the Community’s key priorities and at those regions that need them most."
"Support will be provided for the European Employment Strategy, since this will allow the European Social Fund to make a direct contribution to achieving the Lisbon goals, as well as for individuals and those from disadvantaged groups."
"When implementing the European Social Fund, the Commission will continue to give priority to all groups that have problems finding or staying in employment, irrespective of the cause of these problems."
"One of the goals the Commission sets itself in the proposal is to achieve the widest possible involvement of all stakeholders who play a part in implementing the European Social Fund."
"The social partners should play a leading role in the future European Social Fund, as they have a key part to play in implementing employment policies and in European Social Fund interventions."
"The Commission shares Parliament’s view that NGOs should be more involved in cohesion policy, and in fact it is for this reason that it has reinforced the principles of partnership."
"The draft regulations already state that NGOs will be consulted on the programming, implementation and monitoring of measures taken under the European Social Fund."
"The Commission would stress that NGOs must have access to activities funded under the European Social Fund, particularly in the case of those organisations operating in the field of social inclusion and the fight against discrimination."
"The effort the rapporteurs have put into drawing up these reports will doubtless help us to draft an agreement more efficiently, as well as improving the final version of the proposal."
"I should like to thank them for their work."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Casa, on his excellent work and thank the Committee on Fisheries and its chairman for their valuable contribution to the debate on the European Fisheries Fund."
"I strongly appreciated the significant amount of work undertaken in order to achieve a timely delivery of Parliament’s opinion, as well as the active involvement of Member States and the fishing sector in this debate."
"I, myself, together with the Commission services, have travelled to various Member States to gather the opinions of administrations and the sector alike."
"Despite the large number of proposed amendments, I believe that in substance your proposals are close to ours and I am pleased to note your generous support for our proposal."
"This indicates that we have a common understanding that the new fund should serve the purpose of implementing the CFP and aim at achieving sustainable development of the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the Community."
"I do not share the view of the rapporteur that the fund focuses too much on the environmental dimension."
"It focuses on the attainment of sustainable fisheries in the long term in the interests of fishermen themselves – sustainability in all senses of the word: economic, social and environmental."
"I now wish to say a few words on where we currently stand with the proposal."
"As you know, the Council met on 20 and 21 June to discuss the proposal after significant work had been undertaken at the technical level."
"Under the Presidency’s stewardship we were able to progress towards a broad consensus with Member States, while taking into account the work that was ongoing in the Committee on Fisheries."
"To mention only three areas where we have met your concerns, I refer to the extension of aid to medium-sized enterprises operating in the aquaculture processing and marketing sectors, to the inclusion of new provisions in support of small-scale fisheries and young fishermen, and to increased flexibility in the selection criteria for fisheries regions where local development strategies can be implemented."
"We did not, however, conclude the discussions in the Council on 21 June."
"Member States still have divergent opinions on aid for new constructions and modernisation of the fleet, with some of them requesting the reinstatement of aid for the construction of vessels."
"I have expressed my position in the Council, which I wish to reiterate here."
"I am not prepared to reopen the debate on aid for the construction of vessels, which was phased out during the common fisheries policy reform."
"To do so in the context of over-capacity and over-fishing would undermine our determination to achieve sustainable fisheries and our commitment at international level not to subsidise the increase in fleet capacity."
"We need not only a commitment that our own capacity is not increased, but we need to decrease capacity to attain sustainable fisheries."
"Concerning support to vessel modernisation, the Commission is ready to accept some changes advocated by the Committee on Fisheries."
"Firstly, by clarifying that aid will be available to modernise vessels below deck for safety, working conditions, hygiene and product quality purposes, provided capacity is not increased."
"Secondly, by making safety-related items explicitly eligible under the European Fisheries Fund."
"In many ways, the discussions in the Council mirror the arguments expressed by the European Parliament with regard to the restructuring of small-scale coastal fisheries."
"I am convinced that specific attention to small-scale fisheries is justified because of their important role in the economic and social fabric of fishing communities, their territorial dimension and the competition they often face from other segments of the fleet."
"We are, therefore, willing to include funding for the replacement of engines for small-scale vessels, while ensuring that capacity is not increased and stocks are exploited in a sustainable manner."
"This could take place in particular in the framework of coastal management plans aimed at the sustainable development of fisheries for the benefit of local communities."
"I am confident today’s debate will contribute to improving further the content of the European Fisheries Fund proposal."
"We shall continue our work with the Council to finalise its adoption in due time and I am committed to informing the Council of your outstanding concerns after today’s debate."
"– President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to point out that I am speaking in my capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets on the issue of the Structural Funds."
"In the time allocated to me, there is so much to say that I have decided to select a number of points which, with the budgetary orthodoxy of this Parliament, apply to all opinions and are relevant to the various reports concerned, both that of my colleague Mr Andria on the Cohesion Fund, and those on the ERDF, ESF and European Fisheries Fund, as well as the general opinion of our fellow Member Mr Hatzidakis on the Regulation laying down general provisions."
"I also thank all my fellow Members for the vast amount of work they have undertaken."
"The challenges facing Europe are now, more than ever, of critical importance for the development of the European Union’s future competitiveness, for which the Structural Funds represent not only the indispensable financial instruments but also, today, in the current Europe of 25, which we are now building – in this Enlarged Europe – the spearhead for the Union’s budgetary objectives and the essential vector for our ambitions for Europe."
"I shall not refer again to the substantial work done by the Committee on Budgets or to that of the Parliamentary Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspectives."
"While Europe is experiencing an unprecedented crisis, Parliament has assumed its responsibilities by adopting, in June, the Böge report on the budgetary means of the enlarged Union 2007-2013."
"It is true that, during the preparatory discussion on the Structural Funds, based on the Commission’s proposal which focused on the three objectives of convergence, regional competitiveness and employment, and European territorial cooperation, we had no clear indication of the figures contained in the budget."
"Today, the situation remains complex, not to say grotesque, to use the words of some of our fellow citizens: we are asked to express a view on the Structural Funds while still being unaware of the final amounts to be allocated to them if – as I and the vast majority of our colleagues hope – we manage to reach a rapid agreement on the financial perspectives."
"In connection with two or three key matters, I should therefore just like to stress a few principles based on common sense and simple budgetary orthodoxy, which will enhance the role of the European Parliament as a budgetary authority."
"The first is that once these financial perspectives have been approved, the Commission will, firstly, confirm the amounts indicated in the proposal for a regulation or, if applicable and necessary, submit the amended amounts for approval by the European Parliament and the Council to ensure they fall within the ceilings, as the Committee on Budgets is constantly pointing out that they should."
"The second point, already referred to on many occasions, debated at length and regularly stressed in Parliament’s Committee on Budgets, is to draw attention to the positive results of applying the N+2 rule and to propose that it should be retained as a matter of principle."
"The Regulation laying down General Provisions and the Regulation on the Cohesion Fund stipulate that this N+2 rule should apply to the Cohesion Fund."
"I would remind members that the aim of this rule is to encourage the beneficiary Member States to use the funds committed without delay, obliging them to use a degree of discipline in the preparation and financial management of projects."
"However, aware of the potential difficulties for the new Member States in making rapid use of the Structural Funds, we, and, in particular, the rapporteur Mr Andria obtained, with great difficulty and after long discussions, a compromise whereby the N+2 rule would be relaxed in response to the requests from our new colleagues and should become sufficiently flexible to enable projects to be started and executed rapidly."
"The time allowed under the N+2 rule will start to run on day 1 of the project’s implementation, not on the first day of scheduling by the Commission, thereby creating the flexibility that will help us in achieving our aims."
"Lastly, I shall not go back over the issue of non-refundable VAT, on which we wholeheartedly uphold the position of Commissioner Hübner."
"To conclude, the Committee on Budgets will ensure that its different positions adopted by Parliament are defended."
"It is, of course, ready to begin negotiations without delay with the Council and Commission on the financial perspectives, to which it is strongly committed, believing that, contrary to the statements of Jack Straw reported in Le Figaro on 30 June, it would be extremely serious if we were unable to reach agreement before the end of this year."
"If we delayed in reaching agreement, we must realise that the delay in implementing the policies would have serious economic and social consequences for our fellow Europeans."
"However, despite this, it is important to be clear on one point: Parliament will not accept a bad agreement, and we shall have no hesitation in rejecting it."
"Mr President, we are all fully aware of the fact that the number of goals we are setting ourselves, and the number of needs that must be met, exceeds by far the funds at our disposal."
"It is therefore quite obvious that these funds must be programmed as well as possible and put to the most effective use possible."
"This is the aim behind the amendments that have been tabled to the next Financial Perspective."
"It is quite incomprehensible, however, that certain principles that have proved their worth and functioned properly to date have been abandoned."
"I am thinking in particular of the multi-fund approach, which makes it possible for the funds needed to implement a single task to be combined as effectively as possible at Member State level, or in other words for the money to be used as the country in question sees fit."
"This approach is now going to be changed by restricting cross-financing to 5%."
"Why change a rule that works well, and for which the administrative instruments have already been put in place and staff trained?"
"Why change a rule that allows for greater freedom of decision-making in operational planning and in implementing tasks?"
"Another issue I wish to raise is funding for housing."
"I obviously agree with the changes proposed by the Commission to the effect that funding for housing is not permitted as such, and I am delighted that Mrs Hübner has explained that expenditure on housing that results in energy savings and environmental protection is eligible."
"Since I come from a new Member State, Poland, however, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that social housing in the countries of the former Communist bloc mainly consists of prefabricated blocks of flats, which are no longer environmentally friendly, and which in many instances are extremely unsafe."
"It would therefore be worth giving some thought to whether it would be a good idea to fund the regeneration of such buildings under the Cohesion Fund, since it is impossible for the necessary number of homes to be completely rebuilt from scratch."
"Mr President, I welcome the fact that even while the European Union is experiencing constitutional and budgetary crises, we are debating the nature of the key instruments of European solidarity, namely the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and the Social Fund."
"It was solidarity that provided the foundations for the European project, and it is thanks to a policy of solidarity that the founding states have integrated so rapidly with the poorer countries of our continent."
"Given that we are sitting in Strasbourg, it is worth noting that many years ago, thanks to the Marshall Plan, the economies of Western Europe were regenerated from their wartime ruins."
"This includes the German economy, which is now the most powerful in Europe."
"It was the Communist governments of Central Europe that rejected the Marshall Plan, in so doing condemning their peoples to decades of backwardness in terms of development."
"As Mr Juncker highlighted in his farewell speech, the policy of solidarity is the most important policy of the united Europe."
"Unfortunately, this policy was not accorded its proper place in the otherwise excellent speech by the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair."
"It is a great shame that this was the case."
"The new EU Member States are prepared to carry out reforms and to make changes."
"We have been undertaking reforms for the past 15 years, and we are not easily scared by the need to tackle new challenges."
"These new Member States can therefore act as a natural ally for London in its desire to build a modern and affluent EU that is developing rapidly, and that is free of fears and anxieties."
"We will not achieve such a thing unless we continue to pursue a policy of cohesion, solidarity and support for poorer countries and regions, as this is the most important aspect of EU policy."
"New areas that promote balanced development, such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, carbon dioxide collection and environmentally friendly public transport need to become eligible for funding."
"Management of water networks should also be financed under the Cohesion Fund, in particular flood prevention programmes and the Natura 2000 network."
"I also propose that the present principles governing the eligibility of VAT with regard to funding under the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund should be kept in place."
"This is of key importance in terms of experience in benefiting from the Structural Funds."
". – Mr President, when we talk of we must also include in it the contribution by the European Parliament, with the experience and the exceptional, constructive contribution by MEPs such as Mr Hatzidakis, who not only with this report on the proposal for a regulation laying down provisions for the European Structural Funds on which we are to vote, but also with a previous third report and the working paper last December, has contributed to the maintenance and strengthening of economic and social cohesion and is now also calling for specific reference to the territorial cohesion of the European Union."
"The recommendations in the motion for a resolution and the specific proposals for certain changes or addenda to the Commission proposal will, we hope, help to formulate a position which is also politically acceptable to the Council for the preparation of a reliable budget for the period 2007-2013."
"We welcome the rapporteur's proposal for a balanced Europe-wide polycentric model for sustainable development, with balanced development of the convergence objective and the competitiveness and employment objective regions and with flexible European cooperation."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I note with satisfaction that specific recommendations were incorporated into the report, such as the extension of the principle of equality between men and women, in order to ensure the absence of any form of discrimination."
"This is supplemented by the call for an evaluation of the progress made in promoting equality of men and women and social inclusion."
"It is also proposed that accessibility for the disabled should be a precondition to the securing of benefits from the funds."
"We also highlight the rapporteur's suggestion for calculating the percentage of cofinancing, so that the participation of non-governmental organisations and non-profit-making organisations in Structural Fund activities is not affected."
"As far as the European Social Fund is concerned, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Peneda, on his willingness to cooperate, so that the proposals in the new regulation for this fund will prove to be effective, especially for European men and women, with flexibility in the eligibility of convergence and competitiveness regions."
"We note with satisfaction that the Peneda proposal emphasises the mainstreaming of equality between men and women and the abolition of discrimination in all policies, through special actions designed to increase the sustainable participation of women and promote their vocational training and careers, in accordance with the prospects of the Lisbon Strategy."
"We note the lacklustre presence of measures to publicise the activities financed under the proposal for a regulation for the European Social Fund; these are needed to ensure that interested parties will have simple and fast access to them."
". Mr President, the first thing we have suggested to the Committee on Transport and Tourism is that the Cohesion Fund aid should not just include the trans-European transport networks defined in the Decision of 1996, that is to say, those approved by the Essen Council, but also all of those identified by the high-level Van Miert Group, which also deals with the new Member States, motorways of the sea and the GALILEO project, all of which are included in our decision of last year, 2004."
"Furthermore, with regard to the fields to which Cohesion Fund aid should be directed, we recommend that routes equivalent to motorways or state roads that connect trans-European networks also be considered and that rail rolling stock and collective means of transport be included, as well as the road infrastructure for coach and bus transport."
"Finally, we suggest that the regulation we are debating today should not prevent the Council from extending the application of the Cohesion Fund, on an annually-decreasing basis during 2007-2013, to Member States whose wealth exceeds 90% of the European average, not because they have experienced positive developments in their economic growth, but because of the simple statistical effect of the incorporation into the union of new Member States with below average GDP."
"Unless we do that, we will be deceiving ourselves."
"– Mr President, the report for an opinion on the Regional Development Fund, which I presented to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, was adopted unanimously on three priorities: achievement of the Lisbon objectives, a policy of sustainable full employment and an ambitious policy for people with disabilities."
"This dossier goes far beyond social concerns and encompasses the Community’s priorities, and it is likely to become the Union’s dominant policy, ahead of the Common Agricultural Policy, in three areas, namely solidarity, effectiveness and justice."
"Solidarity with the new Member States, but under certain conditions."
"Respect for the internal market’s competition rules."
"Solidarity must not mean weakness."
"I therefore agree with fellow Members, like our rapporteur Mr Fava, who propose not including VAT among reimbursable expenses and not reallocating resources that have become subject to automatic release under the N+2 rule."
"These policies must be optimised."
"Until now, we have seen that credits have been devoted to simple projects, to the detriment of projects of structural significance."
"This mistake is regrettable and could be exacerbated by the performance reserve."
"Our approach should be one of concentrating our focus on a reduced number of topics."
"Solidarity and effectiveness: effectiveness means pursuing the aims of the Lisbon Agenda and investing in research and the development of employment."
"Solidarity, effectiveness and justice: this policy must remain a Community policy, directed at all Member States."
"I am grateful to Commissioner Hübner for having agreed with this during her visit to my region – the Loire – last Thursday."
"Uncertainty regarding the financial perspectives – as you have seen, Mr Michael – has not stopped us from giving our views on spending and on structural changes."
"The British Presidency may well be faced with the same situation."
"Finally, I would express the hope, certainly shared by our rapporteur Mr Fava, that a consensus may emerge on these reports similar to the one achieved on the Böge report."
"The subjects of both reports are related."
"Parliament will perform its role all the more effectively if the Council’s position is not too distant from the one we have defined."
"In this difficult period, it is important that the European Parliament should remain committed to the Community’s seriousness of purpose and ambition."
"."
"Mr President, today is a historic day for this House, which sees us continuing on the course of cohesion policy and solidarity in Europe, with gratitude to the rapporteurs for their farsightedness."
"In today’s debate, I should like to confine myself to new objective 2 and objective 3, promoting competition, innovation and inter-regional cooperation in Europe, which, in the Commission proposals, amount to a total package of approximately EUR 40 billion, thus also demonstrating that these objectives make a crucial contribution to the Lisbon objectives."
"In yesterday’s deliberations in the committee, Mrs Hübner was right to talk in terms of the ‘Lisbonisation’ of the structural funds."
"In the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I called for private cofinancing to be increased in each amendment as a matter of priority."
"By means of innovation, industry provides the tractive force, while Lisbon determines the course."
"The government puts 1% on the table, industry 2%."
"Secondly, structural funds should be specifically linked to objective 2 in the research and development budget."
"The options for accelerating by means of open innovation, and research and knowledge in intensive production go hand in hand."
"Commissioner Verheugen’s proposals for the CIP are also along these lines."
"Thirdly, the SMEs should be given more opportunities to tap into these funds directly, with public knowledge being made available to them more rapidly, by means, for example, of the knowledge vouchers."
"Fourthly, a fourth provision should be drafted with regard to access to funds for all border regions."
"These should remain available for this purpose."
"After all, Lisbon does not stop at the border."
"Finally, the ‘Lisbonisation’ has only just started and competition at world level is becoming even more cut-throat."
"As a Dutchman, I have to conclude that there has been no debate, or only partial debate, on the new agenda for structural funds, and so we have to raise the level a few notches."
"Outside, there is the , but this is a ."
"In the next debate in Parliament with the Council, on the ERDF criteria, for example, I think that we should elaborate on how the Lisbon objective can be specifically fleshed out."
". Mr President, there is a set of very sensitive issues in the debates on structural and cohesion funds leading to conflicts of opinion that go beyond the political groups."
"Most of the political groups are divided on the issues of the N+2 rule, VAT and public-private partnerships."
"We must ensure that the poorest beneficiaries will benefit from the funds."
"It is important that the aim of simplifying the regulations does not hamper the poorest beneficiaries in their attempts to apply for funds."
"The reports as they stand regarding the rules on VAT and PPP would have terrible consequences for local authorities wishing to apply for funds."
"These rules imply additional costs that the poorest beneficiaries will not be able to cope with."
"We are not requesting more money."
"On the contrary, we are just asking for the current regulation in this respect to be maintained."
"It is simply not fair to change the rules of the game now that ten new Member States with lower socio-economic development have joined the Union."
"This is not a conflict between the old and new Member States, or at least it should not be."
"I urge you, therefore, to bear in mind the very principles of structural and cohesion policies."
"These policies were designed to help the poorest and not to create additional difficulties for the beneficiaries."
"We all acknowledge the fact that the Union is currently facing an important crisis."
"We have to reflect seriously on what message our Parliament will send at this critical moment."
"Therefore, I urge you, in the name of solidarity with the poorest, to support the amendments tabled on the issues of N+2, VAT and PPP."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, contributing to correcting regional imbalances is an objective of extraordinary interest and substance in this difficult period for Europe, provided that it offers the citizens a clear and understandable project."
"The rapporteur for the European Regional Development Fund, Mr Fava, has carried out some excellent work in this direction; he has welcomed the contributions of the other committees whose opinions were sought and, based on a financial dimension that must not be decreased, he has set out a credible solution for reducing the disparities."
"An essential part of this reduction is represented by gender mainstreaming."
"The fact that the initial Commission proposal contained no explicit reference to mainstreaming as an added value means of restoring the balance in the regions was a worrying step backwards."
"I therefore express my satisfaction, including on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, with the manner in which the report has succeeded in reintegrating this aspect and I call on the House to vote in favour."
"I also call on the Commission and the representative of the Council not to consider that overcoming the gender imbalance is negotiable, including within the bodies for managing, overseeing and controlling the Structural Funds, which the Member States will have to create."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I do not believe it is an exaggeration for me to describe European structural policy as being at the heart of the European Union, or to compare cuts in it with the sort of risky heart surgery which can go wrong, or can leave the patient disabled, and is therefore best avoided."
"I would like to point out to the British Presidency something we all know, that being that a body without a heart is dead."
"Set your hand against structural policy, and you put the Community at risk."
"I wish again to call on all those present in the Chamber to organise the European Structural Funds in such a way that they play as fundamental a role in the body as the heart: the body is healthy if all its parts are well, if they live in solidarity with one another and deal fairly with one another, rather than using the resources available to them to compete with one another to the point of their mutual destruction."
"For that to happen, though, resources need to be deployed sustainably, efficiently and from the bottom up, enabling the weakest to be made strong and an appropriate response to development problems."
"This House has produced a substantially better proposal than the Commission’s for how this might be done with the new Structural Funds."
"It is of the utmost importance that all its drafts give particular attention to the local level – as a recipient of support, as a programme level, and as a stakeholder."
"I would therefore like again to stress the constant importance of the European Structural Funds when problems need to be addressed."
"Both in small villages and in the run-down neighbourhoods of major cities, they make Europe visible and tangible for the inhabitants and are for that reason indispensable to Europe’s integration."
"This is most apparent in the case of the European Social Fund, which Parliament’s substantial improvements have made into a ‘fund for the little people’, which springs into action where people are at risk of exclusion, gives support to those who have lost out, and inspiration where there is a need for innovation in the creation of jobs."
"I would like to respond to what the Council Presidency has said by again emphasising the possibility of creating jobs even in regions that are already regarded as lost causes."
"This House’s amendments make the ESF a superb instrument for this purpose."
"Its conception runs directly counter to the idea that it is only by means of large-scale investments that competition can be fostered and jobs created."
"It intervenes where there is a need for knowledge and the potential for innovation at a regional level, and, as problem areas are no exception in this respect, it is there that it can bring success."
"I would again like to emphasise that the Commission has done nothing to back up its claim that EQUAL was to be absorbed wholesale into the ESF."
"This makes Parliament’s amendments particularly important as a means of ensuring that the whole approach is taken on board in an innovative way."
"I would like to conclude by saying something about the partnership principle."
"The Council’s attempt to abandon it is a full-frontal assault on the democratic nature of the Structural Funds, for it is control by society that ensures that money is not squandered and is actually put to use where it is needed."
"It follows that a greater emphasis on the partnership principle is vital to the Structural Funds."
"While we endorse the Commission’s proposal for the involvement of those partners who represent groups that are only now, and at last, gaining recognition in accordance with the anti-discrimination clause in the Treaty, these groups lack the know-how required in order to be able to deliver estimates and opinions as equal partners."
"I am again addressing the Commission when I say that we do not believe it to be wise to play gender mainstreaming off against such groups."
"Let me again observe that the European Structural Funds can be successful only as and when they take due account of the sustainability principle."
"Mr President, the full objectives of the European Fisheries Fund are commendable and clear: firstly, adjustment of fishing effort and better protection of the marine environment; secondly, aquaculture processing and marketing; thirdly, promoting collective interests, such as measures intended to protect aqua, aquatic fauna, fishing ports and the development of new markets; fourthly, sustainable development of coastal fishing areas."
"There are, however, several real problems."
"First of all, while the budget looks sizeable at EUR 4 963 million, it represents an increase of only EUR 0.7 billion on the previous budget for a seven-year period from 2007 to 2013."
"Secondly, we have ten new Member countries, so there is no real increase."
"Secondly, I am disappointed that this report ignores an amendment adopted by the Committee on Regional Development, that 25% of the Community financial contribution should be set aside for Axis 4: the sustainable development of coastal fishing areas."
"Those are areas under threat."
"The statistic is quite startling: 8 000 jobs are lost, on average, every year in direct fishing."
"The coastal fishing areas are the most peripheral and are under threat."
"What is needed is a fishing policy joined up with the regional policy, and there is scant reference to this in the report."
"Several amendments from the rapporteur proposed grant aid for the replacement of fishing vessels, the upgrading and modernisation of fishing vessels, but no percentage limit has been set aside for that."
"If we go down that road, the bulk of the fund will be swallowed up and the key objectives of the fund will not be realised."
"It should be the responsibility of the Member States, subject to the approval of the EU, to assist in the purchase, modernisation and up-grading of replacement fishing vessels, but subject to the EU."
"What we need is to protect and enhance fishing stocks."
"The emphasis, as the Commissioner said, has to be on sustainability: protecting the aquatic environment so that this will happen, protecting the existing fishing communities that are so under threat."
"Finally, we must enable fishing communities to diversify."
". Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs, in particular Mr Hatzidakis, Mr Fava and Mr Andria, whose work we have been able to follow closely in the Committee on Regional Development, which has been intimately involved in the debate."
"They have offered a wonderful example of dedication, compromise and a will to seek agreement."
"I would also like to congratulate Commissioner Hübner, because his determination that our legislative work should make progress has helped us to overcome the discouragement that followed the failure of the last Council."
"I hope that the vote in plenary tomorrow will be correctly understood by the Council as a demonstration of the European Parliament’s determination that the cohesion policy should continue to be built upon an essential pillar of European integration."
"I would like to draw the British Presidency’s attention to this because some may take the view that by opening up very general debates — though they are undoubtedly very important — we could end up failing to conclude anything."
"There is no need to point out that it is already too late for the Commission to draw up the programmes implementing the Funds by January 2007."
"If we had to wait until spring next year for the Council to reach an agreement, the Commission would not be able to go ahead with the first payments until 2009, which would be dramatic for the cohesion policy in general and in particular for the new Member States, to whom the United Kingdom has always expressed its commitment."
"I believe that the European Parliament’s contributions will be acceptable, in particular the compromises on such sensitive issues as the N+2 rule, VAT or the statistical effect."
"Mr President, the three institutions have the responsibility to tackle the negotiations over the coming months with a determination to reach agreement, because we cannot, and must not, allow any further failure."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my contribution to this joint debate on structural and cohesion policy with thanks to my colleagues, particularly to the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, most especially to Mr Hutchinson, our own shadow rapporteur on the Hatzidakis report, who is prevented from being here today – something that he very much regrets – by the fact that he is acting as an election observer in Burundi."
"We in the Committee have worked through hundreds of amendments to find compromises that I regard as constituting very positive input in response to the Commission proposals."
"We very much endorse the general approach of simplifying cohesion and structural policy and making them less bureaucratic."
"Aspects of importance to our group have been still further emphasised, among them the reinforcement of the partnership principle and of the urban dimension of cohesion and structural policy, involving among other things the possibility of projects to improve the environment through support for the building of social housing; the Committee also agreed that private-public partnerships should also be an option and decided on a joint approach to the situation of regions affected by the statistical effect."
"The Committee as a whole saw it as important that we should, in a spirit of solidarity, make policy for people in the poorest and most disadvantaged of the regions in an enlarged European Union."
"Our group found the issue of the reimbursement of VAT by the Regional Funds a difficult one to discuss."
"While most of our group take the view that European structural policy should be used for investment in the regions and not to reimburse the public purse, we are aware of the problems faced by municipalities, especially in the new Member States, and so we have proposed a compromise amendment to the Hatzidakis report, which is intended to make it possible to resolve the problems in these Member States."
"I would be very glad if the majority in this House were to support this compromise amendment and urge them to do just that."
"Last but not least, though, I would urge the Presidency of the Council to adopt the Financial Perspective with the minimum possible delay and to allocate sufficient funding to what I regard as the most successful of the European Union’s policies."
"Even the best regulations are no use without the funds they need."
"I would ask you, Mr Michael, to carry to Mr Blair the message that, in your country too, there are outstanding examples of the good that European structural policy can do, and we want them to continue to operate even after 1 January 2007."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, like my fellow Members, I want, first of all, in my own name and on behalf of my colleagues in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to congratulate and thank the rapporteurs who have done an excellent job."
"They have worked with characteristic determination, but it was their flexibility and ability to listen that made it possible to reach something of a general consensus."
"As coordinator of the ALDE Group, I should like to stress four points."
"Firstly, the general architecture of these Structural Funds is such that they are mutually complementary and consistent with one another, something which should be emphasised in the communication to our populations."
"These Structural Funds are not something abstract."
"They are Funds that help to improve the conditions of daily life for our fellow citizens."
"A specific communication in these terms should therefore be planned."
"On this first practical point, I should like to say something about solidarity, as a number of fellow Members have done."
"These are not just words."
"The European Union, on this specific issue, is not just all about fine words, it is about figures – and they are extremely eloquent ones, because around 80% of the Structural Funds, in accordance with the budgetary guidelines, will be devoted to the objective of convergence."
"You have said, Mr Michael, that the Structural Funds were currently the European Union's second largest item of expenditure after the common agricultural policy."
"In future years, they are likely to become the largest item of expenditure."
"As regards solidarity, I should like to stress that the 25 Member States have all decided together – and Parliament will confirm this – that we are going to devote over 80% of the funds from this leading item of Parliament’s budget to solidarity with the ten new Member States."
"This is tangible and concrete proof, in coin of the realm, of our solidarity with the new Member States, which have great need of it and which, I hope, will receive an allocation of considerably more that EUR 300 billion."
"Finally, to conclude on a note of hope – but a hope that will certainly be fulfilled – I have no doubt whatsoever that the success we have seen in Ireland, Spain and Portugal will be achieved in the ten new Member States that will benefit from these Funds."
"But beyond the Funds themselves, I should also, and above all, stress the use made of them."
"It is one thing to have a franc, euro, dollar or schilling."
"Actual use has to be made of this money."
"I do not have the time to develop this point further, but please allow me to emphasise, in relation to the potential of the Funds, the need to ensure that Member States are aware of all the opportunities we offer, and which are available, for guaranteeing that the Funds are used properly."
"To conclude, I should like to direct a remark to you in particular, Mr Michael, as representative of the Presidency, and say, once again quoting a figure that I believe speaks volumes, that if we do not reach agreement on the financial perspectives this autumn, in 2007 the ten new Member States will only receive some EUR 9 billion, whereas with a 2007-2013 policy, a policy of solidarity through the use of the Structural Funds, they will receive EUR 22 billion."
"These two figures perfectly illustrate the absolute need to implement these financial perspectives without delay."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by expressing my respect and gratitude to all the rapporteurs, particularly, though, to Mr Andria for his open-mindedness during the discussions on the substance of his report on the Cohesion Fund while we were working together on it."
"He had the same attitude to the Commission proposal which served as the basis for our work."
"Our group has, for a long time, been campaigning for the Cohesion Fund to be covered by the general directives on the Structural Fund, which would make not only for EU funds to be spent in a more targeted way, for more transparency and greater efficiency, but also for the regions to have more rights to be consulted when identifying programmes and projects, thus putting the partnership principle into practice."
"All these courses of action we unreservedly endorse, as well as the Commission’s proposal that a new priority be added to the Cohesion Fund."
"It is evident that there is also broad support in Parliament for energy efficiency projects, and I would also urge its support for the few additional amendments that we have tabled."
"We want funds to be allocated equally to the environment and the transport infrastructure, the intention being that Europe should, at long last, give equal support to all modes of transport and that the unfair preference given to roadbuilding projects should cease."
"I am sure that those among you who have already tried to travel from Brussels to Strasbourg by train will support what we are trying to do."
"I will conclude by wishing both the British Presidency and the previous speakers good luck, in the hope that we will soon have adopted a budget, and will not be irresponsibly endangering the maintenance of the Structural Funds’ programmes."
". – Mr President, the existence of a properly funded and proactive European regional policy is an essential prerequisite for the EU to be able to foster economic and social cohesion and to address increasing economic and social disparities."
"The Structural and Cohesion Funds are a vital tool, and indeed the only tool in the Community budget geared towards redistribution."
"These Funds enable the EU to take action to reduce regional disparities, to promote real convergence, to stimulate sustainable development, growth, production and jobs in the regions, and to redistribute and offset the costs of the internal market in the least-developed regions."
"Accordingly, one of the crucial issues is the financial envelope, with regard to both the amount involved and the way in which it is distributed."
"As far as we are concerned, the figure of 0.41% of EU gross national income is woefully inadequate in terms of achieving the proposed objectives and of meeting the cohesion needs of an enlarged EU."
"Yet this is the Commission’s proposal, and that of our very own Parliament in its report on the Financial Perspective."
"In limiting themselves to this ceiling, they are undermining the EU’s ability effectively to promote economic and social cohesion and are failing to address such crucial questions as full compensation for regions affected by the statistical effect, Portugal’s Algarve region being one such region; adequate financing of the transition mechanisms, including the Cohesion Fund; and the adequate financing of the outermost regions."
"As such, the signatory countries to the so-called ‘Letter of the Six’, whose aim is to restrict the Community budget to 1% of EU gross national income, have got their way."
"The recent European Council’s failure to reach agreement on the Financial Perspective 2007-2013 is, however one looks at it, a victory for the ‘Letter of the Six’ signatory countries."
"The Luxembourg Presidency had proposed a compromise reduction in the Structural Funds envelope of over EUR 30 billion for the period in question, which translates into 0.37% of EU gross domestic product."
"The reports before us also fail to address implementation needs, with regard to pre-financing and cofinancing amounts, and to the issue of pegging the Cohesion Fund to the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Unfortunately, a new mindset for the Structural Funds and for their adaptation to the financing of the Lisbon Strategy has become prevalent."
"Such is the case of the European Social Fund, which plays second fiddle to the European Employment Strategy."
"We are therefore opposed to the emphasis placed on competitiveness, competition, adaptability and entrepreneurial spirit, at the expense of cohesion and convergence."
"Against this backdrop, we have tabled proposals for amendments to the reports before us with a view to addressing these key concerns and to stepping up European social cohesion."
". – The debate on the Hatzidakis report is taking place at a time when the EU is mired in a profound crisis, which was triggered by irresponsible attempts to force the European Constitution on the Member States."
"The Constitution is a dead duck, and we have it to thank for the fact that age-old animosities have flared between Member States, and for the fact that they are not even able to agree on the 2007-2013 budget."
"Despite this heated atmosphere, however, we regret to say that the Hatzidakis report divides the EU once again into two blocs, namely the old Member States and the new Member States."
"For understandable reasons, the old Member States are finding very creative ways to limit the funding that was intended to accelerate development in the new Member States."
"The report tells us that those living in the 15 old Member States are best off, and that if they also live on islands, or even better in outermost regions – and particularly if they are inhabitants of regions affected by the statistical effect – then they have nothing to worry about."
"Due to short-sighted considerations, frequently motivated by pre-election nerves, the report fails to mention that by far the greatest problem facing the unified Europe is how to overcome the effects of half a century of non-market developments in the post-communist Member States."
"In order to make it even more difficult for the inexperienced new Member States to obtain funding, the report rules out a more flexible application of the n+2 rule for the Structural Funds, and provides no solution to the problem of VAT and EU cofinanced projects."
"The report is also a slap in the face for any right-thinking entrepreneur who wishes to move production to another Member State where he can find qualified, cheap and industrious workers."
"On the one hand, we do not allow the infamous Polish plumber to work on the other side of the former Iron Curtain, because he might prove that it is possible to work a 40-hour week."
"On the other hand, however, we impose a senseless obligation on entrepreneurs to remain in regions of the EU where the workforce is excessively expensive, and often accustomed to working a 35-hour week for full wages."
"We are preventing entrepreneurs from going in search of Polish plumbers, merely because they once profited from the Structural Funds."
"They were unaware at the time that one day we would hold them hostage for having done so; according to one proposal, they would not be set free for 10 years, which is quite absurd."
"Perhaps they should have thought twice before accepting the payout."
"This is the perfect antithesis of the Lisbon goals, but maybe it fits in with the Gothenburg strategy."
"The Hatzidakis report does however highlight another of the EU’s problems, albeit unintentionally."
"It shows contemptuous disregard for public will by repeatedly referring to the Constitution for Europe, which was categorically rejected and buried by the people of France and the Netherlands, and thus demonstrates the same spirit of elitism that plunged the EU into this far-reaching crisis."
"For this reason alone, it is hard to vote in favour of this report."
"Mr President, I too should like to extend my sincere thanks to all the authors of the reports under discussion."
"This debate on the future of the cohesion policy is an important test of the practical application of one of the fundamental values the EU professes to hold, namely solidarity with a view to achieving equal opportunities."
"I would remind the House that the aim of the cohesion policy is to support the restructuring and modernisation of those countries that need assistance in order to have any chance of rapidly catching up to the average level of economic development in the European Union."
"At present this relates above all to the new Member States."
"From their point of view, the application of the n+2 rule and the classing of VAT as an eligible expense should without a doubt be considered the most important of all the issues we are discussing today."
"The nature of projects financed under the Cohesion Fund means that preparation alone takes longer than two years."
"They are often enormous investment projects, which go beyond the normal time frame of projects financed under the Structural Funds."
"Extending the application of the n+2 rule would doubtless mean a drop in the level of funding granted."
"As far as VAT is concerned, the experiences of the new Member States are incontrovertible proof that the main barrier to the use of the Structural Funds is the relatively high cost of launching projects."
"This cost is covered out of the beneficiaries’ own resources."
"Excluding VAT from the list of eligible expenses would result in many entities, including local authorities, being unable to afford the enormous costs associated with implementing projects."
"For example, preliminary estimates indicate that the Member States may have to contribute almost 63% of the sum contributed by the EU for the implementation of projects under the European Regional Development Fund."
"This would put the new Member States in a position that is considerably worse than that of the Member States that previously benefited from the Structural Funds."
"I would remind the Members from the old Member States that we should seize this opportunity for solidarity, and give Europe a chance to develop."
"This would also be in the interests of the old Member States."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in listening to the debate so far I have been struck by the fact that we clearly all agree on one point, namely that the aim of cohesion policy is to ensure the balanced development of all the regions in the individual Member States."
"As such, it complies with the principle of solidarity, which is one of the founding pillars of the European Union."
"In my opinion, if we are to continue adhering to this principle following the recent enlargement, when 10 new Member States joined the EU, it is imperative that we adopt two key proposed amendments during tomorrow’s vote on the Structural Funds."
"Firstly, we should agree to the funding of non-recoverable VAT under the Structural Funds, and in particular under the European Regional Development Fund."
"Classing non-recoverable VAT as non-eligible expenditure would make it a great deal more difficult for many recipients to obtain funding."
"My fear is that it might become entirely impossible to gain access to EU funding, in particular in the case of smaller applicants from the 10 new and less wealthy Member States."
"Secondly, we should remove the automatic decommitment rule, or in other words the n+2 rule, from the guidelines for implementation of the Cohesion Fund, or at the very least provide for greater flexibility during the first few years of the programming period."
"Major investment projects in the environment and transport sectors are financed under the Cohesion Fund, and rigorous application of the n+2 rule would pose a serious threat to this financing."
"Once again, this is particularly true in the case of the 10 new Member States, which still lack experience in implementing the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group endorses the idea contained in the Fava report that the ERDF should concentrate on investments, infrastructures and further development initiatives in selected areas that are a priority for the Community, as it continues to be the case that the whole Community can expect to derive considerable additional benefit from investments of this kind."
"In essence, the report, as adopted by the Committee, adds muscle to those of the Regulation’s provisions that deal with scope, aid and the rules for eligibility of expenditure."
"Generally, albeit not entirely or in every single detail, the way the Committee voted reflects the position taken by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and we agree with the Commission and with Mr Fava, the rapporteur, on the substance of the three objectives, these being convergence, regional competitiveness and employment, as well as European territorial cooperation."
"We also endorse the proposal for the proportionate distribution of financial resources."
"The emphasis on the regions most likely to benefit from support, albeit not to the detriment of those affected by the statistical effect, is the logical consequence of Article 160 of the European Communities Treaty."
"There are two points to which I should like to draw particular attention, the first being the continuing need for the option of public-private partnerships to be open, which would mean the cofinancing rate being calculated also by reference to private resources."
"There is in fact no reason why the Commission should not agree to this."
"My second point is that, if we fail to reach agreement in due time, in the context of the Financial Perspective, on the amount of funds to be made available, the regions most deserving of support would, in accordance with the treaty’s requirement for cohesion, have to receive special treatment."
"What that means is that under no circumstances must any cuts be merely linear, for this would definitely be to the detriment of the convergence regions and would run counter to the European cohesion policy guidelines."
"Perhaps, though, the British Presidency will manage to fit structural policy into the Budget in such a way that no cuts would be possible."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by echoing the congratulations for the various rapporteurs, and in particular Mr Andria, for his work on the report on the Cohesion Fund and his willingness to engage in the dialogue that has allowed us to reach a consensus on the majority of that report’s content."
"We in the Socialist Group believe that this instrument is essential to achieving the objectives of social, economic and territorial cohesion."
"The incorporation of actions in the field of sustainable development, transport and the environment make this fund consistent with European cohesion policy."
"There are issues, such as the application of the N+2 rule, that require formulae that can be applied more flexibly, so that its implementation does not create problems, particularly for the new Member States."
"We must emphasise the explicit reference in this report to disabled people, incorporating the importance of these funds contributing to the removal of architectural obstacles."
"The achievements resulting from this instrument have allowed countries such as Spain to reach acceptable levels of development; a sudden and immediate loss would therefore jeopardise that development very significantly."
"I am therefore pleased that the need to seek a political solution for those countries which will be excluded in the future has been recognised."
"With regard to the other regulations, we must take account of the existence of other realities which do not exclusively relate to the least-favoured regions, but also the regions suffering from the statistical effect, the natural effect, the outermost regions and regions with low population densities."
"The reality of Europe is plural, it is diverse, and we must take account of the differing realities."
"A resolute and successful policy in this field must take account of the different realities and not forget that behind them the European citizens are awaiting a response."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mr Hatzidakis, for his excellent levels of cooperation in the debate on the report on the general Regulation."
"We achieved a satisfactory compromise on the committee."
"It takes impartial account of the interests and views of both the new and old Member States."
"I hope that it will also be adopted more or less as it is in tomorrow’s vote."
"When we make reforms to EU policies we have to adhere to sustainable principles."
"The aim of regional policy should be to tackle disparities regarding employment and livelihood, on the one hand, and to control harmful migration both within and between Member States, on the other."
"Mr Hatzidakis’s report follows these principles."
"There have been pressures to violate these principles in the debate on the reform."
"Here in Parliament there have been calls to switch the main focus of aid on the cities, as it is in cities that 80% of the citizens of the Union live."
"There is no good argument for this."
"In a market economy, reserves and the population tend too much to be concentrated mainly in the largest cities."
"In regional policy this development should not be endorsed."
"There are particular problems in the major cities, but they should not be solved using regional policy appropriations or the Union’s budget in general."
"There are good grounds, however, for many small and medium-sized cities to receive regional aid, especially if it is a component of broader-scope regional development programmes."
"Aspects of regional policy should also be taken into account in any reform of the common agricultural policy."
"The present system is absurd, as the largest amounts of aid are paid in those regions where the conditions for production are most favourable."
"It is very important for the implementation of regional policy that the Council should achieve consensus on the financial perspective and legislation on regional policy in the months to come."
"Mr President, I too would like to add my voice of congratulations to our five rapporteurs for their cooperative, constructive approach in the compilation of their reports."
"I cannot help but contrast that with the uncooperative, destructive approach of the United Kingdom Government."
"To be fair, I was pleased to hear Mr Michael’s speech mentioning partnership so often, but like so much with the London Labour Government, warm words will cut no ice with us unless we see some action as well."
"The fact is the UK position right now would see the Highlands and Islands, the West, the East and the South of Scotland lose out on millions upon millions of much needed EU funding that the Commission and this House want us to receive."
"If that is the UK definition of partnership, this House has comprehensively rejected it."
"Therefore, I will be backing all five of the reports with a few amendments to strengthen in particular statistical effect and the partnership principle."
"I urge colleagues to unite strongly around these reports, so that the European version of partnership – rather than the British version – prevails."
"Mr President, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs, and I welcome in particular the report by Mr Olbrycht on the establishment of a European grouping on territorial cooperation."
"I thank the rapporteur not only for his work but also for the way in which he approached it."
"Obstacles in the way of the common delivery of services across borders can often deter public servants and others from undertaking practical cooperation on a cross-border, transnational or interregional basis."
"This in turn leads to duplication, waste and lost opportunities."
"The Commission proposal and the amendments made or coordinated by Mr Olbrycht will benefit my country, which has been divided by a north-south border, but it will also benefit all who wish to work more fully with their European neighbours."
"Mr Olbrycht has moved to deal with concerns about financial control, existing cooperation arrangements and partnerships that include NGOs and local authorities."
"I particularly welcome the recognition that such groupings have a role to play in fostering reconciliation across borders where there has been civil or military conflict."
"I also commend the report on European regional development by Mr Fava and I want to acknowledge Mr Fava´s willingness to listen to Committee colleagues and take on board a number of compromise amendments."
"I am particularly pleased with the report's emphasis on social inclusion and sustainable development."
"We can all support the commitment to remove obstacles to access for people with disabilities and the commitment to non-discrimination and equal opportunities."
"Structural funding has helped reshape the economic infrastructure of Ireland."
"We will be keen in future to see the investment available, in the north and south of Ireland, targeted at the most disadvantaged areas, including rural communities along the border between the north and south of the island, communities that have suffered as a result of partition and conflict."
"In this respect, I also welcome the inclusion by Mr Hatzidakis of compromise amendments dealing with the specific challenges faced by the natural effect regions in Ireland and elsewhere."
"Programmes should have a bottom-up approach, where local communities have a say in the design and implementation of projects, and we welcome amendments that strengthen the contribution to the social economy."
"However, my party and I do not favour the use of public-private partnerships."
"On a broader level, the EU faces a considerable challenge in ensuring that both established and newer Member States receive consistent levels of ERDF funding on the basis of need."
"Like my colleagues, I also hope that the necessary budget for all this can be agreed this year so that the next cycle can start promptly."
"Mr President, cohesion policy has been at the heart of the European project from the outset and it is a policy dependent upon the concept of regions at the expense of nations."
"In many countries, not least the UK, regions are a wholly artificial concept."
"It is only a short step from artificial regions within the nation states to artificial regions straddling them."
"If European groupings of cross-border cooperation make that step they will be entities with a legal personality, with their own statutes, organs and budgetary rules."
"The Commission explicitly states that EGCCs are a means of overcoming the major difficulties in carrying out cooperation due to the many national laws."
"This is a momentous development hidden away as usual behind dry jargon."
"Conservative-controlled Kent County Council will love all this."
"It has already set up an unofficial cross-border region – Transmanche – with Nord-Pas de Calais, but the people of the UK will not even accept attempts to set up regional governments within their own borders."
"I assure you there is no way they will accept regional government from beyond them."
"Mr President, I welcome the excellent report by Mr Casa on the European Fisheries Fund."
"It correctly identifies the key policy objectives and the means to achieve them."
"In Ireland, aquaculture has long been recognised and identified as having a critically important socio-economic contribution to make in our coastal communities."
"I am, therefore, particularly pleased at the important provisions that will allow diversification into aquaculture."
"I am pleased that a number of elements in the Commission’s proposals concerning small-scale coastal fishing, and aquaculture investments in particular, have been amended in committee."
"These amendments will seriously contribute to achieving the overriding objectives of the Fisheries Fund."
"I do not approve, however, of certain mandatory elements in the Commission’s proposal, notably the requirement that socio-economic measures must be included in national plans."
"I believe that the application of the subsidiarity principle would be more appropriate."
"Today, more than ever, there is a vital need for subsidiarity."
"I, therefore, particularly welcome the fact that it would be up to each Member State to set its own priorities and to decide where and how the funds will be spent."
"Finally, we must all ensure that the negative bashing of the common fisheries policy stops and that this fund is presented to the European electorate as something positive; indeed, it must be presented as something the sector can fully and wholeheartedly identify with, something that will allow the development of the sector, something that will contribute to a better future for fisheries, not least for the fishermen and women on the west coast of Ireland whom I represent."
"Article 160 of the Treaty states that the European Regional Development Fund is aimed at helping to correct the largest regional disparities within the Community."
"Proposed Amendment 8 draws particular attention to ensuring that this Fund complements the aid provided by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, which is natural."
"Why do I mention this?"
"The success of our plans to reduce regional disparities in the European Union depends directly on the success of rural development."
"Most regions of Europe are rural regions, and the most backward regions are the most rural of these regions."
"Furthermore, ladies and gentlemen, current studies clearly show that where agribusiness prospers, so does the rural environment and the entire region, and where it falters, so does the rural environment and the entire region."
"This is a rule that applies almost without exception."
"Thus, our current endeavours to reduce regional disparities would be put in question by the efforts at downplaying such common agricultural policy whose aim is to attain sustainable prosperity of agriculture and of rural regions."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us constantly bear in mind that the problems of the European Union’s regional development cannot be successfully resolved without ensuring rural development, and that prosperous rural regions will become a reality only when the farmers prosper."
"We are not rivals, ladies and gentlemen."
"The negotiations on these proposals have come at a time when intense debate is under way about the future of the European Union, about where we are heading and how we are going to move forward."
"We are no longer just talking about the need for enlargement to be a success, but about what means the European Union has at its disposal to meet external challenges, or, as the representative of the Council said, ‘to deal with the challenges of the 21st century’."
"The instruments of regional and cohesion policy must play a key role both in ‘digesting’ enlargement – to adapt Churchill’s expression – and in responding to the challenges."
"There can be no question that the most important evaluation criteria must be efficiency and effectiveness."
"But while laying great emphasis on these criteria, we must not allow a situation to arise where we adopt, or push through Parliament or elsewhere, regulations of a sort that could put Member States at a distinct disadvantage."
"Now, in this phase, it has emerged that a good few proposals included in these reports ruin newly acceded countries’ chances of utilising these funds."
"A good few speakers before me have already mentioned the N+2 rule, the VAT issue, and so on. Moreover, these proposals are included in the reports in a way that changes previous practice, making the conditions less favourable, or ignoring possibilities that relate to improving the competitiveness of a particular region, or to other Lisbon objectives."
"We therefore urge both Council and Commission representatives present here today to please ensure that any proposals they put to us later on, and any proposals they support and develop, provide equal opportunities and equal rights for all Member States as regards access to the Structural and Cohesion Funds."
"A decisive experience for the EU-10 in the transformation processes of the last 15 years has been the disappearance of national borders, the fact that borders have become ethereal, and the recognition and implementation of democratic European values such as subsidiarity, solidarity and regionalism."
"As Robert Schumann once dreamt, national borders no longer divide."
"We are uniting not countries, but regions and citizens."
"Regions would like to have common goals, organised mechanisms for cooperation and, in the spirit of subsidiarity, they would like to be able to decide directly on cooperation and on the necessary funds."
"This will make Europe more democratic, and more economically efficient too."
"We welcome the Commission’s efforts to take the request of the regions and the principle of subsidiarity into account when drafting the legislation, and we greatly appreciate the complicated and multifaceted legal negotiations it has undertaken in an effort to allay the initial fears of national governments."
"My Group understands the caution evinced by the Council and the Member States with regard to the jurisdiction of the new groupings and the reduced role of central government entities, and we are preparing for the next round of negotiations."
"The Europe of the Regions is versatile: it is characterised by a variety of levels and forms of local government."
"For this reason, EGCCs are a reasonable option."
"Why should not we opt for them?"
"Now, at a time when integration, the common European project, appears to have come to a sudden standstill, representation of local and regional interests is particularly important."
"One example of successful cross-border cooperation is the cooperation between Styria and Bavaria in connection with avalanche disasters, to provide an immediate response aimed at disaster prevention."
"This operates by providing a simplified way for the parties adversely affected to approach each other for help, rather than by means of time-consuming administrative procedures."
"Just imagine what would happen without a regional agreement!"
"First they would have to apply to their respective central governments for formal consent, and only once they were in possession of the appropriate resolutions and authorisations could the process of providing assistance begin."
"The mere thought of this is horrifying."
"My Group has drawn Parliament’s attention to the parallel preparatory work undertaken by the European Council to draft the triple protocol to the Madrid Outline Convention on Euroregional Co-operation Groupings – whose very title reveals the shared goal of the two pieces of legislation."
"I think the work of the rapporteur deserves credit and that the compromise proposals are useful, and I recommend that the report be adopted."
"The proposed directive for the establishment of European groupings for cross-border cooperation was conceived as part of the reformed cohesion policy, which will be made available to members if they so wish."
"It still remains in no small measure controversial, which is a result of the fact that, because of its legal nature, it is not in any way whatsoever a tool."
"It represents an instrument of the new generation of European policy, established in light of the constitutional goal of increasing geographical cohesion and based on the substantial experience of those regions that in years gone by developed cross-border cooperation within the framework of Interreg and ran into problems as a result of different national legislation."
"The new groupings introduced by this directive will be by their very nature purposeful."
"Previously competent regions will, with this document, be in a position to implement regional projects of a cross-border nature."
"The advantage will be that such activity will no longer be at the mercy of changes in parliamentary majorities in the Member States, and there will therefore be no need for them to be organised at the lowest level."
"The new directive differs from the previous practice of interregional cooperation in that such cooperation will have to be carried out at a higher level."
"The difference is the legal distribution of duties, which, of course, increases the responsibility of agencies and heightens financial responsibility when dealing with joint resources."
"As far as resources from European Union funds are concerned, the state remains financially responsible and will remain so when these resources are managed by groupings."
"In the case of other resources, the groupings themselves will be responsible."
"The Commission's original proposal had to be supplemented with respect to the competence of the supervisory bodies of any state whose law will be selected."
"There must not be any area not legally regulated in an unambiguous way."
"We believe that the proposed amendments, which we have adjusted with the rapporteur, have filled any such gaps satisfactorily."
"We will see in practice whether our hypotheses were correct."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to thank Mr Casa for this very important report on the European Fisheries Fund, a sector that, unfortunately, has suffered recurrent crises due to excessive pressure on fish stocks and to the problems of organising a sustainable fish management policy which will help keep a human fabric and a dynamic business alive on our coastlines."
"We therefore applaud everything which helps to achieve a more selective use of fishing equipment, a reduction in environmental impact, support for small and micro fishing enterprises and transparency in the policies adopted."
"However, we very much deplore the fact that the Committee on Fisheries again wishes to subsidise the construction and modernisation of new boats, and indeed their export, although these subsidies were cancelled in 2002 because of their incompatibility with the aims of the policy and because of their pernicious effects."
"The Funds should be much more focused on human problems, such as training, technical support, redeployment, the role of women, assistance in the event of socio-economic crises, improved knowledge of environments and ways of preserving and restoring them, etc. These are the things which are vital for the future of fisheries and we hope that the Council will not give in to the temptation to satisfy certain national lobbies to the detriment of the wider interest."
"– Mr President, allow me to start by thanking all five rapporteurs, especially my honourable friend Mr Hatzidakis, on the effort which he made in drafting this report."
"However, we must not forget that, when we talk of European regional policy, we are talking about the development of a programme designed to promote social and economic cohesion and allow the Union to undertake actions to reduce regional inequalities, promote real cohesion and invigorate employment, while also serving to redistribute and counterbalance the cost of the internal market as regards the less developed regions."
"This report, which deals with most aspects of the Union's regional policy, does not, in my opinion, give enough weight to the less developed regions."
"Nor must we forget that the new Member States which are suffering from serious geographical inequalities, such as Cyprus and Malta, need more help within the framework of European regional policy."
"In order for this need to become reality, we must take account of the imperatives for a sustainable cohesion policy for the whole of the European Union, which will take the form of actions, not statistics contested on numerous counts."
"Mr President, in our market-led economy, large, often international, companies set the tone."
"Key words include specialisation and scaling up."
"Companies choose their locations on the basis of natural regional benefits, and it follows that not every activity in each region can be carried out profitably."
"The circumstances often outweigh any financial incentives offered by governments."
"I am therefore not labouring under the illusion that the European structural policy will be able to perform miracles."
"It is too unrealistic, too inflexible and too limited in scope for that."
"That does not mean, though, that European structural policy could not in certain circumstances contribute to a temporary reduction in regional and local economic bottlenecks, for practical experience demonstrates that it can."
"The reports by our fellow Members are therefore worthy of at least some support, with particular attention for a few bottlenecks."
"I am particularly thinking in terms of the continued option of including private funds in the calculation of cofinancing, regional and local partners having the necessary influence in drafting and executing plans, and spending available resources within the periods prescribed for this purpose in an effective and efficient manner."
"A possible reduction in the Council’s total budget will need to be borne by all regions."
"In future, we will need to focus on the knowledge element, instead of the production element."
"That is where our strength lies, as is also borne out in practice."
"We should therefore leave room at each level to exploit that strength and to use the powerful regions to improve the plight of the weaker ones."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteurs for the fine work carried out."
"Article 160 of the Treaty establishing the European Community stipulates that the European Regional Development Fund contributes to correcting the main regional imbalances existing within the Community, by participating in the development and the structural improvement of regions lagging behind in development, as well as in the restructuring of industrial regions in decline."
"Regional policy therefore represents a chance and an opportunity that we must not waste and that must be managed in the best way possible."
"I refer in particular to the southern regions of Italy, which come under the former Objective 1, now termed the ‘Convergence’ objective, which still have enormous problems and lag seriously behind in many sectors."
"Regional policy can genuinely be very useful for those regions, even if a number of mistakes from the past need to be corrected."
"At times we did not utilise all of the resources at our disposal and at other times we utilised them in the least appropriate manner."
"Mr Fava’s report, with which I agree, seeks to adjust this perspective, by focusing on knowledge, research and development, therefore ..."
"Mr President, my primary observation has to be that the proposed structural and cohesion funding package for 2007-2013 fails to provide adequately for those regions within the EU-15 which, though themselves deficient in infrastructure investment, failed because of the national criteria to qualify for cohesion funds."
"Northern Ireland which I represent is such a region."
"Our water and sewage and roads infrastructure need huge investment."
"We have not seen a mile of motorway built for maybe 30 years."
"Our water system requires expenditure to the tune of hundreds of millions."
"Yet we did not qualify for environment and road infrastructure assistance under the Cohesion Fund because of the national criteria."
"Our nearest neighbour, the Republic of Ireland, did so qualify and in the 10 years from 1993 benefited from over EUR 2 billion of expenditure on such projects."
"These proposals with their almost total focus on the new Member States do not recognise the glaring needs of regions such as mine. I therefore call for a reconsideration of the real needs of regions that still exist within the EU-15 that are now in danger of being totally bypassed."
"I would like to say a word about the European Fisheries Fund."
"It seems to me to be designed largely with a view to managing further decline."
"Its prohibition on funding new vessels will do nothing to tackle the dangers and the problems of an ageing fleet."
"The fund rather should provide for the specific needs of the fisheries sector in each Member State and, if it did, the modernisation and funding of new vessels would be top of the agenda in many areas."
"The European Social Fund is without doubt an important element in the promotion of the European social and employment policy."
"In the same way, it contributes significantly to meeting the aims of the Lisbon Strategy, such as job creation, support for education and vocational training, the promotion of cohesion and social inclusion, and not least, eliminating gender inequalities."
"I would like here to express my thanks to our colleague Silva Peneda for his work in preparing this report."
"I wholeheartedly hope these efforts will allow this regulation to eliminate the significant inequalities that exist between the 25 EU Member States in the fields of unemployment, social security, vocational training and education as much as possible."
"The European Social Fund is an important instrument in the promotion of social integration and for making employment accessible to various disadvantaged groups, such as people with disabilities."
"I am extremely pleased that in this Parliament we have been able to incorporate the protection of such people into the text of the regulation as a priority."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like here to draw your attention to the proposed amendment, which I and Jan Březina, with the support of my colleagues from Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary, put forward at Wednesday’s plenary session."
"This is Draft Amendment 98, in which we are jointly proposing that the grounds for the regulation be extended by adding the text, I quote ‘that one of the priorities of the European Social Fund be to make up for the negative effects of the exclusion of workers from the new Member States from the EU labour market’."
"In our view, this clause is of great political importance regarding the decision to impose a transitional period for granting workers from the new Member States access to the labour market of the European Union."
"Today we know that this decision, which was taken before our accession to the EU, has proved unfounded."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Jöns, the shadow rapporteur on the Silva Peneda Report for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, is unfortunately, for personal reasons, unable to be here today, and so I shall be presenting the essence of her comments on behalf of our group."
"In the first place, we are grateful to Mr Silva Peneda for his good cooperation."
"He has indeed managed to pull all the threads together and to summarise the most important objectives for everyone."
"The report adds much of importance to the Commission proposal, and we hope that it will receive widespread support tomorrow."
"We will be tabling only one amendment, and it is one that we believe to be a necessary addition."
"There are four points I wish to make, and I shall do so briefly, as is only right and proper."
"Firstly, we are glad to see that the report calls on the Member States to do more to implement innovative measures across national borders."
"This ensures added value for Europe and disseminates the best practice that we have learned from labour market policy."
"Secondly, we regard it as of the utmost significance that more attention is given to nation action programmes to address social exclusion."
"People out of work for long periods of time and those who have not completed their schooling need special help, and these are in a position to provide it."
"Thirdly, we welcome the obligation imposed upon the Member States to target action more specifically at women, and the requirement that they ensure that gender budgeting is implemented."
"Some Member States, such as Germany, Belgium and Austria, are already distinguishing themselves by allocating more than 10% of their ESF funds to women’s employment."
"To sum up, we are convinced that ESF measures must continue to benefit asylum seekers, who, in many cases, have been with us for many months, waiting for a decision on their applications for asylum, and so they need our support."
"Irrespective of whether they are eventually granted asylum or return home, we must offer them something."
"Mr President, thanks are due to all the rapporteurs for the open and inclusive manner in which they have handled the dossiers and for the extent of the consensus they have built."
"My own thanks are particularly due to Mr Hatzidakis for supporting the ALDE amendments to his own report."
"I speak specifically, however, of the Casa report; here we wish to introduce references to an ecosystem-based approach to management, to Regional Advisory Councils and to improved disclosure on financial control structures."
"I ask colleagues to vote in favour of them."
"On a personal note, whilst I believe that there is much to commend already in the report, there are certain aspects that, like the Commissioner, I cannot support."
"Resources allocated to the fund are limited; there are many needs to be met."
"The inclusion of safety improvements and of improvements to quality conditions on board vessels, and the inclusion of measures to make vessels more environmentally friendly may be acceptable, particularly for the small-scale coastal sector."
"However, I am strongly opposed, both in principle and as regards the practical effects, to using European taxpayers’ money for wider fleet renewal."
"This is simply an attempt to turn the clock back."
"More generally – and I turn to the President-in-Office – I would like to echo colleagues from across the political groups and urge the Council to take very seriously Parliament’s recommendations on the financial perspectives and on structural funding as found in the Berger and Hatzidakis reports."
"Otherwise, I fear serious adverse effects for both economic regeneration and social inclusion."
"I also believe very strongly that EU funding should be available to areas in need wherever in the Union they happen to be located."
"In this light, I wish the UK well in its Presidency, hoping that it will include a speedy on the financial perspectives."
"When its Prime Minister spoke recently to this House, he referred to a ‘union of values, of solidarity between nations and people’."
"May this understanding above all inform the debate."
"Mr President, the purpose of the European Fisheries Fund should be to implement the common fisheries policy, according to Mr Borg."
"In Scotland, though, a more accurate description of the need would be to compensate for the disastrous effects of the common fisheries policy on our communities and it is a worry that the total fund projected is about the same for 25 as we have had for 15 Member States."
"I support most of the amendments from the Committee on Fisheries of this Parliament, with the exception of vessel construction."
"In particular I support changing the presumption from fleet reduction to adaptation, so that account can be taken of individual circumstances in areas."
"I support highlighting the importance of aquaculture, priority for small-scale inshore fisheries and the compensation proposed for enforced tie-up."
"I welcome the fact that the Commission considers fisheries important enough for its Fisheries Commissioner to be here for this debate."
"It is a pity that the Presidency did not do likewise, but then that is all too typical of UK governments and how they see fisheries, particularly in Scotland."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a sword of Damocles hangs over this debate, in the shape of the financial perspectives of the Union, which have a decisive influence on the definition of the EU cohesion policies."
"The cohesion policy is the best instrument for reviving the role of political Europe, whose crisis is often caused by neo-liberal choices and the militarisation of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"The rapporteurs have carried out some excellent work in drawing up fresh methods of achieving the objectives of the new cohesion policy."
"I should like to thank in particular Mr Fava and Mr Andria for the work they carried out."
"In order to be able to plan the future, however, an assessment also needs to be carried out of the impact that the Structural Funds have had on businesses and the economy in the weak areas of Europe."
"Often, in fact, the Structural Funds did not help to improve the quality of life of citizens in underdeveloped areas, but rather were a matter for the mafia, were handed out according to a system of patronage or were utilised in order to cover holes in budgeting, and at times they were not even spent."
"Whilst a debate on the amount of funding is necessary, thought must also be given to the quality of spending."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs."
"A lot has been said about cohesion and the balanced development of Europe."
"If such development is to become reality, however, appropriate decisions must be taken regarding the Cohesion Fund, the Structural Funds, the Social Fund and cross-border cooperation."
"I should like to take this opportunity to call for the adoption of more flexible solutions, especially with regard to the n+2 rule for the Cohesion Fund, to non-recoverable VAT, to social housing and to the multi-fund approach."
"Amendments to this effect would benefit not only the new Member States, but also the old Member States."
"Numerous examples can be found to show that companies from the 15 old Member States win tenders to invest in the new Member States."
"The new Member States also have a full understanding of such problems as the statistical effect and conditions on islands."
"I would add that this far-reaching divide into old and new Member States is damaging for the EU."
"Mathematical game theory recognises that games exist in which the gain of one party does not result in the loss of the other."
"We should take part in just such a game, as this would benefit Europe."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by defending the excellent work and the difficult consensus achieved by the rapporteur, Mr Casa, in the European Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries."
"Secondly, I would also call on the critics of the fisheries restructuring policy to leave behind the hackneyed argument that a fishing vessel or an aquacultural plant are synonymous with environmental disaster and rather to give them their support."
"I can assure you that, with the budget reserved for us by the European Fisheries Fund — 4 900 million for six years and 27 countries, which represents an increase of just 1 500 million on the current fund for 15 countries — we can do little damage to the environment or the Community’s budget."
"I believe that the report has sensibly introduced more measures than were contained in the Commission's proposal, with a view to providing greater flexibility and thereby enabling the Member States to respond better to their various sectors."
"We have extended the cases eligible for renovation and modernisation of the fleet, because it is difficult to understand why we are condemning certain professions to work with obsolete and dangerous means of production, in particular the small-scale fleet, which is the most outdated."
"To express our regret at accidents and to pay tribute to the victims is of little use."
"But now we have the opportunity to help to prevent them since, furthermore, we now have a whole range of methods of teledetection and satellite monitoring, in order to prevent too much from being fished or the wrong things being fished."
"Mr President, allow me to say a final word about mixed companies."
"I believe them to be the guarantee of an effective development aid and cooperation policy and, in accordance with the Commission’s support for them within the new policy on association agreements, I would like to defend them."
"However, Commissioner, I do not believe that it is possible for mixed companies to be created in developing third countries without the corresponding Community assistance, since these countries do not have the same legal guarantees for investments."
"So if we really want mixed companies to be a cornerstone of development cooperation, Commissioner, let us give them assistance from the EFF."
"Mr President, I thank the rapporteurs."
"Regional development is one of the cornerstones of the European Union."
"I welcome Parliament’s position on regional policy per se, but I also believe that we must have sustainable development."
"I welcome the review of the common fisheries policy as giving a sustainable framework for fisheries."
"I deeply regret that the report on the European Fisheries Fund has been transformed into a vehicle to reopen decisions taken during the CFP review."
"The review clearly ended subsidies for boat building and put into place limitations on modernisation."
"It is disingenuous to say that engine replacement and other forms of modernisation do not increase fishing capacity."
"I welcome the focus on sustainability within the Commission’s EFF proposals."
"I also noted that, in his working document on the CFP, Mr Böge commented that the overcapacity of the Community fleet still is, despite the efforts made in the framework of the previous structural programmes, one of the main reasons for the over-exploitation of certain stocks."
"Sustainability is the key to future prosperity and development in the fisheries sector."
"I do not buy the argument that old small boats are unsafe and need replacing by public money."
"It may be undeniable that they need replacing."
"However, my previous old small car was unsafe and needed replacing, but I had to pay for the replacement myself."
"All right, I was not running a car-based business but, if I had been, I would not have expected the government to step in and give me the money."
"Fleet renewal needs to take place, but I want that to happen on a sustainable basis."
"We should not subsidise too many fishermen to chase too few fish."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on this occasion I speak as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe on the regulation on the ERDF."
"I should like to first congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Fava, for the excellent work carried out."
"I consider the reference made by the rapporteur to the issue of public security as the guarantee against organised crime infiltrating the expenditure processes linked to the Structural Funds to be positive."
"Significant consensus has been reached on a number of points among many of us, of different extractions and origins in terms of both geography and politics, on the significant issue of social inclusion."
"During the debate in committee, extremely effective compromises and points of synthesis were found upon reading the amendments."
"I welcome the fact that the rapporteur chose to pay the utmost attention to the requests put forward by my group, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"In particular, we obtained more attention for the urban dimension."
"Emphasis has been placed on the driving force that a good programme of investment and management of funds directly apportioned to the cities can have for the economic and sociocultural revival of the suburbs and surrounding rural areas, as the Commissioner here present also stated today."
"That will act as a real engine for the sustainable and long-lasting development of the regions."
"Finally, with regard to the issue of disabilities, I have requested that the aims of the ERDF should include a specific commitment to promote measures aimed at removing the architectural barriers in projects financed by the Fund, so as to ensure equal opportunities for accessing the Fund."
"With regard to the other issues, particularly the issue of VAT, I believe that they have already been thoroughly discussed previously."
"– Mr President, last year we said 'yes' to the new countries and 'yes' to their financing, but not for this financing to be at the expense of the financing of disadvantaged areas in the old countries."
"Greece has three thousand islands which we all want to visit in July and August, but no one asks how they live the rest of the year, often with no oil, no doctors and no public transport."
"We must therefore see that this 0.41% of the budget is not enough; it is less than inadequate for us to cover the outermost regions fairly."
"We were told that Greece would get EUR 24 billion."
"That is what the former Prime Minister, Mr Simitis, said."
"Now the new Prime Minister, Mr Karamanlis, comes along and says that we shall get just over half of the fourth package."
"These are ridiculous arrangements."
"Countries cannot progress in this way."
"The European Union cannot progress in this way."
"The Member States must be encouraged to take up resources."
"In 2003, we got EUR 2.6 billion, according to Mrs Hübner, and last year we got 1.4 billion."
"This year, not a single euro has been entered and seven months have already passed."
"This is money which is missing from the market, missing from farmers, missing from production and missing from productivity."
"We must at last stop seeing people as numbers because, if we carry on like this, with Mr Blair's policy, you should know that, at your next meal, you will not be served tomatoes, you will be served microchips and, instead of getting fruit and vegetables, you will be getting CD-ROMs and floppy disks."
"People live here, not robocops!"
". Mr President, thank you for allowing me to speak at this point."
"Colleagues will report on future contributions, but I am grateful to you for understanding the difficulties involved in being here for the changed time of the debate."
"We have heard some excellent contributions."
"I particularly welcomed Mr Galeote Quecedo’s stress on the importance of cohesion to the future of the European Union."
"I also agree how welcome an early decision on the budget would be."
"That requires a serious focus by all of us on achieving an outcome."
"We will certainly undertake to play our part in trying to bring about such agreement."
"I also note the emphasis he placed on such issues as VAT and housing."
"I say to Members that we will now reflect on the points raised today and examine carefully the reports and the amendments that are adopted tomorrow."
"The Presidency will then maintain close contact with Parliament as we move towards a common position, in order to discuss how best to accommodate your concerns."
"Some of those concerns were very varied."
"Mrs Krehl referred to the success of the cohesion funds in the UK."
"I agree, and that is one of the reasons that we agree with the point that Mr Beaupuy made when he called for a focus on the ten new Member States."
"Mrs Griesbeck called for agreement but reserved the right to say ‘’."
"I say to her and others that we should all focus on getting the right answer for the 21st century for Europe."
"But, again, today the focus is on the regulations."
"As I said in my opening remarks, there are differences of opinion on the package of regulations, but it is clear from the debate that there is a strong consensus between the Council and Parliament on many aspects of reform."
"We are all determined to develop a dynamic and efficient EU regional policy that contributes fully to the Union’s key objectives and helps ensure that enlargement is a success – all except Mr Smith, who read a press release into the record, and perhaps Mr Booth, who seems to have missed the enormous benefits of regional development in England."
"But turning now to the mainstream of the debate, Parliament has raised a range of questions and issues regarding the size of future structural funds budget, as well as its distribution between the Member States and their regions."
"A number of Members, especially Mr Hatzidakis and Mr Andria, have defended the broad architecture of the Commission’s proposals, which would focus an expanded structural funds budget on three objectives – convergence, competitiveness and cooperation – and have opposed any modification of the distribution of funds between these three priorities."
"Mrs Schroedter emphasised the role of the EU regional policy in ensuring EU solidarity."
"I agree – although there is evidently a range of views – on how to introduce genuine solidarity in practice."
"For example, Mr Triantaphyllides argued for a greater focus on the poorer Member States, while Mr Allister suggested that the Commission’s proposals would allocate too much to the new Members."
"The Council is also pursuing a debate on the best way to focus and deliver the funds in the next financial perspective so that they make the most efficient contribution to the EU’s regional development; asking a range of questions regarding the Commission’s proposals for the allocation of the funds, for the distribution between the three objectives, on the emphasis placed on convergence funding for richer regions, primarily in the richer Member States and the proposed 50-50 split of funding between the old and new Member States."
"Others have questioned aspects of the technical rules for delivering programmes, such as the application of the n+2 rule to the Cohesion Fund, where there was a welcome reference to flexibility on the way that applied, and the treatment of VAT and other expenditure."
"These are complex issues and how we resolve them will have a major impact on the effectiveness of future structural fund spending."
"I noted that most parties in Parliament and the Council are broadly supportive of the Commission’s proposals to strengthen the strategic focus of structural fund spending on the Lisbon and Göteborg agendas."
"We all want a rigorous evaluation and more flexible and efficient mechanisms for delivering projects and we are all eager to maintain robust rules for monitoring expenditure so that structural fund spending is rigorously accounted for."
"We can agree with Mr Silva Peneda and Mrs Krehl on the need to simplify procedures for delivering structural fund programmes."
"While we welcome many of the Commission’s useful initiatives in this area, the Council can certainly agree with Mr Silva Peneda that there is scope for even greater simplification of some of the proposals in the draft regulation."
"We can also agree with Mr Harangozó and others on the need to maximise private sector involvement in the programmes."
"As for the priorities for structural fund support, again the Council and Parliament have much in common."
"On the ERDF, we all agree on the need to maintain an appropriate level of concentration on a limited number of priorities and, as Mr Fava has argued, to strengthen the focus on activities, such as innovation, research and development in support for Lisbon targets."
"On the ESF, we can agree with Mr Silva Peneda on the need for a clear focus on the European Employment Strategy."
"The outstanding issues are now clear."
"Both the Council and Parliament are eager to maintain a strong principle of partnership so that national, regional and local stakeholders continue to participate actively in the delivery of programmes."
"However, there are differences that we need to resolve on working with partners."
"Similarly, there is widespread support for measures to improve the effectiveness of structural funds."
"But we have differing views on some aspects of the Commission’s proposals."
"For example, the Council has been unable to offer support for the Commission’s proposals to establish obligatory performance and contingency reserves, because we fear that the administrative difficulties and bureaucratic cost would outweigh any concrete benefits they might achieve."
"These are not insurmountable difficulties, but we need to work closely together to resolve these differences over the coming months."
"We will take Parliament’s views into account as we prepare new compromise texts to be discussed in the Council working group."
"My colleague Alan Johnson will be visiting the Committee on Regional Development on 12 September, and will be happy to discuss these issues further with Members then."
"We will keep in close contact with the rapporteurs to discuss matters with them as the Council’s position develops."
"From today’s debate I have a very much clearer understanding of Parliament’s views on these very important dossiers."
"Time is tight and our two institutions will need to cooperate closely."
"For my part, I can assure you that the Council will work constructively and effectively with you to find a way forward."
"I look forward to our cooperation over the coming months to establish the common ground on which we can build a cohesion policy fit for a new Europe in the 21st century."
"Mr President, taken as a whole, the draft regulations for the structural funds achieve their intended purposes, but, in my opinion, several issues are not resolved accordingly to the tasks that have been set out."
"I shall note three of them."
"I unequivocally support improvement of the financial management of the European Union funds, as well as stronger discipline in project preparation and implementation; however, the application of the n+2 principle to the Cohesion Fund can lead to the directly opposite – hurried project preparation and implementation and an ineffective and wasteful use of European Union taxpayers’ money."
"It would also significantly reduce the capacity of the new Member States to absorb the grants of the Cohesion Fund."
"As a minimum requirement, I propose considering the n+3 principle."
"Secondly, I consider that we must seriously evaluate and rework the extension to seven years of the period for aid programmes and conditions contained in the draft regulations, as well as the requirement for relocated businesses to repay the grant of the Structural Fund, which is in blatant contradiction to the single market principles, constitutes an infringement of competition and fundamental freedoms of the European Union."
"Thirdly, we must preserve the possibility of financing projects from the private cofinancing of European Union funds, without involving national public funding."
"Therefore I propose that we provide a possibility of including private cofinancing in general attributable costs."
"In that way it would be possible to carry out projects for a greater total amount and make the use of national public funding more effective."
"Mr President, Commissioner Hübner, ladies and gentlemen, it is at moments of political uncertainty, like the one that we are experiencing, that the European institutions, in order to be credible, have to demonstrate strength and provide definite answers to the demands of the citizens."
"Parliament, as a consequence, must have the ability to transform political ideas into decisive measures."
"The reports we are examining today represent an effective answer to the very many issues relating to the cohesion policy and to regional development that emerged in the wake of enlargement."
"Statistical criteria alone are not enough to demonstrate the real economic situation of the various European regions lagging behind in development and they are insufficient for providing tangible answers in terms of solidarity to those regions that have still to overcome the hardships due to structural difficulties or to objective situations such as insularity or peripherality."
"I should like to stress that the cohesion policy must not be merely an opportunity for stating its decisive importance for achieving European integration and for the genuine involvement of all citizens."
"In order to be effective, constructive, and above all credible, it will have to be supported by sufficient financial resources."
"The 0.46% reserved for the cohesion policy under the proposal for a regulation is a modest figure, in view of the large increase in the population eligible for inclusion under the ‘Convergence’ objective following an unprecedented enlargement."
"With regard to our group, we agree with the proposals contained in the reports, which, inter alia, are the product of in-depth discussions and mediations."
"On this subject, I should like to take the opportunity to congratulate the rapporteurs and the supporters."
"I should just like to focus on a few items relating in particular to the European Fisheries Fund, in which fishing boat engines are not included among the processes of modernisation."
"Renovating the fleet does not necessarily mean increasing the fishing effort."
"To conclude, I reaffirm the need to overcome the limits of the obsolete model, which focuses primarily on the land, seeking to obtain full acknowledgement of the special nature of maritime cross-border problems."
"Mr President, Commissioners, it seems to me that, logically enough, the proposal by Parliament that is beginning to take shape is more or less in line with the long-term draft budget we presented earlier."
"I shall concentrate on the European Social Fund."
"The Social Fund has two overarching tasks which have become more and more important: to bolster the employment strategy and to promote social integration and combat discrimination."
"These are two challenges faced by the EU in the new and globalised society with its demographic changes."
"That is why these objectives are more important than ever."
"Lifelong learning is very important to increasing the level of employment."
"Europe will not be able to compete with India and China, with their social models and with their pay and conditions in the labour market."
"Instead, we must compete, for example, through research and development and through the skills possessed by the EU’s labour force."
"This is something for which the Member States, businesses and the two sides of industry must accept responsibility, but the EU can make a valuable contribution by increasing skills throughout our area."
"We have a host of disadvantaged groups which need to participate more not only in the development of society but also in the labour market."
"In order to cope with the competition from outside, we need everyone – women especially – to participate in the labour market in the future."
"Women are still under-represented and discriminated against in the labour market."
"The same is true of people with disabilities who, like people from countries outside Europe, are at present excluded from the labour market to an incredibly high degree."
"Allow me to draw attention to a number of important points."
"It is good that the transnational dimension is increasing."
"We are retaining the innovative dimension that has existed in, for example, Equal."
"It is important for the Social Fund to be able to operate to some extent in conjunction with other funds at local and regional levels."
"In conclusion, I agree with Mr Špidla who said how important it was, in the future too, for partnership and the two sides of industry to play a prominent role in the work of the Social Fund."
"Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to call most emphatically for a degree of consistency."
"When we voted on the Böge report a few weeks ago, we made it a rule that we would not extend the n+2 rule to the Cohesion Fund."
"We made it a rule that enterprises that had benefited from the Structural Funds would have to remain in the same place for five years."
"We are now planning to change that."
"A couple of weeks ago we had one opinion, and now we intend to change our minds."
"I would appeal for a degree of consistency."
"In the Böge report we decided that if the n+2 rule were extended to the Cohesion Fund, it would become impossible in many instances, especially in the case of the new Member States, to benefit from this Fund when implementing large projects."
"Similarly, it would appear that while we are giving money to businesses with one hand, we are taking it away with the other, since we are now introducing the rule that VAT will not be an eligible expense, after so many poor countries and regions have joined the European Union."
"Polish children say that, ‘who gives and takes away winds up in hell’, and I would appeal for us not to give with one hand and take away with the other."
"As far as VAT is concerned, and presuming that the amendments are not adopted tomorrow, I would call on the Commissioner and the Council to give serious though to a zero rate for VAT on investments made under European funds."
"A zero rate of VAT would make it possible for those who do not want EU funds to return to the budgets of the individual countries to find common ground with those who cannot afford to double their contributions as a result of the changes currently being proposed."
"I would urge the House to take these concerns seriously, and they are indeed serious concerns, particularly in the case of the new Member States."
"I would urge Members to ensure that enlargement does not become an illusion."
"– Mr President, I should like to start by expressing my warm congratulations to the five rapporteurs."
"I should like especially to express my warm congratulations on the excellent job done by Mr Hatzidakis and Mr Casa."
"I shall comment on the report by Mr Casa and defend my amendments."
"The Casa report tries to attach a great deal of importance to balance and respect for the environment and to the proper management of fish stocks."
"I would add that we need to look at how we are also going to protect European fishermen."
"I therefore have three proposals: firstly, to allow fishing equipment which respects the environment; secondly, for there to be the facility to acquire equipment to improve fishermen's health and safety conditions and, thirdly, for there to be the facility to change engines on fishing vessels up to the same horsepower."
"We cannot send our fishermen out to fish for us with engines which are 20 or 25 years old."
"The second part concerns aquaculture; this must be protected, it must be enlarged and it must produce more fish."
"Why?"
"Because the global demand for fish has increased."
"Either we overfish, which means disrupting the ecosystem, or we provide the facility for more fish to be produced by aquaculture."
"That is why the European Union needs to support this sector as much as it can."
"What is of crucial importance is that these enterprises protect the environment, they are environmentally-friendly."
"That is what must take top priority."
"It does not matter if they are small, medium-sized or large enterprises."
"I hope that the small enterprises will become big and the big enterprises bigger, so that they can produce more fish, which our planet needs, instead of our overfishing."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to highlight a number of what I regard as key points before tomorrow’s vote on the regulations and the Structural Funds."
"We are opposed to the full application of the n+2 rule to the Cohesion Fund, as in our opinion this could result in the new Member States losing out on substantial amounts of cohesion funding."
"We should also endeavour to find some way of ensuring that VAT falls under the category of eligible expenditure."
"This will be particularly important in the case of the European Regional Development Fund in the event that future recipients of funding include towns and villages."
"Our demands to this effect met with incomprehension on the part of the rapporteur, the coordinator and a number of other Members, and I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed at the outcome of our endeavours."
"I believe in the common sense of the majority, however, and I therefore hope that the amendments we have tabled will be adopted tomorrow."
"Mr President, it is through our support for Europe’s most disadvantaged regions, particularly those in Eastern Europe, that our solidarity is given expression."
"I would like to emphasise something about which previous speakers have not pin-pointed, namely that European structural policy also kick-starts innovation in those regions that are not typical candidates for support."
"What I would like to stress is the importance of Objective II, employment and competitiveness, whereby Europe helps to give infrastructures and innovation and international dimension."
"Both in Europe’s traditional centres of economic activity and elsewhere, the result of such impetus will be growth, from which, at the end of the day, we will all benefit."
"Structural grants do not just support growth and European pilot projects;"
"I would emphasise that promoting the competitiveness of regions helps to get the European ideal accepted in Western Europe."
"While this is particularly true of grants from the Social Fund, it also applies in the case of Objective II, territorial cooperation."
"Whether as a consequence of cross-border social institutions, enterprise zones or chambers of commerce, cross-border association is the way by which the European ideal is lived."
"It is because it is important that this form of European support be maintained that we endorse the principles underlying the Commission proposal."
"We have to give very serious thought to how, even with less money at our disposal, we can retain the structural policy’s political substance."
"We will have to rearrange the way in which structural and agricultural policies are funded, and what that means is that agricultural cofinancing must be required at national level, along with rules that make public-private partnerships simpler."
"We will, in future, also have to think about funding structural programmes by taking out loans."
"If there have to be cuts, they will have to be made across the board, in all fields of action, and not to the detriment of individual regions or programmes."
"The bottom line is that European structural support works."
"We should fight for its political substance. We appeal to the Heads of State or Government to do their part for the benefit of Europe’s regions."
"I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the coordinators for their work; it has not been easy, given the current situation, but they are succeeding and they deserve all of our support."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for her efforts to understand Parliament's position; we hope that she will make every effort to facilitate an agreement which is as urgent as it is necessary."
"We would call on the new Presidency, whom we welcome on the other side of the fence, to demonstrate, through concrete actions, their European passion, which we would like to believe is sincere."
"However, as those who have been governing for some time are well aware, nothing exists unless it is in the budgets."
"So the first requirement if Europe is to be credible, as Mr Blair wishes, is a sufficient budget produced on time."
"We also hope that both the Commission and the Presidency will provide compensation, which is acceptable both in terms of its fairness and of its gradual nature, for the regions and Member States likely to suffer significant financial losses as a result of the new allocation of resources for the enlarged Europe, as well as preferential treatment for regions affected by the statistical effect, regions affected by the natural effect — the outermost regions — and areas with special structural difficulties: mountain regions, border regions ..., regions suffering depopulation or low population density and regions with accessibility problems, such as my region, Aragón."
"Furthermore, we want the new objective of competitiveness, which must relaunch the Lisbon Strategy and redouble efforts on R+D, to serve also to reduce the technological gap between regions and Member States."
"Anybody who thinks that Europe can make progress on the basis of a few top people while the majority remains digitally illiterate is guilty, ladies and gentlemen, of complete naivete or a lack of intellectual honesty."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, cohesion policy is one of the pillars of European integration."
"It will become even more important during the next programming period, since it will act as a tool both for reducing economic differences between regions and for making Europe more competitive on the global market."
"Although I very much appreciate the work done by all those involved in formulating Parliament’s position on the drafts, I am disappointed at the lack of interest that has been shown to date in most of the new Member States’ demands and needs."
"The debates that have lasted for many months within the Committee on Regional Development have left me with the impression that the suggestions made by Members from the new Member States have not been given due consideration."
"By way of contrast, a great deal of attention has been paid to the needs of other players, such as the former cohesion countries, and to remote regions and regions affected by the statistical effect."
"Their demands were not only listened to, but also given due attention."
"I find the attitude of Members from the former cohesion countries particularly irksome in this connection, since they have so far snubbed our proposals to keep the current rules in place, even though they themselves benefited from these rules in the past."
"I am thinking in particular of the n+3 rule for the Cohesion Fund and of the rule classing VAT as eligible expenditure for non-taxpayers."
"I regret to have to say that the majority of concessions made to the new Member States related either to the report on the current Structural Funds Regulation or to the report on the Cohesion Fund."
"Parliament is not entitled to make direct changes to the Commission’s proposals in either of these cases."
"The same demands were flatly refused in the case of the proposal on the European Regional Development Fund, however, to which we are entitled to make changes."
"To put it another way, concessions have only been made to the new Member States in instances where they are of very limited significance."
"As I see it, a decision to remove VAT entirely from the list of eligible expenses would be a major political blunder, not to mention insensitive treatment of the new Member States."
"It could prompt tens of millions of citizens in these countries to ask whether they are really being treated equally, given that they are being denied the benefits of advantageous rules that the old Member States enjoyed for many years."
"I should therefore like to call upon the goodwill and understanding of this House, and I would ask Members to vote in favour of keeping these rules in place during the 2007-2013 period."
"– Mr President, I too should like to start by congratulating the rapporteurs, especially Mr Hatzidakis, on the very good job they have done throughout the procedure."
"It is an undisputed fact that cohesion policy is the lever for the development of the European Union."
"Cohesion policy has contributed to development and to the creation of jobs, with positive results for the convergence of regions and the Member States of the European Union."
"The tools of cohesion, the Structural Funds, bring Europe close to the citizens, contribute towards development and demonstrate in practice the principle of solidarity."
"Today, cohesion policy is being called on to face important challenges and extended inequalities within the Europe of the 25: we need urban development, but we also need rural development."
"Today, cohesion policy is being called on to help achieve the objectives of the Lisbon and Gothenburg Strategy."
"We cannot have any choice but to guarantee the Structural Funds the minimum resources needed to allow them to operate effectively, by which I mean 0.41% or a minimum of EUR 336 billion."
"Consequently, what is needed is for there to be no further delay, so that structural policies and the corresponding regulations are brought to a close as quickly as possible during 2005."
"After expressing the obligatory, though heartfelt, congratulations due to our rapporteurs, I would like to focus very specifically on an issue that many speakers have already touched on: the issue of refunding VAT payments."
"In my home country, I represent a region that is perhaps the poorest."
"I know there is a certain logic in not supporting expenditures from community funds that are really revenues belonging to the treasuries of Member States."
"I would, nevertheless, like to present the other side of the coin."
"Local authorities in my region that are planning on taking part in the development measures through the Union’s structural policy, will be deprived of the opportunity to apply – because of their very poverty – if this burden falls on them too."
"Please consider very carefully how you decide regarding these proposed amendments."
"Let the rule stay as it is!"
"I would like to raise another point: Union regulations are constantly changing, and we, the representatives of the new Member States, feel that these changes are increasingly to our disadvantage."
"This process must be halted, because in the event of things carrying on as they are, enlargement will not be a success, but a massive fillip for Euroscepticism and the political extremes."
"Fellow Members, please act responsibly and consistently."
"If something has worked until now, let it stay, and do not try to push the very poorest regions to the periphery!"
"– The two recent no votes on the EU Constitution are a warning from the citizens that Europe must provide a different social model, one that differs markedly from that of a United States of Europe."
"The citizens of Europe have spoken clearly, and what they want is more citizenship, more social concerns and, especially, more European social model."
"The purpose of the European Social Fund, one of Europe’s founding principles, has always, in tandem with cohesion policy, been to help people, and has consequently been the policy that people have identified with most. It is my view that the Social Fund, along with other funds, must not be allowed to encourage a two-speed Europe."
"Its aim is not to exacerbate exclusion, or somehow to foster discrimination in all its various forms in our society."
"Its aim is precisely the opposite – to put people first."
"The time has come to show people that we intend to continue to invest in them."
"We must, therefore, get the social model up and running."
"The time has come to make sure that objectives are met and that the statistical effect does not make the innocent carry the can for the guilty."
"We must guarantee that we do not jump from comitology into a numbers game and that the smallest regions are not made to foot the whole bill for the change."
"Our hope and expectation is that the package of regulations before us today, despite all the financing that has remained on stand-by, will actually help to implement a Europe of the regions with the people at the forefront of priorities."
"This purpose will be our driving force for Europe."
"– Circumstances have conspired to ensure that this debate on the future of economic and social cohesion is taking place at a particularly crucial time for the European project."
"If we are to emerge from this crisis, the European Institutions, and in particular the Council, must draw up a regional development policy that is characterised by the kind of vision and solidarity needed to meet the enormous challenges facing the EU."
"Accordingly, the United Kingdom, which has just assumed the EU Presidency, has a huge responsibility."
"I view this Presidency with a mixture of apprehension and hope."
"I feel apprehensive because the United Kingdom is, as we know, one the six countries seeking to restrict the EU budget to 1% of GDP, which I feel runs counter to a strong cohesion policy and to the ambitious objectives for future EU action that we wish to set."
"I also feel apprehensive because of the UK Government’s stance on the renationalisation of the European economic and social cohesion effort, which, were it to happen, would amount to a terrible lack of solidarity not only with the new Member States but also with certain regions that are still in need, namely Portugal, Spain and Greece."
"Along with these concerns, however, comes a great deal of hope, in that the United Kingdom is known to be in favour of attaching priority to strengthening the EU’s competitiveness, without which there can be no strong economic growth, and to ensuring that it is at least equal to that of the United States of America. This will in turn enhance job creation."
"We will not fulfil this objective if we do not have the courage to implement the Lisbon Strategy in full."
"A strong, revitalised European cohesion policy with adequate financial resources is one of the crucial factors in meeting the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"In the least-favoured regions of Europe, there is enormous potential for competitiveness and development that needs to be tapped."
"This should be one of the main objectives of European cohesion policy."
"Mr President, one year ago the European Union enlarged to include 10 new, and mostly poor, Member States."
"Although we constantly hear references to balanced development from all quarters, in the majority of cases these are nothing but hot air."
"Attempts are in fact now being made, ‘on the fly’ as it were, to change the principles currently governing the implementation of the main tools for funding regional development."
"Why are different and harsher conditions being imposed on the new Member States than those that benefited the development of the 15 old Member States?"
"Classing non-recoverable VAT as non-eligible expenditure and introducing the n+2 rule for the Cohesion Fund are obvious obstacles to the development of the new Member States."
"Do measures of this kind show solidarity within Europe?"
"The present principles should not now be changed, as otherwise the poor will not be able to afford to benefit from EU aid."
"The new Member States must have the same development opportunities as those which were enjoyed by the 15 old Member States, and which they put to outstanding use."
"It is time for the talk of a Europe of equal opportunities and balanced development to finally gain legislative force."
"We should make changes for the better instead of for the worse, and we should not divide Europe into those who are better off and those who are worse off."
"– Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, enlargement has led to a widening of the economic and social development gap between the regions of the Union."
"The cohesion policy, of undoubted added value for all parts of Europe, must remain more than ever the instrument of European solidarity, aimed at reducing regional disparities."
"I share the rapporteurs’ opposition to any change in the overall architecture of this reform, any re-nationalisation of regional policy or any drastic cutback in Community spending."
"The proposal to impose financial sanctions on companies which, after receiving European funds, decide to relocate their businesses has now become indispensable."
"Additionally, I thank my colleagues on the Committee on Regional Development for their strong support both for the Special Fund of EUR 1.1 billion for the outermost regions and for the possibility of extending the scope of the ERDF, on an exceptional basis, to finance operating aid to these regions to compensate, in both these cases, for the extra costs due to their remoteness."
"Moreover, I ask for full implementation of the requirement set out in Article 299 paragraph 2 of the Treaty, providing for particular treatment for the outermost regions and guaranteeing them access to the Structural Funds, particularly in the case of those regions whose GDP is already in excess of 75% of the Community average."
"With regard to the European Fisheries Fund, I am pleased to note that a real equilibrium has been achieved between environmental concerns and socio-economic considerations."
"The Committee on Fisheries has accepted my proposal to enable the financing, through the European Fisheries Fund, of public aid for the renewal and modernisation of the fleet in the outermost regions."
"In the majority of the outermost regions, fishing is a very recent business and fish stocks are still abundant."
"It would be unthinkable and counterproductive to prevent this type of aid."
"However, I regret the rejection of my request that public support for the transformation of outermost regions should be maintained at the current rate of 75%, and not 50% as proposed."
"I hope the Council will follow the route opened up by the European Parliament on this reform, which is vital and urgent for so many European regions."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community’s regional policy exists just as much for the sake of cohesion among Member States as of cohesion between the different European regions."
"Solidarity requires us to direct the bulk of the Funds to the new Member States, but we must also remember that certain regions of the old Member States still need to gain the benefit of the leverage effect produced by the Structural Funds in order to implement projects of structural importance and to consolidate the progress they have made in their development."
"I therefore support the Commission’s proposal, because it offers a fair balance between focusing the funds on the poorest regions – and therefore on the new Member States – and giving attention to the poorer regions of the old, wealthier Member States."
"To disturb this balance would not only be dangerous for European cohesion, but it could also heighten the phenomenon of European citizens’ disaffection with the European project, because European regional policy is the most visible and best- known policy in our countries."
"I therefore wish the Council a rapid and favourable conclusion to the negotiations on the financial perspectives in order to equip regional policy with an adequate budget and to assist the regions which still require help."
"Mr President, cohesion is the key to the social construction in the Europe of the 25, and, as we all share responsibility for this, the new Member States and poorer regions should be able to count on our solidarity."
"The structural funds must allow the reconstruction in those new Member States to run as quickly and successfully as possible."
"Europe must display solidarity."
"We should not be caught up in self-interest, for that will not do the public in the 15 old Member States any good either, and, quite apart from aid from funds and structural funds, we should also provide access to our countries and ensure no regions are screened off."
"I would now like to turn to the European Social Fund, in respect of which Mr Silva Peneda has done such an excellent job."
"The ESF’s review, as currently proposed, is important."
"Why?"
"Funds are being set aside for the Lisbon objectives with a clear focus on the new countries, and this is something I wholeheartedly support."
"In fact, this morning in the Netherlands, I enquired about our expectations surrounding the ESF."
"The response that I received from the Netherlands will shock you: they were quite clear; they wanted nothing."
"That comment is in sharp contrast with the opinion of local councils and social organisations in my country, which are opposed to the social exclusion of anyone."
"It is therefore only fair that the ESF should provide for jobs and training for all those who are socially excluded, wherever the problems may occur."
"In short, we should not use the funds, and particularly the ESF, to build new walls."
"The large city issue is universal."
"We must learn and innovate across Europe."
"There is added value, even for the 15 old Member States."
"Europe can play a stimulating role not only in directives, but also in this sense, because even the old 15 still have a thing or two to learn."
"Mr President, the Structural Funds are an essential example of EU solidarity – solidarity between the richest and the poorest parts of the EU – and I am delighted to see that the Structural Funds have been refocused to concentrate on achieving the Lisbon goals."
"There will be better strategic planning, and there will be increased simplification, which is what we are looking for."
"In the Hatzidakis report, we are also asking the Member States to take their responsibilities seriously in terms of making sure that the money is spent properly, and we are demanding that the Finance Minister in each Member State signs off the accounts on an annual basis."
"We want to see an end to the blame game, blaming the Commission for the failures within the Member States."
"In Wales, we have enjoyed generous support from the EU Structural Funds, and I would like to see that support continue for West Wales and the Valleys."
"If the Council gets its skates on, we may sort out the budget before December and we may see a situation where we receive the maximum amount of funding."
"Being poor is not a badge of pride, but, on this occasion, it would be a window of opportunity to help our poorest communities."
"I am also pleased to see that there is a reference now to inactivity in helping people who are inactive in the workplace."
"Mr President, I have risen to speak in this debate, which relates to the Council regulations on the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, as a representative of a new Member State, Poland."
"I would therefore like to start by saying how delighted I am at the fact that the work on these regulations has continued, even though the Council has failed to reach an agreement on the new Financial Perspective for the years 2007-2013."
"The fact that these regulations are being prepared a long way in advance of the period during which they will apply will enable the Member States, and in particular the new Member States, to make appropriate preparations in terms of public authority structures, the various types of institutions, beneficiaries of the projects and national legislation."
"In view of the limited time available, I would merely like to highlight two issues that are particularly important for the new Member States."
"The first is the problem of VAT, or more specifically the problem of classing this tax as an eligible project cost."
"If such a decision were taken, this would have particular significance for public beneficiaries of projects, which do not pay VAT."
"In Poland, for example, this would affect the majority of projects, and in such instances VAT would increase the costs of implementing these projects by more than one fifth."
"This, in turn, would lead to a reduction in the number of projects submitted, as well as frequent financial problems for beneficiaries."
"Mr Hatzidakis has agreed in his report to such a solution with regard to VAT and the Cohesion Fund."
"A group of Members has proposed that a similar solution also be adopted with regard to the European Regional Development Fund, as there is no logical reason why different solutions should be adopted for different funds."
"A second important proposal that has been submitted by a group of Members is that the n+2 rule should not apply to projects implemented under the Cohesion Fund."
"This would allow greater flexibility with regard to this Fund, as well as making it easier to implement large infrastructure projects, especially in the new Member States."
"Adopting such a solution would also be in accordance with the provisions relating to this matter in the Böge report on the new Financial Perspective for 2007-2013."
"Finally, I very much hope that a majority of Members of this House will ultimately vote in favour of these two important proposals."
"Mr President, Europe needs a regional policy characterised by solidarity."
"We have very big differences between regions in the EU, especially between new and old Member States."
"That is unacceptable on a continent where importance is attached to welfare."
"We cannot, however, rely on the internal economic market alone being able to bridge the gulfs, and that is why we need the Structural Funds."
"The new regions should therefore be allocated a larger proportion of the Structural Funds, and the richer countries must have their own regional equalisation policies."
"At the same time, the EU countries must also, however, emphasise that growth and research provide scope for regional development."
"The European Parliament is now submitting a proposal that makes sense in financial terms too."
"We also emphasise how important it is for environmental work to be given priority within the Structural Funds."
"Finally, I wish to emphasise that, according to the Commission and the European Parliament, there are regions with permanent geographical disadvantages, including sparsely populated and mountainous regions, which also need to be compensated via the Structural Funds, because the geographical conditions do not change over time."
"I assume that the European Council will take account of this too in the future financial perspective."
"This is the first time that urban public transport has figured in the regulations on the Cohesion Funds as an objective to be supported."
"On the part of the Committee on Transport, we welcome and support this."
"It is important to make the proposal more precise, however."
"In the case of urban fixed-rail public transport systems, in addition to the track we need to include the vehicles or, to use the technical terminology, as in my proposed amendment, the so-called rolling stock."
"After all, without it the giant would only have one arm."
"Likewise, the routes used for bus transport, in other words the roads that carry the bulk of transport by bus, must be included and listed here."
"So, what is it we are saying?"
"We are saying that it is vital to develop route infrastructure and vehicles together in order to achieve results; the two are inseparable."
"We are striving to reduce congestion by making public transport in our cities as attractive as possible."
"Well then, for European cities – which are eligible to receive cohesion support – the proposal that I am asking Parliament to support will mean a genuine improvement and a rise in standards."
"The Committee on Transport also proposes extending the objectives of the Cohesion Fund to include motorway-type sections of access roads linking larger regional towns into the trans-European network."
"In some regions, the towns have a crucial role and are a major wellspring of cohesion."
"Appropriate infrastructure connections could significantly increase the existing competitive potential of these towns and thereby also enhance cooperation."
"I ask Parliament to give resounding support to this proposal, too."
"– Given that I shall speak about the European Fisheries Fund, I should first like to praise the Committee on Fisheries’ work on this draft."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate my colleague Mr Casa on his good work on what is set to be one of the most important issues to be addressed in this legislature."
"I believe that it is essential for the European Fisheries Fund to be the major instrument in squaring the objective of conserving the biological resources of the sea with fishing possibilities."
"Against this backdrop, the money earmarked for this purpose must be consistent with the actual needs of the fisheries sector, which is integrated into an enlarged Europe with new challenges ahead."
"Given the fact that the financial envelope for the 2007-2013 period is virtually the same as the one in the Community framework still in force and that Europe has enlarged from 15 to 27, it strikes me as both logical and necessary that the overall financial allocation for this Fund should be increased."
"The indicative fund level, as just mentioned, is no higher than of 0.5% of the Community budget, expressed as an annual average."
"As well as the financial aspect, I feel that the intervention strategy proposed by the Commission should also be changed."
"I refer, for example, to the restrictions as regards the objectives and general intervention rules for the fund that the Commission is seeking to place on businesses."
"It will be impossible to ask our businesses for competitiveness and environment protection technology if we only support micro and small enterprises."
"I now turn to the issue of modernising fishing vessels."
"I feel that the Commission must rethink its positions on replacing Community fleet vessels."
"Banning them strikes me as wrong in terms of economic, biological, safety and operational capability considerations."
"Lastly, I should also like to point out that the outermost regions must continue to enjoy the protection of the common fisheries policy."
"Accordingly, I feel that the derogations currently applying to the outermost regions, as enshrined in the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG), must remain in the new text of the European Fisheries Fund."
"Additionally, I wish to stress the importance of the idea of strengthening some of the measures contained therein."
"Mr President, I too would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his work of synthesis, which has been demonstrated by the compromise amendments supported by all of the political groups."
"From the text approved by the Committee on Fisheries, Commissioner, I would like you to take account of certain very positive issues and to take good account of them, because they reflect the reality of this sector — which some of us know well since we see it on a daily basis — for example, that Member States can present national plans throughout the period of programming or that the article relating to equal opportunities between men and women be strengthened and this view of gender equality integrated into fisheries activities, and, with regard to aquaculture, the extension of aid to medium-sized businesses, not just micro and small businesses, and that the improvement in the working conditions and safety of workers in the sector can be funded."
"Also important is the consensus reached on eligibility criteria, the low level of employment and fisheries activity in decline, which make it logical that the reference to municipalities of less than 100 000 inhabitants be removed."
"Two more controversial points, the renovation and modernisation of vessels and engines and mixed companies as an alternative to scrapping, have been saved in a positive manner, as a result of a good willingness to negotiate."
"My group is in favour of the fleet being able to continue with the process of renovation and modernisation, provided that it does not mean an increase in capacity."
"We have the obligation to keep fisheries activity alive and well in the European Union, guaranteeing decent salaries and conditions for workers in the sector and preserving resources, but we also have the obligation, Commissioner, to save lives at sea."
"My region, Galicia, knows a lot about this, since over the last two years many of its people have been lost at sea as a result of construction problems, structural problems involving vessels."
"We cannot allow this to carry on and we must continue to support the renovation of the fleet."
"Mr President, I should like to make two specific and brief comments in the two minutes that are allocated to me."
"I should like to start by saying something about the ‘Objective 2’ regions, which should not be left out in the cold."
"It is undoubtedly a good thing that the limited resources be mainly deployed in the area of the Lisbon objectives and that innovation policy be central to this."
"Although that is, of course, to be welcomed, there is hardly any room, if any at all, for the so-called traditional projects which are, in fact, just as important to the local economy and employment."
"Hence this appeal for a really decentralised policy, because it is invariably the regional policy makers who really know what measures are needed to boost the local economy with the future in mind."
"Regional competitiveness and regional employment, for those are the issues at stake, currently account for some 17% of the resources of the structural funds."
"Surely it cannot be the intention, Commissioner, and I would also say to the Council – not currently present – that the budgets in this area need to be reduced in absolute terms, simply because the current ‘Objective 2’ regions then have to suddenly pay the price for a lack of European solidarity"
"Secondly, as Mr van Nistelrooij and Mr Berend have already said, it is crucial that cofinancing from the private sector should remain an option."
"Hence our express request to retain the purport of Amendment 52."
"Finally, we unreservedly support Amendments 124 and 126 about VAT."
"As has been said repeatedly on this platform, if the non-recoverable VAT is abolished as a cost qualifying for subsidy, this would mean a heavy blow to very many projects, for example in education."
"I am sure the Commissioner will agree with me that we should avoid this at all costs."
"– I should like to join in the congratulations for Mr Casa on his outstanding work."
"I also wish to commend the Commission, and the Commissioners attending this House today, on its positive proposal."
"Yet I must also mention what, to my mind, are the major omissions in your proposal, namely the Natura 2000 network and its presence on the oceans, and the undertakings made by the Commission as regards the Convention for the protection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR Convention)."
"These are international commitments that should lead to compulsory expenditure on the Commission’s part."
"Unfortunately, whilst the Commission’s proposal is a good one on many levels, there is a glaring gap in this area."
"I should like to call on the Commission and the Council to plug that gap as soon as possible and to make their final decision on the matter."
"Mr President, of all the instruments with which European employment policy is implemented, the European Social Fund is the most important; for the period between 2000 and 2006, it made available EUR 80 billion for measures to combat unemployment and for education and training, with EUR 12 billion going to Germany alone."
"Between 2007 and 2013, priority is to be given to helping workers and businesses to adapt and to prolonging working lives."
"Following the last European Council, it is to be hoped that the British will come up with one initiative or another as regards how this is to be funded."
"Glad though I am that the social partners are to be involved in devising and implementing projects, and that we are, together, endeavouring to improve the exchange of best practices, I do repudiate the Commission’s ideas about separate ESF projects for convergence on the one hand and regional competitiveness on the other."
"Mr Silva Peneda was right to point out that this would produce the novelty of a Europe with multi-speed support."
"Having measures that benefit only the new Member States and do the old ones no good at all will not work, for what we need is solidarity."
"It is not acceptable that the Commission is in favour of ESF funds being used only if the public purse pays its share as well."
"The consequence of this would be that many projects would go under for lack of money."
"A third point I would like to make is that no reference whatever is made to the possibility of the ESF helping to run courses open to craft industry trainees from various firms."
"In my own country, Germany, these are run in the craft industry associations’ training facilities, and with a great deal of success."
"They pass on new, up-to-date, and important business knowledge."
"For this reason, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats calls for these measures, from which trainees and apprentices benefit, and which help small and medium-sized enterprises financially, to be continued."
"I ask all those who are in earnest about support for SMEs – which are, after all, the backbone of the European economy – to make good use of this opportunity and vote in favour of this amendment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make the general comment that structural policy is one area of Community policy of which people in Europe are very much aware, and of which they generally take a favourable view; in this, it resembles the agricultural policy, being also a policy that promotes the interests of rural areas."
"Although financial instruments and the rules under which they operate still vary, our long-term objective must be to have a policy that applies to the EU as a whole."
"We all have to consider how, in future, we may foster closer cooperation between the various funds and policy areas and thereby arrive at a generally coherent policy."
"More specifically, there are a number of points to which I would like to draw your attention."
"One of them is to be found in paragraph 47 of the Hatzidakis report: the difference in the levels of support given to regions on either side of the new internal borders must not be allowed to exceed 20%, or else competition will be distorted."
"Another is the simplification of administration: if the administrative authorities are not to face excessive obstacles in their day-to-day handling of the programmes, the Commission must demonstrate a high degree of flexibility, particularly when programmes are altered or adjusted."
"Particular attention needs to be paid to mountain and hill areas, which perform many functions that are vital to the overall viability of the EU and of its rural areas."
"Few, if any, of these additional tasks are being performed to their fullest extent, and so the Community needs to intervene in this area if we are to have an overarching structural policy."
"I would add that, in future, for the sake of policy coherence, competition policy, which imposes limits on aid, will need to be brought much more into line with structural policy than hitherto."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their reports and for the great deal of work they put into preparing them."
"The future reform of structural funding will bring about many changes to regions within the original 15 Member States."
"That causes concern in many regions, such as my own region in Northern Ireland which has received excellent support over many years."
"A great deal has been achieved as a result of that."
"I believe that the greatest problem for the European Union – and perhaps it should reflect upon the two ‘no’ votes in France and the Netherlands – is that we try to make the one suit fit everyone, from one end of the Union to the other."
"It does not work that way; we cannot make that happen; that is one of the great misunderstandings."
"While we understand the needs and requirements of many in the ten new Member States, it is of little comfort to those who will lose out substantially."
"Northern Ireland, where I come from, is a much better place than it was ten years ago."
"It is not perfect by any means, and I would not claim otherwise, but we have, to some degree, an imperfect peace, which we did not have at that time."
"However, in the last 30 years we have suffered the scourge of terrorism, when our towns, cities and villages were bombed to pieces."
"Many people lost their lives, but the will and resilience of the people saw us through those dark and terrible days."
"The rebuilding had to be paid for, however, so instead of gradual investment in infrastructure and the development of our road, rail and other connections to the rest of the United Kingdom and Europe, instead of upgrading our infrastructure, all the finance went into rebuilding the bombed-out areas."
"That has left us with a serious legacy of decay and decline with out-of-date structures and over-capacity in our water and sewage works."
"We have not built a single kilometre of motorway in that time."
"The west and the north-west of my province are crying out for infrastructural developments that will provide links within the province and encourage industry to those areas."
"Our rail system has been improved in recent years but still requires further development in rolling stock."
"We have lost out."
"We will need further support."
"Commissioner, you recently visited Northern Ireland and came to Belfast."
"It was a very short visit."
"I hope that we will be able to welcome you back in the near future, when you will be able to see and perhaps help us on our way through some of those difficulties."
". Mr President, I would like to say a few words and I thank you for this opportunity."
"I would like to thank all of you for this inspiring debate."
"I have been listening carefully to your arguments and I am absolutely convinced that, as we continue our dialogue and cooperation through the consecutive stages of the legislative process, the Commission will be able to accommodate many of your concerns and that it will be to the benefit of our proposals."
"In that context the commitment of the Presidency to work in partnership for early results has indeed been encouraging."
"I shall briefly make two comments on two issues to which I did not refer in my introductory remarks."
"On partnership, I want to say that the Commission fully agrees with all those of you who pleaded for reinforcement of the partnership in the process of implementing the funds."
"Yes, it is the principle of partnership that makes the governance of our policy so unique."
"My second comment is on an issue quite dear to my heart and that is private capital participation in the financing of cohesion programmes."
"The Commission would certainly like to see Member States making use of public-private partnership in the implementation of the cohesion policy and I can tell you that the original proposal has been modified in order to allow Member States to define the co-financing rate at programme and not priority level."
"I shall finish by emphasising what unites this House and the Commission, not what divides us."
"I am sure that the Commission and Parliament are both convinced that the Union’s cohesion policy, whilst focusing on the poorest and responding to their needs, must apply to every region of Europe."
"The solidarity expressed by this policy was vital for the harmonious development of the Union in the past and it should remain so in the future."
"I believe both Parliament and the Commission are convinced that a vibrant and adequately resourced cohesion policy can make an essential contribution to the modernisation of the Union’s economy by helping it to achieve the Lisbon goals and benefit from the globalisation of markets."
"In conclusion, the construction and further development of this policy is our common task and the Commission has drawn strength at every step of the way from the support, both intellectual and political, of this Parliament."
"I commit myself to continuing the dialogue between our institutions within and beyond the formal procedures."
"Together I am sure we can make something which will be of lasting benefit to our citizens and help them improve the quality of their daily lives."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened very closely to your observations and comments, and I should like to thank the House once again for these valuable contributions."
"I am delighted that the Commission and Parliament have reached agreement on the basic issues, and we are very much behind the House’s efforts to ensure that equality between men and women, and equal opportunities in general, are taken into account in every sphere of the European Social Fund."
"Cohesion policy must help to eliminate all forms of discrimination."
"In this respect, I would remind the House that the Structural Funds already play a key role in promoting the social inclusion of the Roma and other disadvantaged groups, and will play an even more prominent role in the future."
"Cohesion policy must also promote social inclusion, by means of our common objectives in the fight against exclusion."
"Parliament reiterated this point, which is in any case one that has the Commission’s backing."
"I can tell you that the Commission is able to accept a total of 68 amendments."
"That leaves 31 amendments that it cannot accept, and the reasons for this are as follows."
"Firstly, the Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the future role that may be played by the social partners in implementing the work of the European Social Fund."
"This is why we have accepted Amendments 6, 46 and 54, and having accepted these amendments we cannot accept any amendments that run counter to them."
"Our reservations concerning certain other amendments stem from a number of considerations."
"Some are horizontal provisions that come under the scope of other regulations, while some overlap with other provisions of either the draft regulation or the present regulation."
"Others are unworkable or do not come under the remit of the European Social Fund."
"Finally, some are at odds with the principles of healthy and effective financial management."
"Honourable Members, I am delighted that the cooperation between the Commission and Parliament has been so fruitful."
"The intended outcome of this cooperation is a guarantee that the European Social Fund will continue to function effectively in the future, while adhering to the growth and employment objectives of the revised Lisbon Strategy."
"The principles underlying the European Social Fund in the period from 2007 to 2013 will be cohesion, consolidation and simplification, and it will also be underpinned by a partnership extended to involve all key stakeholders."
"I am quite sure that a strategy viewed in these terms will be an effective tool in our efforts to boost employment in Europe, to promote social cohesion and equal opportunities and to eliminate all forms of discrimination and disadvantage."
". Mr President, honourable Members, given the limited time at my disposal I can only comment broadly on the spirit of the amendments tabled."
"The Commission can agree to a number of amendments, which also reflect the progress that has been achieved in the Council."
"These include eligibility for replacement of engines for small-scale vessels under strict conditions so as to ensure that there is no increase in fishing capacity."
"With respect to aid for young fishermen operating in small-scale fisheries and wishing to purchase a second-hand fishing vessel, proposals considered by the Council restrict such aid to the purchase of vessels below twelve metres not using towed gears."
"Your request to apply this possibility to all vessels requires further examination."
"The scope of socio-economic measures has been extended to training and to compensation for fishermen working on board vessels whose activity has been stopped permanently."
"The requirement whereby aid for temporary cessation of activities must be accompanied by a reduction of capacity is withdrawn and replaced by reinstating the current FIFG provisions setting the threshold of Community contribution to all types of temporary cessation."
"We stated in Council that EFF-funded plans put forward following the adoption of emergency measures may also cover real-time closures for reasons of concentration of juveniles or of spawning."
"It is proposed to extend EFF support to medium-sized enterprises operating in the aquaculture, processing and marketing sectors, while keeping small and micro-enterprises the priority."
"Aquaculture is made more visible."
"Indeed, we have included aquaculture in the definition of the fisheries sector, and support for aquaculture is explicitly quoted as one of the objectives and missions of the EFF."
"Support for inland fisheries, with the exclusion of vessel construction, and the starting-up and restructuring of producers' organisations are reinstated."
"There are new funding possibilities to enhance and protect the environment in Natura 2000 areas concerned by fisheries activities."
"In addition to other provisions on equal opportunities, we have added support for collective actions aimed at networking and the exchange of experience among organisations promoting equal opportunities between men and women."
"The Commission cannot accept the following proposals that have been included in your report."
"The construction or replacement of vessels, even with no increase of capacity."
"The Commission cannot accept a proposal that goes against our conservation policy."
"Such aid would contribute to maintaining the situation of fleet overcapacity."
"The Commission is not prepared to move on this point, which for us remains a fundamental pillar of sustainable fisheries."
"The same applies to aid for the establishment of joint ventures."
"Such aid benefits mainly private vessel owners and would run counter to our commitments made within international organisations."
"However, there is agreement that studies on the feasibility of such joint enterprises could be funded."
"Regarding the replacement of engines for all types of vessels, let me repeat that during the Council deliberations the Commission accepted a compromise whereby the replacement of engines would be allowed for small-scale vessels."
"I have listened to your views with regard to the extension of aid beyond the parameters already accepted by the Commission."
"Clearly, this must be further evaluated."
"I am of the view that the installation of young fish farmers need not be financed in the same way as that of young fishermen, because aquaculture is not facing the same recruitment problems as the catching sector."
"I am willing to look into this further."
"We have proposed the reinstatement of aid for inland fisheries."
"However the Commission cannot accept the request to extend aid for the construction of inland fishing vessels, because precaution is also required in inland fishing, where some stocks are reported to be in a bad situation, and given the limits of scientific knowledge in this area."
"We nevertheless envisage that vessels operating in inland fishing should enjoy the same treatment as vessels operating in marine fishing."
"Finally, we have also carefully examined your amendments concerning the 'horizontal issues' with regard to the management, monitoring and control systems."
"As you are no doubt aware, these provisions are very much inspired by the proposals for a Regulation on Structural Funds."
"For the sake of coherence among Community instruments, we shall await sufficient progress to be made in the negotiations on these proposals."
"The next item is the report (A6-0175/2005) by Mrs Bozkurt, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, on the role of women in Turkey in social, economic and political life (2004/2215(INI))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there was a woman in rural Turkey who was about to be married off against her will, and women’s rights organisations told her that new legislation in Turkey meant that she could go to court to have her marriage declared null and void."
"When she told her parents that she intended to do exactly that, they realised that there was no point whatsoever in marrying her off and so the wedding was cancelled."
"This is just one example of the way in which Turkey is in the process of improving the position of women."
"Turkey’s new legislation comes in for praise in the report on the role of women in political, economic and social life in Turkey by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality."
"In the area of women’s rights, Turkey has made many improvements in relation to the new constitution, labour law and new criminal law."
"These things exist on paper, and they must now be put into practice."
"Although Turkey has made a start on this, it must persevere."
"Respect for women’s rights is an absolute condition for EU membership."
"The report urges the Commission to put women’s rights high on the agenda in discussions with Turkey."
"Yesterday, Commissioner Rehn explained to this House the shape that negotiations with Turkey will take."
"I am pleased that he added that women’s rights will be a key priority and that they will be a core issue in the annual progress report on Turkey."
"In addition, the Turkish Government has indicated that it is taking the report very seriously indeed."
"For example, in response to earlier discussions in Turkey about this report, it has already been decided to set up a women’s rights committee in the Turkish parliament, and the government has already committed to building more relief centres for female victims of violence."
"A large majority of Turkish women’s rights organisations support the findings in my report."
"In this House too, the report met with wide support during the vote in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality."
"I am indebted to all those who have worked on this report."
"In particular, I would like to thank the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for the excellent cooperation in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality."
"Needless to say, wide support for the report does not mean that we see eye to eye on everything."
"I would like to single out a few aspects which could be significant for tomorrow’s vote."
"In Turkey, women participate in politics only to a very limited extent, and one possible solution that the report proposes to this is a system of quotas that can help involve more women in politics in the short term."
"The quotas are suggested as a possible solution to a problem but are not compulsory, since the European Union cannot, of course, demand of Turkey something that is not yet generally accepted in its own Member States."
"I join with the women’s organisations in Turkey in asking for your support in this area."
"The amendment on this subject tabled by the Liberals is one with which I can identify, provided that the Turkish Government is called to account in terms of its responsibility."
"I would ask you to support the oral amendment that I will be presenting in the plenary the day after tomorrow and with which the Liberals can apparently agree."
"Then there is the issue of the headscarf."
"In Turkey, the strict division between church and state means that the wearing of religious clothing at universities or in government offices is prohibited."
"If women refuse to remove their headscarves, they cannot attend university, nor can they work in the civil service."
"In my report, I have repeated the Eurlings report’s appeal to the Turkish Government that it be ensured that all girls and women, irrespective of their backgrounds, can enjoy their right to education."
"I endorse the amendment tabled by Mr Szymánski of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, which makes an indirect appeal for the ban on wearing the headscarf to be lifted."
"I do so, not because I am unaware of the negative implications this ban may have, but because Europe itself has no agreed policy on wearing headscarves."
"We can hardly ask Turkey to do something which we have not figured out for ourselves."
"In addition, the European Court of Human Rights recently decided that Turkey, with this ban, is not flouting women’s rights; each country is entitled to adopt its own policy on religious symbols."
"Turkey should therefore find a sensible solution of its own to the issue surrounding the headscarf."
"I would gladly help find that solution, provided that, for example, the problem can first be discussed at great length in the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee."
"This topic must be debated both in Turkey and in Europe."
"It goes without saying that we as Parliament cannot solve this problem ourselves, but we can make a contribution to the discussion."
"Finally, I should like to urge everyone to vote for this report, understandably, because it is my own report, but I have made particular efforts to bring about good cooperation with other parties in respect of this report because it is important, I think, that Turkey sees that the appeal to work hard on women’s rights comes from the whole of the European Parliament."
"I would thank you in advance for your help and for your attention and look forward to your contributions during this debate."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was here two and a half hours ago, and it is annoying that once again there is a quite unreasonable delay before we can start this debate, especially as it is such an important issue."
"I have to say, it is no wonder that European competitiveness is on such shaky ground, when people cannot keep to such a simple rule as a timetable."
"I hope that the Bureau might reflect on this and also do something about it for the future."
"I welcome this opportunity to discuss women’s rights in Turkey on the basis of Mrs Bozkurt’s excellent report at a particularly important moment in EU-Turkey relations."
"Last week, the Commission submitted the negotiating framework for Turkey to the Member States and it is the most rigorous framework ever presented by the Commission."
"It states that the Union expects Turkey to sustain the process of reform and ensure its determined implementation to respect fully the rule of law and human rights in all walks of life and in all corners of the country."
"I have said that in the negotiations with Turkey the journey is at least as important as the destination, but to have a meaningful journey you need a destination and it is precisely the prospect of EU accession that provides Turkey with such an aim and gives the European Union credible leverage to influence issues such as women’s rights in Turkey."
"Let us be frank."
"No other perspective would give Turkey the same incentive to adopt and implement European values on gender equality as the prospect of its becoming a member of the Union."
"This is the secret of the success of our enlargement policy and let us not forget this secret."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report."
"It is a well-researched and comprehensive report that addresses many of the issues identified by the Commission in its regular reports."
"The report’s recommendations should be taken on board by all relevant parties."
"I welcome in particular the report’s focus on promoting women’s participation in the workforce, increasing the representation of women in decision-making positions and combating domestic violence against women, and especially the need for more shelters for the victims of violence."
"I share the rapporteur’s appreciation of the Turkish Government’s efforts to introduce constitutional and legislative reforms, for instance the penal code, which addresses the situation of women and promotes gender equality."
"The new penal code has been criticised in some respects, but overall it represents a clearly positive development that modernises the criminal system, as it includes many improvements for women."
"I shall give you some very concrete examples."
"The penal code implies and leads to the criminalisation of marital rape, the abolition of discrimination against non-virgin and unmarried women, the criminalisation of sexual harassment in the workplace, the abolition of the patriarchal concept of the head of family, and equal rights to children born out of wedlock."
"All this is included in the new penal code."
"Now it is a matter of implementation, implementation, implementation."
"Finally, I would like to underline that women’s rights will be a main priority for the Commission in the process of accession negotiations with Turkey and we shall assess the state of women’s rights in depth in our next regular report, which the Commission will adopt on 9 November this year."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last week I read in a major German monthly magazine a marvellous report on three Turkish businesswomen."
"Reading the report we are considering today, one can appreciate how great the gender gap in Turkey is."
"Our main concern is to help human rights, specifically, in this instance, the rights of women, to gain acceptance."
"Violence against women, including domestic violence, the so-called honour killings, forced marriage, the high incidence of illiteracy among women – all these things are alarming."
"Many hundreds of thousands of girls are not allowed to go to school, either because their parents are backward or because the facilities are absent."
"Kurdish women are particularly affected by these things."
"As the Commissioner said, laws get passed, but we have yet to see them put into effect."
"I very much hope that the Commission will insist on that being done."
"Honour killings and forced marriages, though, are problems that particularly affect Turkish women who have come to live among us, and, hence affect our society too."
"The political parties should also take appropriate action to address the under-representation of Turkish women in legislatures, but forcing Turkey to adopt quotas and a ‘zipper’ system of placement on the election lists is, to put it mildly, humbug if we do not first try to do that sort of thing in our own countries."
"I hope that the resolution that will be adopted with support from all of us will help women’s associations in Turkey to tell it like it is to their political representatives in that country."
"The changes are needed, for these breaches of the law are infringements of human rights, and – quite apart from any desire for membership of the European Union – the need for them to be outlawed ought to be self-evident."
"I hope that this will also, slowly but surely, dawn on politicians in Turkey."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to extend to the rapporteur the congratulations of the Socialist Group on her report, which is timely and very sound, and we have had innumerable discussions both with the women’s committee in Turkey and in this House."
"We have had talks with the NGOs and with the political class and the social partners."
"All these have resulted in a wide-ranging debate in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and a report supported by almost all the groups."
"It is very clear from the report that much has been done in Turkey towards complying with the European Union’s ."
"The new penal code entered into force on 1 June."
"It must now, of course, be put into effect, and there must be no let-up in the pressure for it to be so, but Turkey must also be given the time in which to do this."
"From now on, marital rape will be punishable, and honour crimes are now stigmatised as the thoroughly dishonourable and criminal acts that they actually are."
"It is now for Turkey to take the next step and appoint women to political office."
"A 4% quota for women in the Turkish parliament is not feasible; a 1% quota in municipal council chambers is minimal to the point of insignificance."
"This is where Turkish women need our help, and, with the aim of getting this House to send a clear message, the women’s organisations have sent us an urgent appeal, begging us to support them with quotas and with best practice, but above all to put it in a resolution."
"That, I think, is what we should do."
"We should also, again and again, denounce violence against women and put it on the agenda."
"Negotiations are due to commence on 3 October, and this report will have an important contribution to make to them."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are quick to advise countries outside the Union on issues where we ourselves still might have much to do."
"This report on women’s rights in Turkey points out that women constitute only 4.4% of the Turkish parliament."
"The issue must be raised and the objective should be a change for the better."
"We cannot, however, propose a mandatory quota system to try to increase women’s participation in Turkish politics without also calling on our own Member States to change their legislation in exactly the same way."
"We cannot demand of Turkey more than what we ourselves are prepared to do."
"Accordingly, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe tabled Amendment 3."
"I would like to appeal to our Turkish associates. Encourage women to participate more in politics; be bolder than the heads of many of the current Member States of the Union!"
"For example, the proportion of women in the national parliament in France is approximately 12%, and in Italy it is smaller still."
"I have not heard the heads of either of these countries or the European Union express concern about the situation and the restricted participation of women in these countries."
"It would be enough if action were taken there."
"We should not conceal our own problems and point an accusing finger just at Turkey."
"We should address the problem of low numbers of women in political life both in Turkey and the Union, and, indeed, in the selections the Union itself makes."
"Finally, I wish to thank the rapporteur, who has done some excellent work."
"At the same time I also wish to thank Commissioner Rehn, who has, to his credit, raised the issue of women’s rights in these membership negotiations."
". Mr President, I too, speaking on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, would like to warmly thank the rapporteur for this report."
"I hope that, tomorrow, a clear message will be sent out, and not just from this House."
"I would like to see the Commission giving a more prominent place to equality policy, which has, I think, been somewhat in the shadows until now."
"We have to make it abundantly clear that we will not be content with progress that exists only on paper, but demand that women’s rights be put into practice."
"I am glad that we have laid down a quota. We should go further and actually consider demanding the same thing in the European Union."
"It really does testify to our political bankruptcy that women make up only 4% of the members of our national legislatures and 1% of our local councils."
"There is an urgent need for action to address this, and nothing short of quotas will do the job."
"In view of the fact that it was as long ago as 8 March that this House adopted a resolution making explicit our opposition to forced marriage, I again ask your support for our amendment on the immediate registration of the newborn, which would prevent the legitimation of forced marriage through underage girls being declared to be adult."
". Mr President, we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left endorse Mrs Bozkurt’s report and will also be voting in favour of it tomorrow."
"The report makes it clear that there is still much to be done, in society and in the economic and political spheres, despite the improvements in the position of women in Turkey, as exemplified by such things as the legislation on honour killings and marital rape."
"We, the GUE/NGL Group, see it as important that a political solution be found to the situation in South-Eastern Turkey and that the disadvantaged position of the Kurdish regions become a thing of the past."
"It matters to us that women in backward rural areas should have more opportunities to work and be educated, and that projects to this end be supported."
"That is why one of my contributions to the report is the clause calling on the Turkish Government to cooperate with mayors in these regions in drawing up and promoting targeted programmes on equal opportunities and rights for the women who live there."
"An improvement in the position of women in Turkey will represent a great step forward for negotiations on that country’s accession."
". – Mr President, I am speaking as the author of the book entitled 'Women Today', a book which has become a bestseller in my country, and I address my honourable female friends."
"If they love the women of Turkey and feel real solidarity with women, they should not vote for the report."
"What are the real circumstances?"
"They are described in an article which was published a few months ago: a 14-year-old girl was raped by her uncle, she told her family, a family council was held and they killed the girl."
"The murderers are free."
"That is the reality."
"That is the situation."
"We cannot write reports from Brussels."
"We can write reports if we go to Diyarbakir and see how women live."
"In mediaeval circumstances."
"Prejudice is rampant against women. The education system in Turkey cultivates it."
"The patriarchal structure of the family orders the raping and beating of women."
"If we want, at last, to show respect for women anywhere in the world, we cannot vote for this report."
"Mr Erdogan, the prime minister of Turkey, has put women in Turkey back ten years."
"From where they had a woman prime minister, today the prime minister's wife goes round in a veil."
"That is the retrogression of women in Turkey."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, polygamy, forced marriages, illiteracy, honour killings, domestic violence, discrimination in politics, and more of the same besides: this report on the role of women in Turkey is, in terms of content, reasonably exhaustive and well-founded, but anyone who follows the political situation in Turkey from close range will have long been aware that the candidate Member State, the so-called ‘secular model state Turkey’ to use Mr Michel’s words, ‘is in a very bad way indeed in terms of human rights’, particularly in terms of women’s rights in an Islamic society."
"It is, however, helpful that the rapporteur, a few months before the official start of the accession negotiations, makes us revisit some of the facts."
"For those who learnt nothing from the way in which the Turkish police beat up peaceful female protesters, this report comes at exactly the right time."
"In fact, if reports were to be presented here on the role of religious minorities, the occupation in Cyprus, the rights of Armenians, and the restriction of freedom of expression of opinion and of assembly in Turkey, then these would not be received with many accolades either."
"At least once a week, independent sources report grave shortcomings in the area of what we, so ceremoniously, call ‘fundamental rights’."
"The situation in Turkey has not improved in any area whatsoever and incidentally, this whole report is in flat contradiction to the optimistic noises we heard last year from Commissioner Verheugen and Mr Prodi when the Commission, completely at odds with the truth, led us to believe that there are only minimal human rights problems left in Turkey, only to give Turkey the green light."
"In conclusion, the question is, of course, whether we will have the political courage to draw the only obvious conclusion, which is to Ankara, frankly, that Turkish society is too different in terms of values from our own to admit Turkey to the European Union by the date envisaged, for that is the only sensible lesson we can draw from this report."
"It is not just in Turkey that the situation of women is a yardstick of democratic development."
"Turkey has made huge progress in this regard, and this still holds true even though we know there are legal loopholes."
"No one questions the fact that the constitutional amendments and the new criminal code are a great step forward, not only in terms of women’s rights, but also in terms of universal human rights."
"Practice, however, shows that application of the law in implementing these rights is slow and inconsistent."
"The problem is not just that it is more difficult to change traditions and customs than it is to change the law."
"The report encourages the Turkish Government to be more consistent in its efforts to change the situation."
"It is good that the constitution assigns responsibility for creating equal opportunities to the government’s jurisdiction, but no underlying strategy is apparent regarding how the government intends to achieve this goal."
"It is good that men can legally only have monogamous marital relations, but in practice the Imams still perform the marriage ceremony for second and third wives too."
"It is good that around 40% of university teachers are women, but this does not alter the fact that nearly a quarter of women are illiterate."
"Wherever the government is committed, the results are visible."
"In recent weeks, as part of a government campaign, more than twenty thousand previously unregistered children were officially registered in the course of just one day."
"The aim of the report that has been presented, together with the proposed amendments, is to ensure that the progress made in practice helps to close the often enormous gap between the and the human rights situation."
"Mr President, it has certainly been a long and difficult job to collect all the relevant information and data in order to compile such a detailed report concerning the situation of Turkish women in real terms."
"We have been considering countless problems, many of which are encountered in all spheres of life in Turkey in the areas of women’s rights and gender equality."
"Although Turkey has started to meet the challenges on a legal basis, the real transposition of principles into everyday life still lies ahead."
"Turkey, which has been applying for EU membership and regards itself as a potential candidate, should respect fundamental human rights and the in the fields of human rights and gender equality."
"The Turkish Government has proved its strong commitment to European principles and values by creating a new Penalty Law to protect women’s rights."
"I offer my congratulations."
"It should be recalled that we have proposed designating 2006 as the European year of action to combat violence against women."
"Turkey should join in with this, both in principle and in real terms through concrete and visible action by taking steps not only against violence but also towards implementing gender equality in other areas."
"A strong political will for implementing gender-equality policies is not the sole means of gaining success."
"It should be obtained by overcoming many other obstacles, such as traditions, patriarchal social structures, religious aspects, habits, educational, employment and family values, standards and stereotypes all of which hinder progress."
"This is a big challenge, since these structures have been built up over centuries and it is not easy to implement reforms all at once, but if Turkey intends to approach and join Europe, it should respect European values as well."
"We strongly believe that the Turkish Government will be embarking upon taking steps towards implementing our recommendations."
"It is in our common interest to monitor the progress made in order to get a real picture of the situation."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank Mrs Bozkurt most warmly for the excellent report that she has produced."
"The topic of equal rights for women in Turkey is one that I regard as not merely an issue in relation to Turkey’s aspiration to membership of the European Union, but as at the very heart of it."
"The educationalist and educational social worker in me would not wish to omit something positive: when the Turkish daily paper starts to run a campaign under the slogan of ‘send me to school, Daddy!’, then that is a cause with which we can ally ourselves."
"This has to be seen in the context of the planned accession to the EU; the same can be said, for example of the Turkish media group Dogan taking a stand against violence within families, and, its doing so is another thing we can welcome."
"I believe that Turkey must also, over the coming years, come to a new consensus within its own society on the headscarf issue."
"It cannot be right for mothers wanting to attend their children’s celebrations to be barred from the university campus in the city of Erzurum in Eastern Turkey for wearing the headscarf."
"I advocate a forthright ‘no’ to the wearing of the headscarf being enforced, but I also want to say ‘no’ to the warped secularism that bans mothers from visiting their children at school."
"Mr President, the report we are debating today tells us that Turkey is not ready to join the European Union and participate in a system of values of Christian origin, and that it does not wish to be ready."
"I propose that accession negotiations with the country, which are due to start in three months’ time, should not be opened, if only because women’s rights are not respected in Turkey."
"This is only one of many reasons, the most important of which are cultural differences."
"I propose that negotiations should be opened when Turkey becomes similar to Europe, which is likely to be never."
"We do not have the right to demand of Turkey that it abandons its own civilisation and its own system of values, as well as its own religion, since religion is at the root of every civilisation."
"Are women in Turkey really subject to discrimination?"
"Are they discriminated against more today than in the past?"
"Perhaps Turkey simply has different standards and cultural models that cannot be translated into the European model of behaviour."
"It may even be the case that the increase in violence against women is an expression of the fear and aversion of traditional Turkish society towards European integration."
"The Turkish people will not be able to respect us Europeans, who have been brought up in a different spirit and within a different value system, if they cannot respect their own women and national minorities."
"– Mr President, one of the most basic issues by which Turkey's progress towards Europe will be judged over coming years is improvements in protection for human rights."
"Within this framework, improvements in the position of women in all sectors in Turkey is of vital importance, especially bearing in mind that gender equality and respect for human rights and, above all, women's rights, are today part of the . The European Union must stand by Turkey in its efforts to adjust."
"However, certain issues must be noted, as highlighted by Mrs Bozkurt in her report:"
"Firstly, that the government department responsible for women's rights must develop an integrated policy with adequate financing."
"The important problem of violence against women, either in the form of crimes of honour or in the form of domestic violence, must be abolished and protected by any government policy."
"The participation of women in political life in Turkey is minimal. It must be improved by strengthening quotas or greater active participation by women both in democratic parties and in government itself."
"To close, I should like to express my support for Mrs Bozkurt's report, in which she really has tried to formulate feasible and material proposals to help the pre-accession process of this country towards the European Union."
". Mr President, I thank the Members for their comments, which included some very important messages that will have to be taken into account."
"I will just respond to two or three points made by most of the speakers."
"Firstly, as the rapporteur, Mrs Pack and many others said, implementation is indeed at the heart of the matter, as is a change of mentality."
"The legislative changes are important and their implementation essential, but changes in mentality and mindset are at least as important."
"We therefore support, and will reinforce our support for, awareness-building measures to strive for a change in mentality and mindset regarding the practical application of women’s rights and the attitude of the security forces, for instance, in terms of human rights in general."
"That is also the objective of the civil society dialogue that we launched last week, which will accompany the negotiations and move forward in parallel with the negotiations proper."
"We aim to create long-term partnerships, for instance between women’s organisations in the European Union and Turkey, in order to increase mutual understanding and strengthen civil society in Turkey, which is one of its weak points."
"That will certainly enhance women’s participation and European values of gender equality and women’s rights."
"As regards quotas, mentioned by Mrs Jäätteenmäki and the rapporteur, the Commission agrees with the rapporteur that we cannot ask Turkey for more than we are prepared to provide ourselves."
"The fact is that some Member States have quotas and others do not."
"I recall that the Member State I know best has, for quite some time, had quotas to enhance women’s participation in public decision-making."
"I recall that as a young member of parliament in 1991, together with Mrs Jäätteenmäki, we faced a vote on quotas on the basis of gender equality."
"Once I had a meeting with other MPs under 35 and realised that I was in a minority of 12.5%, because the other seven MPs under 35 were women, I certainly voted for the quotas so as to ensure equal representation of both sexes in the future."
"On 3 October, we will start a long and no doubt difficult journey."
"It is important to realise that it is precisely the prospect of accession that provides the incentive for Turkey to enhance women’s rights."
"It also provides a very strong push for activists and citizens who are concerned and want to work for these important European values."
"I can assure you that the Commission will carry out objective and strict monitoring in the course of these accession negotiations."
"It is a very good idea to repeat this exercise every year and thus follow the progress made on women’s rights in Turkey."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A6-0176/2005) by Mrs Niebler, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation (COM(2004)0279 C6-0037/2004 2004/0084(COD))."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Niebler, and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for their key report on our proposal for a revised directive."
"The purpose of this proposal is to simplify, modernise and improve Community legislation on equal treatment for men and women in employment."
"The revised directive is intended to gather the relevant provisions of previous directives on this issue in a single document, in order to make them more workable and easier to understand for all citizens."
"This ties in with our attempts to make the EU more open, more transparent and more relevant to everyday life."
"The proposal does more than merely consolidate existing legislation, however; it also simplifies it and takes cautious steps to modernise it."
"This will result in significant improvements, the most important aspect of which will be the use of consistent terminology and, most importantly, consistent definitions, which will ensure that the legislation is more coherent."
"Explicit use has been made of a number of horizontal provisions relating to occupational social security schemes, and recent case law of the Court of Justice has been incorporated in order to increase legal certainty and clarity."
"It is entirely true that the proposal fails to introduce new policies or innovative ideas, but it should be stressed that we are in a unique position in that we are revising a directive on the basis of an interinstitutional agreement."
"The major advantage of this legislative method is that it allows us to make technical improvements to EU legislation at Community level and to safeguard past achievements without reopening the debate and calling into question solutions that have already been found to be politically sensitive and complex issues."
"The Commission has endeavoured to take advantage of this method and of the potential it offers for legislative revision in order to better promote equality between men and women."
"Mr President, Commissioner Špidla, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow’s vote on the recast directive will draw a line under the very in-depth discussions in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, and so I am sure you will understand how much Mrs Niebler regrets her inability – due to a close family bereavement – to be present at this debate."
"She has asked me to make this statement on her behalf, and I ask the House’s indulgence for that."
"Mrs Niebler is grateful to all of you for the good and fair cooperation in the Committee while preparing this important report."
"What the Commission has proposed in this instance is a rather tricky tightrope walk between a mere consolidation of current legislation and a partial improvement of the existing regulations with the intention of drafting them in more comprehensible terms, modernising and simplifying them, while also incorporating into the consolidated text the case-law of the European Court of Justice."
"Speaking as a former member of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I myself can do no other than endorse that objective."
"What Europe demands in this area needs to be expressed more transparently, more comprehensively and with greater clarity, and it is for that reason that we support this approach."
"It is no secret that this proposal has arrived at a time when the process of transposing Community decisions in the Member States is the subject of decidedly vehement debate – I need mention only the over-heated debate in Germany, where the Red/Green government is, indeed, facing political defeat for going far beyond what Europe requires, but that is not the point at issue."
"This directive concerns itself solely with the equal rights of men and women at work, something that is at the very heart of European equality policy, and its being a matter for the European Union to deal with is not a matter of dispute."
"After decades spent working towards equality, how do things stand now?"
"Despite our efforts at equality in the world of work, we can see that there is still a gender gap, amounting to some 16% of wages."
"Men are twice as likely to occupy positions of leadership and three times as likely to be at the top of companies."
"At the highest decision-making levels of the 50 largest listed companies, the proportion of women amounts to a mere 10%."
"Three subject areas gave rise to lively debate in the Committee."
"For a start, various members demanded that the directive should include reference to parental leave, but Mrs Niebler has taken the view that the use of this recasting to bring about such a fundamental change in European law is not opportune."
"The fact that rules differ so widely from one Member State to another – with parental leave varying from three months to three years – means that extending the directive to cover it would entail enormous changes and make both in-depth debate and an impact assessment necessary."
"It is therefore worth supporting the compromise that we have come up with, according to which the social partners, who are already doing something about this, are urged to review the existing regulations with this in mind."
"The second subject of critical scrutiny in debate was what are known as the ‘unisex tariffs’."
"At one point, the Committee, by a very narrow majority, expressed itself in favour of the idea that the distinction drawn between men and women in occupational pension schemes should be done away with, but Mrs Niebler has warned, in no uncertain terms, against resuming this debate at this stage, for it was only a few months ago that, after protracted negotiations, a very well thought-out compromise was reached in relation to provision for old age."
"Mrs Niebler regards it as very important that this should be mentioned, for, if we now reopen the debate on the ‘unisex tariffs’, a highly politically controversial issue, then there is the risk of the recasting directive being lost as a result of our expecting too much of this process of consolidating legislation currently in force."
"The same argument holds good in respect of the third issue, namely our call for more pressure to be exerted on the Member States and the social partners to get them to improve matters."
"Let us not, then, put the whole directive at risk by weighing it down with substantial demands; that the law should be clear and comprehensible is of value in itself."
"That is what the directive aims at, and I ask you to help enable it to bring that about."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the proposal for a revised directive on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women has been presented to plenary today in its new form, following months of laborious processing by the rapporteur, Mrs Niebler."
"During this processing, all sides had the opportunity to express themselves and to be heard by everyone who helped to formulate today's proposal."
"The rapporteur deserves warm congratulations, because she combined the Commission's suggestions for simplification of the codification of older legislation with a broader scope for horizontal policies in basic sectors of European law, such as in the sectors of pay and insurance."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I find that the safeguarding of equal opportunity in the workplace is being improved, from access to training, access to employment, to career development, especially as regards pay."
"The proposal strengthens the principle of subsidiarity, in that the Member States are repeatedly called on to decide on individual measures for equal treatment."
"The fundamental right of effective legal assistance and dissuasive sanctions for harassment are also safeguarded."
"The different point of view between the revision procedure and the codecision procedure should not lead the Commission into continuing a vendetta between it and Parliament."
"The demographic problem of the European Union imposes the granting of equal opportunities to men and women as far as parental leave is concerned, which was decided in a directive between the Commission and the social partners alone."
"The Commission is, moreover, called on to propose a review of the directive."
"Inequalities are created at times when women are occupied with underage children or people who require protection."
"That is why the proposal for measures to combine work and family life, with parallel protection for maternity, are not wide of the mark."
"We are also calling on the Council to express its political will …"
". Equality of opportunities between men and women is a fundamental right and a priority in the European Union."
"Community policy aimed at ensuring equal opportunities has been on the Community’s agenda since the start of integration, albeit with variations in content."
"The directive that – we hope – will be adopted tomorrow summarises the directives already dealing with this issue, and thus reflects the aim of the legislators to set out uniform, simplified regulations bringing together all the existing provisions on the matter."
"A crucial component of the directive is that it sets out as a goal not only gender equality as regards treatment of men and women, but also equality between the genders."
"It is important to stress that the principle of equal opportunities cannot be narrowed down to employment, because it affects all areas of life."
"This principle demands that there should be no discrimination of any form on the basis of gender, especially with regard to marriage and marital status, and most notably as regards conditions for access to social security schemes, in calculating contribution obligations and benefit entitlements."
"Since women’s traditional roles within the family are one of the main reasons for inequality in the workplace, the directive calls for more flexible working time arrangements in the workplace to enable both men and women to combine family and work commitments."
"The directive aims to enable injured parties to assert their legal rights effectively; this is facilitated by the reversal of the burden of proof in cases of discrimination, and by the prohibition of indirect or hidden discrimination."
"The directive also makes a special point of drawing Member States’ attention to the fact that elimination of the disadvantages faced by women is inconceivable unless governments take an active role, and furthermore, there is also a need for democratic institutions to monitor governments’ efforts in this regard."
"Let us have specialised institutions for guaranteeing women’s rights both within the government institutional system and outside it."
"– Mr President, I should like, first of all, to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for their helpful and constructive cooperation."
"Next, I should like to raise two issues of current interest: firstly, the obligation to comply fully with the legislative sovereignty of Member States; and, secondly, the economic recognition of the work of women in all its forms."
"Firstly, to a social Europe, permitting full equality between men and women, but also to a respect for countries’ different cultures."
"The Beijing action plan is clear, and the European Union should also comply with it."
"It states that the implementation of any political programme is the sovereign responsibility of each State, acting in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms; moreover, the taking into account of, and full respect for, various religious and ethical values and the cultural heritage and philosophical beliefs of individuals and their communities should contribute to the full enjoyment by women of their human rights in order to achieve equality, development and peace."
"Finally, since we are concerned here with a revision, it has only been possible to adopt what was already in previous directives."
"However, a directive on the economic value of female work in the non-commercial and informal sector, or non-remunerated work of women in the area of social, inter-generational or professional solidarity would be useful."
"It has an economic value."
"I invite all fellow Members to familiarise themselves with the ideas of Nobel Prize-winner Gary Becker, whose studies have accurately assessed the economic value of women’s work in all its forms."
"This work is worth full reconsideration, evaluation and quantification in the interests of full economic equality between men and women."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Niebler, on the comprehensive and balanced text she has prepared."
"This compromise wording, with the amendments that have been made, represents an important and high-quality parliamentary contribution."
"Its main aim is the revision of the terms of the previous directives on equal pay, equal treatment in access to employment, training and promotion, working conditions, occupational social security systems and the prevention of harassment."
"This revision will enable us to present a single coherent wording, free of any contradictory definitions, to increase the transparency and clarity of the legislation on equality of treatment and to facilitate effective implementation by reinforcing the , avoiding any regression and incorporating all recent developments of European jurisprudence."
"By including also all the definitions of direct and indirect discrimination and of harassment, together with the principle of equality of pay and occupational pension arrangements, this text will provide the clarification and simplification that are essential to good implementation in the Member States and will ensure a high degree of legal certainty."
"However, I regret that, of the three main aims set out by the Commission – to simplify, modernise and improve Community legislation – the aim of effecting improvements has not resulted in any concrete proposals in the text."
"A vigorous policy on the protection of self-employed women, particularly in the areas of agriculture and crafts, on parental leave and on the reconciliation of professional and family life should have formed part of this objective, and I deplore its absence."
"I therefore ask the Commission to send a strong signal, firstly by urgently revising and improving Directive 86/613 on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in a self-employed activity, and, secondly, by re-examining Directive 96/34 on parental leave, in order to adapt it to the current situation through the introduction of incentives in the Member States, such as reasonable compensation and statistical recognition of the value of this unpaid work."
"Essential improvements have to be made to combat traditional segregation of roles within the family and to ensure a better balance of women and men in the labour market."
"In short, a better reconciliation of work and family life."
"Equality of treatment is an essential condition for achieving the goals of sustainable economic, social and environmental growth and development which form part of the relaunch of the Lisbon strategy."
"Europe must ensure minimum rights for all men and all women and must urgently ensure they are respected in the Member States."
"This aim requires us all – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – to show a strong political determination and intelligent cooperation in the service of our fellow citizens."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, addressing the issue of equality of pay has been one of our biggest equality-related problems for several decades now."
"Community legislation up till now has been unable to eliminate this area of inequality."
"Mere incentives and recommendations will not be enough to achieve equality of pay in the future either."
"It has to be made clear that unjustified differences in pay are unacceptable."
"We need stricter requirements, we need legal sanctions, and we need results."
"Member States should report how they implement the principle of equal treatment in practice."
"There is insufficient information on how it is implemented in law."
"We need to adopt proper procedures in the Member States."
"We were just saying that Turkey needs to implement legislation and that it is not enough merely to agree with just laws."
"In this respect, the EU and its current Member States could take a look in the mirror and implement the laws and regulations that we have adopted jointly."
"Instead of spurring on the social partners, the Member States should ensure that they implement and promote the principle of equal treatment, and thus do what EU treaties and legislation prescribe."
"If an employer flouts a regulation, he or she should have to answer for it."
"We parliamentarians want to improve current legislation, so that it might promote the equal treatment of women and men."
"Hopefully, we will reach consensus with the Commission and the Council regarding objectives."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has, in the past, been an unfailing beacon of equality for women."
"In the debate on Turkey, a lot was said about being a community of values, and about the value of equality in the European Union, one that I hope is not being eroded."
"We regard the inclusion of occupational pensions in this report as indispensable, knowing as we do that women suffer discrimination on the grounds of their gender, for the firm has no idea whether they or their male colleagues will live longer."
"Not only is discrimination in occupational pensions incompatible with Article 13 of the Treaty, but also with the principle of equality in the workplace."
"I therefore expect the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality as a whole to support this proposal, and hope that they will do so."
"I might add, moreover, that I think it improper of Mr Wuermeling and others in this House to make, in passing, sweepingly derogatory comments about the idea that the anti-discrimination directives should apply outside working life."
"I expect you, Commissioner Špidla, to reiterate your clear and explicit backing for the anti-discrimination directives, not only in respect of discrimination at work but also outside the workplace."
"Where women’s policy is concerned, one cannot say ‘stop’ one day and ‘go’ the next, but, rather, we must instead make it clear that it constitutes one of the values of the European Union."
"Equal opportunity policy is not something one can back out of."
"Mr President, the whole report concerns the very basis of all work on gender equality, namely the right and the opportunity to earn one’s own living."
"I wish especially to emphasise three parts of this directive."
"The first matter concerns equal pay for equal work."
"That is nothing new, but something also included in previous directives."
"The point is reinforced, however, in that the two sides of industry are called upon to take both the initiative and the responsibility in connection with the principle of equal pay."
"Despite the fact that we have had the directive on the principle of equal pay, there are still big differences in pay, meaning that discrimination still goes on."
"The second part to which I wish to draw attention is that concerning parental leave."
"Parenthood is no longer seen as an issue for just one of the sexes. Instead, parents are to be given the opportunity to share the responsibility for children."
"The third part I wish to highlight is that concerning equal treatment in matters of employment and occupation."
"We should be concerned here not only with equal treatment for women already established in the labour market but also with non-discrimination when it comes to recruitment and employment conditions."
"Mr President, this resolution was intended to increase equal opportunities and improve the situation of women in the job market."
"Many of the amendments will help change things for the better, but it would appear that if actual improvements are to be made, we must not only introduce legal standards, but above all change the way we think about women’s role in social and economic life."
"We must abandon liberal ideas, which are based on moral relativism, and move to an approach based on ethical and moral principles, which pay attention to the individual, whether female or male, and do not just see an item that may be used for profit."
"Weaker individuals, and especially women, are particularly vulnerable to the risks of a utilitarian approach, which involves corporations, concerns and commercial chains refusing to grant maternity leave or pay wages, and women being forced into humiliating jobs or services."
"Changes in the way we think must begin with education at school, at home, in the workplace and in all areas of life."
"Women are different in psychological and physical terms, and in our opinion should be prohibited from working in a number of jobs for their own protection."
"Women who fight for equal treatment often find themselves in unfavourable situations, competing and fighting with men instead of cooperating and sharing responsibilities in line with their predispositions."
"I believe that it is very unfair that the draft omits to mention the significant number of women who are either retired or not receiving a pension."
"This runs counter to the resolution’s declarations."
"Unless the aforesaid provisions are included, the directive under discussion will be yet another dead document."
"Mr President, this directive deals with the position of women in the labour market."
"It is therefore primarily addressed to women, and it is we women whose cause is yet again being advanced by the completion of the bonfire of red tape that we promised the public."
"I hope that we will vote as one tomorrow, and also that the reference to the anti-discrimination law was a bit of verbal skirmishing on Mr Wuermeling’s part."
"A national election is already underway and it has nothing to do with this directive."
"According to Article 119 of the Treaty, European law promises women equal rights, and they need to see these put into effect."
"Many women Members of this House have made reference to the areas in which they have not been, and to the need for awareness to be raised of the direct and indirect discrimination that goes on."
"Discrimination may well begin in people’s heads, but its removal requires that we change the rights, and laws and their transposition into national law will follow."
"There is a need for political will, and this Commission has demonstrated that it possesses it."
"This House is contributing its own."
"I hope that, tomorrow, we will be able to get what we want and send women in the EU the message that we are still the engine that moves women’s rights forward in Europe."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, problems relating to reconciling the work-life balance have become part of modern-day life."
"One of the reasons for women’s unequal status in the workplace is that employers are wary of conflicts of interest between work and family responsibilities."
"Even though women account for almost 44% of participants in the Czech labour market, the best-case scenario according to our research is that there are five times as many men as women in managerial positions."
"Women who are keen to move up the career ladder have to perform exceptionally well in order to be regarded as equal partners to men; in fact, they have to go to greater lengths to succeed than men doing the same job."
"The average wage for women in the Czech Republic is currently 19% lower than that for men."
"It is also a proven fact that women themselves often ask for lower wages in interviews than men applying for the same job, which in itself indicates women’s lack of self-confidence in employment relations."
"It therefore follows that the promotion of equal rights for women and men should not merely be a matter of adopting various directives and laws."
"I am all in favour of a directive, but it must be rooted in fundamental changes within European culture as a whole."
"Indeed, I would go so far as to say that its starting point must be the complete eradication of our medieval attitudes, and of the mistaken belief that equality between men and women is merely a problem for women, and that there is no such a thing as discrimination against men."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in the present situation, in which the European Union finds it difficult to speak its mind, or at least to do so in such a way that it is understood by the public, it is all the more important that the EU legislation and case law should become clearer and more readily comprehensible."
"That is why I welcome this proposal."
"When it comes, though, to the modernisation and improvement that are mentioned in this document, I regret to have to say that the method of recasting leaves no scope for changing or adding anything of any substance, such as equality in occupational pensions, for example."
"When we were preparing the last directive relating to Article 13, we were promised that this issue would be dealt with later on in the recast directive."
"Both the Commission and the Council are now opposed to this being done, and I find myself wondering why this opportunity has not been made use of."
"What was needed was for this point to be given greater emphasis, and I regret that this was not done."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my thanks for an extremely animated and focused debate."
"I should like to start by emphasising that an opportunity is available to us to adopt this crucial directive without delay."
"In the interests of Europe’s citizens, this opportunity must be seized."
"I would note that this is a key step forward that must be taken in order to promote equality between men and women in the eyes of all stakeholders, regardless of the different opinions held by the institutions on the thinking behind this revision."
"If I may, I should now like to explain the Commission’s position on the amendments in a little more detail."
"The Commission can readily accept a significant number of them, and indeed we believe that they are also consistent with the Council’s position as set out in its general approach of 7 December 2004."
"They go a long way towards improving Community legislation in this field and making it more accessible."
"A variety of tools are employed to this end, including technical measures, legal clarifications and provisions that will give fresh political impetus to the promotion of equality between men and women, for example with regard to equal pay."
"The Commission cannot accept a second set of amendments for purely technical reasons, and it will outline these reasons in detail in its amended proposal."
"In addition, it has rejected a certain number of amendments because they go beyond the scope of what can reasonably be achieved during this revision process."
"The specific aim of the latter is to facilitate the ongoing and parallel procedures of codifying Community legislation on the one hand, and laying the groundwork for fundamental changes on the other."
"The first of these amendments relates to the new Article 3(a), which would oblige Member States to implement positive action measures, instead of this being an option."
"Given that Article 141(4) of the Treaty, which is a source of primary law, clearly states that the Member States are competent to take whatever action they deem necessary in this field, any act of secondary law that cited this Article of the Treaty, while at the same time encroaching upon this competence, would in our opinion face major obstacles."
"Secondly, the Commission cannot agree to the obligation incumbent upon Member States to support certain measures in the framework of social dialogue being turned into an obligation to guarantee certain outcomes of this dialogue, in line with the amendments to Articles 24 and 27."
"It would be hard to square these amendments with the principle of social partners’ autonomy."
"I should also like to remind the House that corresponding provisions were included in Directive 2002/73/EC, following lengthy negotiations with Parliament and the Council."
"This Directive and the rules it lays down, which represent an innovative approach intended to increase the involvement of social partners, will not come into force until October 2005."
"As we see it, it would be inappropriate to amend these provisions before they have had a chance to prove their worth in practice."
"The new Article 28(b), which proposes a review clause for the Parental Leave Directive, is unacceptable because this Directive does not fall within the scope of the present revision."
"A clause to this effect would be difficult to reconcile with the relevant provisions in the Parental Leave Directive and with those in the European-level framework agreement between the social partners, upon which the Directive is based."
"What is more, problems would arise regarding the compatibility of this amendment with the autonomy of social partners and their role, as enshrined in Articles 138 and 139 of the Treaty."
"Finally, the Commission cannot accept the amendments to Article 8 that are aimed at prohibiting the use of gender as a factor when calculating insurance premiums and benefits for employee insurance schemes."
"These amendments also go beyond what is involved in drafting legislative proposals such as the directive under debate."
"That is not to say that this issue should not be a subject of political debate in the future."
"Even though opinions are divided on the matter, and the position currently held by the Council is quite clear, I am absolutely convinced that this is an important issue that requires our attention."
"Furthermore, the Commission does not of course believe that applying different schemes for second- and third-pillar pensions would give rise to ambiguity in the present context, as was also suggested during the debate."
"This is an entirely separate issue, and one that transcends purely technical considerations."
"In conclusion, I would note that the Commission can accept a number of amendments in full on the basis of these considerations, and, if I may, I will run through the amendments in question."
"The Commission can accept in full Amendments 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 64, 65, 66, 68, 69, 70, 74, 75, 77, 78, 79, 80, 82, 83, 85, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 96, 101, 106, 107, 108 and 109."
"The Commission can accept in part Amendments 5, 24, 71, 72, 73, 76, 84, 98, 102, 103, 104 and 105."
"The Commission cannot, however, accept Amendments 3, 12, 13, 29, 30, 36, 44, 46, 53, 63, 67, 81, 86, 94, 95, 97, 99 or 100."
"I have already set out the rationale behind the Commission’s position."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this leads me to put a question to you."
"In the proposal from the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, there are two essential elements – parental leave and occupational pensions – that actually constituted the core of the proposal, and you have rejected them."
"Your response to occupational pensions was along the lines of ‘yes, that is a very important issue, and we will take it up at some point’."
"It is my belief, Commissioner Špidla, that you promised us that at the time when we were working on the directive ..."
"I ask you, though, Mr President, to let me put the question."
"You described this as an important issue, and as one that would at some point be taken up."
"What I want to know is: when you will do that, and in what form will it be taken up?"
"What about your actual timetable?"
"I really would ask you to make a statement on the occupational pensions issue – as you have promised to do –, because it is in fact in breach of the Treaty, ..."
"I apologise, but that did not relate to the matter at hand."
"It concerned a completely different matter, but I will allow the question, and I would ask the Commissioner to take the floor."
". As I see it, it has emerged quite clearly from the debate that the aim behind this proposal for a directive is to make technical improvements to the EU legislation currently in force, and not to introduce extensive and far-reaching changes."
"It is for this reason that the Commission cannot accept the two key amendments to which Mrs Breyer referred, since that would clearly be at odds with the thinking behind the drafting of this directive."
"The two issues she mentioned are of such enormous importance that I will be dealing with them in the course of my work, although at this moment in time I cannot give the House any exact dates."
"What I can say, however, is that these are issues that we will debate in the very near future, and indeed I am quite sure that an opportunity to do so will present itself during next week’s debate on the Green Paper on demographic change."
"How we reach our conclusion is still an open question, however, and it would be inappropriate to go into any more detail on the matter."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A6-0211/2005) by Mrs Wallis, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (‘Rome II’) (COM(2003)0427 C5-0338/2003 2003/0168(COD))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you will know, the Commission has proposed a measure for the payment of damages, which aims to pursue three objectives."
"The first objective is that of predetermining the solutions and therefore of guaranteeing legal certainty to the citizens and to the economic operators that are victims of torts."
"The second objective is that of facilitating the resolution of disputes before the courts and encouraging mutual recognition of the decisions made by the judges."
"The third objective is, obviously, that of facilitating as far as possible the resolution of such disputes."
"In order to achieve these objectives we have proposed a general rule, that is to say, the rule of application of the place where the damage was caused, or rather the place of direct damage."
"We decided to adopt such an approach, because it is the most widespread solution in the Member States’ legal systems and, in our opinion, the solution that provides the best balance between the parties."
"The Commission proposal also included a number of special rules, such as liability for defective products or environmental damage."
"I believe that the general rule does not always allow an appropriate balance to be achieved in these particular issues, for which special provisions are needed."
"The measure provides for a certain degree of flexibility for judges, in order to allow them to take account of exceptional circumstances."
"Such flexibility, however, has to be limited, in order to avoid compromising the general objective, or rather legal certainty."
"In that regard, it is clear that allowing judges to exercise full discretion would make it difficult to predetermine the legal certainty that is one of the main objectives of this initiative, since economic operators and citizens wish to know in advance which law will apply to their situation."
"In the light of what has been said, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her high-quality report, the outcome of extremely in-depth consultations, and I should like to thank her for her determination to proceed swiftly, in order for the report to be approved before the summer."
"In my opinion, the only problematic aspect is an excessive margin of flexibility granted to judges in the amendments tabled by the rapporteur, allowing them to take account of special circumstances on a case-by-case basis."
"This excessive amount of discretion risks compromising strict legal certainty."
"We have difficulty, moreover, in accepting the amendments abolishing the special rules."
"I referred to product liability, which provides for the full protection of the consumer, or to environmental liability."
"In my opinion, scrapping those special rules would be dangerous."
"On the other hand, I fully agree with the solution reached by the rapporteur on sensitive issues, such as press defamation and the link between international private law and the internal market."
"They are two extremely delicate sectors and I believe that the compromise reached is satisfactory."
"Finally, with reference to traffic accidents, I should like to congratulate Mrs Wallis once again on having thoroughly studied this issue, which is of great practical importance for citizens."
"As the Commission, we agree with the intention to pursue an extremely in-depth analysis, for example in the framework of implementing Rome II."
". Mr President, I think this proposal is ground-breaking for Europe, ground-breaking for Parliament."
"We have had no previous coherent set of rules dealing with applicable law over such a vast arena of civil and commercial claims."
"We now have a potential roadmap for litigation and access to justice in the internal market, building on the structures of Brussels I in relation to the jurisdiction of our courts."
"For Parliament, this is the first time we have acted as a co-legislator in such an area of private international law."
"I am proud that via our committee we have raised the policy debate in a number of areas where we might not have been expected to tread."
"Let me touch on some of those debates."
"We have thought long and hard about the kind of general rule required, looking for the approach that can best deliver justice in our courts."
"It seems to be one, if I can put it this way, that gives a little subsidiarity to our judges."
"We start from the Commission’s clear rule but then give some room for manoeuvre, to deliver justice in the many and various situations that would doubtless arise in litigation."
"Here there is a clear message about the difficulty of characterising torts inherent in the method used by the Commission."
"Our approach avoids this difficulty, unless we can find good definitions."
"I would accept my Socialist colleague’s amendment on product liability on this basis."
"I think it is a good definition and rule and would add to the debate."
"On road traffic accidents and personal injuries in general, we have sent a clear message about the injustice of applying the damages regime of the country of the accident."
"If I may illustrate this, I have a constituent who had an accident in Spain."
"He has been offered GBP 4000 according to Spanish law."
"It would be GBP 43 000 according to English law and it is in England that he has to live out his life."
"This problem has to be addressed, if not here, then by further Commission study and proposal."
"On the use of foreign law, the success of Rome II will depend on good judicial cooperation, proper use and respect for one another’s laws."
"The record to date is patchy."
"Courts often avoid the application of foreign law."
"The court and parties should – or must – consider this issue, otherwise we are all wasting our time here."
"That is a matter that has to be closely monitored if we are to deliver a true area of civil and commercial justice."
"On defamation, where Parliament was expected to be active, I was grateful for the opinion of my colleagues in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"I personally share their view but have always felt that we would have to go further to respect the media’s concerns about freedom of expression."
"We now have a compromise which has wide support across the political groups and, more importantly, across publishing and the journalistic world."
"It is unclear whether it will work technically, but it gives the direction for new discussion in the Commission and the Council."
"It indicates what is acceptable in achieving a balance between freedom of expression and the rights of the victims of defamation."
"Finally to our old friend: the country-of-origin principle."
"I shall say it again: it is not a choice of law rule; it will not give you the answer to the question as to which law should be applied to a dispute between two civil parties."
"If it gives you an answer, it will probably not be the one that the supporters of the principle want."
"It is an important principle of Community law in the field of public or state regulatory law and should be given full weight as such."
"I believe we have done that in the solution we have put forward in the committee’s report."
"I hope that will survive intact after amendments from either side."
"I thank everyone in the Legal Affairs Committee and the LIBE Committee who have supported our work on this report and express my considerable gratitude to our secretariat on legal affairs who have helped us by carrying out extensive research and making efforts towards producing a report that I believe we can be proud of as a committee."
"Mr President, I should like to join the Commissioner in expressing my sincere thanks to Mrs Wallis for her extremely perceptive report, and for having brought about compromises on many difficult issues."
"Although this is a complex and technical regulation, it represents a very important stage in the establishment of a coherent European civil law system."
"The lack of such a system would make it a great deal more difficult for the common market to function, and even though the latter is sometimes criticised, it forms the basis of European integration."
"It is for this reason that all the comments submitted by both the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and, above all, the Committee on Legal Affairs, are absolutely key."
"Given the short timeframe, and above all in view of its competences, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs concentrated primarily on Article 6 of the regulation, which indicates the law applicable in situations where a person’s honour and reputation are violated, or where a person or company is defamed by media publications."
"It also outlines the application of this law in the event of possible legal disputes."
"In the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, for which I acted as draftsman, the European Union must guarantee its citizens a high level of legal security."
"In the event that a publication violates a person’s honour and reputation, it is therefore key that this person’s subjective rights should be protected above all else, and that this should take place in the country where the offence has been committed."
"Our basis for these considerations was the fact that there is no current threat to media freedom in Europe, since the latter is protected both by the constitutions of the Member States and by European courts."
"Furthermore, a compromise reached in the Committee on Legal Affairs meant that an amendment has been tabled that takes into account the position of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the one hand, and, on the other hand, establishes such a precise legal framework that European publishers should be able to rest content."
"I support these amendments, since this solution, especially in the context of the Brussels 1 Regulation, grants legal protection to publishers, as well as providing a guarantee that the rights of victims will be enforced."
". Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for the way she has handled this difficult material, which eventually boiled down to only a few aspects, but these were fought over with particular vigour."
"Rather than specifically addressing these, I would like to consider, in the light of what has been said over the last few weeks, two ways in which this legislation brings us forward both in practical terms and in principle."
"One of them has already had light shed on it in this debate: the familiar case of the road traffic accident, which needs to be properly taken forward and resolved."
"It is, I believe, in this instance, that one is most likely, and most frequently, to see the citizens, in the most literal sense of the word, ‘collide with’ Europe, and afterwards ask themselves where their rights begin and end."
"The second, that of the law relating to the press, is about fundamental principles."
"Over recent weeks, we have seen the fourth estate, which keeps a close watch on how the first three work together, and which is, in some sense, the public’s primary lobby, itself becoming a lobby."
"The case of Princess Caroline of Monaco might lead one to believe that this is of relevance only to people who are rich, beautiful, famous, important or noble, but it can, by its very nature, also affect ordinary people, in ways we have not seen since the lost honour of Katharina Blum."
"A new Europe-wide understanding of fundamental rights is dawning, and, as we have to accept the possibility of it putting free expression of opinion and rights relating to the personality on a collision course, it is a good thing that we are now endeavouring to draw a dividing line that will work in practice, while also incorporating a review clause in the regulation."
"Just one final point, quite unspectacular, but important: Mrs Wallis proposed a new option to take account of the way in which the law develops ..."
". I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, and I would like to draw attention to only one or two items."
"It is my opinion that coherent, unified European regulations in private international law relating to civil and commercial non-contractual obligations are a significant step for the continued development of the area of freedom, security and justice in terms of cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs."
"We can see that economic mobility and citizens’ mobility have increased with internal market integration, and consequently issues relating to compensation obligations in this area have become an everyday occurrence, and may in fact include a number of international components."
"Consolidating the legal provisions applicable in such cases at European level is a matter of urgency for a variety of reasons, and I think that this regulation answers this need."
"This is a matter of utmost importance from the point of view of businesses, as uniform legislation guarantees them legal certainty, predictability and consistency."
"It is advantageous for citizens, consumers, and potential injured parties and victims too, as it lays down provisions that serve to protect them, and makes relevant legislation more transparent."
"All of this will help to bring the European Union closer to its citizens through the legislative process too."
"A particular merit of the draft provisions is that they take into account, and at the same time facilitate, the work of the European Court in interpreting the law."
"I would like to draw particular attention to the broad spectrum covered by the provisions of the draft regulation, ranging from damages sustained by consumers and product liability, to traffic accidents and environmental damage, and defamation."
"Consolidation of European law on liability for international environmental disasters is an aspect that I, as a Hungarian Member of the European Parliament, consider particularly important."
"Let me remind you of the cyanide contamination of the river Tisza by Romania a few years ago, and of the Rosia Montana (Verespatak) project."
"I repeat: this regulation is a major step forward in terms of legal certainty, predictability and transparency."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Commission and Mrs Wallis for the excellent work carried out, which has produced a useful legislative text."
"We are, however, very perplexed by one of the points in the text, about which we hope to succeed in persuading Mrs Wallis to change her mind."
"The point relates to Article 7 on specific legislation on violations of the environment."
"We do not consider that that specific rule should be abolished and we indeed believe that, in the overall economy of Mrs Wallis’s report, abolishing it would deprive the Commission’s proposal of an important element."
"As far as violations of the environment are concerned, I believe that at European level, as well as in many Member States, the law is very weak and there is no legal certainty, and therefore depriving victims of this option offers no advantage whatsoever."
"My group has decided to abstain in the event that this aspect of Mrs Wallis’s report is adopted."
"We hope, however, to succeed in persuading Mrs Wallis to abandon this amendment before tomorrow."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be very brief."
"I should like to once again thank the rapporteur and all of the Members who have spoken."
"I should just like to mention a point that has already been discussed."
"Firstly, as I said before, the Commission also believes that the special sectors, such as the protection of the environment, deserve to be treated differently, and therefore I take the liberty of drawing the rapporteur’s attention to that matter."
"As regards press defamation, I confirm my appreciation of the compromise that the rapporteur proposed to the Commission and which the Commission accepted."
"As regards the amendments tabled after the vote by the Committee on Legal Affairs, I believe that they run the risk of in fact reproducing a mere variant of the country of origin principle, that is, a variant of a principle which, in my opinion, we cannot lay down and decree in this House."
"To conclude, in confirming my appreciation of the first compromise reached and voted on by the Committee on Legal Affairs, I must, however, admit to having some doubts about the second proposed change, that is, Amendments 56 and 57."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"– With regard to the report by Mrs Wallis (A6-0211/2005) on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II) I should like to say, if I may, that, in order to ensure freedom of expression, together with a legal framework for protecting privacy and legal certainty for journalists and the media in the European Union, I voted:"
"a) in favour of Amendments 57 to Article 6 and 56 to Recital 12, and"
"b) against Amendment 10 to Recital 12(a) and Amendment 54 to Recital 26(a), both from paragraph 3."
"The next item is the Commission statement on ‘no-fly lists’/passenger name records."
". Mr President, as you know, with regard to the well-known incident with a KLM flight, the United States authorities indicated that the flight was prevented from entering US airspace after two passengers were identified from advance passenger information – API data."
"API data is essentially passport and ticket information collected at check-in to speed up immigration controls at the destination."
"The transfer of API data by airlines prior to arrival at the point of destination constitutes normal airline practice."
"According to the information available to the Commission, air carriers only send API information to border control authorities."
"That information is not retrieved by the US authorities from computer reservation systems."
"The Commission also wishes to clarify once again that the passengers concerned could not be identified on the basis of passenger name record – PNR – data."
"That instrument does not cover flights overflying the United States, but only flights from and to the United States."
"As such, it is not relevant with regard to cases such as the KLM incident."
"In the Commission’s view, the use of API data by the United States authorities does not seem to constitute a circumvention of the PNR agreement."
"The Commission will be particularly attentive to any circumvention of the agreement and will raise this issue in the framework of the joint review."
"The Commission wishes to underline that there is no current requirement for air carriers to provide the US with API data on passengers for over-flights."
"The no-fly list is drawn up by the US authorities and contains the names of people they do not wish to fly into the US on the basis of US intelligence and risk-threat assessment criteria."
"It is produced by the United States and that country alone is responsible for it."
"The European Union has a rigorous policy on aviation security, but that does not include a no-fly list."
"In the Commission’s view, a no-fly list does not mean that the people included are necessarily suspected of any wrongdoing."
"The United States simply decided that it does not want them to enter the country for various reasons, based on a number of rather general criteria."
"It is, of course, very annoying for somebody to be denied access to the United States because his or her name is on the no-fly list."
"In this regard, the Commission will seek clarification of the US no-fly list in its talks with the United States."
"For example, the early and effective forwarding to airlines of an up-to-date no-fly list is an essential aspect."
"The Commission is, therefore, seeking to better clarify these criteria with the American authorities, in order to prevent future cases of false positives."
"Since the start of the US-EU talks in March 2003, the Commission has been able to secure from the United States the undertaking that the American Congress would require the appointment of a chief privacy officer within the Department of Homeland Security who has to report annually to Congress and whose findings are binding on the department."
"The chief privacy officer has agreed to receive and handle in an expedited manner cases lodged by data protection authorities in the European Union on behalf of citizens who consider that their complaints have not been satisfactorily addressed by the Department of Homeland Security."
"So the EU citizen has stronger assurance of fair treatment."
"As regards the joint review of the United States Undertakings, the latter provide for a joint review of their implementation, to be conducted by the United States authorities and the Commission, the latter assisted by representatives of European law enforcement authorities and data protection supervisors."
"The joint review will take place after the summer break, presumably in September."
"The review aims to provide a clear picture of the way the Undertakings function."
"It is the Commission’s intention to inform this Parliament of the outcome of this joint review and any important developments."
"Finally, national data protection authorities will be part of the Commission-led team conducting the joint review."
"This should allow the national data protection authorities, the so-called Article 29 Working Party, to assess fully the implementation of the Undertakings."
"I am pleased to tell you that despite differences in view of the United States PNR package, there is excellent cooperation on the implementation of this package between the Article 29 Working Party and the Commission, and this cooperation will continue."
". Mr President, let me say, on behalf of my group, that the Commissioner’s elucidations of this question were very persuasive."
"Let it be said that our desire for a joint evaluation of the agreements relating to PNR data is something to be welcomed."
"We find ourselves in the difficult position of having to hold in a balance the interest not only of every single one of the EU’s Member States but also of the USA in being protected against terrorist acts, as against the need to protect individual citizens’ personal data."
"The process is a difficult one."
"I hope that the Americans will actually deliver on the promises they have made to us that the data we supply to them will be collected and evaluated only for the purposes of protection against terrorism, that they will destroy them when they are no longer required, as they have promised to do, and that we will keep each other informed about problems relating to internal security."
"I think there is a good chance of the agreement between the European Union and the USA producing a result that will not only comply with our provisions on data protection but also give us all less cause to fear terrorist attacks."
"Let us also, though, look to the future; one thing I regard as important, and of which we must keep on reminding the Americans, is that we have no liking for unilateral security rules, for we want to protect our citizens just as much as the Americans want to protect their own."
"For that reason, Commissioner, I believe that the right approach is for us, jointly with the Americans, to assess the risks to our passengers and share the results that emerge from that, thereby, and together, making the public safer."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, we are grateful to you, Commissioner, for this clarification."
"However, there is no escaping the conclusion that the US is trying to impose an increasing number of security constraints on Europe, and we are still not reassured."
"That is why we oppose the agreement on the transfer of passenger data by airlines to the US authorities."
"The fight against terrorism must preserve a balance between security and individual freedom."
"The agreements concerned are disproportionate in relation to their aims."
"We cannot automatically treat citizens as if they were all terrorists."
"This is why an agreement with the US will only be acceptable if we put an end to the systematic transfer of personal data on all passengers."
"As you have pointed out, Commissioner, a KLM aircraft en route to Mexico was recently turned back at the request of the US."
"That incident once again showed that the rights of European citizens are being flouted."
"How could the US authorities have obtained data on the passengers on that flight when it was not even en route to America?"
"Were data on the passengers transferred and, if so, by what right?"
"What specific measures can the Commission take to put a stop, once and for all, to these practices which are a breach of Community law, in particular the Directive on Data Protection?"
"You told us that you had received an undertaking."
"How can we check that it is complied with?"
"Can the Commission assure us that the US authorities do not have unlimited access to the airlines’ reservation systems?"
"It is vital that, in response to that repressive view of the fight against terrorism, Europe can hold up its own vision."
"We acknowledge that to combat terrorism and organised crime effectively requires stronger crossborder cooperation, but the European Union’s anti-terrorist policy must be developed with absolute respect for the rights of citizens, particularly their right to move freely and their right to have their privacy protected."
". Mr President, Commissioner, this is not the first time that we meet in this House late at night to discuss issues of passenger data."
"Commissioner, you mentioned the case of KLM and you reassured us that the way in which the US obtained the data was perfectly legitimate."
"However, like Mrs Roure, I, quite frankly, am not reassured because we never got a clear answer."
"In this case, the US acquired the ‘APIS’ data, which they apparently got from Mexico."
"Where did Mexico get the data?"
"Was it allowed to transfer the data to the United States?"
"Does such an agreement also apply to flights through US airspace?"
"We would like a precise answer, not general reassurances."
"We were in the United States last week, discussing this issue."
"I have the feeling that the United States might be accessing the databases directly on the basis of the PNR Agreement."
"Secondly, I would like to know about the US administration’s no-fly lists."
"You say that the people on those lists are not necessarily dangerous, but I still find it remarkable that the US administration considers them to be dangerous enough to deny them access to US airspace and send them back to the European Union without notifying the EU authorities; it only notifies the airlines."
"They are apparently considered to be dangerous in the United States but not in Europe."
"As regards the annual joint review, you said that you will review issues of protection of privacy."
"I hope that you will also include the effectiveness of the measures in that review."
"The word ‘security’ has been mentioned here a number of times, but I would like to know how many crooks have been caught, how many attacks have been prevented and how many mistakes – false positives – there have been."
"The joint review was supposed to take place in May. It has now been postponed until September."
"I understand that is because the US was unable or unwilling to provide us with the data requested."
"Could the Commissioner shed some light on that?"
"– Mr President, I shall speak in Greek."
"Either I shall speak very, very quickly and no one will translate, or I shall speak very quickly or I shall speak more slowly."
"I ask for your forbearance."
"How many 'no-fly' passenger lists are there today in America and how is erroneous reconnaissance avoided?"
"How many names are added to these lists and how?"
"With what objectives and how is the temptation to use them for other purposes avoided?"
"How safe are the names and details from unauthorised use and access?"
"How effective, ultimately, are the lists in identifying terrorists, when we know that the names of possible terrorists are not put on the lists, so that the airlines do not know and so that it does not leak out that they are being watched?"
"Finally, how can people inspect and correct their details?"
"These are not my questions."
"The US Congress itself has put them to the US administration."
"They may be difficult questions for American citizens, but they are doubly difficult when European citizens are involved."
"The Commission needs to cooperate with the United States here and try to jointly formulate policies relating to us."
"Commissioner, in March 2005, the Congressional Research Service issued a report on precisely this subject."
"It states that the ΡΝR details of European passengers will be used on the Secure Flight Programme, which relates solely to domestic and not to international flights, contrary to what you said."
"If you wish, I can give you the page and the details."
"To close, there are three major dangers now: the citizens are not controlling the authorities; it is the authorities that are controlling and monitoring the citizens."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too will be extremely quick, but I believe that some consideration should be given to specific points."
"During the talks with the United States, the Commission intends to call for clarity, in order to prevent the adoption of unilateral measures that may affect the interests of European citizens, and to demand that such measures are agreed on with the European institutions."
"I refer in particular to the so-called no-fly list."
"We believe that it is an important first step, since the no-fly list is currently the sole responsibility of the United States only in relation to flights over US territory."
"As regards flights from or to Europe, we will ask the airlines to give us advance notice, so as to avoid the mistake made in the past of listing people with the same name on the no-fly list, prompting the grounding of an aircraft simply because of confused identity."
"With advance notice from the airlines on the data included in the no-fly list, those mistakes could be avoided."
"As regards the issue of secure flights mentioned by Mr Lambrinidis, we have already conducted an in-depth discussion with the US authorities on aviation security."
"It is with a great deal of satisfaction that I can tell you that the US authorities have recently given their consent for US airlines to exclude citizens of European birth from the planning of secure flights."
"In other words, they undertake not to include data on European citizens in the trials concerning internal flights with the United States."
"It is a guarantee that we have been given, on which we nonetheless intend to continue our talks."
"We were unable to hold this meeting earlier for reasons of a technical nature."
"A video conference was, however, held a few weeks ago, and the dialogue will continue during the September meeting that I announced previously."
"For my part, I will be absolutely clear in demanding full respect for the protection of EU citizens’ personal data."
"I have already clearly stated this to Secretary Chertoff, on the occasion of our meeting held in Sheffield a few days ago, and I will continue to do so."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the political situation and the independence of the media in Belarus."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking those of you who asked for an exchange of views with us on Belarus."
"It is the third exchange of views on Belarus since I became a Commissioner."
"It is very important, because I share your concerns."
"I firmly believe that strengthening democracy and supporting independent information sources in Belarus are of the utmost importance, especially in view of the forthcoming presidential elections."
"The European Commission has a strong interest in Belarus being a democratic and stable neighbour and hopefully, in the future, being able to benefit fully from the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"Recent developments in Belarus, however, have moved the country’s political system further away from a European democratic system and norms and values, preventing the country from taking its rightful place in the family of European nations."
"After the parliamentary elections and the referendum in Belarus last year, which fell significantly short of international standards for democratic elections, in November 2004 the Council of the European Union confirmed the restrictions on ministerial-level contacts with the Belarusian authorities."
"At the same time, the European Union sent a very clear message to the population to tell them that we had not forgotten them and that we wanted to enhance contacts with civil society."
"The European Union has consistently condemned the arrests and politically motivated trials of potential opponents to President Lukashenko."
"We have called for respect for the rule of law and the immediate release of these people."
"We see these actions by the regime as attempts to eliminate opposition leaders, especially in the run-up to the presidential elections in 2006."
"The growing repression of political parties, non-governmental organisations and independent media outlets is of serious concern to us."
"We are also closely monitoring the human rights situation in Belarus."
"As a clear signal that the European Union cannot accept violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, last year we imposed a visa ban on certain high-ranking Belarusian officials on the basis of Council of Europe findings."
"There was the Pourgourides report on politically motivated disappearances."
"We then extended this visa ban to cover the officials considered responsible for rigged elections and also the rigged referendum, as well as those responsible for the repression of peaceful demonstrations."
"Our grave concerns about the observance of trade union rights in Belarus have led to an investigation into alleged violations of freedom of association and also the right to collective bargaining, as defined in the ILO Conventions, especially within the framework of the GSP, the Generalised System of Preferences."
"The investigation might ultimately result in the withdrawal of Belarus’s access to the benefits of the GSP."
"Against the background of the worsening political situation in Belarus, the European Union remains very committed to assisting civil society and the people of Belarus."
"Here it must be said that the Commission is a major donor to Belarus and in the past few months we have also streamlined our assistance to the country."
"A workshop was organised in Vilnius specifically to coordinate our assistance."
"This was very important, as it gave us the chance to intensify our coordination, not just amongst the Member States but also with countries like the United States of America and Canada."
"We have two objectives."
"One is to assist and support human rights, democratisation, civil society and democratic forces in the strict sense of the word."
"We pay special attention to support for the media, non-governmental organisations, the strengthening of democratic institutions and the rule of law."
"This is being done through the EIDHR – the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights – and the decentralised cooperation instrument."
"Two calls for tender were launched there in March and the project selection has already been completed."
"Contracting will probably take place over the summer, so that the activities can start before the end of the year."
"There are 10 to 12 projects relating to education and advocacy NGOs giving legal advice to people who have human rights problems."
"I hope that the results will be excellent."
"The second objective is to support the broader needs of the population in related areas."
"By broader needs, I mean the TACIS programme that focuses on support for the population itself in different sectors, including good governance, sustainable development, the social sector, education, health, the environment and economic development, and also alleviation of the problems caused by the Chernobyl catastrophe, which figures prominently on our assistance programme."
"The idea of supporting independent radio broadcasting to Belarus has been suggested as an effective and useful response to the lack of alternative and independent information in Belarus."
"We have studied the possibilities carefully and will see how that can be managed."
"Under our current financial regulations it is not easy to find the right solution immediately."
"However, I can tell you that, as regards the difficulties journalists are facing in Belarus, we have a key programme for training journalists and we have already been able to do a lot."
"We have provided support for the Belarusian Association of Journalists, for which it is very grateful."
"For instance, we gave it our backing as the winner of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 2004."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this is in fact Parliament’s fourth resolution on Belarus."
"It is, however, the first to result from a deep sense of disillusionment with the Commission’s attitude."
"From Parliament’s point of view, the Council is an ally, and the Commission is the enemy, at least as far as a review of current policy on Belarus is concerned."
"The Council understands what is needed, whereas the Commission has no understanding whatsoever of how the existing instruments should be modified in order to support civil society and the process of democratic transformation in Belarus."
"The message sent out by Javier Solana during his meeting with Condoleezza Rice in Vilnius on the democratic opposition in Belarus is important in political terms."
"At the same time, however, the Commission has fallen into a peculiar kind of vicious circle."
"It believes that change can be brought about in Belarus using existing political mechanisms and instruments."
"This is not the case."
"Change cannot be brought about in this way because these instruments are designed for democratic countries, or countries where the process of democratic transformation has already begun."
"It would be impossible to promote the start of democratic transformations in any country in the world by means of the instruments to which the Commissioner refers."
"If we were to try to do so, we would risk sacrificing the European Union’s political credibility, as well as running the risk that political declarations would in future no longer be followed by actions."
"While all this is going on, presidential elections will take place in Belarus shortly, or in other words next year."
"We need to help the Belarussians make their choice."
"It is therefore enormously important that they are provided with reliable and independent information, mainly via radio stations."
"I would note that projects have been launched in Poland and Lithuania to establish independent radio stations."
"These projects were initially in competition with each other, but are now working together."
"It is for this reason that the resolution refers to a network of radio stations for Belarus."
"The national governments have already lent their backing to these projects."
"They should also have the backing of the European Union, however, and current attitudes must change."
"The Commission has been considering the possibility of such backing for eight months already, and this cannot go on."
"This motion for a resolution is concerned with precisely this problem."
"Mr President, what we are doing today amounts to nothing less than describing what could be termed the stagnation of a crisis."
"News of this crisis has reached us, and we have all seen the pictures of demonstrations, victims and people who have been beaten up."
"These people later go to prison, and we send protests and wait for the next pictures to appear on television."
"What all this means is that we are in fact incapable of doing much at all."
"We cannot do much, and we should at least have the honesty to admit that to ourselves."
"Today’s debate on the media deals with only one small aspect of the harsh reality that prevails in all areas of life in Belarus."
"On behalf of my group, I should like to call most emphatically on the Commission to take the compromise resolution which has been drafted, and which will be tabled tomorrow, as an inspiration for its actions."
"There is one additional point we should not forget."
"Despite the fact that it is so late, and that we have such a small audience, we should be honest with ourselves and admit that the European Union, by which I mean all of us in this Chamber and the Member States, will be powerless and helpless until we hold talks with Russia on the issue of Belarus."
"We hold talks with Russia on various matters, the most popular of which are gas and various profitable interests, but we have not asked Russia for its real opinion on the situation in Belarus."
"It is very convenient for Russia and for President Putin for there to be a country that they can look down on in that part of Europe, and for there to be a regime that can be seen as the black sheep of Europe."
"Lukashenko and his exploits are tolerated and subsidised by means of cheap gas and oil, and the European Union agrees to it."
"We should at least admit to ourselves that the Lukashenko regime is convenient for Russia, and that we agree to this."
"Khodorkovsky’s imprisonment pales into insignificance in the face of what is happening in Belarus."
"We tear our hair out and protest about Khodorkovsky, but precious little is said about Lukashenko’s anonymous victims."
"Unless we take concrete steps to strengthen civil society, these people will lose their most important asset, which is hope."
"That really would be the end."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you gave a very lively description of the current situation in Belarus."
"Things are heading in the wrong direction there, and it is of course all the more depressing because, particularly in other countries of the former Soviet Union, there is a mood of renewal which we do not see at all in Belarus."
"You mention a long list of programmes that are under way."
"I believe, however, that Mr Klich was quite correct in saying that many of the EU programmes are intended for neighbouring countries with some form of democratic structure."
"It is different when we are dealing with a dictatorship, as in the case of Belarus."
"Other instruments are needed for that country."
"As is well known, Tacis has many resources for solving environmental problems and resolving issues of border surveillance."
"How do we know, however, whether President Lukashenko’s management of these resources is in the EU’s interests?"
"I therefore think that the proposal contained in the resolution on which we are to vote tomorrow is perfectly correct."
"It is a document that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe can support fully and unreservedly."
"It is important for us to support the right to free opinion-forming in Belarus, and we have an obligation, pure and simple, to get down to some of these projects which, from a financial point of view, will be extremely modest but which will mean an incredible amount for the morale of those in Belarus who are fighting for democracy."
"They need to hear and understand that there are people who are aware of their situation, who are behind them and who will support them wholeheartedly."
"In fighting, they are putting themselves on the line and are in great danger of their own lives."
"We must support them from outside."
"We have a responsibility, and I think you should explain to us how, in practical terms, you will go about matters."
"Mr President, in recent weeks the Lukashenko regime has made yet another addition to its list of dubious practices."
"It has started playing the nationalist card against the Polish community in Belarus, even though the latter has lived in the country since time immemorial."
"The Union of Poles in Belarus has been persecuted ever since a new democratic leadership was elected, despite the fact that the organisation stays well out of domestic politics in Belarus."
"The Polish-language newspaper was closed down, and the state-run media use official propaganda to portray Poles as agents of foreign powers, financed by NATO and the CIA, who are virtually preparing a bloody revolt against the Belarussian state."
"EU policy must provide a response to such goings-on."
"In my opinion, it would be worth thinking about an increased level of solidarity between countries at intergovernmental level, as well as solidarity in terms of EU and transatlantic policies."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, policies must be targeted at implementing very specific projects, such as support for independent media."
"Commissioner, there is one issue I should like to highlight in particular at this point."
"There can be no question that this House will have no understanding for any passivity and sluggishness by the Commission during this parliamentary term."
"If you continue to act as you have done in the past, you will do nothing but create further areas of conflict between Parliament and the Commission."
"You leave us no other choice, Commissioner."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Lukashenko, the dictator of Belarus, is successfully creating a totalitarian regime, learning from the classics of Soviet totalitarian communism and praising them; this time he is not using the dictatorship of the proletariat and communist ideology as a mask but is methodically destroying the civil and political liberties of the people of Belarus, and destroying the right to freedom of speech and truthful information."
"The people of Belarus receive minutely detailed reports of the dictator’s heroic deeds from the enslaved media."
"Songs of joy come from the radio and a propaganda machine worthy of Goebbels is crippling the confidence of society."
"The need for democratic freedoms is being destroyed, hopelessness is degrading people’s dreams and belief in their own strengths."
"How can this process of mankurtism be halted?"
"How can we preserve those shoots of civil society that still remain intact?"
"How can we create anew an internal demand for honest and truthful information?"
"We can do this if the European Union fulfils its own rights and obligations."
"By fulfilling the right and obligation to create a free information space with budgetary funds that have already been voted this year."
"I call on the European Commission to stop playing at its exaggerated diplomacy and to carry out its obligations."
"The launch of independent radio broadcasts currently depends purely on the goodwill of the European Commission."
"Financial, technical and organisational issues can be resolved during the course of this year."
"Professional journalists are standing by at this moment to create objective content."
"This work would be an even greater honour to them than the Sakharov prize presented by the European Parliament last year."
"I call on you to support this resolution."
"Support it and carry it out, so that Belarus does not become a totalitarian state."
"Mr President, the Commissioner does not need any of us to tell her what is going on in Belarus."
"At the same time, I believe that you are on our side, Commissioner."
"However, please let us get things going."
"That is the plea that we are all jointly making."
"Rules are a means to an end, not an end in themselves."
"We cannot tell the people in Belarus that we cannot help them at the moment because we have to comply with difficult rules."
"Let us change the rules."
"One of the major players in making the rules and ensuring their observance is Parliament."
"Let us see what we can do."
"We would all like to establish concrete commitments with regard to the radio station project, direct assistance for the families of victims of the regime – they are in dire straits – and thirdly and most importantly, a concrete, realistic timetable."
"I understand what you mean when you refer to a timetable which will begin, hopefully, after the summer and continue for the foreseeable future, but we should have a concrete timetable of specific events over the next 12 months."
"The European Humanities University which was closed in Minsk a year ago was recently reborn in Vilnius."
"Historically, the universities of Europe were the forerunners of the European Union."
"The true roots of the European Union are in the universities, while the universities are founded on freedom of thought."
"This is why we welcome the revival of the European Humanities University in the resolution that we are presenting to the Parliament on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations. We also derive joy from the efforts of the Republic of Lithuania, which are aimed at spreading democracy, freedom of thought and human rights through education, by preparing a trained generation for a new country, one which is a neighbour of the European Union, but still in the grip of a dictatorship."
"Therefore, we address the European Commission, the Member States of the European Union and urge you to follow the example of donors in Europe and the United States of America and to support this university in every possible way."
"We are sure that this is how we will really broaden the realm of freedom, in which a nation's freedom, solidarity and cooperation serves a person's dignity our own dignity."
"Mr President, I have a long-standing interest in Belarus and I have never advocated completely cutting off contact with the Belarus authorities in areas of mutual concern such as people trafficking and trade matters."
"It is also true that current EU policies have not paid any dividends."
"The regime of President Lukashenko has retreated into a siege mentality, in which increasing paranoia about the intentions of the EU, the USA, and even Russia at times has resulted in mounting repression and authoritarian responses."
"Democracy has been effectively terminated, with sham elections and an end to limits on the president’s term of office, although CIS observers would claim otherwise."
"Human rights are trampled on, with unexplained disappearances of opposition figures."
"The judiciary is far from independent and does not question the campaign of Deputy Attorney General Paval Radzivonaw as the principal architect of the crackdown on newspapers such as and ."
"The criminal conviction of opposition figures such as Mikhail Marinich is further evidence of this."
"Press freedom is virtually non-existent now, with newspapers being suspended and journalists, including foreign correspondents, harassed or fined."
"Theoretically, Belarusians can even be sent to labour camps for daring to criticise the president."
"One journalist, Veronika Cherkasova, was mysteriously murdered last year."
"In terms of media freedom, Belarus is now on a par with some of the world’s pariah regimes, such as Cuba, Burma, North Korea and Iran."
"The EU and the USA stand together in condemning this brutal regime and imposing smart sanctions on officials of the regime."
"I strongly support independent radio broadcasting into Belarus from the EU and also financial assistance for Belarus journalists and for civil society."
"I hope that that ghastly regime’s days are numbered and that it will soon be off the map of Europe."
". Mr President, I think in fact we have no difference."
"It is a regime where freedom is being trodden on, so we have to do something, which I have explained three times already."
"It was the Commission that agreed to go to Lithuania with a few Member States to work together and find the right strategies."
"The right strategies are there, the problem is our financial regulations."
"These financial regulations were introduced because Parliament asked for them in the past."
"Why?"
"Because there have been irregularities, but we are now very constrained."
"It is very difficult for me to go against the financial rules, which is why it takes a lot of time."
"I cannot just go and give money to any NGOs."
"This has to be done according to the rules, and the rules are very difficult and strict."
"If we want to change the rules – and I would not mind starting to simplify them – then frankly I need Parliament’s support, otherwise I cannot do anything."
"I do not wish to be accused of irregularities, as colleagues have been in the past."
"I am always flexible and open."
"I will look into the matter, but it takes a long time."
"It can take months to get things in place, but we will go in the right direction."
"I do not think it is correct to say that the Council has different ideas."
"The Council came after us."
"We started to work with a few Member States and with many NGOs, but the Council is not responsible for implementation."
"Implementation has to be done by us, according to the Financial Perspective and rules and according to our constraints."
"This is the real crux of the problem."
"You should know this; therefore I clearly and openly say so."
"It is also untrue to say that we are not communicating with Russia on this issue."
"Of course we are."
"The reality, however, is that Russia has not changed anything up to the present time and it seems to be difficult for it to do so."
"But I completely agree – and we agreed at the seminar – that we should make moves towards the media and make direct contact with the society there; we should train journalists."
"We should also work via Ukraine."
"We have been working with our Polish and Lithuanian friends, and we will also work a lot with Ukrainians, as they have better access than us."
"It is true that Lukashenko is now imposing stricter measures because he is fearful that movements could start similar to those in Ukraine, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan."
"This is the reality of the situation but I cannot give you any more information at this stage."
"We are working on the implementation but unfortunately it takes more time than I would wish."
"In my former role as Austrian Foreign Minister, I gave an instruction and the instruction was followed and perhaps within the next few months it was implemented."
"In the Commission, it is more complex."
"We have to be very careful to ensure against any irregularities."
"But I am ready, if you are, to look into this situation."
"I have received six motions for resolutions(1) tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the oral question (B6-0329/2005) to the Commission by Mr Barón Crespo, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on rules of origin in preferential trade arrangements (COM(2005)0100 final)."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my capacity as chairman of the Committee on International Trade, I would like to begin by welcoming Commissioner Kovács and tell him that we would be delighted to receive him in the Committee on International Trade to hold a first debate on the issues we are dealing with together."
"I am saying this to him directly in this very intimate atmosphere so late at night."
"I would like to express my satisfaction and that of my Committee with the approval of the GSP Regulation in April, although it is regrettable that it was not adopted on the scheduled date so that it could benefit the countries affected by the tsunami."
"And, with regard to rules of origin, although it is true that Parliament does not have powers of codecision or consultation in relation to the Regulation implementing the Customs Code, pursuant to the Council Decision of 1999, laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission, we have the right to be informed regularly about the procedures carried out by means of comitology."
"This would mean that, as in the case of the Trade Directorate-General, from which we regularly receive documents from Committee 133, the Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union will send our committees the drafts of implementation measures, as well as the results of votes and the minutes of meetings."
"This is in accordance with our competences laid down in the Rules of Procedure, which do not relate strictly to commercial issues, but also to economic and commercial relations with third countries."
"We are therefore keen and prepared, Commissioner, to consult our respective agendas with a view to establishing sensible relations with you involving dialogue, debate and control."
"With regard to the proposed reform, we believe that the range of issues raised from the point of view of simplification, flexibility and control are important;"
"I shall comment on them very briefly."
"With regard to simplification, we believe the elimination of a long list of conditions imposed upon exporters and the extension of the certificate of origin solely on the basis of the added value criterion to be positive."
"With regard to this point, we would like to receive the impact studies or simulations that have been carried out demonstrating the economic repercussions of the establishment of added value thresholds on commercial exchanges and beneficiary countries as soon as possible."
"With regard to increasing flexibility, we believe that to allow regional cumulation amongst countries of the same region will promote economic integration amongst them, which is consistent with our fundamental philosophy and also may have beneficial effects."
"Finally, with regard to control, we must produce a proposal to establish new control mechanisms in order to ensure that there is no accumulation of excessive bureaucratic and administrative procedures which may discourage the use of the mechanisms for using preferences."
"At a time when a very lively debate is taking place on the achievement of the Millennium Objectives and the fight against poverty, both in this Parliament and in the UN, the OSCE and the G-8, we believe that this is the most appropriate time for a reform of rules of origin which opens up our markets and benefits the countries that need it most."
"That is the objective of this question and we would like to know the Commission’s views at this point."
"Mr President, the communication of 16 March 2005 defines general orientations for the future of the rules of origin in preferential arrangements."
"It is a three-pronged approach, which should be seen as a package: firstly, simplification and appropriate relaxation of the substance of the rules; secondly, improved procedures for their implementation and enforcement; thirdly, a secure environment for legitimate trade, in particular through a targeted monitoring of the functioning of the arrangements."
"While the orientations should be applied progressively to all arrangements, their priority focus is firstly on the arrangements devoted to the development of each GSP."
"The Commission considers that formal simplification could be achieved by placing the current numerous and complex rules for determining the origin of products that are not wholly obtained in a country by a single, across-the-board method based on value criteria."
"That method also offers the flexibility, through the setting of the value threshold, to adjust the origin requirements according to the desired results in terms of market access and development for beneficiary countries."
"It would apply both for determining what sufficient processing is when materials not originating in a country or in a cumulation zone are used, and for allocating origin, but in the context of cumulation, using different value thresholds."
"Let me take the opportunity to address your second question. The need for relaxation has, taking into account my preliminary remarks, to be considered against its desired effect, not only in terms of growth of exports under the GSP, but mainly on the actual development of the beneficiary countries."
"In that context the criteria to be taken into account in order to define the value thresholds lie in the impact of the new rules on development."
"The use of a value-added method is therefore a starting point."
"The Commission is launching studies to measure its impact on certain products that are key commodities for developing countries, such as textiles, agriculture and fisheries –until now the determination of their origin has not been based on value – and which are sensitive for the Community in tariff and market terms."
"The study will help in defining the criteria and in verifying whether a value-added method with the appropriate thresholds for both sufficient processing and cumulation is actually in line with the principles of simplification and development-friendliness."
"Should this study demonstrate that the value-added approach would not deliver the expected results for certain sectors, the Commission will adopt another approach to better achieve these objectives."
"Referring to your first question, the Commission is ready to explain in more detail to representatives of Parliament."
"However, the terms of reference of the study are how the products and countries will be selected for the simulations and the steps to be followed in evaluating its results."
"With regard to the definition of thresholds, that will be part of the process of drawing up and adopting the Commission regulation to amend GSP rules of origin."
"Parliament will be involved, in accordance with the comitology procedure."
"However, once the Commission is in a position to formally start the examination of the draft regulation within the Customs Code Committee, the draft will be made available to Parliament."
"With regard to your third question, the Commission has carefully considered the idea of allowing global cumulation between all GSP beneficiary countries."
"That goes far beyond the cross-regional cumulation."
"Cumulation of origin, to have a real impact, should be an additional opportunity to source materials from countries that are real economic partners, with lower constraints than from other countries."
"Expanding sourcing possibilities to all developing countries would result in denying the very concept of cumulation, assuming that most of the supplies used by developing countries to manufacture products to be exported to the EU under the GSP come from other developing countries."
"Such a global cumulation would, in fact, replace the normal origin requirements."
"The main beneficiaries of such a situation would again be the biggest exporting countries and not the poorest and more vulnerable ones, whose interests would be better served by appropriate value thresholds."
"To make an impact, cumulation and its facilitation must remain targeted in groups of countries with mutual and balanced economic interests."
"As highlighted by the communication, that does not exclude extending existing cumulation zones or merging existing groups such as ASEAN and SAARC."
"However, that must correspond to needs expressed by the groups of countries themselves and it must be supported by the necessary instruments for administrative cooperation in origin matters."
"The Commission remains at the disposal of Parliament to keep it informed of the further development of this important file."
"I should like to say to the Chairman of the Committee on International Trade: I am at your disposal and the disposal of your committee whenever you invite me to participate in your proceedings."
"."
"Mr President, when we talked about the system of trade benefits for developing countries back in March, we asked the Commission to review the rules of origin, mainly to promote better use of the scheme, and so we are pleased that it is in the process of doing just that."
"It kicked off in March and we can expect the final proposals this coming autumn."
"I have three questions to ask in this respect."
"The first concerns cumulation."
"The Commission has already indicated that it would like to enhance regional cumulation, which I consider extremely important, and that it would like to further develop cross-regional, or possibly, global cumulation."
"Can the Commission say any more about that at this stage?"
"The second question concerns the use of the Generalised System of Preferences."
"The biggest benefits are mainly enjoyed by only a handful of countries, including China."
"The challenge we face is to incorporate the adjustments in such a way as to ensure that the countries that need this system the most will, and can, actually avail themselves of it."
"How does the Commission think it will achieve this?"
"Does the Commission consider a lower regional cumulation threshold for the LDCs?"
"I should like to finish off by saying a few words about the possibility of potential misuse and fraud, which is a real problem."
"It is hoped that readjustments can be made by simplifying the criteria of origin and simplifying administrative procedures, as well as by making the conditions for regional cumulation more flexible."
"A risk analysis had been provided for in this respect."
"I would like the Commission to tell us whether this analysis has now been carried out, and whether the Commissioner is able to comment on it."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the report on the generalised system of preferences and shadow rapporteur for the reform of rules of origin, I would like to stress the importance of the preferences recognised by the Union being applied effectively and truly benefiting their recipients."
"Parliament’s main interest is to ensure that this purpose is achieved and therefore, while I share the objectives of your communication, I would like to raise certain issues."
"With regard to simplification, I would like to stress firstly that special treatment is necessary for the least-developed countries and lower thresholds and the possibility of minimal rules in their favour must be recognised."
"At the same time, the establishment of added value thresholds as the only criterion requires that certain collateral problems be tackled, because this requirement may be very costly for companies in the least-developed countries, which would need sophisticated accounting and auditing systems."
"If we relate this criterion to the net cost of production in the different countries in relation to exchange rates, salaries and prices of raw materials, the system may become more complex and may lead to exclusion in the least-developed countries with cheap labour."
"With regard to making rules of origin more flexible, I would like to stress the need for countries that are subject to the same preferential treatment, although they belong to different geographical or commercial regions, to be able to cumulate amongst themselves."
"We believe that this would be a consistent rule and that, at the same time, it would be necessary to recognise the possibility of bilateral cumulation with the European Union, so that products finished in a beneficiary country that contain materials originating from the Community may also benefit from preferences."
"With regard to the control measures, I would insist on the need for us to receive impact studies and simulations, I would ask you to listen to the views of civil society and ensure the monitoring of the system, keeping Parliament duly informed."
". Mr President, I have taken note of the great interest expressed by Parliament in the substantial review of the rules of origin launched by the Commission."
"We clearly share the same objectives."
"While GSP rules of origin come first, the orientations of the Commission communication will also inspire the definition of the revision of the rules of origin in other arrangements, in particular in the negotiations of the EU economic partnership agreements with the ACP States."
"I would again insist on the fact that, while the formal involvement of your institution is based on the legal framework for the definition of rules of origin in the various preferential arrangements, I consider it extremely important that your committee be kept fully informed and have the opportunity to express its views on the charges to be introduced for the benefit of better market access and development."
"For products to be considered as sufficiently processed in a country on account of regional accumulation, it is none the less necessary to determine in which country of the region the product originates."
"It is essential because there can be developing countries in the same region which benefit from different preferential arrangements on the GSP, and diversion of those preferences should be avoided."
"For that purpose, an accumulation threshold will be fixed in order to decide whether the products originate in the country of final manufacture."
"This threshold should be lower than the threshold imposed on non-originating inputs in order to favour sourcing in the accumulation zone and, at the same time, high enough to avoid any diversion of preferences."
"The threshold will be more easily reached by the developing countries."
"Reform of the rules of origin is of great importance for improving trade opportunities for the world’s poorest and most vulnerable countries."
"We must ensure that we deliver our promises."
"As far as some other details of the questions are concerned, we will give a written answer."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Dimitrakopoulos, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the European Union and Iraq - A framework for engagement [2004/2168(INI)] (A6-0198/2005)."
". – Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my thanks to my honourable friends in the Committee on Foreign Affairs for their cooperation, which means that today you have before you a report which, I believe, is an integrated report laying down certain substantial guidelines on how relations between the European Union and Iraq need to move in future."
"Without doubt, since combat operations ended, the situation in Iraq has been difficult and, unfortunately, is deteriorating by the day."
"Thus, the first comment I have to make concerns the security situation, the most important problem identified in Iraq today."
"It is important not only because it costs thousands of human lives every day, but also because nothing else can be done unless the security problem is addressed."
"Of course, this conclusion is not enough."
"Very specific measures also need to be taken."
"One of these is, of course, the restoration of the Iraqi security forces and, on the other hand, the restoration of the Iraqi army, which is no easy matter."
"At the same time, as certain security problems are caused by the presence there of foreign military forces, I consider that replacing the military forces with a UN peace force would be an important step."
"This is one of the basic proposals in my report."
"Of course, it is something which cannot be achieved in 48 hours; of course, it is a decision which requires debate; of course, it is a decision which must be based on a UN Security Council resolution. However, in my opinion, it is necessary."
"The third comment I have to make concerns reconstruction."
"Following the war, Iraq is a country in which the entire social fabric has broken down."
"Thus, reconstruction must not be examined as a mere logistical construction process; there is, of course, the question of construction, but there is also the question of reshaping and orientating a society, and reshaping and orientating a society includes political, economic, social and cultural issues."
"The epicentre of the overall reconstruction process is, without doubt, a procedure which has just started, by which I mean the drafting of the new constitution."
"It is clear – and it must be clear to all of us – that the future of Iraq is primarily in the hands of the Iraqi people, and that is how it should be."
"On the other hand, however, it is very important for the European Union, with its tradition of democracy, to propose – through the procedure to draft the constitution of course – that care be taken to ensure that there will be a democratic, progressive society, with social awareness; a society which reflects the pluralism of Iraq."
"Finally, and this is my last point, the presence of the European Union both in the reconstruction and in the entire course of events of Iraq, which is a country with an important history, is something for which provision is made in this report and something which should be supported."
". Mr President, it is a very great honour for me to be here today."
"It is the first occasion on which I have addressed this great body."
"Thank you very much for the opportunity to do so, first to make a brief speech now in respect of Iraq and later in the morning at greater length on Africa and globalisation."
"I begin by thanking the Committee on Foreign Affairs, particularly its chairman, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, for its report and for the presentation this morning."
"Apologies for my pronunciation."
"I did Ancient Greek at school, but of course that was written rather than oral."
"The disagreements within the European Union over military action against Saddam's regime in Iraq are a matter of record and we all acknowledge that strongly held views remain on both sides."
"Given the strength of feeling, I am particularly grateful to your Committee for the way in which it has looked forward for a future for Iraq rather than backwards to rehearse the arguments over it."
"Since the end of military action, the European Union has recognised its strong and common interest in supporting the new Iraq that is now emerging."
"I think we all condemn those who want to determine Iraq's future through extremism and violence."
"We condemn all killings and kidnappings, but, given the nature of this body, we particularly condemn the recent kidnapping of the Egyptian Ambassador in Iraq, Mr Ihab al-Sherif, and the attacks on other diplomats from Arab countries."
"We are determined to see the success of a peaceful, stable and democratic Iraq, which responds to the needs of all its citizens."
"Just over a year ago, the European Council endorsed the Commission's communication setting out medium-term objectives for the development of the EU's relationship with Iraq."
"That strategy is bearing fruit."
"Last November, the Council presented a package of European Union assistance to Iraq's then Prime Minister, Dr Allawi."
"That included a longer-term commitment to starting negotiations on a third country agreement and to promoting EU trade and political cooperation with Iraq; a reminder of the Commission's offer to implement the generalised system of preferences and financial support."
"Experts from the Commission worked with the United Nations and the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq, and helped to make a success of Iraq's first democratic elections on 30 January this year."
"Several Members of the European Parliament also observed those elections."
"The General Affairs and External Relations Council in February agreed to build on this package of assistance with further support for Iraq's political process, including the drafting of a new constitution."
"It agreed on a new Community aid package of EUR 200 million and the launch of an EU integrated Rule of Law and Police Training Mission for Iraq with offices in Baghdad and Brussels."
"That mission began training Iraqi police, judiciary and penitentiary officials yesterday and is making a valuable contribution to the Iraqi Government's efforts to increase its authority and to entrench the rule of law."
"Overall, the European Union is today delivering an impressive and comprehensive programme of assistance to the Government and people of Iraq as they seek to build a peaceful and democratic future."
"Last month, along with Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, the High Representative, Javier Solana, and the President of the General Affairs Council, Jean Asselborn, I visited Baghdad."
"In my view, and I hope Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner shares this view, it was a very important visit, symbolising the European Union's commitment to the new Iraq."
"There the Commissioner reiterated the Commission's intention to open an office in Baghdad as soon as possible, so as to strengthen the EU's dialogue and technical assistance."
"At the International Conference on Iraq in Brussels a fortnight ago, hosted jointly by the United States and the European Union, representatives from 87 countries and international organisations gave a similar and strong message of support to the new Iraq."
"Let me just respond in opening to one absolutely key point."
"I will make my first apology for referring to the rapporteur as the chairman."
"If this is regarded as a slight on my very good friend Elmar Brok, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I apologise to him too."
"Mr Dimitrakopoulos rightly said that the security situation was the key to everything else and the security situation is serious."
"There is no disguising that."
"He also intimated that the sooner the Iraqis were able to take control of their own security the better."
"Let me say, as one of what were the two formal occupying powers in Iraq, the United States and the United Kingdom, and someone with his own personal responsibility for the war, we share this aspiration."
"Leave aside the arguments of the past."
"All of us believe that the quicker the Iraqis are able to take responsibility for their own security the better and the quicker the coalition forces will then be able to leave."
"The security situation is poor."
"The better news is the increase in the training and ability of the Iraqi security forces."
"Now there are 168 000 individuals in the Iraqi security forces overall."
"More and more of them have a proper capability and are being used."
"We are well aware that under Security Council Resolution 1546 the mandate for the foreign forces in Iraq will come to an end in December this year, unless it is renewed in some way, and that in any event, as 1546 makes clear, we the coalition forces are only there at the invitation of the Iraqi Government."
"Were the Iraqi government to ask us to leave, we would leave immediately."
"On the issue of whether there could be a United Nations 'blue-hatted' force, I have no difficulty with that in principle."
"The only issue is encouraging other countries to come forward."
"Whether we can achieve that remains to be seen."
"However, on the overall objective of coalition forces being reduced and then leaving and the Iraqis taking full control for themselves, we are absolutely in agreement."
"To sum up, the United Kingdom will look during its presidency to pursue a growing relationship between the EU and Iraq, building on what we have already achieved."
"I welcome the Committee's endorsement of the goal and particularly their call for the Commission to open its office in Baghdad and for the EU to send an observer mission to the elections to be held in Iraq in December."
"I greatly welcome the Committee's suggestion that the European Parliament should build on its relationship with the Iraqi Transitional National Assembly."
"I look forward to today's debate"
". Mr President, I should like to start by welcoming Mr Straw to the Presidency."
"I congratulate Mr Dimitrakopoulos warmly on his report."
"It is an excellent and timely report and gives us a good opportunity for an update on the intensive developments over the last few months."
"Iraq is still a huge and multiple challenge to all of us."
"It really is ‘work in progress’ and we have a lot to do there."
"Significant events have taken place, one of which was the troika visit to Iraq on 9 June, because we, the 25, showed that we are all united now in reconstructing and assisting Iraq."
"It was not easy, because there have been times when we have not been united."
"It was also very well received by the Iraqis themselves."
"I also think it was very important that we had the international conference in Brussels."
"Many members of the Iraqi Government were present and they were able to present their ideas and wishes and suggest where we could assist them."
"The deplorable abduction of the Egyptian diplomat and other recent kidnappings have driven home to all of us the conditions under which people are living."
"I decided, therefore, that the Commission should also have a presence in Baghdad and, as Mr Straw has already mentioned, we will be setting up a delegation."
"We will, of course, do that under the protection of the British and we hope that safety can be guaranteed as far as possible."
"We know it is not an easy undertaking, but I think it is important that politically we also show our flag and help the Iraqi people."
"The situation in that country is still very difficult and I agree with Mr Dimitrakopoulos that ensuring military and civilian security must be the main priority of the new Iraqi administration."
"The only way to establish security is to address the underlying causes of the violent attacks by some sections of the Iraqi population."
"I see two concrete prerequisites for this."
"The first is an inclusive and broad-based constitution and the second is an environment in which reconstruction can bring visible improvements to the daily lives of the Iraqi people."
"I would even add that, thirdly, it is very important that neighbouring countries also contribute to more unity in the country and less conflict."
"I shall say a few words about the new constitution."
"This must represent the interests of all Iraqis and was a central topic of our Iraq Conference in Brussels."
"It must be a product of inclusive, broad-based consultation and all Iraqis must feel it belongs to them, can protect them and guarantee their rights."
"The inclusion of Sunnis in the main drafting body is therefore a promising start, but, as we know, the process will not be easy."
"We in Europe know from our recent experience the myriad difficulties a constitution can pose and, by the way, we also discussed that very frankly with the Iraqis."
"We are also ready to offer technical expertise if requested."
"We already provided technical expertise in the last elections, especially for the United Nations, and we have said that we will assist the United Nations experts again this time, especially with funding, but also by providing some of our own experts."
"Of course that always depends on whether the Iraqis want us to help."
"We rely very much on the United Nations to advise the Iraqis on compliance with the principles of international law."
"Once the Constitution has been drafted and elections are scheduled, we also intend in principle to offer the Iraqis an election observation mission to oversee them, but it depends on the security situation."
"We have not yet taken a final decision on that."
"The Iraqi people need to see concrete improvements in their everyday lives."
"Since 2003 we in the Commission have been working on health, education, basic needs, sanitation and water, and also on creating jobs, because what is most important is that people themselves are able to feed their families."
"Of the EUR 200 million committed we will soon have finalised EUR 145 million, to be channelled through the World Bank’s International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq to meet basic needs."
"The forthcoming donor conference in Amman will then offer an opportunity for the Iraqis themselves to take the lead, based on the last conference in Brussels, in setting up a real donor coordination mechanism."
"They already announced it at the conference and we would like to work with them."
"In addition to reconstruction aid, the international community also needs to do more to reduce or reschedule Iraq’s debts."
"The Commission will be pushing EU Member States on this, because we think it is fundamental."
"It is a prerequisite that neighbouring countries especially contribute more and more, because they will really play a central role in shifting the balance in the region."
"These countries need the assistance and cooperation of their neighbours."
"The neighbours have made this commitment in principle, but now we have to see whether it can be put into practice."
"Iraq is an extraordinary country with a great but turbulent past."
"It is now the inspiration for a new era of international cooperation."
"We know that the agenda that we have set out is very ambitious, but I think we can deliver if we just stay the course."
"The Iraqi people have shown tremendous courage and resilience, particularly in turning out in such large numbers to vote, but also in their everyday lives against a background of violence and intimidation."
"They deserve compassion, but also solidarity and financial and other assistance."
"That is what we have to do on moral and also political grounds."
"I can inform the Council and the Commission that Parliament offers courses in modern Greek, if needed, in order to help with the pronunciation of Mr Dimitrakopoulos’s name."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find myself in the slightly ridiculous position of being the only person to have abstained from the opinion issued by the Committee on Development."
"There were no votes against the opinion."
"To be quite frank, my abstention was the result of the rejection of two paragraphs that I consider important, namely the reference to the military occupation and to the rejection of the war with the resulting withdrawal of occupation troops, as well as the criticism of the rule and the loss of economic sovereignty connected with Ambassador Bremer’s corrupt and negative management."
"Mr Straw, the present is a consequence of the past."
"The deaths occurring daily and the killing of Mr Calipari, the secret agent, bear witness to this fact."
"Yesterday, representatives of Iraqi civil society were received; they are present in the Chamber today and I welcome them with great respect."
"These are people who live in insecurity every day, but who do not give up on their commitment to fight for an Iraq free of the military occupation, terrorism and armed resistance."
"They live in Fallujah, Basra and Baghdad, they believe in justice and democratic participation by the people and they were victims of Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship."
"Yesterday, I realised how important it is to give these people power."
"As our opinion states, it is necessary for the reconstruction process to provide for their involvement and financial support for their projects."
"Our opinion also strongly emphasises the promotion of development measures in favour of women, who must acquire and not lose rights, and of children traumatised by the dictatorship, the embargo and the war, as well as measures designed to help the country to clear the mines and cluster-bombs and to place control and reconstruction projects back in the hands of the Iraqi authorities."
"Our opinion also calls for the involvement of the United Nations. Above all, it calls for respect for human rights, which have been tragically and shamefully violated, and a continued commitment by the European Union through its presence in Iraq, as the Council and the Commission have also called for here."
"Finally, since the time available to me has ended, I urge that the debt cancellation that Commissioner Waldner believes necessary should not be considered a substitute for aid."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after years of oppression and deprivation of freedom, and the prevailing difficulties notwithstanding, the people of Iraq now have a chance of a peaceful and free future."
"It is an opportunity we must do everything in our power to seize."
"What does this mean in terms of trade policy?"
"Firstly, my committee welcomes the strategy proposed by the Commission for involvement in Iraq, calling on all parties to help transform the country into a diversified market economy."
"Secondly, Iraq’s planned accession to the WTO is a crucial step in integrating the country into the global economy, although the economic and administrative structures for this have yet to be created."
"Thirdly, reconstruction must involve a leading and coordinating role for the United Nations."
"Fourthly, Iraq possesses many natural resources, particularly its reserves of oil."
"It is not least in our interest that the trade in oil and natural gas be resumed; as it will help secure our energy supplies to a considerable degree, it is important to both sides that legislation be approximated in the energy sector, too, and that adequate conditions under which investment can take place be established."
"It has to be said, though, that sustainable reconstruction is inconceivable if the proceeds are not reinvested in Iraq."
"Fifthly, as regards international financial aid or the cancellation of debt, there must be close cooperation between the partners involved."
"There also – and this is my sixth point – needs to be close cooperation between Iraq and its neighbours, on which the development of a favourable investment climate across the region as a whole depends."
"I will conclude by thanking the members of the lead committee, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for adopting our opinion with scarcely any reservations."
"The window of opportunity that we have for change in Iraq will not be open for ever."
"Let us make good use of it for the people’s benefit!"
". Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Dimitrakopoulos on the excellent work he has done on Iraq, a tough, complex and difficult issue, as we can see from the events that have taken place recently: the murder of more than 40 people this weekend, the kidnap of the head of the Egyptian diplomatic mission in the street in broad daylight, the standstill in oil production and the spectacular increase in violence over the last year."
"Nevertheless, Mr President, I believe that the task of rehabilitation, reconstruction, democratisation and pacification of Iraq is not a task that should fall to the countries most closely involved — and I can see Minister Straw, who is with us today, and we welcome him as well — but rather it is a task that should fall to the whole of the international democratic community."
"The European Union must give decisive support to the tasks required in Iraq at the moment: a Constitution that will have to provide a prudent and sensible balance in terms of the nationalist and religious factors, the holding of new elections, the establishment of a new government and the trial of Saddam Hussein."
"And all of this, Mr President, must accommodate the Sunni community and allow it greater participation in the structures of power."
"If I had to emphasise one aspect of Mr Dimitrakopoulos’s report, it would be that it looks to the future, because the future cannot be built solely by talking in the past tense."
"If we do not have a clear view of our ambitions and our projects for that country, we will not be able to build the future and we will not be able to understand the past."
"It is therefore very important, Mr President, for the European Union to clearly promote peace, understanding, concord and reconciliation in that country, as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has said and as the President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers of the European Union has also told us."
"But I believe, Mr President, that we will have to try, amongst all of us, to turn the discords of the past into the harmonies of the present, as suggested by the rapporteur, Mr Dimitrakopoulos."
"Mr President, I have been told that the page must be turned."
"I am turning it."
"I shall not speak about the mass graves in Fallujah."
"I shall not speak about the dozens of people killed each day."
"I shall not give any figures."
"I shall not speak of the ghetto to which foreign nationals are confined."
"I shall not speak of the journalists who have been kidnapped or of my Iraqi friends who have been murdered."
"I shall not speak of this chaotic, free Iraq which often seems like hell."
"I shall not speak of the appalling corruption and the misappropriation of oil revenue."
"Above all, I shall not say that this war has been a tragic mistake from beginning to end."
"I am turning the page."
"Do not ask me, however, to say that all those Iraqis who are resisting have become terrorists."
"Yes, alas, there are terrorists, but there is also a popular uprising."
"Do not ask me to shut my eyes to the appalling management of the conflict when even Bush himself is coming under attack for this within his own party."
"Do not ask me to hide the fact that European Union money is lying unspent in Mr Wolfowitz’s World Bank Trust Fund, despite the call made by the European Parliament, in its resolution of September 2003, for all of its donations to be managed by the United Nations."
"You have been an excellent rapporteur, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, but do not ask me to give yet more ground and forget our Amendments 11, 12 and 13."
"That is our bottom line."
"Why?"
"Quite simply because the Iraqis are watching us and reading us and because they expect from Europe not only hope but also truth."
"Commissioner, your words were well chosen and full of compassion and we support you."
"We want to rebuild Iraq, but with the Iraqis, for the Iraqis and for them alone."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Foreign Secretary Straw, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I wish to welcome you here and wish you good luck with your work."
"Scarcely a day goes by without new attacks in Iraq being reported."
"Suicide attacks, acts of terrorism, kidnappings and other outrages directed against Iraqi and foreign civilians, journalists and soldiers are unfortunately now becoming everyday fare."
"Most of us only need see it on TV, but the Iraqi people are living in the middle of this situation."
"It is a priority task for the whole of the world community to support the Iraqi authorities in bringing the violence to an end, rebuilding the country and introducing democracy, peace and stability."
"Europe has a big responsibility to support this process through its presence and through money, trade, aid and all other possible forms of help, for example police training and training in the holding of elections."
"We have had many harsh exchanges in this House about the American invasion, but we must look to the future now."
"On behalf of my group, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, for his work on the report and for trying to be so constructive and forward-looking."
"We do not need to dig ourselves into trenches."
"We do not need to harp on what is past."
"I wish to appeal to all the groups to try to look forwards."
"To demand now that all the troops be withdrawn would be a disaster for the Iraqi people. people are needed in Iraq, and we genuinely support the call to try to bring about a UN-led force with a European presence, if that is possible."
"The Iraqi people are courageous and patient."
"They showed this during the election, and they show it every day."
"With its constitution, the Iraqi Government has ambitious goals."
"We naturally support the work on creating democratic institutions, strong protection for women and minorities and support for a society founded on the rule of law."
"We would also appeal to Iraq to abolish the death penalty in the longer term."
"If required, the EU can help in making expertise in constitutional work available."
"The road towards democracy and security is difficult and long."
"Success would turn Iraq into a fantastic model for the whole region, but that will require increased aid from Europe and from ourselves here in the European Parliament, involving contact with the elected Iraqi Members of Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by congratulating the rapporteur on his report’s strong points, for example, the replacement of American and British troops by UN security troops, which will, in time, improve the security situation to a vast degree."
"I think the rapporteur is right, and I would like to urge Mr Straw to show more commitment in this area, not only telling this House that he is in agreement, but also, among other things, by adopting a tougher line in the Security Council."
"Another strong point is the need for national reconciliation and for no crime to go unpunished."
"I appreciate the fact that, in his report, the rapporteur refers to a number of positive developments in Iraq, including the elections in January 2005."
"Having said that, there are two important failings in the report that I would like to mention."
"The first one is the deteriorating security situation."
"Although this will, in time, be improved by troop replacements, at the moment, the speed at which things are being done is simply too slow and the direction too unclear."
"I am entirely convinced that there will be no fundamental improvement in the security situation without a more radical and a more rapid transfer of powers."
"Secondly, I simply have to return to the issue of the ambiguity surrounding the start of the war, particularly in the first recitals."
"Like the rapporteur, I believe that both the European Union and this House will need to focus on the future and future cooperation between the European Union and Iraq, but not even in this House can there be any effective and concerted action without an objective assessment of the past."
"That is why my group has tabled a number of amendments that underline this, addressing, among other things, the lack of legitimisation by the UN."
"The overwhelming majority of my group will not vote to endorse the report unless those amendments are adopted."
"If we do not learn from past mistakes, we risk repeating them, and that is something we should avoid at all costs."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the report that has been submitted to us on the European Union’s engagement in Iraq states, as early as its first paragraph, and I quote, that we ‘need to move on from past events and to look towards the future’."
"In other words, keep mum about the war, those responsible for it and its consequences."
"This approach seems to me to be ethically irresponsible, politically suspect and strategically unrealistic."
"It is ethically irresponsible."
"What right do we have to write off the unspeakable suffering that this war has already brought to the Iraqi people: the 100 000 innocent victims, the destruction, the total lack of security, the deprivations and the humiliation of the occupation?"
"Let us remember once again that this war was started against the wishes of the international community and on the basis of a twofold lie: that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that Al-Qaeda had been in the country before 2003."
"We can no longer regard as insignificant the legitimate anger of many Americans, British and others towards their leaders, whom they do not intend to forgive for deceiving them and drawing them into this bloody and inglorious venture."
"Covering up the origins of the present fiasco would also be politically suspect."
"The current leaders of the Commission and the Council are precisely those who were among the most ardent supporters of the American President."
"Let us imagine that the vagaries of scheduling had forced the recent transatlantic summit to be put back by two weeks."
"We should have had a startling photo of the meeting: Mr Bush, Mr Blair and Mr Barroso, almost a repeat of the Azores Summit of 2003."
"Would they then have had nothing to say to us about their assessment of the consequences for Europe of the decisions they took then and the lessons that they have now learned?"
"It would be too easy, Mr Straw, to welcome the new spirit only, in so doing, to pay off such a heavy liability."
"Far from eradicating terrorism, this war has transformed Iraq, according to the CIA itself – and I quote – into a terrorist laboratory where the Jihadists come to train in urban warfare, and this for maybe another twelve years, according to Mr Rumsfeld."
"You owe us some explanations!"
"Finally, I believe that it is unrealistic to believe in the lasting success of a political solution in Iraq, which would save us from condemning this war."
"Neither Europe nor the United Nations has the authority to provide back-up troops for occupiers in difficulties."
"Now is the time to send this entire battered region some strong political signals, such as a decision to proscribe all recourse to war in future as a way of resolving the world’s problems, or the implementation of the Quartet’s commitments, that have never been kept, to restore the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people, or substantial aid for the creation of civil society – and I salute the representatives of civil society who were welcomed by my group yesterday – and a totally free and sovereign authority in Iraq."
"Mr President, we are told that Europe urgently needs to engage in a major project and this is one!"
". Mr President, among the elements slowing down Iraq’s reconstruction are the ongoing suicide attacks."
"The European institutions can make a substantial contribution to keeping this almost exclusively Arabic jihadism under control."
"How?"
"By finally giving Iraq’s closest neighbour, Syria, a clear warning, because to date, Syria has acted as the perfect springboard for Islamic terrorists from Mesopotamia."
"What I would say to both the Council and Commission is that we cannot, surely, under these circumstances, entertain the idea of an association agreement with Damascus."
"Moreover, I would like the Council to tell us to what extent Al-Qaeda jihadists are being recruited from within the European Union, and to what extent terrorism against Iraq is being funded by mosques based in Europe."
"Although Mr Dimitrakopoulos, in his report, fails to spell out the disruptive Arab influence on Iraq’s general reconstruction process, I do welcome his unambiguous request to the Commission for a meticulous justification of all EU projects in Iraq."
"Indeed, that is something that taxpayers in the EU Member States have every right to have at their disposal."
"Mr Dimitrakopoulos does, however, address another, second, obstacle to Iraq’s reconstruction in the shape of the widespread evil of corruption within that country’s administrative apparatus."
"Once again, the European Union can make a valuable contribution to Mesopotamia’s prospects."
"Corruption and security are closely related."
"‘Only transparency can get us out of this quagmire’, said the Kurdish politician Mohammed Toufik, and he was right."
"This represents a new set of aid tasks for the European Union in Iraq."
"I would like to add that I have a great deal of respect for the US, British and other international troops, and wish them much strength in their endeavours to achieve a better …"
"Mr President, during the Communist era in Poland, a joke did the rounds about a travel agency that allegedly used the following advertising slogan; ‘visit the Soviet Union before the Soviet Union visits you’."
"An updated version of this joke might be; ‘let us take care of Iraq before Iraqi terrorists take care of us’."
"The EU Special Representative for Afghanistan recently said that our political presence and substantial financial involvement in the country were necessary because the EU had made the mistake of failing to take any interest whatsoever in Afghanistan between 1990 and 2001."
"We should avoid making the same mistake with Iraq, and we should not leave the country to the Americans."
"In my opinion, both supporters and opponents of US intervention in Iraq – and I include myself in the latter camp – can and should agree on the fact that the EU must act as a stabilising force in Iraq and the surrounding region."
"The EU committed a grave error by failing to send observers to the January 2005 elections in Iraq."
"He who is absent is always in the wrong, and has no say in how he would like events to unfold."
"I should like to end by thanking Mr Straw for our meeting last Thursday in London, and to tell him that the Committee on Foreign Affairs still has the same chairman, namely Elmar Brok."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, a fortnight ago, our committee welcomed a delegation from the provisional parliament of Iraq, led by its President and his deputy, and including all factions – Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds together."
"I was pleasantly surprised to note the interest these leading representatives of their communities had in finding a solution that would include reconciliation and would join the religious and ethnic groups together, and the way they engaged in serious discussions to this end."
"The chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs was also present."
"One thing on which, or so I believe, the long-term peace of this country depends, is a balance of power in the form of a sort of federal structure, one secured, in bad times and good, by means of a constitution."
"We could thereby arrive at a way of doing things that would give everyone the feeling that their interests were secure, as was also, though, their religious and ethnic identity, and that would also have an influence in the cultural sphere."
"On this, I believe, the success of the enterprise largely depends, for it was often the case, in these states formerly under colonial rule, that a small group held the reins of power, and in Iraq, this was the Sunnis, something I regard as one of the main reasons behind this terrorism, and we must – as you, Commissioner, said – succeed in spelling that out, or else it will not be clear to the public where the benefit for them lies."
"They have to see that the terrorists are attempting to make democracy and power-sharing impossible; that they do not want stability, for stability will bring the investments that will improve conditions in the country."
"It is by these means that they seek to regain their former positions of power, or for purely ideological reasons, to nip democracy in the bud."
"At the time, I was an opponent of the war, but that is now irrelevant."
"What matters now is that we, together, win the peace and establish democracy."
"We have to bridge the gulfs by which we have long been divided and, by means of a multilateral approach, make it possible for this country to become stable and democratic, with consequent benefits – not least for us – right across the region."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report could have and should have been more courageous, since what we are discussing are issues of life and death and of the strategic future of our Union."
"The text has certainly been improved, but in too many places it has become detached from the reality on the ground."
"This war is now lost, and it has done much to aid the jihadist terrorists, instead of weakening them."
"If Mr Bush were wise, he would announce a wholesale withdrawal, without maintaining any strategic bases, and he would implement it in accordance with a precise timetable."
"As always, in asymmetrical conflicts there is no military solution, but only a political solution."
"The new Iraqi Government is demonstrating this to us."
"In point of fact, it is not negotiating with the terrorists, but with the resistance, including it in the reconstruction process."
"For this reason, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, it is important to insert the word ‘resistance’ into the report, since today in Iraq there are both insurgents resisting the occupation and terrorists, and their objectives are different."
"In addition, it was also important to point out that the war against Iraq was cold-bloodedly sought by Mr Bush and deliberately sustained through a tissue of lies."
"Iraq, in fact, did not possess weapons of mass destruction, nor did it have links with Al-Qaeda."
"Once the invasion had been completed there was a moral duty to reconstruct Iraq, at least in physical terms, but political and military arrogance, incompetence, corruption and ineptitude have prevented this."
"Thus, even passing over the disgrace of Abu Ghraib, they have lost, without winning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people."
"I therefore also address the Council and Commission representatives: now is the time to abandon the weaknesses of past divisions and to focus even more firmly on a common policy in order to escape the impotence that dogs minority coalitions."
"Europe is worthwhile only if we think, decide and work together."
"Otherwise, it is just a charming collection of little bonsais crushed by the first passing elephant."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the war in Iraq Europe has experienced one of its greatest divisions of opinion, and because of this the Dimitrakopoulos report accomplishes a semi-miracle in seeking a possible equilibrium."
"Many deficiencies, however, still remain."
"The actual situation on the ground unfortunately confirms all the doubts expressed by those who declared themselves opposed to military intervention."
"We waited for the turning point with the fall and capture of Saddam Hussein, and later we hoped that the turning point would come after the elections in January, and that the Allawi government would actually be able to stabilise the country."
"In reality, we know that things have turned out differently."
"If we look at the civilian victims of the suicide attackers, the unrecorded acts of violence by Iraqis on Iraqis and the increase in the weekly attacks on the occupying forces, Iraq is the largest terrorist training ground on the planet."
"Today, however, we should not look towards the past but concentrate on the future, which is why we have given the Allawi government our endorsement, committed ourselves to the reconstruction and supported the recent resolutions."
"On this point, we have set ourselves three objectives, namely the prior commitment – as the Solana doctrine calls it – with neighbouring countries, which can lend us a hand, not only not to export terrorists but also to help Iraq to emerge from the abyss; the training of the security forces, who are vital in planning the withdrawal of the occupying troops; and, finally, the constitutional agreement."
"This is truly the last turning point."
"Either we are able to keep the country united with the constitutional agreement, or an inexorable civil war will break out."
"The signs of tension that are also present in Kurdistan give us cause to believe that this is really the last chance Europe has to achieve a better situation in the coming months."
"Mr President, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, ladies and gentlemen, the road to hell is paved with good intentions."
"What I mean is that if accounts are not settled with the past, the past will sooner or later come back to haunt us, presenting us with a very expensive and dramatic bill."
"If we do not condemn the war today, it is not possible to understand what is happening in Iraq at the moment."
"The war and terrorism continue to feed off each other."
"Before the war in Iraq there was no terrorism."
"We have to have the courage to say that the occupying armies are an element producing insecurity and not security."
"We have to have the courage to say that the United States and its allies went into Iraq because there is oil there and because they wanted to get hold of it, and certainly not to spread democracy."
"Yesterday we met representatives of civil society, human rights organisations, trade unions and women’s organisations, who explained to us that this society is active and wants to have a say in its own future."
"Europe should look at this issue too, and not just at its relationship with a government voted in in elections that were held under foreign military occupation."
"– Mr President, are we afraid or are we ashamed of the truth?"
"Are we afraid or are we ashamed of it, Giorgos?"
"The simple truth is that we have an occupying army and we have an irresponsible invasion by the Americans, British and Spaniards."
"That is the truth."
"With the occupation which we went through and which you went through in 1940, we too had executions and abductions."
"That is what we did to the victor and that is what the people of Iraq are doing today and rightly so."
"The occupying forces must leave."
"They must leave this country free to find its way."
"They must pay compensation for the wrong they have done."
"They must leave them the oil, and with oil at 60 dollars a barrel they will find their way."
"As long as there is an occupying army, there will also be crimes."
"They need to understand that."
"That is the real truth."
"We have lived through it."
"When Stalin interfered in Greece's internal affairs from 1944 to 1949, we slaughtered each other for many years."
"The occupying army must leave. That is the right thing to do."
"Let us speak the truth. We should not be ashamed."
"We should not come here and legislate from the safety of Strasbourg and Brussels."
"Let us go and say what we have to say in Vasora."
"Let us go and say what we have to say in Baghdad."
"That is where the people are, that is where the truth is, that is where the problem is."
"Long live democracy."
"Long live freedom."
"Long live self-determination."
"Mr President, that the alleged presence of weapons of mass destruction was used by the USA as a pretext for forcing their way into Iraq, and that the Americans are currently engaged in forcing their conception of democracy onto the Iraqi people, are matters of common knowledge."
"It is not only the duration of this intervention, but also its cost and side-effects that were underestimated."
"Iraq is now a lawless place, offering extremists the ideal opportunity to regroup and amass combat experience."
"The American invasion has turned the country into a training camp for terrorists from every corner of the world, and these have now only to wait for the opportunity to put their newly-acquired skills into practice on our soil."
"Even now, then, we all have to pay the price for America’s mistakes, be it in the shape of more terrorist activity or of a constant increase in recruitment by extremist Islamic groups."
"The idea that Europe should cough up even more, by sending troops, for this aberrance on the part of the USA, is quite unacceptable."
"It is because Iraq will know peace and a resolution of its problems only if these things come from within itself that we should rather give our support to the restoration of education, the reconstruction of the economy and the fight against rampant corruption."
"Those are things Europe could do, and they would bear fruit."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Dimitrakopoulos on the huge amount of work he has put into this complicated but extremely important issue."
"After years of Saddam Hussein’s regime, the Iraqi people have now been given the opportunity to construct their country in a free and democratic way."
"The parliamentary election, which was conducted under great pressure from forces that were interested in neither democracy nor free elections, was the first step in the democratisation process."
"It was also a chance for politics to triumph over terrorism and violence, but that did not happen."
"Even though a transitional government has been formed and work has begun on devising the new constitution, the security situation in Iraq has not been stabilised as it should have been."
"On the contrary, the situation is such that, for a long time to come, efforts will have to go on being made and a strong international presence will be required."
"Obviously, the earlier Iraq itself guarantees security in the country, the better."
"On the basis of what we have learned from other conflicts in our own neighbourhood, for example the wars in the Balkans that I myself experienced, we cannot however expect any quick results."
"Constructing peace and democracy takes time and would do so even if all the forces in the country were well disposed towards these goals."
"Still more time is required in countries such as Iraq or Bosnia where there is a variety of groups opposing the democratisation process."
"We need time and patience, however, for, if we were not to show sufficient support for Iraq’s efforts at political democratisation or too quickly to withdraw the international forces from Iraq, we should be jeopardising the peace not only in Iraq itself but also in the surrounding region, and that is something we cannot afford to do."
"Therefore, our only alternative is to continue to support Iraq, both politically and through a strong international presence for as long as that is required."
"Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner pointed out quite correctly that Europe now stands united in its efforts to rebuild Iraq."
"In my opinion, unification is precisely what would make it possible to stabilise the situation in Iraq and to overcome the problems we have there at present."
"Mr President, we have before us a difficult compromise, which has emerged after many weeks of debate."
"I should like to call on all the rabble rousers in the Chamber, for whom time stopped two years ago and who still use the language of that period, to study this compromise and to ask themselves whether Iraqis will gain more from this compromise or from their rabble-rousing."
"Anyone who fails to differentiate between anonymous, civilian-killing criminals and the coalition forces, made up of soldiers risking their lives in Iraq, is quite simply a liar, and I would protest against such lies."
"I have two suggestions for the Council and the Commission."
"Firstly, more pressure should be brought to bear on Iraq’s neighbours."
"Previous speakers have already referred to Syria, and recent events both there and in Iran have shown that these countries must bear responsibility for what is happening within their borders."
"The international community must put pressure on them, and they must also bear part of the responsibility for what is happening in Iraq."
"These countries cannot pursue policies in secret, while sending out misleading signals."
"Secondly, we must strengthen our dialogue with the political leadership in Iraq."
"Even though deep-rooted ethnic and religious divisions exist within the interim parliament, we must still talk to these people."
"Those who do not fight are our partners."
"Finally, the suggestion to send peacekeeping troops to the country is a splendid but naïve idea."
"Which army would be able to go out in blue helmets and protect the Iraqis?"
"This is a task for a well-armed and well-prepared Iraqi army, as they are the only ones capable of protecting their own people."
"Mr President, reports before this Parliament seldom contain jokes, but there is some humour, if unintentional, in this one."
"Paragraph 43 suggests that the European Union ‘offers its expertise and assistance with a view to the drafting of the Iraqi Constitution’."
"Iraqis might think that the European Union’s expertise and experience in this field leaves something to be desired."
"Its last attempt produced a Constitution that was opaque and confused and ran to almost 500 pages."
"On the other hand, the United States of America has a clear and concise Constitution that runs to just a few pages of paper, with only about 27 amendments needed over the past 200 years."
"If the Iraqis need some help, they might prefer to ask the Americans to lend a hand."
"If the EU becomes involved it might even offer to organise the constitutional referendum for the Iraqis, and that could lead to all kinds of unwanted problems."
"Mr President, Iraq is the frontline of the war against terrorists."
"These terrorists have made it quite clear that their goal is to force foreign powers to withdraw from Iraq, and then to crush the beginnings of democracy in the country."
"The world cannot allow them to achieve their goals or to carry out their plans, and the EU Member States cannot afford to allow such a thing to happen."
"The war on terror is a global challenge with which the world was confronted at the beginning of the 21st century."
"This is a war that we must win, because our opponent does not understand the meaning of such words as treaty, agreement, compromise, dialogue or peace."
"The aim of modern terrorism is to destroy the civilisation in which we live."
"Its current target is the United States, but it will be Europe’s turn in a few months’ time."
"The EU should therefore resolve to take joint decisions that are both courageous and practical, as it is no longer enough to provide EUR 200 million in aid."
"The EU should start by responding to the basic problems faced by the Iraqi population."
"These include a lack of water, to which two million Iraqis have no access, a lack of food – according to the latest UN report, one in four children goes hungry – a lack of work, with unemployment standing at 70%, a lack of security and the fear of terrorist attacks."
"The destruction of pipelines and other oil installations by saboteurs has meant that Iraq has suffered losses of USD 11 billion over the past two years."
"These are issues that should be included on the EU’s list of priority areas for aid to Iraq."
"We cannot allow our most notable effort towards reconstructing Iraq to be the announcement that a Commission representation will be opened in Baghdad, or the sending of an observation mission to the December elections."
"It is ordinary Iraqis who are waiting most impatiently for concrete assistance."
"We must step up our involvement in Iraq, and this involvement must be better organised."
"We need a vision that is worthy of a community comprising 25 Member States."
"The cost of failure would be high."
"A defeat for the democratic forces would strengthen the terrorists’ position, and this would have a knock-on effect in the shape of a new wave of terrorism, not only in Iraq but all over the world."
"Peace in Iraq will be key for the development of transatlantic relations and for peace in the region as a whole."
"Pressure must be brought to bear on Syria and Iran to ensure that these countries no longer provide support to terrorists there."
"For some time now we have been hearing that we should not be referring to the past and that there is no need to talk about the reasons for the invasion of Iraq by the United States and its ad-hoc coalition and allies."
"I am sorry, but I disagree deeply with this view, because the ad-hoc coalition created and led by the Americans invaded a sovereign state without any international or legally acceptable mandate."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Straw, history has shown us on numerous occasions that mankind could have avoided many of its mistakes if it had carefully analysed its errors and moral failures."
"Unfortunately, we seem to be unable to learn from our own mistakes."
"Mr. Dimitrakopoulos, not only am I able to pronounce your name, but I respect you as a colleague from the Foreign Affairs Committee."
"Yet, I cannot support your resolution, even though I am aware of the amount of effort you have put into it, and I agree with Mrs De Keyser, that without the passage of our draft amendments, this resolution would have no authority whatsoever."
"Mr President, first I want to pay tribute to Mr Dimitrakopoulos, a name which I have become familiar with in recent months."
"He has worked extremely hard to get this report right, seeking compromise from all sides to create a report that I think represents the views and aspirations of the vast majority of this Parliament."
"That is not an easy job when it comes to Iraq."
"One of the positive aspects of this report is the recurring theme of the need for us all to look forward with Iraq; concentrating on what can be achieved as Iraq moves ahead into the future and not constantly referring to mistakes and decisions made in the past."
"The rapporteur has not allowed this report to be hijacked by those who want to rehash the debate on the basis for war in Iraq and the legalities surrounding that decision, or lack of them."
"This is a valid debate but it adds nothing positive to this report at this stage."
"Instead, the report concentrates on what the EU's role will and should be in the future, assisting the new authorities in Iraq."
"Many issues are dealt with; I want to refer to three of them."
"First, in relation to political support, I was glad to hear Mr Brok referring to the visit of representatives from the transitional National Assembly to this Parliament recently, and it was a welcome event."
"They called for assistance, support and help in relation to the drafting of the new constitution in Iraq, which is something I think we should do wholeheartedly and enthusiastically."
"Primarily, we need to ensure that there is full participation of all groups in the drafting of that constitution."
"Second, in relation to security, we should not forget that, as we speak, there are European citizens in Iraq trying to provide security in difficult circumstances."
"We need to look forward to see what the EU can do collectively."
"To that end, I welcome the fact that we are going to see an EU delegation in Baghdad in the near future."
"I also welcome the Rule of Law and Police Training Mission, which will add considerably to the security situation in Iraq, and the new call for a new UN Security Council Resolution on Iraq, which is outlined in detail in the report."
"That is a brave new call."
"Finally, we should not forget our human rights principles, despite the very difficult and extreme circumstances that continue in Iraq, particularly in relation to the death penalty."
"Mr President, I welcome the emphasis of the rapporteur and of Amendment 12, by the PSE Group, in supporting the EU’s positive commitment to the social, economic and political reconstruction of Iraq, to the success of the January elections, to the doubling of international partners for Iraq, as represented at the Brussels Conference, and to our united condemnation of all violence, kidnappings and human rights abuses within Iraq."
"The European Parliamentary Labour Party cannot support those amendments that seek to rekindle the divisions of the past."
"In that context, I note that Amendment 3, by the Verts/ALE Group, seeks to delete this Parliament’s commitment to fighting both terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"Everyone should vote against that amendment."
"Finally, there is a link between this debate and the next on development."
"Twenty years under Saddam Hussein left five million Iraqis suffering from chronic poverty, the fastest increase in child mortality of any country in the world, access to safe water for less than half the people in rural areas and 60% wholly dependent on food handouts."
"Today the European Parliament reaffirms its commitment to the right for development for the Iraqi people, as well as their right to peace."
". Mr President, the post-Iraq-war phase can be compared to some degree with the period after the Second World War, even if it is not on the same scale."
"However, we have to get over all our past differences and quarrels and look to the future."
"That is the only solution."
"We cannot just talk about the situation, we have to take action, we have to turn the page."
"That is why the Commission has been seeking over the past two years to contribute, through its support for reconstruction, to promote reconciliation within Iraq and in the international community."
"As Mr Brok and Mrs Morgantini pointed out, we must also ensure that the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Iraq produce benefits for all Iraqis."
"That must be an inclusive approach."
"Of course we have to look to the constitution."
"It has to be a constitution that gives ownership to the Iraqis, that really protects the territorial integrity of Iraq but, at the same time, looks to the federal possibilities."
"That is the only way to secure the right balance between the different ethnic elements."
"It also has to look to the future, creating a modern society in which women and religious communities must be given an appropriate stake."
"Therefore, the constitution is of the greatest importance."
"It is also very important to build the institutions of the new Iraq."
"There has been a great deal of talk about energy and trade."
"I believe that, in order to restore the possibility for Iraqis to develop themselves, there has to be capacity-building with the Ministries of Trade and Energy."
"We supported the elections and we will support the next elections if the security situation will allow it."
"It is also very important to ensure the further development of the Iraqi police and judiciary."
"The ‘Eujustlex’ mission that began on 1 July will be of great importance and will hopefully make a significant contribution."
"This involves the training of 770 policemen and judiciary members."
"We also have to refocus on the social services, such as education, health and sanitation."
"People must be allowed to live their lives."
"At the moment they only have electricity for a few hours per day, in a climate where temperatures reach 50 degrees centigrade."
"We know how difficult it is."
"Conditions on the ground are exceedingly difficult."
"We are also aware of delays in some implementation because of the difficult situation."
"We therefore have ongoing discussions with the World Bank, the UN and the Iraqis themselves."
"It is clear that the main responsibility lies with them, but we must give them all our assistance."
"I agree that it is very important that the international community encourage Iraq’s neighbours to adopt the same approach, striving towards reconciliation and unity in Iraq."
"That is the clear message we gave in the international conference."
"We support the WTO proposals regarding Iraq."
"Trade and cooperation agreements could be the next step, subject to negotiations with the Iraqis."
"There is a chance for them to build – in a new way – on the current situation in which we are providing them with assistance, but this must be done in a much more orderly way."
"I am very grateful for the support of the European Parliament."
"I congratulate Mr Dimitrakopoulos for the excellent work he has done."
"You see, I can learn and will do better next time."
". Mr President, may I through you thank all Members of the European Parliament for a very constructive debate, which has been very interesting for me as well."
"Of course, it is right in one sense to say you cannot discuss the future without understanding the past, and there are different analyses of the past."
"I happen to think that war was justified at the time."
"I still do."
"I respect those who take a different view."
"What I would say, however, is this: we can argue – and we will argue for a long time – about the legitimacy of the military action, but please do not now argue about the legitimacy of what is a democratically elected Iraqi Government."
"There were some speakers who challenged the legitimacy of the current government."
"With respect, that is wrong."
"The elections that took place on 30 January took place under a United Nations mandate, under intense international scrutiny."
"They were fair elections: 8.6 million Iraqis voted, and they produced a representative assembly which now has instructions from the United Nations to bring forward a draft constitution in August and to have it ratified in a referendum in October for there to be further elections leading to a more permanent national government in December."
"I suggest that it is responsibility of the whole of the international community, in support of that unanimous United Nations mandate, to ensure that this process works and works effectively."
"I am deeply grateful to the Commission and to the Parliament for the support that they are giving to that process."
"Yes, the situation in Iraq today is serious."
"Yes, too many are being killed, but I would remind those who describe it simply as some kind of legitimate resistance that the overwhelming majority of the victims of this terrorism are not coalition forces, they are ordinary Iraqis."
"I would also remind colleagues here that in many – not all – areas of Iraq there is a fair degree of normality."
"There have been very few incidents."
"Why?"
"Because the terrorism there has been defeated."
"Where there is abnormality, it is because of the terrorism."
"I am not naive."
"I accept that, where there is this level of terrorism, there has to be a political process to try to bring people in as well as an immediate security response."
"It is a matter of great regret that most Sunnis decided not to participate in the elections in January."
"What has happened since – and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and I met representatives of the Sunni community and discussed the matter with members of the Shia and Kurdish communities – is an effort by the Iraqi Government to bring Sunnis in."
"It has been difficult but, just two days ago, the National Assembly decided to confirm the representation of 15 Sunnis on the constitutional committee."
"That is of profound importance, a first step in reaching out to the Sunni community."
"There have to be other steps taken as well, so you end up with an Iraq that represents all the communities."
"The other thing I would say is that any analysis of opinion in Iraq suggests that, despite the violence today, most Iraqis prefer what has happened and is happening today to what was going on before."
"And yes, there was terrorism before the war: it was state terrorism that led to the death of hundreds of thousands of ordinary Iraqis."
"And no – hundreds of thousands have not been killed since the war, some scores of thousands have been."
"It is too many, but at least now the Iraqis can look forward to a democratic, peaceful future in which they control their destiny, which they never could under Saddam."
"There have been arguments within Europe as elsewhere about this situation in Iraq."
"Given those, we greatly welcome the very constructive approach adopted by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and his committee."
"I thank you very much for that."
"I know, given the range of opinions, that it was a very hard task to bring together a sense of this and of action for the future."
"It is well illustrated by today’s debate."
"I am grateful to Mr Dimitrakopoulos and also to the Commission."
"For our part, in the Presidency, we will do all we can over the next six months actively to support the work of the European Union as well as accepting our own responsibilities within Iraq as one of the contributors to the Coalition."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at noon today."
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"- the Council and Commission statements on Africa and the challenges of globalisation,"
"- and the oral question to the Council by Mrs Morgantini on behalf of the Committee on Development: ‘Global call to Action Against Poverty: Making Poverty History’ (B6-0248/2005)"
"- and the oral question to the Commission by Mrs Morgantini on behalf of the Committee on Development: ‘Global call to Action Against Poverty: Making Poverty History’ (B6-0249/2005)."
". Mr President, I wish to say, for the second time this morning, what an honour it is to address the European Parliament."
"I greatly value the dialogue I have had with Parliament and its committees, not just over the last four years as Britain’s Foreign Minister but over the previous four years as Britain’s Home Secretary."
"Indeed, I have been serving in the British Government long enough to recall our previous Presidency, seven and a half years ago, when I had the privilege of chairing the Justice and Home Affairs Council."
"I also wish to congratulate Parliament on its initiative today to support the ‘Make Poverty History’ campaign."
"It is a sign of your strong commitment to global development in what is a vital year for Africa and for the poorest nations worldwide."
"Mrs Morgantini has submitted to me some detailed questions."
"I have already sent her a detailed answer to those questions and I shall make sure they are more widely available."
"In my speech I shall be answering many of the points she raised."
"Over the last few months, the headlines in Europe have often been about disagreement and difficulty."
"The voters in two founder Member States have brought into sharp relief questions of profound concern to all Europe’s citizens."
"How can the European Union better deliver to them the prosperity and security which we all seek in a rapidly changing world?"
"Some of the answers to that question will concern the European Union’s internal policies, including future financing."
"The United Kingdom, as Tony Blair said to Parliament just two weeks ago, takes its responsibilities as EU President very seriously."
"We will work hard to reach agreement on the Financial Perspective by the end of the year."
"Alongside this, we will seek to conduct the wider debate on Europe’s future direction and priorities in an open and inclusive way, respectful of the different viewpoints in this Parliament and amongst Europe’s governments and citizens."
"Yet if we are to respond fully to people’s hopes and fears for the future, it is just as important that the EU strengthen its actions in the wider world."
"One of the most striking developments of the last few years has been how much we have done already in the European Union to rise to that challenge, on a basis of very broad agreement."
"A few years ago, Europe’s nations were severely divided, as we were reminded in the previous debate over Iraq."
"Yet today we are taking strong common action in support of peace in the Middle East, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo."
"We have a comprehensive programme of engagement with the new Iraq."
"We are leading the international community in the difficult but vital process of engagement with Iran."
"The story is the same on security and defence."
"Just a few years ago the debate on ESDP revolved around the location and staffing of a small planning cell in a suburb of Brussels."
"But today an EU force is working with NATO in Bosnia on the ground."
"EU missions there and in Macedonia are training police."
"We are also training Iraqi police and judiciary."
"We have two European missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo."
"We are assisting the African Union force in Sudan."
"So, today, the European Security and Defence Policy is not a piece of paper: it is making a real difference to thousands of lives across the globe."
"I want the United Kingdom’s Presidency – and the years ahead – to be a time in which we build on these achievements and further strengthen the European Union’s influence and power as a force for good in the world."
"Nowhere is that more important than in Africa."
"Africa today is poorer than it was 25 years ago."
"Half of the population south of the Sahara lives on less than a dollar a day."
"Africa’s share of world trade is one third of its level in 1980."
"The total national income of sub-Saharan African countries is less than the developed world – the EU, the United States, Japan and a few other countries – spend on farming subsidies."
"A major breakthrough is needed if we are to achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"At the current pace, it will take Sub-Saharan Africa more than 100 years to meet the targets for primary education or reducing infant mortality."
"For three of the goals – those for hunger, poverty and sanitation – the situation in sub-Saharan Africa is getting worse day by day."
"Meanwhile, life expectancy in Africa today is just 42, less than the age of most people in this Chamber."
"It is predicted that in some African countries life expectancy will be under 30 in five years’ time."
"Twenty million Africans have already died of AIDS, now the continent’s biggest killer."
"Three-quarters of those living with HIV worldwide are in Africa."
"Nelson Mandela said: ‘Like slavery and apartheid, poverty is not natural."
"It is man-made and can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings’."
"Mandela was right."
"Africa has all too many examples of how the actions of human beings prevent other human beings from building better lives for themselves."
"In Darfur – as Hilary Benn, my colleague and friend, the Secretary of State for International Development in the United Kingdom – and I have both seen for ourselves, the government-backed militia has killed many thousands of people."
"Millions have had to flee their homes."
"In Zimbabwe, the government has already trampled over democracy and basic human rights and has ruined an economy that was once amongst the strongest in the whole of Africa."
"The government in Zimbabwe has now turned on the poorest and the most vulnerable in that country, driving hundreds of thousands from their homes and destroying their livelihoods."
"The problem of Zimbabwe is not one of intrinsic lack of resources or of climate but one of very bad governance."
"The European Union has been right to send a firm message that the government of Zimbabwe’s behaviour is wholly unacceptable."
"We have done so through new extended and restrictive measures against the Mugabe regime, and through a firm condemnation of the latest abuses."
"But amongst all this gloom, let us remember that the picture in Africa is far more complex than it at first appears."
"In the 1970s you could count the democracies of Africa on the fingers of one hand and still have two fingers left: there were three."
"Today there are more than thirty democratically elected governments across the continent."
"Only a few years ago, armed conflicts were ablaze across Africa, but today sustainable peace is taking root in countries such as Burundi, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Angola."
"The Organisation of African Unity used to preach non-interference in its members’ internal affairs."
"In contrast, its successor, the new African Union, is founded not on non-interference but on non-indifference."
"It is taking as its inspiration what the European Union has been able to achieve in a continent that was once itself characterised not by the peace and stability we now enjoy, but by conflict, war and bloodshed."
"Through the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, NEPAD, African leaders have agreed to a peer review mechanism which many developed world governments, many governments in Europe, would find uncomfortably intrusive."
"Nor is the economic situation in Africa as uniformly negative as it sometimes seems."
"Some countries, such as Mozambique and Ethiopia, have achieved growth rates of around 7%, a level sufficient to lift large numbers of people out of poverty."
"The continent has enormous resources, both physical and human, and these positive factors should give us real cause for hope."
"Africans want a better future and we in Europe, with our international partners, must continue to deliver the support to enable reform in Africa to take root and in turn help Africans to change the situation for the better."
"So we have made this year a year of action and we have already achieved a great deal."
"Last month’s European Council is currently famous for its disagreements on the European Union budget, but I suggest that our children will better remember it as the Council which decided to double European aid to Africa over the next five years."
"That was the enduring legacy of that Council and, with luck and work, the temporary problems over the European budget will indeed be temporary."
"We are also resolved to make that aid better coordinated and more effective, building on the agreements made at the OECD meeting in Paris this spring."
"We have to ensure that the aid does not compound bad governance and enrich the corrupt, but rather that it is used to drive up standards of governance and help the poorest, for whom it is intended."
"The G8 has agreed 100% debt relief for all highly indebted poor countries and the G8 leaders who assemble today in Gleneagles and meet today and tomorrow will discuss further support."
"At the United Nations Summit in September, we are going to review the Millennium Development Goals and strengthen international action to achieve them."
"However, we have to do more."
"Under our Presidency, the United Kingdom will work to deliver a European strategy to support Africa’s successful development."
"The strategy needs to be comprehensive and ambitious; it should go beyond financial support and show how Africa will invest in people, in good governance, in growth, peace and security."
"As part of this strategy, we have to deliver better access to developed markets for the world’s poorest countries, so as to make the Doha development agenda a reality, and we should start with this December’s meeting in Hong Kong."
"The European Union, the United States and other rich countries must honour their commitments to abolish export subsidies and do so to a clear and explicit timetable."
"We have to recognise, too, the central importance of peace and stability in Africa."
"Already there are thousands of refugees in Darfur who are safer."
"Why?"
"Thanks to financing from the European Union Peace Facility for the African Union’s mission there."
"Through the facility, we can increase our support further by supporting the African Union and organisations like the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, which itself has played such an important role in tackling conflict in West Africa."
"The Peace Facility really has been a success, but the money allocated to it is running out and we need to agree adequate long-term funding for it."
"As Africa’s leaders themselves have recognised, Europe can help by promoting better and more democratic governance in Africa."
"To return to the issue of Zimbabwe, I greatly welcome the European Parliament’s calls for action on elections and rigorous enforcement of European Union sanctions."
"The Joint EU-ACP Parliamentary Assembly has been a strong supporter of better governance in African states, as well as those in the Caribbean and Pacific."
"The Cotonou Agreement allows us to suspend aid in the worst cases."
"We should not only remain prepared to use that provision but, I suggest, be far more proactive in monitoring progress on democracy and on governance."
"It is the people who have most to gain from democracy and better governance, the ordinary people in the ACP countries in Africa, who themselves are wanting us to make use of these mechanisms within agreements like the Cotonou Agreement."
"The great Live 8 concerts that took place across Europe and across the globe last weekend are still echoing in our ears."
"They and the wider interest generated by the G8 Gleneagles meeting have hugely raised expectations in Africa and in Europe and across the developed world that this time the aid effort to Africa will work."
"Let us hope that it will."
"Let us hope that the developed nations actually deliver the aid they are promising, but let us also understand this: the process will only work if governance in Africa is improved and corruption there is cut down."
"In our action in Africa and across the world, the European Union can draw on three great strengths. Firstly, the EU’s intrinsic power and influence."
"When we speak together we can set the international agenda."
"We are doing so on world trade, but I have seen that too in leading with Javier Solana, with Joschka Fischer and now with Philippe Douste-Blazy in the difficult Iran dossier."
"The strength of the European Union when it is united is phenomenal."
"The strength we have is the strength of our global connections."
"There is hardly a country anywhere in the world that does not have some special tie of history or friendship with one or other of the European Union’s Member States."
"The latest enlargement, last May, added further to that network of partnership and trust and our global reach is mirrored in this Parliament and in your strong international engagement."
"The EU is today building stronger relationships with neighbours such as Russia and new strategic partners such as China and India, which are going to hold such important summits with the EU during our Presidency."
"Obviously we will wield greater influence with such strategic partners when we act together."
"The third, and perhaps most important, strength is the strength of the European Union’s values."
"Soft power in foreign policy has been defined as making others want what we want."
"The European Union’s enlargement is one of the most striking and powerful examples of that soft power in action."
"The magnetic pull of the EU’s success, its values and institutions, have helped to transform first southern, then central and eastern Europe and the prospect of EU membership is now spreading reform and stability to Turkey and across the Western Balkans."
"Others here perhaps know the Western Balkans better than I do, but all of us who know the Western Balkans know that in reality the only thing that is helping to push those divided communities towards some prospect of peace and security is the European Union, its values and its strength."
"The June European Union Council recognised this in reaffirming its intention that the EU should fully implement its existing commitments on enlargement, including opening negotiations with Turkey on 3 October."
"Meanwhile, our neighbourhood policy is helping to promote our values further to the east and to the south, including to Ukraine and to the Mediterranean countries, with which we will also host summits during the UK Presidency."
"Those values are the bedrock of the transatlantic relationship, the world’s greatest alliances of liberal democracies, essential in tackling the global challenges of the future from terrorism and proliferation to poverty and climate change."
"Through these assets – our own strength, our global connections and the power of our values – the European Union today has even greater potential to increase its strength as a force for good across the world."
"I look forward to working with you all towards that goal during our Presidency."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, when I requested the development and humanitarian aid portfolio, I knew that Africa would be at the heart of my actions and my commitment."
"My commitment is stimulated by feelings of indignation and of urgency: to this day, Africa remains cut off from the world, on the fringes of our consciences and isolated from the benefits of globalisation."
"My commitment also springs from a recognition that the context has changed and that we now have the opportunity, undoubtedly a unique opportunity, to make Africa a more prosperous, more stable and better governed continent."
"In this context Europe can and must make a difference, given that it is now possible to create conditions favourable to the eradication of poverty and that there is no longer any excuse for not doing so."
"Africa has changed."
"The Africans themselves have decided to turn their backs on fate and to take their destiny into their own hands."
"The energetic and impressive action of the African Union in Darfur, Togo and Cote d’Ivoire, for example, has given a new dimension to the principle that African solutions must be found to African crises."
"This action, based on robust regional organisations, opens up hitherto unhoped-for prospects for peace, stability and security."
"Furthermore, the African Union is supported by a strong leadership which is now sketching out a promising vision."
"If Africa has changed, Europe too has changed."
"Increasingly Europe is establishing itself as the spokesman for a world that has a greater sense of solidarity and fairness and for a system that is more multilateral."
"This year, 2005, the year of development, Europe must make its voice heard as the world’s biggest donor of development aid and as such it can push the international community to take tangible, voluntary action, thereby preventing the Millennium Development Goals from soon becoming synonymous with broken promises."
"I am also very pleased to note that the European Council – as has just been stated – has followed the Commission’s proposal, which will indeed make it possible to double public development aid by 2015 and to double aid to Africa by 2010."
"Finally, the world has changed."
"The events of recent years have shown us the extent to which the existence of failing states can be a source of instability and can create safe havens for terrorists and criminals."
"The intensification of globalisation at all levels also makes an intensification of solidarity indispensable."
"I now see development policy as the key tool for putting a human face on globalisation."
"In any case, I see no better one."
"Globalisation has the specific characteristic that it is not born, as some would have us believe, out of a political decision made hidden away in some dark corner."
"Globalisation has not really been orchestrated; it is a spontaneous process, welcomed by some, feared by others, but over which, and this is the trouble, no authority, be it national or international, has direct control."
"I am, of course, one of those who believe that it has much to contribute and that, in any case, it offers more advantages than drawbacks."
"We must respond, of course, to the intensification of globalisation at all levels with an intensification of solidarity at all levels."
"After all, what can globalisation mean for people who have no access to water, for young people who have no access to education, for children who are dying from diseases that we could treat."
"Even if there are some who dream of a return to models which, sadly, smack of déjà vu, I believe that it would be wrong to think that people do not want globalisation or that they want to turn back the clock."
"What we want, as Europeans, is globalisation that benefits everybody, that is a positive lever for the whole of humanity, without exception."
"In this context, nothing is more urgent than ensuring that globalisation can function in Africa and for Africa."
"Admittedly, in this context market liberalisation is only beneficial when the State has the ability to enact rules to curb abuses and to promote the common interest."
"As you know, to benefit from the opportunities offered by globalisation, governments must guarantee a macroeconomic framework."
"They must also create effective and predictable conditions for this macroeconomic framework and must obviously also ensure governance within a framework that fosters economic activity."
"They must also encourage and support a watchful civil society that guarantees fair and balanced redistribution of wealth and other services, such as, for example, access to justice, administration, health and education."
"From this point of view, and particularly for Africa, I believe that special efforts need to be focused on promoting equality between men and women."
"For all these reasons, I believe that it would be useful to set out a common European strategy, not only for development but also for Africa, a strategy that is capable of responding to the new geopolitical order in Africa, a strategy that we want to draw up with our African partners in order to build on this new impetus at global level."
"It has been said that the African Union has very quickly become a key political negotiator and a veritable driving force for change for the continent."
"At the same time, I think it is useful to stress that this construction will not stand up by itself."
"The house of the African Union must be built on solid regional building blocks."
"There will be no continental integration without regional organisation that is strong, ambitious and recognised."
"An ambitious political partnership between the European Union and the African Union is, therefore, more necessary than ever before."
"On what should this marriage be based?"
"I do not have an exhaustive answer, but, nonetheless, I shall confine myself to suggesting four avenues that we might explore together."
"As you are aware, at the end of the year I will be tabling not only a statement on development, an updating of development policy that we will, of course, have debated and that we will debate together, but also a proper master plan for Africa."
"The first axis is governance."
"No one disagrees, of course, that governance is of prime importance."
"It has been said that Africa is not poor; it is, unfortunately, badly governed."
"Africa, however, is starting to move."
"Efforts to improve governance are being made at various different levels."
"Over the last five years more than two thirds of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa have held multiparty elections, some freer and fairer than others, and several changes of government have taken place democratically and peacefully: only very recently there were elections in Burundi."
"I hope that we will also see significant progress in March in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"I also wish to remind you that 23 African countries have ratified the Statute creating the International Criminal Court."
"It is worth noting this when certain Western democratic powers still have not done so."
"The most striking fact of recent years is that Africa itself has given itself a vision, a mission and principles."
"As regards governance, this fact integrated by the institution of the African Union and reflected by the vision of NEPAD constitutes a break with the past and the practices of the past."
"This vision and these principles have not remained purely declarations of intent, because the African peer review mechanism henceforth gives Africa a unique tool for the support of Africans by Africans."
"This mechanism deserves our full support."
"The second axis is infrastructure and networks."
"We all agree that without trans-African networks, without infrastructure, no development will be possible."
"The European Union itself is proof of that."
"The European Union has demonstrated the relevance of this fact."
"It is vital to intensify current efforts to improve and to ensure the durability of the infrastructure networks, both to accelerate growth and to promote trade."
"That is why the Commission proposes to develop a plan for a Europe-Africa partnership on infrastructure and networks."
"Through this partnership we shall support the development of trans-African networks which are essential for interconnectivity and the dissemination of knowledge across the continent, trans-European telecommunications networks, railways, airlines and infrastructure for improving access, which is also very important: ports, airports, navigable waterways, everything relating to energy and water."
"In parallel with this partnership on infrastructure, we shall have to break new ground in terms of financing mechanisms, based on the participation of the private sector and other sponsors."
"I shall return to that when I make my statement on the EDF in a few months’ time."
"The third axis is, obviously, trade."
"All those involved recognise the central role of trade in economic growth."
"Africa’s share in global exports has fallen by almost 60%, which corresponds to a loss of USD 70 billion a year, that is the equivalent of 21% of the region’s GDP, more than five times the USD 13 billion that come into Africa every year in development aid."
"Clearly we have to reverse this trend."
"As you know, we are currently negotiating economic partnership agreements with six regions, four of which are in sub-Saharan Africa."
"Peter Mandelson, the Commissioner for Trade, is negotiating these agreements."
"There is no doubt that this is the most ambitious trade process ever negotiated between the North and the South."
"For the first time the European Union is providing financial support to its partners’ negotiation teams."
"For the first time trade agreements are being negotiated with the development of our partners as the sole objective."
"For the first time these agreements are based on, and for, the regional integration of our partners and, for the first time, our financial and technical cooperation can be used for reform, budgetary support, action to improve the capacity for supply growth, and the building of an attractive environment for investment and trade."
"Finally, the last axis is culture."
"Culture is a key dimension of development which, in my opinion, has hitherto been forgotten all too often."
"It is, however, vital."
"Culture is the soul and the expression of a people."
"It determines the way a society functions and therefore also its economic structure."
"That is why it seems to me that taking into account the particular societal and cultural identity of Africa is the only way in which we can ensure that our development aid is rooted in the reality on the ground and boost its effectiveness."
"I shall conclude, Mr President, by raising a number of questions, which it would be desirable to debate."
"I have heard talk of sanctions."
"I feel that sanctions are only right when they affect the people responsible."
"By contrast, I do not believe in sanctions when they affect the general population directly or indirectly."
"It would be useful to open this debate."
"I think we also need to discuss the famous question of ownership or appropriation."
"How best can we ensure that the people themselves take charge of their destiny and their development?"
"Appropriation goes hand in hand with the principle of sustainability."
"How can we ensure that the programmes and projects underway continue to have an impact once the outside operators leave the area?"
"There is also the question of choice or whether the priority should be given to budgetary aid, and under what conditions, rather than to aid through projects."
"This question will, no doubt, form the subject of a debate at the end of the year, along with consistency and coordination."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have rapidly sketched out the framework within which we can bring answers to a subject as vast and as important as the one that you have put on the agenda."
"We shall, of course, have the opportunity to return to these questions before the end of the year in the context of the new policy and in the context of this focus on Africa."
"For my part I should like to express to you my optimism."
"I am optimistic firstly because a certain number of propitious circumstances have coincided. There is the fact that the British Presidency has put Africa right at the very top of the European Union’s agenda, and right at the top of the G8’s agenda, and the fact that a strong consensus is now emerging that we shall not achieve the Millennium Goals globally or individually unless we make a huge effort on Africa and quickly."
"I would say that we must do more, we must do it better and we must do it more quickly."
"As far as we are concerned, we shall do our best."
"I have no doubt that the European Parliament will be the watchful guardian of these promises."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Michel and Mr Straw."
"We will certainly take into account, within our committee, the assessments and written replies that have been sent to us."
"We will not be merely custodians, but we intend to take action for a common policy."
"On 2 July I participated, together with hundreds of thousands of others, in the march across Edinburgh to call for poverty to be made history and to call on the G8 countries for a fair trade policy, more development aid, stringent controls on arms sales and a policy for peace and justice, rather than endless wars."
"The demonstration was on a huge scale, with children, women, men, young and old participating, all in full awareness of their actions."
"These people are an asset to our democracy – they are voices that should be listened to."
"We in the European Parliament have done so, symbolically encircling the Chamber with a white band and asking Members to sign in support of the campaign organised by hundreds of organisations across the world."
"The signatures collected will be sent by President Borrell to Mr Straw so that they can be given to the G8 leaders."
"This is already an action, an assumption of responsibility."
"Nelson Mandela, in his message to the G8, expressly said that hunger is also the hunger for justice and added – and I share the sentiment his words express – that poverty, like slavery, is not natural but man-made and can be eradicated by human beings."
"He also added that while poverty persists there is no true freedom."
"Overcoming poverty is not an act of charity but an act of justice and defence of a fundamental human right: the right to live in dignity."
"Poverty is not a misfortune, but the result of political and economic choices made regionally, nationally and internationally, and should be considered illegal."
"The greatest scandal is not that hunger and poverty exist, but that they persist even when we have the human and physical means to confront them decisively and resolutely."
"These are the concluding words of the New York declaration, signed by 111 governments meeting under the supervision of President Lula, and setting out financial instruments to promote development, including taxes, settlements, measures to combat tax evasion, to reduce costs and to increase the social responsibility of companies."
"These are instruments that should be seen as complementary to and not replacements for those that already exist."
"Overcoming poverty in poor countries, as well as in sections of so-called rich countries, does not mean just respecting the right to life."
"It is the best weapon against fundamentalism, brutal conflicts and terrorism."
"In recent years we have seen how the structural adjustment programmes, savage privatisations and the headlong liberalisation of markets and services – and in saying this I do not mean that I am opposed to trade – have helped to exacerbate the problem of hunger and poverty."
"I believe that we should be consistent in our choices and face with courage and vision the contradictions produced by international trade policies."
"When we talk about fair trade, we must be consistent."
"We cannot invade the markets of African countries with our subsidised products and destroy local economies."
"Mr Straw is right in saying that we cannot be partners if we do not take into account unequal conditions."
"For this reason, I believe that we ought to also consider very carefully reforms such as the sugar reform, which damage developing countries."
"The proposal to link aid to conditions too is an important step that we are taking, creating the conditions required for a real partnership."
"I hope that the awareness that can be observed in the people and among us will also be displayed at the next WTO round in Hong Kong and that the Millennium Objectives, which are a fundamental intermediate stage, can be achieved."
"The efforts made by Mr Michel and the Luxembourg Presidency at the Council of Ministers have been positive and have produced an increase in aid."
"This is a major step that should not be underestimated, but that is nonetheless not enough to reach the targets we have set ourselves."
"I hope that the UK Presidency, whose words convey such a high level of awareness, can do much more."
"The 0.7% that we have been hearing about since 1970 must finally become a reality."
"There are many other useful measures in addition to these."
"For example, for some time now there have been discussions in Parliament concerning increasing spending on development and education."
"In order to eradicate AIDS and to help the ill it is not just increased funds and a drugs access policy that are needed, but also control over and a vision of liberalising drugs licences."
"Another important issue is debt cancellation, which the African Union summit called for yesterday."
"We have achieved something, but it is not enough."
"We cannot consider the cancellation of debt as part of the balance-sheet of development aid, as is happening with regard to Iraq."
"There is still a lot to be done if 2005 is really to signal a historic turning point in the fight against poverty."
"Africa has strong resources that we can use."
". Mr President, Mr Straw, Commissioner Michel, first of all, I should like to warmly congratulate the organisers of the Global Call to Action Against Poverty campaign on their initiative."
"It is a sound initiative at an important point in time, since this coming autumn will see discussions taking place not only in the WTO and the G8, but also on the Millennium Development Goals."
"Poverty remains a problem with which we cannot live, and fighting it is central to MDG policy."
"As you are aware, the problem of poverty is at its worst in Africa, particularly in the sub-Sahara."
"As rapporteur for the development strategy for Africa, I am pleased that both the Commissioner and the British Presidency have chosen to give priority to Africa."
"I am also pleased about the manner in which they intend to address it, as they described it today."
"Further to the resolution, I should like to say that it is, of course, a good thing to free up more funds to fight poverty, but as someone said a moment ago, the solution to effective poverty reduction is not merely financial."
"It is more important to address its causes, which include mismanagement, corruption and trade barriers."
"As I see it, the European Union could act on at least two levels – firstly, through its own dealings with the poor countries, and secondly, in its own internal policy."
"Emergency aid will still sometimes be necessary, but, if we want to establish stable societies, we must, in our dealings with poor countries, concentrate on promoting good governance, building up capacity and economic empowerment, particularly of small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as a sound social infrastructure, good education and health care."
"We must concentrate on making our own policies more coherent, improving coordination, and making them more effective."
"As for the burden of debt, debt reduction is not a panacea for poverty."
"Debt reduction in itself does not guarantee development, nor is it a solution to such problems as corruption, the absence of the rule of law, human rights violations and economic instability; nor, indeed does it automatically benefit the poorest of the poor."
"In the final analysis, it is the countries themselves that are responsible for their own futures."
"We can only give them a helping hand, provided something is done about the quality and effective …"
". Mr President, for the Socialists, the eradication of poverty in the world is an absolute priority, because it is an issue of justice and solidarity, both of which are values fundamental to our ideological and political identity."
"Justice and solidarity are part of our contribution to the process that has led us to the European Union, but in the globalised world in which we must operate, justice and solidarity cannot be seen as something that should exclusively benefit our citizens and our territory."
"On the contrary: it is time for justice and solidarity to transcend our borders and to make their mark on all European policies and actions on the international stage, as laid down in the constitutional Treaty."
"The Socialists in the Committee on Development are pleased about two events that respond to this committee’s demands."
"The first is the Development Council in May’s confirmation of significant commitments with a view to realising the Millennium Development Objectives, maintaining the objectives set five years ago."
"The second is the British Presidency’s prioritisation of the eradication of poverty, with particular emphasis on Africa."
"We believe this to be justified, but we cannot exclude from the fight against poverty other areas of the planet in which there are terrible pockets of misery and in which inequalities even greater than those suffered in Africa also require our priority action."
"Through the wristband event, through this debate and through the resolution we are to approve, we are synchronising our actions with those of millions of Europeans throughout the Union at the moment."
"We have recently talked about the lack of understanding between the European leaders and bodies and our citizens."
"This mobilisation against poverty is now an excellent opportunity for agreement, proximity and reconciliation, but we must be careful!"
"The effects will only be positive if we do not abuse the trust placed in us, and if we go beyond words and good intentions."
"With regard to the eradication of poverty, we will be judged more by what we do in the future, and sooner rather than later, than what we say here now."
". Mr President, those of us who were in Edinburgh on Saturday were left in no doubt about the strength of popular support for making poverty history."
"I hope that the G8 meeting this week keeps faith with that passion."
"I welcome Mr Straw’s comments on the Doha agenda, but the fight against poverty will be won or lost not in headline talks between world leaders but in the anonymous rooms where civil servants hammer out the detail of trade agreements."
"Therefore, could the Commission and the Council give us an assurance today that, when it comes to nitty-gritty trade discussions in the months ahead, making poverty history will still be top of the agenda, away from the world’s media and away from parliamentary scrutiny?"
"In the detailed backroom discussions on agriculture production, export subsidies, sugar reform, imports of processed goods, rules of origin, the contentious economic partnership agreements, will poverty reduction still be the Commission’s and the Council’s priority, even when European agriculture and big businesses are lobbying heavily?"
"We must go one step further than trade agreements and support developing countries in building their capacity for trade through things like microcredit and better transport links, as Commissioner Michel mentioned, so that both regional and world markets can be accessed to the full."
"Some trade-related technical assistance already exists: for example, the Commission’s pesticide initiative programme, which helps African farmers meet European food safety standards."
"However, that initiative is a drop in the ocean compared to what is needed."
"Liberals and Democrats have always stressed the importance of fighting corruption and fostering good governance."
"Part of that is a duty of respect to democratically-elected governments, whether we agree with them politically or not."
"Indeed, in its report, the Commission for Africa stressed the importance of pragmatism, of having a programme of action based not on ideology but on sound evidence about what works and what does not."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, more than thirty years ago the ecologist René Dumont said that Africa was in a sorry state."
"Today, it is again centre stage in an even more terrible state."
"And now you must recognise that the dogmatic liberalisation of trade, the plans for structural adjustment, the excessive privatisation and, of course, the broken promises have only served to worsen a situation that was already very difficult to the detriment of education and health policies in particular."
"Having said that, the essential question is for the North, for us, to answer."
"Are we prepared to completely revise our development model, how we produce, consume and move around, and to rethink the very organisation and meaning of our societies?"
"What is needed now is for us to set about resolving, in the North as well as in the South, problems as fundamental as the three that I should like to list for you here."
"Firstly, there is the problem of access to energy, petroleum and mining resources, on which we are far too dependent and which have not helped the development of Africa."
"Are we ready, yes or no, to implement a completely new energy policy that is sustainable, fair and environmentally friendly?"
"Secondly, there is the problem of access to land and to food, while respecting local rural cultures and territories."
"Are we ready to revise our intensive and over-industrialised agricultural policies, our unfair, subsidised trade policies, and to control the market and the price of products from the South in such a way that they are profitable?"
"Thirdly, there is the problem of access to democracy, the rule of law and peace, at local level as well as at global level."
"Are we prepared to make our international bodies democratic, to support democrats in Africa, at the risk of losing a part of that excessive power that the North has over the planet, powers symbolised by the G8 who are now shut away, as if in a fortress, at Gleneagles?"
"If we cannot clearly say yes to these three questions at least, then this great rousing media show, with the generous white knight coming to the aid of Africa, will have been, once again, no more than a sham."
"The European Union can no longer allow itself to disappoint."
"Now, for our part, we are ready to shoulder our responsibilities."
". Mr President, what we are doing today is securing the human right to a life worth living – no more and no less than that."
"With the G8 summit in the offing, I want to underline the fundamental demands, made above all by many African movements, for fair trade to be guaranteed, for the poorer countries’ debt crisis to be brought to an end, for far more resources to be made available for aid, and for it to be ensured that such aid is of the highest quality."
"The European Union must regard these demands as being addressed to itself and must consistently contend for a just global economic order."
"I call for disclosure of the extent to which official development aid and partnership agreements constitute a sort of development aid for big European businesses."
"Before the EU’s summit on development policy kicks off, we want an answer to the question as to how the EU will ensure that industry receives no support of such a scandalous kind."
"Mr President, the British Presidency, the Commission, the President of Parliament, Bob Geldof: everybody is talking about it."
"And we are all slapping ourselves on the back; there is a mood of self-congratulation over our giving more money to Africa, as if, somehow, money will solve the whole problem."
"Well, I am afraid that I remain a bit of a cynic and I see foreign aid as poor people in rich countries giving money to rich people in poor countries."
"Frankly, I think the atmosphere here on Monday, when we discussed this, and again today, smacks of rank hypocrisy: all the while we have the common agricultural policy; all the while we have high tariff barriers against agricultural goods; all the while we have the sugar regime and the export credit system."
"I know that Mr Blair wants to reform the common agricultural policy."
"I suspect he is going to struggle, but there is one thing the British Presidency could do over the course of the next six months to really help Africa."
"We have spent over EUR 2 billion of European taxpayers’ money bribing poor black African governments to allow the Spanish fleet in to fish."
"It has had environmentally disastrous consequences, we have taken away the livelihoods of tens of thousands of indigenous poor black Africans, and we have actually killed hundreds of them into the bargain."
"Starting with the Comoros deal, renewable in September, will you in the British Presidency please stop these appalling fisheries deals and do something to really help Africa?"
". Mr President, in the words of Nelson Mandela, ‘Like slavery and apartheid, poverty is not natural."
"It is man made and can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings’."
"Thirty thousand children a day die as a result of extreme poverty."
"We must look into our hearts and pose the question that is on everyone’s lips at present: do I, do we, have the will to make poverty history?"
"We have the cash, we have the drugs, we have the science, but do we have the will?"
"That is the main question to be posed here today."
"Millions of people all over the world are trapped in bitter, unrelenting poverty because of largely man-made factors: a questionable global trade system, demands from prosperous countries for large amounts of money to service debts."
"The gap between the rich and the poor has never been wider."
"Malnutrition, corruption, AIDS, malaria, conflict, illiteracy and suffocating bad debts are crippling the poorer nations of this world."
"As the Commissioner outlined, progress is being made in Africa and we must remember that, but a lot more needs to be done."
"A recent G8 meeting agreed that debts owed by the world’s poorest countries to the World Bank, the IMF and the African Development Bank would be partially cancelled – USD 1 billion over ten years."
"It is a small amount, but it is a step in the right direction."
"However, an awful lot more needs to be done."
"It is imperative that bad debt relief be organised so as to ensure that corrupt African leaders do not rearm themselves to bolster highly questionable regimes."
"We must make sure that we in Europe do not rearm them."
"The cancellation of all debt can only be effective if international aid is continued at a sustainable level."
"The European Union donates the most aid at present and it remains at the forefront in guaranteeing the full implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, including the commitment to contribute 0.7% of GNP per annum."
"I would urge all wealthy nations to affirm their commitment to fulfilling their aid obligation within a reasonable and realistic time frame."
"The recent worldwide Live 8 concert spearheaded by Bob Geldof displayed global support for making poverty history, as did the 200 000 people who took to the streets of Edinburgh in advance of the G8 Summit that starts today."
"We witnessed both young and old expressing a very strong view."
"This Parliament, other parliaments and politicians are often accused of ignoring what people really want."
"The people have spoken on this issue and we must act – and act decisively."
"As the G8 Summit gets under way at Gleneagles in Scotland today, let us bear in mind some words of wisdom from the much respected Nelson Mandela: ‘[...] overcoming poverty is not a gesture of charity."
"It is an act of justice."
"It is the protection of a fundamental human right, the right to dignity and a decent life’."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the socialists of the new Italian Socialist Party and as a member of the Committee on Development."
"According to the classification lists and assessment criteria of organisations such as the World Bank,Freedom House and Transparency Internationala growing number of African countries now have the leadership and quality of governance to be able to obtain economic results, but they do not have the requisite resources."
"Even countries governed relatively well remain, in reality, prisoners of the poverty trap."
"They are too poor to manage to trigger economic development processes or even merely to achieve basic growth."
"With extremely low levels of internal savings, and external investment flows that are equally low, the current economic conditions in Africa do not offer any hope for escape from poverty."
"The rich countries ought to commit themselves to doubling aid in the 2005-2015 period, achieving at least 0.5% of GDP by 2010 and 0.7% by 2015."
"This increase seems a very small thing when compared with the wealth of countries with a high income or with military spending worldwide, which amounts to USD 900 billion a year."
"The credibility and workability of the international system are at stake."
"If decisive steps are not taken in 2005, the poor countries, however well governed they are, will not manage to implement a strategy aimed at achieving the Millennium Goals and faith in the promises of the international community with regard to the fight against poverty – already weak – will vanish forever."
"Mr President, last Sunday my mother celebrated her 100th birthday, a century which has seen wars, famines and pandemics, but also enormous strides in scientific knowledge and capacity."
"When she was 69, the World Food Conference pledged a world free from hunger."
"When she was 91, the World Food Summit abandoned that pledge and aimed only to halve the number to 400 million by 2015."
"Now that pledge has slipped to 2030."
"The last century saw millions killed in wars."
"The last 50 years have seen 400 million die of hunger: three times the cull of a century’s wars."
"In health, the year 2000 saw, as we know, three million die from AIDS."
"But, as we probably do not know, 2.9 million died from diabetes."
"When we were in Mali recently I saw the consequences of the inability to afford medicines, insulin, specialists and nurses: amputations, blindness and early death."
"So many diseases are untreated or poorly treated and the result is millions incapacitated, with enormous costs to families and to nations."
"It really is a case of no health, no wealth."
"Those are the challenges, and the answers are capacity-building aid, untied aid, micro-credit schemes to build economies from the bottom upwards; avoiding putting money into the pockets of corrupt officials and politicians; avoiding making aid millionaires; helping to end tyrannies in countries like Zimbabwe; avoiding waste on consultancies and top-heavy charities; cutting subsidies in Europe and removing the obstacles to trade from developing countries."
"Often when we set new standards for Europe, we do not help the developing countries to meet those standards so that they can meet our import requirements."
"Lastly, on debt, let us not make the developing countries uncreditworthy."
"Let us find ways of repaying the debt repayments into those countries, into the Millennium Development Goals, into the country strategy papers, and then debt can be a benefit rather than a burden."
"Mr President, ‘Everyone belongs to the world and the world belongs to everyone’, according to my favourite Dutch musician, Thé Lau of The Scene, and also according to Live 8, as transmitted on 140 television channels."
"It is now for politicians like us to turn things around, and we have six months in which to do it, with Gleneagles, the UN Millennium Summit and Hong Kong."
"At present, 2015, the date named in the Millennium Goals, seems to be getting further and further away."
"We are not going about things the right way, but we do now have three meetings which can help us to change tack."
"There are four important things that I think the EU presidency has to do."
"Firstly, as Mr Straw said himself: ‘Abolish export subsidies’."
"I sincerely hope that he was saying this on behalf of the Council."
"A round for free?"
"Secondly, cancel debts, provided we use these for development, but not from existing aid budgets, though, for we would be tapping into our own coffers."
"Thirdly, five of the eight Millennium Goals concern two of the most important conditions for development, namely basic education and health care."
"Although we should be using 35% of the funds the EU has set aside for this purpose, with 20% devoted to basic education and basic health care, the shameful reality is that we spend only 9%."
"This is where Mr Benn and our Commissioner, together, could make a big difference."
"Fourthly, commit to good governance, provided that the local people are involved."
"We should use them and invest in them to achieve good governance in Africa."
"I would like to finish with a quote from ‘USA for Africa’, dating back 20 years: ‘There comes a time when we hear a certain call, when the world must come together as one’."
"I hope that this appeal will resound in the three meetings."
"I wish you success."
"– Mr President, I think that we can echo Mr Michel, who proposes to do more, better and more quickly."
"To be brief, I shall say that there are two increases that we shall not be able to avoid, the first being an increase in the volume of aid."
"It is clear that if it is to achieve the Millennium Goals, the world will need to devote at least 0.7% of its wealth to them. We are still a long way from that."
"As far as the European Union is concerned, our objectives are, for the time being, a little below that, as we will see an increase from 0.38% to 0.50%."
"I wanted, however, to draw your attention to the considerable amount of money that this represents: EUR 20 billion a year."
"This money does not come from nowhere; it comes from the pockets of our taxpayers."
"That brings me to the second increase that has been announced, that is, in the quality and the efficiency of the aid, an increase that we owe to our taxpayers."
"Let us continue to demand good governance and let us help those leaders, particularly African leaders, who demonstrate that they are clear about the conditions for appropriation."
"Let us remember that international trade will always provide more, via the private sector, than public aid can provide."
"Let us also avoid those easy solutions that ease our conscience, such as budgetary support without conditions, which damages the work of NGOs on the projects, or debt cancellation as a miracle cure, without addressing the problems of subsequent structures, or again the futility of sanctions that are not targeted."
"Above all, there is a link between the second increase and the greater efforts we must make to inform public opinion."
"Our action must be clear."
"That is why I proposed that the European Union should take direct charge of objectives such as child vaccination campaigns or the fight against malaria, because it is possible – if rather macabre – to quantify these actions."
"In this way, then, we could become a Union that is open, shows solidarity and, above all, is effective."
"Mr President, I have just come back from the civil society alternative G8 meetings in Edinburgh, where thousands of people debated how to make poverty history."
"I want to highlight two important conclusions."
"First, free trade is not the answer to Africa’s problems."
"While moves to cancel some African countries’ debts are welcome and long overdue, the policy conditionality in the package on offer, the enforced liberalisation and privatisation, are as onerous as the debt it relieves."
"Second, poverty in Africa is not the result of some kind of accident of nature."
"I was very happy to hear Jack Straw agree that poverty is man-made, but amazed that the men he had in mind were ones that lived in Africa alone, not in the G8."
"Poverty in Africa is largely the direct and logical consequence of the policies of the G8 nations and their corporations, which have been driving Africa’s accumulation of debt, which have been selling weapons, which have been stealing Africa’s resources, which have been enforcing neo-liberal economics, which have been privatising public services and which have collectively impoverished so many millions of people."
"Until that changes, until we have an approach based on ..."
"– Mr President, behind one Martinez lurks another!"
"After half a century of development aid, international rock concerts, debt relief, fair trade and rather hypocritical tears from somewhat self-righteous white men, Africa is still locked in poverty."
"So, what are we to do?"
"Firstly, we must declare water, education, health and food to be global public goods."
"Secondly, we must guarantee access to these goods by means of four global public services."
"Thirdly, we must entrust the management of these services to an economic security council analogous to the United Nations Security Council."
"Fourthly, we must provide them with resources by levying VAT on the services provided by geostationary satellites."
"Fifthly, and finally, we must enable Africa to use the same means that all western countries have used to develop, namely tariff protection, but smart tariff protection this time, in the form of reimbursable customs duties."
"Mr President, I give you a present of three seconds!"
"Mr President, some journalists have made ironic comments asking why politicians have not already put a stop to poverty, since they are in a position to do so."
"I do not believe that the issue of global poverty is a matter about which we should joke or make puns."
"The fight against global poverty can be said to be a measure of our humanity and Europeanness."
"Among other things, EU enlargement has meant that a larger number of countries now participate in development cooperation, and the new Member States are playing an increasingly active role in the fight against poverty."
"Under the auspices of the HIPC debt relief initiative, Poland has decided to cancel all debt from three countries, two of which are in Africa."
"The total debt of the countries in question, namely Tanzania, Mozambique and Nicaragua, amounted to over USD 53 million."
"Sudan is another country in debt to Poland that may benefit from debt relief."
"As I see it, debt relief is particularly important for countries such as Mozambique, where the state budget is entirely dependent on foreign aid, and it may be the first step on the path towards enabling Africans to help themselves."
"Richard Mbewe, a Zambian economist living in Poland, once said that, ‘Africans are not children, and they should not be given fish; they should be given fishing rods’."
"Poland’s experiences are proof that effective and long-lasting economic reform can only start after a country has undergone political transformation."
"A large part of the loans granted to Poland in the 1970s went to waste, and debt reduction only made any sense after the changes of 1989."
"Mr Straw and Commissioner Michel therefore made a key point by saying that good management and the fight against corruption are the most important challenges for Africa."
"The second pillar of our policy, in addition to development policy, should be public understanding, and campaigns like ‘Make Poverty History’ help to raise public awareness."
"Mr President, I will begin by saying how proud I am of the UK Presidency’s very strong commitment to making poverty history."
"This is a time of unprecedented opportunity in the world."
"And I believe that, for every obstacle we might face, there is a solution."
"The world must at last be ready to keep its promises to Africa: on aid, on unpayable debts, and on fair trade."
"African leaders, as others have said, must deal with governmental issues and with corruption."
"We must also understand that poor governance is as much a result of pervasive poverty as it is a cause."
"There are now no ifs or buts or whens."
"We can work together to invest in better crops, to improve malaria control, to get medicines to the sick, to develop an AIDS vaccine, to protect fragile eco-systems."
"We can get millions of children into school and we can save precious mothers’ and babies’ lives."
"We can speed up developments by empowering women, who in Africa are 50% of the population but 70% of its poor."
"Conflicts can be resolved, the arms trade can be controlled, and companies can and should be made to trade openly and ethically."
"Africa’s route out of poverty has now been very clearly charted and we need, as Gordon Brown has said, to have a new relationship with Africa."
"We can be the generation that makes history by transforming the life chances of millions of Africa’s people."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is good news that Africa is once more in the political spotlight."
"It seems to me, however, that there is still confusion regarding which policy to adopt, and the prescriptions put forward vary considerably and include some bargain basement solutions."
"We radicals, however, consider it an absolute priority that democracy, civil rights, the rule of law and fixed rules should be the prerequisites to any political approach that we decide to adopt, since no type of trade, whether private, internal or international, can function without rules, laws and the rule of law."
"The issues of democracy and the rule of law, however, are simply being added to the list of the many things to be done."
"We, on the other hand, are convinced that these two issues are of the highest priority and I thus believe that we must be a little less hypocritical and admit that public aid can also be linked to progress by these countries along this path."
"Personally, I do not understand how we can be, in a certain sense, so racist as to think that the Africans are, perhaps, too poor, too illiterate and too black to enjoy the same democratic rights that we enjoy."
"We are all pushing for democracy in the Arab world, but not in Africa."
"I believe that if we do not follow this path, we will witness the umpteenth squandering of public resources, with poor or feeble results."
"Mr President, the precarious position of many African states is something that ought to make people in general ashamed."
"To be sure, we have to make worldwide hunger a thing of the past, once and for all, but how?"
"It has become apparent over recent years that the problem lies, not in the quantity of development aid, but in how such aid, in order to achieve optimal results, is targeted."
"We should be working, systematically, towards greater transparency and democracy in as many African countries as possible."
"We should be working towards the sort of public life in which freedom of opinion is at the top of the agenda, and these countries need to make the conscious choice to invest in education."
"In the absence of these things, there is a danger that development aid will be sufficient from the moral standpoint, but ineffectual in practice."
"We can all ..."
"Mr President, I should like to thank my friend, Luisa Morgantini, for her splendid initiative to put the issue of poverty in Africa on the agenda."
"Two fundamental points: yes to effective aid, but also assessed in terms of quality; yes to international aid while at the same time respecting, above all, the dignity of poor countries."
"To overcome poverty, Heads of State and experts have adopted a purely quantitative approach, which targets measurable economic results, but ignores the unofficial, unpaid work of the poorest families, including intergenerational work."
"The pride of parents in raising their children, even in extreme poverty, cannot be measured quantitatively."
"To overcome poverty in Africa it is necessary, on ethical grounds, to develop a sense of social justice and the common good at international level."
"Many countries that are poor in economic terms, but rich in wisdom, could give us much inspiration."
"Every nation inherits from its ancestors a civilisation that it must preserve."
"The institutions necessary for life in society are part and parcel of this, whether they are political or whether they are expressions of spiritual life."
"When the latter are rooted in true human values, it would be a grave mistake to sacrifice them."
"Graver still would be European interference forcing a people to sacrifice its values, whether religious or ethical, its cultural heritage or the philosophical beliefs of individuals and communities, which are an integral part of it."
"This would rob a people of the best of itself."
"In order to live it would be sacrificing its reason for living."
"– Mr President, what if, after these last few rather sad weeks for the European Union, it were now to bounce back, precisely on the issue of development, and prove that it is in the vanguard of the fight against poverty."
"The European Union is on the right track with its twofold commitment: 0.7% of its wealth for development aid by 2015 and 50% of this increase for Africa."
"I am delighted that the British Presidency is making Africa its central concern."
"Tony Blair must also take advantage of his presidency of the G8 to obtain something other than declarations of intent from the rich: the only cheque that he must defend is the one promised at Monterrey."
"Further progress is needed on debt cancellation, but a premium on democracy must be introduced and new sources of finance urgently sought: taxes on the movement of capital, on the arms trade, on CO2 emissions, it does not matter, all manner of things have been put forward."
"We must reach conclusions now because, in the words of the slogan of the global campaign against poverty, after 2005 there will be no more excuses."
"Mr President, a quarter of a century has passed since Willy Brandt presented his report on North-South relations."
"Since then, the problem of poverty has not only not been resolved, but in many cases it has actually worsened."
"In reality, the latest report on poverty in the world demonstrates that there has only been a degree of progress in China, in some countries in South-East Asia and in some specific cases in Latin America."
"In Africa the figures are discouraging, and we must therefore welcome this British initiative, which I do not believe to be opportunist — it was announced by Minister Straw and his Prime Minister at least two years ago."
"After 40 years, dozens of wars and millions of deaths have left the continent of Africa exhausted."
"They are no magic formulae in the fight against poverty and only two things are certain: firstly, contrary to what some people think, poverty is not an economic problem, but rather a political one, and resolving it requires, as a priority, political decisions; secondly, in order be successful, we must ensure economic growth — without growth, there is no wealth to be distributed."
"In this context, these days we hear millions of voices calling for the application of traditional formulae throughout the world: increasing official development aid, cancellation of debt and fair trade."
"These are three necessary, but insufficient, measures."
"The political and social leaders of the countries suffering from poverty must demand much more, particularly in the field of strengthening civil society — strengthening their societies, transparency and good government, thereby increasing investments in health, education and gender policies."
"In Africa, there are more than 100 000 armed children, whose faces some of us have seen."
"If we want to make progress on the objective of reducing poverty by half by 2015, these points I have indicated demonstrate the direction we must take if we are to succeed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we want to consign poverty to history, the gap between words and deeds needs to be closed."
"Therefore, the time has come to choose a path that is at least in part different from those of the past."
"Neo-liberalist prescriptions have failed and the positive commitment of Europe as a principal donor has not yet made any decisive impact."
"If we want to achieve the Millennium Objectives, the conditions for development must be created, including democracy and good governance, as well as the opening up of the market to agricultural products from the poor countries and debt cancellation."
"To this end, I would like to point out that the cancellation of Iraq’s debt alone corresponds to the amount received by sub-Saharan Africa over the past ten years."
"Therefore, what counts is political will and the interests at stake."
"I hope that it is clear that it is in our public interest to create development in order to receive, in exchange, stability and security."
"Mr President, Mr Bowis made reference to his 100-year-old mother."
"I would like to make reference to my British mother-in-law and father-in-law, who are substantially younger."
"I am very proud of the fact that they were in Edinburgh on the march."
"I should add that this was on Saturday, not two days ago."
"They were not among the hooligans!"
"I would like to make three points."
"Firstly, on making poverty history."
"I think it is a great subject for the British Presidency."
"It revolves around three things: debt, which should be forgiven; aid, of which there should be more; and finally trade, which should be much freer and fairer."
"It seems that we have made the least progress on trade."
"We need to work on infrastructure and on access."
"What should we do in the short term?"
"Three things."
"First, we should stop dumping agricultural products on the African markets at cheap prices."
"Second, we need to change the conditions on the basis of which we give aid."
"It is wrong that the World Bank and the IMF make non-agricultural subsidies a precondition when we do exactly the opposite."
"Third, for a short time, they should be able to protect their markets much like we have done."
"My third and final point is a proposal to the British Presidency, namely that we should establish an all-encompassing Africa strategy."
"Just as we have a Mediterranean strategy, and just as we had a Russia strategy, we need an Africa strategy."
"That Africa strategy should lend our African policies coherence and consistency in the common foreign and security policy and in trade and development."
"A final suggestion in order to help the British Presidency, especially the Foreign Minister, Jack Straw, get out of the tangle in the budgetary negotiations, is to think about including the European Development Fund in the real budget of the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, last year the rich countries of the world spent USD 80 billion on foreign aid, USD 600 billion on defence and USD 300 billion on agricultural subsidies for their own countries."
"Rich countries have all the means at their disposal to eradicate hunger, poverty and the many diseases that currently kill millions, such as malaria."
"Development policy must become the EU’s mission in this new global era."
"This would allow us to forge an identity for Europe, and it would serve to differentiate the EU from the rest of the modern world."
"Our most pressing tasks, above all where Africa is concerned, are currently debt cancellation, improving the quantity and quality of foreign aid, fair trade, support for diversified production and exports, stamping out diseases for which we have effective vaccines and measures to promote universal education and equality, particularly in terms of the status of women."
"I should like to take this opportunity today to remind the House of the words of Nelson Mandela, which should serve as a moral beacon for EU policy:"
"‘Make poverty history in 2005."
"Then we can all stand with our heads held high’."
"– Mr President, I welcome the British initiative and I hope that it will have substantial results, because it is true that, despite the pronouncements to date by the leaders of the strong states, little progress has been made. That is because humanitarian aid alone may provide temporary relief, but it cannot bring about substantial results."
"Aid will only be effective if it is combined with systematic efforts to develop trade and if it focuses on the creation of infrastructures in education and health care."
"Furthermore, aid must become the vehicle for combating the political corruption which unfortunately today constitutes a permanent regime in most African countries, because today Africa is mainly being plundered by corrupt African politicians or by guerrillas, often with the support of international economic interests."
"However, particular importance must be attached to the administration of resources through close cooperation and supervision by the various international organisations and non-governmental organisations."
"Only such an effort will make the proper distribution and use of the aid provided feasible, in the long-term objective and aim of the development of these countries, which will help them to wipe out the phenomenon of poverty."
"I think that everything else we hear covers the issue superficially and does not get to the root of it."
"Mr President, I strongly support the proposal made by our colleague Mr Stubb."
"He is quite right."
"We need a comprehensive Africa strategy."
"The Presidency representative just spoke about soft power, where the European Union is successful."
"I think he is absolutely right, but we still need to translate this into positive action."
"Talking about action against poverty is wonderful, but it is certainly not enough, especially if you consider that we have been putting so much aid into Africa for many years and the outcome is not always very positive."
"The same applies when we talk about trade and poverty reduction."
"There is a strong connection."
"We know this, but do we really understand it?"
"I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on International Trade."
"I would recommend an Africa strategy, which should be the subject of renewed debate by the end of the UK Presidency, taking all aspects into consideration."
"It would be great if the UK Presidency could reflect on this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as chairman of my group, I have made the quite deliberate decision to take the floor at the end of this debate, and I am rather disappointed to note that I am the only group chairman to speak on this subject at all."
"It is in fact an issue on which the leaders of groups simply have to give their backing to those in their ranks who are working to combat poverty."
"To those Members of this House who are always – and not just because of the British Council Presidency’s initiative – working on this topic, I want to make it clear that the Socialist Group in this House regards the fight against poverty, both in Africa and in the world at large, as a key part of the work it does."
"I want to devote one moment in my speaking time to an unknown person – to the mother and her dead child."
"In the small town of which I was mayor, there were plenty of people, women in particular, who had lost children during the war."
"When I was a guest at anniversary celebrations, the worst thing I would have to hear was women of the war generation talking about was the loss of a loved child, a wound that is always fresh."
"If we look at Africa we see innumerable mothers – uncounted day by day – sitting in front of their dead children, uncomprehending, grieving and deserted, an image I wish we could all impress upon our minds, for nothing, surely, can encourage and oblige us more to take more seriously the fight against poverty that the British Presidency of the Council has set itself as a priority for action than that small sense of common humanity that tells us that we may not leave a woman who has lost her child alone in the world if we claim to want to make that world a more humane place."
"It is before that image that we Socialists bow our heads in the knowledge that this initiative is the very least we can do, and I have a practical proposal to make, to help these women, along with many, many others who need our solidarity, by doing one small thing."
"If the big multinational and global companies put 0.25 % – one quarter of one-hundredth – of their fees for currency transactions, into a fund for Africa, and if we in this House put 0.25 % of what we spend on our international currency transactions in the Budget and pay it into a fund for aid in Africa, we will end up with a large amount that the business world, along, for example, with us in this House can put to good use in the European Union, as a very practical contribution to the fight against poverty, one that may well involve a contribution by each individual."
"We could perhaps discuss the possibility of taking action of this kind."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking you for giving me this opportunity to respond to the debate that my colleague Jack Straw opened this morning."
"Nobody listening to this debate could fail to hear the great expertise, knowledge, passion and commitment of all the Members who have spoken."
"It seems to me that your voices represent the voices of those that we together have the honour to represent."
"I am very much looking forward, through the UK Presidency, to working with the Committee on Development and to addressing the committee next week."
"Mrs Morgantini was right: this is not about charity but justice."
"It is a cry for justice that is symbolised – as Mr Martínez Martínez pointed out – by the white band."
"The white tide that marched in Edinburgh last weekend is a symbol."
"The people who attended the Live 8 concerts and the people who write to us, their elected representatives, and demand that we do more are all expressing the feeling that now is the time to act – a point made by Mrs Martens and by Mr Bowis."
"I congratulate his mother on her 100th birthday."
"He is right: she has lived a long time; she has seen a lot of change happen."
"We simply cannot afford to allow Africa to continue to drift away from the rest of the world."
"Mr Schulz, who has spoken just now with such passion, reminds us that it is the responsibility of every single one of us."
"There has never been a time, in my political experience, when this debate about Africa, poverty, its causes and what we can do about it has been so much at the centre of our politics."
"It seems to me that the message that we are being sent by those we represent is very simple: they look to us to act and they want to have faith in the capacity of the political process to deliver real change on behalf of Africa and of development."
"It is morally unacceptable that this great continent of 54 countries, only a few miles from Europe, should drift away from us and should be the only part of the world to become poorer in the last 25 years."
"Now we have the means to do something about it."
"The challenge that Europe faces will be to turn the passion, commitment and anger – the feelings people have – into practical action that will make a difference."
"I agree with all those who have called for the EU strategy on Africa to be the means by which we use our politics to make a real difference."
"I look forward to working with Mr Michel, as he draws that up."
"I hope very much that we can make progress on it."
"I would now like to turn to the practical steps we need to take."
"What are the issues we need to address in the EU Africa strategy?"
"The first point to make – if I may disagree with one of the speakers, Mr Farage – is that aid works, aid saves children’s lives."
"That is why we need more of it."
"That is why the leadership that Europe showed, when we met as development ministers over a month ago, in agreeing to double Europe’s aid to Africa, was Europe at its best."
"This was Europe demonstrating its leadership in the world and that we are prepared and willing and will do the things that we know will make a difference."
"That is the first point."
"The second point is debt relief, which many speakers have referred to."
"The real importance of debt relief is that it means that poor countries no longer have to make that terrible choice between, on the one hand, making the monthly repayments that they cannot afford and, on the other, spending the money they want to on doctors, on nurses, on getting children into school, on buying the drugs that will save children’s and adults’ lives."
"Thirdly, every one of us recognises that it is ultimately trade, economic development and economic growth that will enable Africa and the rest of the developing world to transform the lives of their people."
"It is how we did it here in Europe."
"It is how we transformed our societies from 500 years ago, when life expectancy was very short, when there was enormous poverty and when very few people went to school."
"The people of Africa want exactly the same opportunity: to earn and to trade their way out of poverty to a better future."
"There are two other truths that we have to tell in this debate."
"Two-and-a-half weeks ago I was in Sudan, first of all in Rumbek, in the south of Sudan, where one in four children die before they are five years of age and three-quarters of the adults cannot read."
"The experience in Darfur and southern Sudan has taught us one very important lesson: unless there is peace and stability, there will be no development; unless people stop fighting each other, the people of Africa will not have a better future."
"That is why Europe must continue to show leadership and provide support to the African Union, building the capacity of Africa to tackle its own conflicts."
"As my friend Jack Straw said in opening this debate, there are now fewer conflicts in Africa than there were a decade ago and, where there is peace and stability, there is a real prospect of hope for a better future."
"The final thing that needs to happen, Mr President, if progress is to be made, is that there should be good governance because if, in the end, governments are to deliver for their people ..."
"Minister, your time is not restricted."
"You may speak for as long as you wish."
"The problem is that I was asking the Members to enter the Chamber in silence."
"It is all very well that you have not attended the debate, but when you are entering the Chamber, please do so in a manner that causes no disturbance."
". Thank you very much, Mr President, for your concern."
"It is less important that you hear my voice, but it is important that the world outside hears all of our voices."
"If we speak as one and we speak loudly, we have a better chance of making progress in this great global fight."
"In the end, people look to governments to do things for them."
"We look to our governments to provide us with peace and security, to educate our children, to look after us when we are sick, to give us the opportunity to build a living for ourselves and our families."
"In developing countries the real challenge is to build the capacity of societies to do for them and their communities exactly what we look to government to do in Europe."
"In the end it is about governments with a capacity to deliver and about people who have the expectation that government might be able to improve their lives."
"When those two things come together – when the voices of the people are heard – then societies have a better chance of making real progress."
"In the end, it is about political will and political choice."
"That is what politics is for: how we decide what kind of world it is that we want to live in; where we are going to spend the money; what decisions we are going to make on trade to allow developing countries to have a better future."
"We happen to be the generation on whom this responsibility has now fallen."
"As British Prime Minister Tony Blair said at the launch of the Commission for Africa: ‘If not us, then who?"
"If not now, then when?’"
"We are the generation that has the capacity to act."
"Now is the time to act."
"Let us work together; let us seize this opportunity and, by our action as Europe, assist Africa to build a better future that it can pass on to the generation to come."
"Thank you very much, Mr Benn."
"I am sorry that I have had to interrupt you."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak on a point of order, pursuant to Rules 146 and 148."
"I have to say to you, Mr President, that I am very much obliged to you for the efforts you make prior to the votes in every plenary session to get the last ten minutes before the vote conducted in a more or less dignified manner."
"It is regrettable that you do not succeed in this."
"Members, coming from their offices, enter the Chamber in order to vote and, in the absence of any interpretation, understand not one word of what you say; they chat, stand in groups in front of the attendance register, go to their seats, only to find that they have something to sort out with their colleagues."
"This is all understandable and acceptable, but what is quite unacceptable is for the representatives of the Council and the Commission to have to talk while this sort of thing is going on."
"That is not on, and it is a cause of shame to me."
"I do not think it right or proper."
"Nor do I have any desire to see that happening over and over again at every plenary part-session."
"It does not convey the image of a parliament worthy of the name."
"I therefore move that, as the rights of Members have to be upheld at the same time as those of the other institutions, we should have a pause between the end of the debate and the beginning of the vote ...."
"Thank you for assisting the Presidency, Mr Schulz."
"Before giving the floor to the Commission, I must ask everybody to sit down."
"The Members who are still in the aisles discussing personal issues will be asked by the ushers to leave the Chamber."
"Would the ushers please ask the Members still in the aisles to leave the Chamber!"
"Mr Tannock, on the basis of which Rule are you requesting the floor?"
"Would you be kind enough to sit down and be quiet please?"
"Mr President, I am privileged."
"I understand Spanish without the headphones."
"If you speak in Spanish to those standing up at the back of the Chamber, how can they possibly understand you without their headphones on?"
"Could you use French or English so they can understand you?"
"You are extremely unruly today."
"I would like to say to you that your attitude towards the issue we are dealing with this morning is shameful."
"May I ask all the Members who are wandering up and down the aisles to sit down or at least not to hold conversations that disturb our work?"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all also to thank Mrs Morgantini for the debate that she had the sensitivity to organise today."
"The first thing that this debate has highlighted is that there is a consensus and very strong support for the choice of Africa as the focal point of development policy."
"That seems to me to be extremely important, because that is the choice not only of the European Parliament but also of the Commission and of the Council."
"Obviously this does not mean that we are no longer concerned about all of the other poor people in the world."
"Not at all."
"It simply means that more than half of the increase in development aid will be devoted to Africa to enable it to make up the necessary ground."
"The second element that I take from this debate is that everything suggests that we should develop, define and finalise a genuine European strategy for development, and for Africa in particular, a strategy structured around the major development issues – governance, infrastructure and debt."
"For example, someone said that the debt issue would not solve everything."
"We know that."
"The debt issue is certainly important, but it is not, strictly speaking, a development tool."
"The debt issue, settling the debt, obviously does not make it possible to guarantee the effectiveness of development."
"All the same, it is an interesting prerequisite."
"The provision of social policies following the emergence of a dynamic civil society, the provision of social policies of access to justice, access to education, access to health and also to culture – as I said before – is an important point."
"I believe that all of these things should form part of a global strategy, a global plan and a specific programme that we must implement."
"I can say straight away that I am perfectly well aware of the difficulties that we are going to face."
"The difficulties lie in the fact that, once we have this programme, very strong leadership will need to be exerted over the bureaucracies that will have to implement it."
"For that I am counting on the support of both Parliament and the Council; at Commission level we will do everything in our power to progress these issues."
"I believe it is very important for us to be able to register tangible results."
"I think that after all the promises that have been made, and given all of the prospects – extremely credible ones, too – that are open to us, and all of the propitious circumstances that are combining now to produce this firm hope, it will be necessary to provide tangible proof very rapidly that matters are progressing in line with expectations."
"Another element that I should like to emphasise, concerning Africa in particular, is the especially important role of all policies promoting equality between men and women in the continent."
"It is an aspect of the problem that we do not tackle often enough and I should really like to see it taken into account across the whole range of policies, because there are solutions to be found there and opportunities to exploit."
"In saying that, I am thinking of business and of trade."
"I am thinking of microcredit, of the way that this form of credit promotes autonomy for women."
"It is an important cultural factor."
"That, in a few words, ladies and gentlemen, is what I wanted to say to you."
"I wanted to say, as Hilary Benn and Jack Straw have done, that now is the time to act."
"We are the ones who must do so."
"We have no more excuses."
"It has been said again and again and I do not think that we can postpone this challenge any longer, that of turning the strong hope living in the heart of the people into action."
"Someone said earlier that perhaps it would be a good thing if, out of this development policy, out of this new impetus, the magical idea of Europe could be given a new impetus."
"I think that Europe can make, has already made, development the most tangible demonstration of its values, and that is why I am resolutely optimistic."
"Mr President, yesterday a very serious event occurred: Italy was insulted ..."
"If you wish to raise a point of order, you must begin by stating which Rule you are invoking."
"You may not speak, pursuant to Rule 90."
"We have received six motions for resolutions to end this debate(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place next."
"‘Your first duties, first not as regards time but as regards importance and because without attempting them you can only carry out the others in an imperfect fashion, are your duties towards humanity’, said Mazzini."
"This is my way of expressing my solidarity with those countries where we thought that we could increase charity and funds without worrying about their actual development and the eradication of poverty."
"Cancelling their debt will not eliminate the problem of development aid, which the international community will have to provide, or the extremely urgent health resources that they need; it will not exempt us from association agreements with their governments or from fostering education and training programmes to integrate them into complex social, economic and political systems; choosing democratic forms of government, and having a future."
"That is, an opportunity, including outside their countries, but with the awareness that they can return there and that they can feel themselves to be citizens and free."
"The political class should manage globalisation processes through choices that equate to guaranteeing them water, energy, food, health, freedom and education."
"The most recent European Council decided to increase aid to EUR 20 billion per year by 2010, and this is a hopeful sign for many millions of people."
"We can overcome poverty, and we are the first generation to be able to do so because we have the means available to us."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, we are starting on one of the longestvoting sessions in our history with 972 amendments."
"Mr President, I am speaking to put forward a procedural motion with reference to Rule 152."
"Yesterday afternoon during the debate in the Chamber we examined the entire package on regional policies."
"Since the voting list sets out a different order, I propose that after the report by Mr Hatzidakis, my report on the Cohesion Fund and the report by Mr Casa should be put to the vote, so that the whole package is voted on in a single process using the same order adopted yesterday during the debate."
"I believe that this is a fairer method and ask you to consider this proposal."
"–If the House has no objection, we shall change the order of our votes."
"I would invite you, however, ladies and gentlemen, when such cases arise, to advise the services of the sitting earlier, so that our voting lists can be drawn up accordingly."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is every likelihood that this Parliament will shortly reject the proposed Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions."
"All our major groups, and even – I beg their pardon – the smaller ones, have taken this decision, albeit for contradictory reasons."
"I have neither a mandate nor any official capacity here to comment on those reasons. However, this convergence has a common significance."
"On the merits of the question, we are split roughly 50/50, making the result totally unpredictable with a relative majority, and with a bilateral impossibility of achieving a qualified majority."
"Each of our parliamentary groups prefers to reject the text rather than to adopt the other’s opinions."
"Above all, however, there is a collective and unanimous anger on the part of the entire Parliament at the unacceptable way it has been treated by the Commission and the Council."
"A total and cynical contempt for the choices made by Parliament at first reading."
"A total absence of any consultation by the Commission in drafting the text for the second reading."
"Repeated attempts even to stop discussions between Governments within the Council itself."
"As a matter of principle, this is scandalous enough."
"The crisis in Europe today has a lot to do with the deficit of democracy, an area where the Council has an overwhelming responsibility, as it has proved amply on this issue."
"Let us hope that this rejection is a lesson to it!"
"On the merits of the issue, the state of opinion, as reflected here, clearly shows that the problem is not yet ripe for a decision."
"Only with a more in-depth debate could it have matured into a wider consensus."
"On this vital and highly challenging subject – with several tens of billions of dollars at stake each year – a collective awareness is clearly beginning to emerge."
"In that context, rejection is a message directed at the European Patent Office."
"The European Parliament has refused to ratify the recent judicial errors by extending the scope of patentability to certain software programs."
"If these errors were to continue, it now seems clear that a parliamentary majority would emerge to put a stop to them."
"Mr President, what we have always heard from the Commission is that it would be unwilling to submit a new proposal in the event of the Common Position being rejected, but let me remind the House of the Interinstitutional Agreement, which we concluded on 15 September 1999 with the former President, Mr Prodi, and in which the Commission undertook to take initiatives as and when Parliament calls upon it to do so."
"I do not doubt that the House will call upon the Commission to submit a new proposal, and would remind the Commission that it is obliged to do so, and that that is what must happen."
"Mr President, I do not think that we can necessarily interpret this vote as an invitation to the Commission to put forward a new proposal rather similar to the one that has been rejected."
"I believe, therefore, that the issue should be discussed and defined together with the Commission."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, in accordance with the procedure and purely out of courtesy, I invite the Commission to comment, if it so desires."
". Mr President, the rejection of the Council common position is the democratic right of Parliament as co-legislator with the Council."
"Many speakers during the debate yesterday mentioned the voice of the people and the role of democracy."
"Without this directive, patents for computer-implemented inventions will continue to be issued by national patent offices and the European Patent Office under existing law."
"There will be no harmonisation at EU level."
"This means that different interpretations as to what is patentable or not will continue without any judicial control by the European Court of Justice."
"Since the adoption of the common position, the Commission has maintained the view that, should Parliament decide to reject the common position, the Commission would respect this and would not present a new proposal but, if Parliament invites us to do so, we will speak with the various parliamentary committees and then consider the next procedures."
"Various Members have expressed the view that the Commission should present a non-sector-specific instrument and that it should seek the adoption of the Community patent."
"A large amount of national patent law is already aligned with the European Patent Convention and the Community Patent Convention of 1989."
"Again, Commissioner McCreevy will be happy to debate these matters with you."
"You have already said you would invite us to the relevant committee meetings and also to the plenary sittings if you wish to do this."
"On the future of the Community patent, the key to agreement on this lies in the hands of the Council."
"Many options have already been explored formally and informally."
"– Parliament is grateful to the Commission and, once again, thanks its rapporteur Mr Rocard for all the work done."
". Mr President, although this topic is, of course, less exciting than the previous one, it is an important one nevertheless."
"I would like to thank you warmly for the opportunity I have been given briefly to clarify my report."
"Over the past few weeks, we have been involved in tough negotiations with the Council to reach an agreement at first reading and ultimately, we reached a compromise, one that I regard as highly defensible."
"Of the 24 amendments that were adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, 20 have been incorporated, either wholly or in part, in the compromise document."
"Nevertheless, I should like to comment on the spirit in which these negotiations were held."
"In my opinion, we were operating on the brink of what is still acceptable."
"Time and time again, the Council presented us with new changes, while proving indifferent to those proposed by the parliamentary delegation."
"That is regrettable, and I hope that in future negotiations on other issues, we can expect a somewhat more cooperative attitude from Council representatives."
"I would like to make one final remark with regard to Amendment 53, which is also part of the compromise package, but which, unfortunately, not all groups were able to support."
"Nevertheless, I would like to point out that, as agreement at first reading is dependent on this amendment being adopted, I am relying on everyone’s support and should also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for the part they played in helping this agreement to come into being."
". Mr President, the oral amendment is this: at the end of the amendment tabled by the Green Group, we have to add the words 'within the programme'."
"I think the Green Group agrees with this proposal, as do all the other political groups."
". Mr President, I want to delete the word ‘ERDF’ in Amendment 39, tabled by the Socialist Group, and replace it with the word ‘funds’, in order to cover all the structural funds and, of course the Cohesion Fund."
"Mr President, on a point of order, since I became an old-age pensioner three months ago, I am finding it very difficult to raise my hand fully into the voting position in the one-tenth of a second you are giving us!"
"– We have an Olympic challenge, ladies and gentlemen: 972 amendments."
"Whatever we fail to complete today will have to be done tomorrow under the presidency of our Greek colleague; it is bound to be something of a marathon."
"Having said that, I would appeal to Members to keep up the pace."
"Mr President, since we have grouped all the Structural Funds together, it would be logical to vote now on the Casa report on the European Fisheries Fund."
". Mr President, it is quite simple really: there are two dates in Articles 26 and 27 regarding the implementation of this regulation."
"Those dates have already passed, so it would probably be a good idea to delete them."
"I hope the House will consent to that."
". Mr President, it is true that paragraph 28 contains a compromise amendment agreed between the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe on the one hand, and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the other."
"We are able to endorse this amendment subject to the following phrase being added:"
"‘and calls on the Turkish Government to support this;’"
"The entire amendment now reads as follows:"
"‘Suggests that the political parties should review their party structures and adopt adequate strategies to reach a better balance on women and men in elected assemblies, including positive measures such as quotas, and calls on the Turkish Government to support this;’"
"– Mr President, I have the text in English and would like to address these remarks to the Greens."
"I would like to change the figures, because the number of victims is changing every day."
"I suggest that '100 000' and '1 700' are changed to 'thousands'."
"That is one suggestion."
"The second suggestion is that 'US troops' should be replaced by 'foreign troops', because there are troops from other countries as well as the United States."
"Mr President, thank you; the President of the House has already explained to us at length and with great thoroughness how impolite it is not to take the floor punctually during speaking time or to be absent from the vote."
"This House has adopted a resolution to the effect that voting ends at 1.30 p.m."
"As a matter of principle, we in this House hold to what we have agreed, rather than, on an basis, following what we hear from the President of the moment."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, we have begun the Dimitrakopoulos report and, one way or another, we must complete it."
"After that, I shall ask if you wish to continue today with the important issue of the fight against poverty, on which the voting will be fairly brief, but first we must finish the Dimitrakopoulos report."
"– Mr President, once again I shall read the English text."
"This is an addition: a further recital."
"‘whereas the war in Iraq, its various aspects and its consequences continue to be a sensitive issue for public opinion and governments in Europe and the United States’."
"– Before continuing with the voting, I have a statement to make to Parliament."
"I am sorry that the Council is not present as I would have asked the representative of the UK Presidency to make a comment on the statement I am about to make: the city that has been selected to host the 2012 Olympic Games is London."
"Mr President, I should just like to speak from the point of view of Britain concerning that announcement."
"May I first of all pay a compliment to the hard work and the very combative way other European cities have fought for the Olympic Games, particularly our colleagues in Madrid and Paris."
"There had to be one winner."
"From a London point of view, I hope everybody here will attend those Games and we will fight at those Games in a competitive spirit to show Europe at its very best."
"– We wish the European team a rich haul of medals in 2012."
"Mr President, I believe that this is self-evident."
"I would like our friends in the Group of the Greens to accept this amendment, which simply takes note of a statement and does not endorse it fully until we have precise and detailed knowledge of the report that they are referring to."
"Mr President, I would like to deal with a concern of another group: rather than talking about 300 million, or 315, or 400 million people suffering hunger in the world, we can say ‘more than 300 million’."
"By doing this, I believe we will avoid giving a precise figure, as other Members wanted."
"Mr President, there is a serious matter that I want to bring before you."
"Mr Rack was right: the House used to have a strict rule about voting times."
"This is not about whether or not one manages to eat, but I do have visitors here, who have travelled a thousand kilometres for a meeting with me, and after that, I have to be back in the plenary for three o’clock."
"We made these rules, and I really do ask that we keep to them in future."
"We cannot vote on everything on a Wednesday just because there are some lazy people who think they have to leave on that day."
"We could just as well have voted on the last five reports on Thursday at lunchtime."
"I ask the Bureau to plan and organise things properly in the way they used to."
"Thank you, Mr Posselt; your intervention has been noted and the points you have made will be passed on to the services."
"That brings the voting to a close."
"The report is aimed at having the EU accede to UN Economic Commission for Europe Regulations Nos 94 and 95."
"The aim is to remove technical obstacles to trade when it comes to the approval of vehicles with regard to the protection of the occupants in the event of a frontal or lateral collision."
"We choose to support the proposal because we support the EU’s common trade policy and think it necessary to take measures designed to remove obstacles to trade."
"We also find it encouraging that this is taking place within the framework of the UN."
". One of the objectives of Directive 2002/95/EC is to contribute to the protection of human health and the environmentally sound recovery and disposal of waste electrical and electronic equipment."
"The Directive restricts the use of certain hazardous substances in new electrical and electronic equipment put on the market from 1 July unless exempted under the Annex."
"I regret the Commission's decision to add DecaBDE to the annex against the advice of its scientific advisors."
"I call on the Council to oppose this proposal."
"– Decabromodiphenylether is a brominated flame retardant well known to Parliament: in February 2003, it was placed ‘under close surveillance’ and, at the same time, the European Union, in a report of which I was the author, banned its two ‘sister’ substances, penta and octa BDE."
"DecaBDE is a bio-accumulative chemical product, which has been found in breast milk and for which the relative European Scientific Committee has recommended that the risk be reduced even further."
"It is, moreover, a substance that the European Union has undertaken to ban in electrical and electronic equipment from 1 July 2006."
"It is therefore surprising that the European Commission should recommend a major retrograde step by seeking, through the comitology procedure – or, in other words, ‘on the quiet’ – to have this ban reconsidered."
"In both form and substance, this attempt to force it through is unacceptable."
"The Commission has offered no argument to justify this u-turn – indeed, no justification would have been possible."
"I therefore support this resolution and call on the Commission to reverse its decision."
"Should it fail to do so, I shall have no hesitation, with a number of my colleagues, in referring the matter to the Court of Justice."
"Madam President, I have three short observations to make on the software patents directive."
"Firstly, it is better for us not to have any directive at all than to have a bad directive."
"Secondly, this was a clear sign of an interinstitutional power struggle, in which the Commission and the Council ought to have listened to Parliament and followed suit."
"Thirdly, the whole debate was riddled with misunderstandings, and I hope that the Commission will not at this stage simply give up, but put a new proposal on the table, because at some stage we will also need a European software patents directive."
"Madam President, I joined the vast majority in this House in voting against this draft directive."
"Today, here in this House, I believe that reason has notched up a victory against the interests of a few big IT manufacturers and their lobbyists."
"We have also flagged up the greater freedom of choice that consumers will enjoy."
"We have also made it clear that there is a future in Europe for information technology firms, for what was at stake was innovation and small and medium-sized businesses’ freedom to develop themselves."
"I am enormously pleased that we have managed today to firmly send off the pitch those who planned to legalise patents on software, and, in so doing, to show our support for those advocates of open source and defenders of free software development."
"We have also, and in particular, given a helping hand to the small and medium-sized software businesses that would have sustained immense damage had the patenting directive gone through."
"I rejoice that we have won this victory, and hope that we will be able to do something similar when we come to revise the Biotechnology Patents Directive."
"Madam President, I would just like to say how unfortunate it is that Mr Rocard did not manage to get even one of his amendments accepted, and that this House was unable to deliver itself of a position on the subject."
"The problem we are now faced with is that the national legislation continues to apply without amendment, and that the courts will come to very different decisions."
"While it will impose huge expense on big business, and hence frustrate the Lisbon objectives, small firms will find the whole business quite incomprehensible, as they will be required, in future, to get to grips with twenty-seven different systems of patent law."
"I call on the Commission not only to put before us a new proposal for a Community patent, having first discussed it with experts on the subject, but also to make a start on drafting it with the minimum possible delay."
"– It is my belief that Europe needs common, clear and up-to-date rules on patents, as these would play a crucial role in removing barriers within the EU’s internal market, in boosting investment in research, in preventing piracy and in protecting Europe as a whole."
"I very much appreciate the efforts of those Members from all political groups, including the European People’s Party, who have helped us reach a joint compromise on our 20 amendments to the directive."
"The aim of these amendments was to secure patent protection only for firmware as part of a technical appliance, thereby facilitating interoperability and preventing the patenting of pure software."
"At the end of the political negotiations, I voted in favour of rejecting the directive."
"I did so because I believe that this will allow Parliament to send out a clear and strong signal to the Council and the Commission that they should step up efforts to draft a joint proposal for a general European patent, instead of concentrating on a directive relating to a specific type of patent."
"– Madam President, I should like to express my satisfaction at the rejection of this common position, having failed to achieve anything better – in other words, having failed to be able to approve Mr Rocard's amendments one by one, which were intended to bring us back to the first reading by the European Parliament."
"Like my fellow Members, I do not believe it perpetuates legal uncertainty, because a lot has happened in the last three years."
"At first reading, the European Parliament adopted an unambiguous wording."
"Today it has just rejected the patentability of software programs."
"I believe we should stick to that and revert to the wording of Article 52 of the Munich European Convention because, in reality, it was not so much a question of confirming the patentability of software programs but rather of an offensive aimed at making them patentable."
"This offensive has been halted today in a major victory for European parliamentary democracy over the lobbies and over the Commission’s manoeuvring."
"Madam President, I want to explain why I voted not to reject the computer-related implemented inventions directive."
"Rejection prolongs the uncertainty about patentability of software-related inventions and is running away from the need to take a decision."
"I regret that MEPs have proved incapable of coming up with a sensible version of the text, one which could ensure support for innovation but also reassure software writers and users that we are not going down an American-style route of allowing patents for pure software."
"The process has displayed all the defects in the way we legislate at EU level, and these failings must be addressed if MEPs are to avoid portraying themselves as incapable of legislating on complex but vital subjects."
"First, secrecy in the Council of Ministers: it is impossible to be well informed on its reasoning."
"Second, obstacles to understanding because of its impenetrable website."
"Third, the wrong choice of European Parliament rapporteur."
"The convention that a report is the property of a group and it is ‘not done’ to query its allocation to a particular member must be junked."
"Fourth, the stupidity of using a misleading shorthand description like ‘software patents’, which is deeply misleading."
"Fifth, the absence of ‘parliamentary draftsmen’ similar to those at Westminster, who can give MEPs guidance on the precise meaning of terminology."
". Today I voted against the Common Position on the Directive on Computer Implemented Inventions (CII) in view of the increased control and over-powering dominance it would give to large software companies and the consequential harmful effects that it would impose on small and medium sized enterprises."
"I see the proposed legislation of making software patentable as a threat to an industry which requires creativity and innovation in order to thrive."
"This directive would simply reduce competition hence leading to higher prices and lower quality for software consumers and non-technology businesses."
"In my opinion, the anti-innovative behaviour that this directive would undoubtedly create would result in nothing but ruinous consequences to democracy, competition and employment."
"– Europe needs clear rules."
"There can be no question of patenting software programs which are, in any event, well protected by copyright."
"It would strike a blow against innovation, with detrimental effects on research, SMEs and Europe."
"The common position was a step in the right direction, but still left grey areas which should have been eliminated by voting for the Rocard amendments."
"I would have voted in favour of them if they had been put to the vote."
"An unnatural coalition was assembled to reject the common position outright with no attempt made to amend it."
"Those for whom the common position did not go far enough linked up with those who feared that, with the amendments proposed, the ban on the patenting of software would carry the day."
"The outright rejection of the proposal means that they were right and that the European Patent Office could therefore continue to develop legal precedents favourable to the patentability of software programs ‘as such’."
"All of that is detrimental to the freedom of ideas and to progress."
"I abstained because, firstly, I cannot approve the common position and, secondly, because I would have preferred to amend the proposal and not to allow the vacuum and the present confusion to continue…"
"We have chosen to vote in favour of the whole proposal concerning computer-implemented inventions being withdrawn."
"We are opposed to patents on pure software and wish to protect classic patent law. Our ambition has been to improve the Council of Ministers’ common position."
"Unfortunately, that has proved difficult, and we are in danger of obtaining an unclear legal document that does not fulfil our demands for legal certainty, a state of affairs that would benefit neither large companies, small companies nor programme developers."
"The only people who would benefit from muddled legislation are the patent lawyers."
"The consequences of certain wordings also have been difficult to foresee."
"Harmonisation in this area is desirable, but we should do better not to have a directive at all than to contribute to bad legislation."
"It is therefore good that Parliament wishes to reject the proposal."
"We think instead that the Commission should again take up the issue of the Community patent, applicable to the whole of the EU."
"One of the main problems in this connection is that the European Patent Office (EPO) has issued a number of trivial patents and patents for pure software."
"The EPO is not, however, subject to the EU, but is governed by a substantial special convention."
"If the EU wishes to take the lead on the issue of a legally certain and transparent patent system in which patents are only issued for genuine inventions, we should introduce a Community patent relating to all areas and not just to computer-implemented inventions."
". We welcome the adoption of our proposal to reject the Council Common Position of March 2005 on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions."
"As we have consistently said since the Commission tabled the proposal for a directive in 2002, implementing software patents would undermine intellectual freedom, technological innovation and the development of Europe’s economy, as scientists, professors, the student community, many organisations and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have rightly pointed out."
"The high costs of patents would hinder SMEs, which would not have the wherewithal to pay for patents and might even see their ideas patented by third parties."
"Software patents might also be used by large companies as a means of blocking new companies from entering the market."
"It is wrong to award patents to ideas, to knowledge and – who knows where it will end – to life itself."
"We have therefore done as before and signed the proposal to reject the Council common position, which was adopted today."
"This is a victory for knowledge, for innovation and for the freedom to create ..."
". I welcome today's rejection of the draft legislation on the patenting of software."
"I joined this rejection after careful consideration and discussions on its implications with small and medium sized company directors from my constituency, which includes 1,500 technology companies with around 40,000 employees based around the hubs of Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire."
"One small businessman told me that the proposed legislation was akin to patenting tomatoes in a recipe, so that no new recipe could ever be produced again which contained tomatoes."
"Today's vote is a clear victory for creativity, entrepreneurship and common sense."
". As the spokesperson for this issue in the Parliament's largest group and head of the Finnish EPP-ED delegation, I think that the decision to reject the common position was the right one."
"According to my estimation, the resulting directive would not have been good enough."
"Rejecting the whole proposal was a smaller setback than it would have been to adopt bad legislation."
"However, I regret that the attempt to harmonise varying patent practises in different Member States was rejected."
"Therefore I'll urge Commission to rapidly reintroduce the Community Patent proposal that was not adopted by the past legislature. Commission should also take the initiative to renovate the European patent system."
"I also consider that today's decision is a major victory for the Parliament as an institution."
"The Council Common Position did not take into account at all the view of the majority of the Parliament."
"The Parliament showed that the Member States in the Council cannot walk all over the Parliament's view - whatever the matter in question."
"The Dutch People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) is delighted that an overwhelming majority of this House has backed the amendment by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats to reject the Common Position."
"The VVD is opposed to European patent laws sector-by-sector, and, favouring an integral approach, calls on the Commission to table a proposal for one single Community patent, which would offer more legal certainty."
"This would make it possible for the current long-winded and costly system of granting patents to be replaced by a more effective one."
"We would urge the Commission to start the debate in the Committee on Legal Affairs as soon as possible in an attempt to harmonise existing European patent law on the basis of Article 95, as a result of which Parliament will acquire codecision and be able democratically to monitor what takes place at the European Patent Office."
"At the same time, we would urge all the lobby organisations to deploy the same heavy artillery to persuade the French Government to abandon their opposition to one official language in Community patents and thereby open up a competitive and innovative future to their young people."
"By so doing, we would not be merely paying lip service to the Lisbon objective, but actually putting our money where our mouth is."
". I voted to reject the Common position, not because I am against the idea of a European wide patent but because this specific proposal was badly drafted and left some vital definitions of what could be patented clouded in confusion."
"As there are currently enormous differences in national patent legislations, I believe it is necessary to adopt a directive to ensure their harmonisation."
"For this reason, I support the consistent protection of software products by protecting proprietary innovatory solutions for an entire program or a part thereof, but not issuing patents for individual ideas."
"After all, it was Einstein who said that you cannot patent a mathematical formula."
"A patentable invention is a solution that combines an idea with a technical device, such as software for mobile phones or ABS systems in cars."
"Patenting will provide companies with returns on their investments in developing an invention, and will encourage further investment in research and development."
"The directive proposed by the Council contains unclear formulations making it impossible to make a precise distinction between software and technical benefits."
"Lack of clear definitions for patenting software may result in competition between companies being shifted from the market to the courts."
"If software became patentable, the costs of the patenting process would ruin small and medium-sized software development companies."
"I have attached my signature in support of the Roithová – Buzek draft amendments, which strive to restrict the scope of the directive so that it does not permit the patenting of pure software, and which are a compromise that will prevent the unclear interpretation of the directive."
"If they are approved, I will support the thus amended text of the Council common position of 7 March 2005."
". Although I was co-author of a series of amendments aimed at improving the final version of the common position, in the event of its adoption by Parliament, I was pleased to vote in favour of its rejection and to see Parliament’s proposal for rejection adopted."
"I feel that this is the best means of preventing the adoption of a document that would clearly have undermined the interests of small and medium-sized software businesses, not to mention consumers’ interests."
"It is also true that the proposal for a common position was at odds with, and failed to promote, the highest principles of creativity and intellectual property."
". The question underpinning this report, and the resolution to which it relates, is that of determining the limits of the patentability of computer-implemented inventions."
"The most common form of software protection in Europe, as we know, has thus far been based on implementing author/copyright arrangements."
"The proposed method will bring us into line with the US, which does not strike me as either beneficial or capable of sharpening the focus of the market in any way whatsoever."
"Rather, it will serve to exacerbate difficulties for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are in fact responsible for most of the innovations and account for 70% of the jobs in the sector."
"In the parliamentary process, it has become clear that the large European businesses have sought to guarantee exclusive use of programs for computer-implemented inventions, and this is at variance with the provisions of the Munich Convention and the case law of the European Patent Office."
"As the report correctly points out, ‘a piece of software is no more patentable than a musical chord or a combination of words."
"As a group of related mathematical formulae, it is a product of the human mind in the realm of ideas. And the free movement of ideas is a founding principle of our civilisation’."
"This is also my opinion."
"– By voting this lunchtime to reject the Council’s common position, I wanted to express a clear rejection of all forms of patentability of software."
"Conversely, I considered that software programs, as a product of the human intellect, were adequately protected by copyright."
"Also, and above all, I voted for the supremacy of politics over technical considerations, in order to revive the spirit of Lisbon."
"As a liberal and fierce defender of the values of entrepreneurial freedom and healthy and fair economic competition, I could not accept a text that was ‘tailor-made’ for certain major companies, already enjoying a virtual monopoly in their respective sectors."
"A proposed directive which over time was intended to nip in the bud the creative spirit of young software developers and the independence of numerous European SMEs and micro-enterprises."
"A text which, let us not mince words, had little to do with the socially aware Europe to which we all aspire."
"Over the two years of this debate, I have not met a single computer expert, university researcher, ordinary user or boss of an SME software producer who had a good word to say in favour of this directive."
"This can be no mere coincidence."
". I was among the small number of Members who voted against the motion to reject the proposal for a directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions."
"Parliament had an opportunity to state its opinion on this proposal and to change its contents as it saw fit during the codecision procedure."
"By voting almost unanimously to reject it, the House is merely side-stepping a decision, which is hardly a responsible course of action."
"The broad coalition comprises groups of Members with widely differing views."
"After a great deal of thought, I found myself unable to identify with any of them."
"Members who are opposed to effective protection for intellectual property as such, or in other words those on the far left, voted against the directive, but I do not belong to their number."
"Those casting ‘no’ votes also included Members who are opposed to a system for providing such protection at European level, or in other words the far right."
"I do not share their views either, as in many countries it costs a great deal of money to register inventions."
"A number of Members voted against the directive because they believe that Parliament’s political influence on the legislative process should be extended."
"Their representatives can be found in every group, but I do not subscribe to their position either."
"Finally, all those Members who believe that the proposal for a directive poses a threat to Poland’s national interests, or in other words Polish MEPs, voted against."
"Quite apart from the fact that unlimited opportunities are available to make amendments, this is a misguided assumption."
"Whether patent protection is defined in a broad or narrow sense, it is conducive to private investment in innovation, and hence to the creation of jobs for research workers."
"The USA spends almost twice as much as Europe on such investment, and one of the main reasons why this is the case is the characteristically broad patent protection available in the USA."
"In spite of this, however, many speakers in this debate have held up the country as a bad example and a warning."
"I welcome the recommendations given in the report, in particular the acceptance of my opposition to arbitrary limits on maritime borders eligible for cross border cooperation, which would have left Norfolk and other parts of my constituency without the possibility to access funding, despite strong historical and cultural ties across the North Sea. My region has participated fully in inter-regional cooperation and Parliament's insistence that an independent strand is maintained for such cooperation is good for the East of England, Britain and all those who want to benefit by joint working and exchanges across European borders."
". I believe it is essential that we have a better understanding of the amounts of polluting substances omitted by installations and for this information to be made easily available to the public by requiring operators to report their emissions."
"These objectives are contained in this legislation which aims at establishing a European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register and is linked to the proposed decision for the EU to accede to the EN-ECE protocol of 21 May 2003 and to incorporate its relevant parts into European Law."
". Environmental issues are at the heart of policies on the future of Europe."
"Accordingly, I feel that tools must be created to raise public awareness of questions of an environmental nature and that better implementation of environmental legislation must be promoted."
"Mr Blokland’s report aims at incorporating the relevant parts of the UN-ECE protocol of May 2003 into Community legislation."
"This report will bring improvements in making information available to the public and in ensuring a better understanding of the amounts of polluting substances emitted by installations."
"I therefore voted in favour of Mr Blokland’s report."
"The major shortcoming of this resolution is that it is hampered by Parliament’s resolution on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013, which accepts a financial envelope of 0.41% of Community GNI for the Structural and Cohesion Funds. The increased cohesion needs in light of the enlargement and economic and social disparities would suggest that this figure falls short of what is required."
"Consequently, we have once again made a number of proposals, including an increase in amounts for the structural funds, aimed at guaranteeing full compensation for the regions affected by the ‘statistical effect’ and at implementing phasing out mechanisms for the Cohesion Fund. These proposals were, to our dismay, rejected by the majority of Members of this House."
"We also deplore the rejection of our proposals to scrap mechanisms affecting the implementation of the Structural Funds, not least the levels of cofinancing and prefinancing and the pegging of the Cohesion Fund to the Stability and Growth Pact, and to scrap mechanisms that undermine the expenditure objective of the Structural Funds (the ‘n+2 rule’)."
"We also feel that the restriction of long-term public aid commitments to businesses should be strengthened, especially in terms of jobs, as we proposed."
"– The reform of the Structural Funds will not solve the problems posed by enlargement in the East; what it will do is penalise France."
"Brussels, which has not calculated the cost of an enlargement which incorporates Eastern Europe, bankrupt after four decades of communism, will pay the new Member States EUR 190 billion in regional aid."
"Will these sums assist their economic integration into the European Union?"
"The German failure in the Eastern states of the former Communist German Democratic Republic suggests it may not."
"This concentration of regional policy on the countries of Eastern Europe will, however, have two unfortunate consequences for France:"
"- It will reduce the already modest share allocated to France."
"For instance, Corsica and French Hainault, in the Nord Pas de Calais region, have not received Structural Funds, intended for Europe’s poor regions, for the last five years."
"- The increase in regional expenditure, which is now the largest item in Europe’s budget, will involve a reduction in agricultural spending, from which our farmers benefited, and an increase in the overall budget of Brussels and, therefore, in the French contribution to that budget."
"More than ever, European regional policy, held up by the federal Europeans of the UMP and PS as manna for our regions, is proving to be an economic and social sham."
". I welcome the adoption of this interim report on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the European Cohesion Fund."
"I am especially pleased that a new paragraph in Article 3 has been adopted, which states that regions affected by the statistical effect – such as the Algarve – must receive sufficient financial support to enable them to pursue the convergence process and that there should be no differential between them on the basis of population."
"Those population-based criteria, which are contained in the Luxembourg Presidency’s negotiating package for the Financial Perspective 2007-2013, are devoid of any objective foundation. They should therefore no longer act as a basis for unfair and disproportionate differentiations, and are little more than an afterthought in the history of solidarity between EU regions."
". I voted in favour of this Report which should guarantee a continuation of European money to the Highlands and Islands in Scotland and offers hope that other parts of Scotland will continue to benefit from access to EU structural funds."
"Of course until we have a budget settlement it is impossible to know the extent of the funding flow."
"I welcome proposed reforms that should enhance the quality of EU structural funds expenditure such as more simplification, better strategic planning, cutting bureaucracy and more transparency and accountability."
". – I, like the large majority of my political group, supported the Hatzidakis report because:"
"· it supports the regions in danger of being damaged by the statistical effect of enlargement;"
"· it calls for the outermost regions to be treated as a special case as regards their access to the Structural Funds;"
"· it proposes that unspent resources due to the N+2 rule be reallocated to areas which can make good use of them;"
"· it rejects any renationalistion of regional policy spending;"
"· it calls for fair treatment for islands and sparsely populated regions;"
"· it makes the rights of people with disabilities a prime priority of cohesion policy."
"The amendments which I tabled with other MEPs of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left:"
"· strengthen the text and make clear to the European Commission and the Council that competitiveness and entrepreneurship cannot be promoted at the expense of sustainable development and cohesion;"
"· call for an increase in resources for the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, because an unequal Europe cannot be viable;"
"· call for better control of state aid, so that it is not an incentive for relocating businesses within Europe at the expense of the workers in various regions."
". I voted in favour of this report because I feel that it covers a range of aspects that are of major importance to Portugal, and indeed equally positive for the European Union in which I believe."
"The European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund are all of the highest importance in promoting the objectives of economic growth competitiveness, wealth creation and reducing the enormous regional disparities."
"I was therefore pleased to see the rapporteur address areas that I consider essential."
"For example, the report rejects any attempt to renationalise regional policy and any attempt to reduce amounts of state aid to least favoured regions, and endorses the Commission’s proposal to penalise businesses that relocate but still enjoy the benefits of European funds."
". The Hatzidakis report sets out the European Parliament’s perspective on the future reform of structural funds."
"The inclusion of ‘statistical effect’, the recognition of natural effect regions, the rejection of the 150 km limit for defining maritime regions, the emphasis on equality issues and the strengthening of environmental concerns should all be welcomed."
"On Amendment 42 and original paragraph 13 the EPLP abstained due to the language of the text."
". – The Communist Party of Greece voted against the reports on the Structural Funds for the fourth Community Support Framework for 2007-2013, because they serve the anti-grass roots policy of the ΕU and the safeguarding of increased profits for big business."
"The Structural Funds are used by governments to strengthen the plutocracy of the Member States, the imperialist plans of the Member States, the concentration of capital and the escalation of the monopolies."
"They are used to promote capitalist restructurings which strike at the wage and social rights of the workers and at health, welfare and education, and to make sweeping changes in the rural economy and other sectors."
"They are used for ideological terrorism, military spending on the imperialist aggression of the ΕU and ΝΑΤΟ and for bribery and corruption in order to mislead the working and grass-roots movement."
"The law of asymmetrical development is inexorable."
"Social and regional disparities are worsening instead of getting better."
"Enormous problems are faced by the workers and, in particular, the residents of the island, outlying and mountain areas of Greece."
"The allegations about promoting the convergence and cohesion policy of the ΕU through the Structural Funds are the greatest fraud against the workers, women, farmers and the grass-roots classes."
"Greece is a typical example because, according to the statistics, seven Greek regions, 80% of the population, are in danger of falling outside Objective 1 funding from the Structural Funds."
". We feel that one of the key issues with regard to the current proposal for a regulation for the Cohesion Fund – already covered in the previous regulation – is the pegging of the Cohesion Fund to the Stability and Growth Pact, in other words, the possibility of suspending all or part of the financial aid from the Fund to cohesion countries, such as Portugal, if the decision provided for in Article 104(8) of the EC Treaty is adopted."
"The country concerned will thus be penalised twice over and the rapporteur’s proposal to make this a political decision by the Council, rather than an automatic decision, does not resolve the problem."
"We are also opposed to the so-called ‘n+2’ rule being applied to the Cohesion Fund, which will place new restrictions on the use of these funds by countries that ought to be aiming to bring their levels of economic and social development up to the Community average."
"We also consider the amounts earmarked for this Fund for 2007 to 2013 to be inadequate, particularly in light of the EU enlargement."
"In view of the rejection of proposals that we tabled aimed at amending these and other measures that we felt were steps in the wrong direction, we voted against this resolution."
". One of the key aspects of the debate on the future of the Cohesion Fund is, of course, that of ‘statistical wealth’."
"Every aspect of this fund is extremely important, yet the aspect that most concerns me, and without doubt the national authorities, is that of apparent wealth stemming from actual impoverishment due to the loss of support breaking an unfinished cycle of growth."
"This is the key problem for Portugal in talks on the future of this fund, and is my greatest concern."
"I welcome the fact that the report is mindful of the need to find an adequate political response to this question."
"The accession of ten new countries has presented the EU’s internal cohesion with one of its greatest challenges. It has exacerbated differences in economic development and regional economic and social disparities across the Union."
"Greater effort is therefore required on the part of the EU’s cohesion policy, which is currently undergoing a root and branch reform with a view to taking on board the impact of enlargement."
"In a Union enlarged to 25 countries, the instruments of cohesion policy must be provided with the appropriate financial resources, which must in turn be distributed fairly among the least favoured regions, not only of the ‘new’ Member States but also the ‘old’ ones. This must be done in such a way that we can press ahead with reducing the gap between the levels of development of the various regions and the extent to which certain EU regions are lagging behind (the current ‘convergence’ objective), and with meeting the new ‘regional competitiveness and employment’ objective."
"The recommendations tabled in the various reports submitted to the vote today, and particularly that of my Group colleague Mr Fava on the European Regional Development Fund, address these concerns."
"As regards the allocation to these funds, we await with interest the Council agreement on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013, which we hope will be equal to the new challenges facing the EU’s cohesion policy."
". I strongly welcome the adoption of my key amendments to the ERDF regulation, which will ensure full access to the funds, without discrimination, and will also seek to use the fund to tackle the particular social, economic and environmental problems faced by predominantly rural areas, such as my own constituency, particularly through diversification measures, entrepreneurship and through stimulating local employment."
"I also welcome the adoption of my amendments to mitigate the environmental impact of business and domestic activity, and prioritise climate change, biodiversity, environmental management, and sustainable energy production in the use of funding - growth areas of massive potential in the East of England"
". Portugal has benefited considerably in recent years from the European Regional Development Fund."
"At national level, we might take issue with some – or indeed a large number – of the priorities set by the different governments for the use of these funds, and can demonstrate our disappointment at the eventual impact, given that we deserve more and better."
"Nonetheless, we must recognise the enormously positive effect that this fund has had on Portugal and must focus on the rules that will apply to it in times ahead."
"Accordingly, I endorse the priorities expressed in this report, such as that of ensuring that these funds are distributed more fairly, in such a way that past and future enlargements do not undermine the least developed regions and countries of the EU. Particular attention should also be paid to ‘statistical wealth’, which is not real wealth and should not be treated as such."
". I welcome this report in general but am particularly pleased with the overwhelming support given to proposals to ensure non-discrimination and accessibility for 50 million disabled persons to goods and services, infrastructures, buildings and ICT funded by the new regulations for 2007-13."
"The position adopted on Article 2 of the ERDF promoting social inclusion and recognising the need to remove barriers faced by disabled people in accessing goods and services in built up areas is particularly welcome."
"– Madam President, this is a sad and tragic day for the new Member States, which are suffering yet more discrimination."
"With regard to the Hatzidakis, Fava and Andria reports, the ground rules have been changed."
"The scope for new Member States to use the Structural Funds has been altered and severely restricted, with the goalposts being moved in terms of the N+2 rule for the Cohesion Fund and with the rejection of private sector participation."
"It is discrimination against the local authorities and civil organisations in the new Member States."
"All Members of Parliament for the new Member States have voted unanimously to defend their interests."
"What is happening is discriminatory, and it shows a lack of solidarity by Parliament."
"It is a very unfortunate message to be giving to the new Member States."
". The strengthening of economic, social and territorial cohesion through cross-border, transnational and inter-regional cooperation is one of the Union’s fundamental objectives."
"Such cooperation fosters the balanced and harmonious integration and development of the European Union."
"To this end, the Union has set up internal and external instruments for cross-border cooperation within the EU."
"Steps taken to reduce difficulties in managing cross-border, transnational and inter-regional cooperation are therefore of particular importance."
"I therefore endorse the report by Mr Olbrycht on instituting a Community-level instrument which allows the creation of cooperative groupings in the Community territory, invested with legal personality, to be known as ‘European groupings of territorial cooperation (EGTC)’. I feel that an instrument of this nature can make a positive contribution to the balance of territorial cohesion in Europe."
". The British Conservative party support the European Social Fund and in general the amendments made to the report by the rapporteur."
"In particular, the initial block vote of 80 amendments contained positive modifications looking to promote women's participation in the labour market and promoting work-life balance."
"However, Conservatives do not support amendment 58 which looked to specifically promote capacity-building and the networking activities of NGOs."
"The resolution adopted by Parliament on the European Social Fund closely follows the Commission’s proposal, in that it places emphasis on the European Employment Strategy and the Lisbon Strategy. It is true that some amendments have been introduced, here and there, to cover the experience of the Equal Programme, gender equality, the fight against poverty and disability issues."
"We regret however the rejection of four proposals that we tabled, which were intended:"
"- to promote high-quality work in all aspects, in addition to issues of training and acquiring new skills, by promoting improved working conditions (in terms of hygiene and safety, health and patterns of working time), stable contractual relations, adequate salaries, and working hours that are compatible with family life;"
"- in light of the social and economic situation in each Member State and the social challenges faced by the Union, to build a broad support framework, with special emphasis on increasing the workers’ qualifications, on improving working conditions, on the objective of full, high-quality employment with rights and on the fight against poverty and social exclusion."
". The European Social Fund (ESF) has always played a key role in European development, albeit with certain changes of direction over time with regard to its areas of intervention."
"The Commission’s latest proposal can be divided into two parts: one with a view to modernising the European social model by investing in people, and the other to simplifying texts and procedures."
"Although I welcome the Commission’s proposal, I go along with the idea that the actions of the ESF should not be channelled exclusively into the regions belonging to the convergence objective. Quite the opposite, in fact;"
"I feel that support for people should be provided on a non-discriminatory basis."
"Accordingly, I support the amendment to Article 3(1), aimed at broadening the scope of application of this fund, and broadly endorse the Silva Peneda report."
"Many of the report’s objectives in terms of sustainable integration, social protection and increased gender equality are worth striving for."
"However, these issues are best dealt with at lower levels of decision-making, rather than at EU level."
"With a view to controlling the EU’s growing zeal for centralisation and regulation, the EU’s tasks need to be clearly demarcated and its budget kept within bounds."
"In the light of this, we cannot support the proposal to allocate EUR 336.2 billion to the European Social Fund between 2007 and 2013."
"I strongly welcome a majority of the amendments adopted to the ESF regulation, aimed at using ESF funding to reinforce social inclusion and sustainable inclusion in the labour market."
"In particular, my own amendments which seek to improve accessibility for disabled persons in the workplace, and to train employers in equal opportunities recruitment, disability awareness and non-discrimination."
"I also welcome the adoption of my amendments that prioritise the involvement of local communities and enterprises and promoting local development initiatives, such as urban social projects, lifelong learning and active citizenship."
"Voluntary organisations at the grassroots level must be enabled to take part in our funding programmes."
"Finally, the emphasis on my amendments to supplement employment and growth criteria with social indicators such as skills deficits, numbers of elderly persons and lone parents - mean that pockets of poverty in otherwise relatively more prosperous regions like my own in the East of England can continue to have their needs heard at the European level."
"For over 40 years the European Social Fund has been the financial instrument of Europe’s social policy and is widely seen as a resounding success. For that matter, Portugal has been a privileged witness to this success."
"This fund is of particular importance at this juncture, when our efforts should be channelled into implementing the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"It is very much in Portugal’s interests to see this strategy, which was set out in Lisbon, become a reality, not in terms of repeated statements of intent, but of practical steps, of realistic definitions of priorities and of significant action."
"Against this backdrop, the proposals tabled by both the Council and the rapporteur are worthy of my wholehearted support, as both clearly address these concerns."
"We Moderates have today rejected the European Parliament’s proposal concerning the European Fisheries Fund."
"We believe that the European Fisheries Fund needs proper restructuring, as proposed by the Commission."
"We do not, however, believe that fisheries policy requires increased appropriations."
". Whilst it contained some points that we welcome, two points led us to vote against this resolution:"
"- the Commission’s proposal for the European Fisheries Fund is consistent with the financial guidelines of the latest review of the common fisheries policy, in 2002, to which we were opposed."
"- the financial envelope proposed for 2007-2013 is EUR 4.9 billion, virtually unchanged from the amount set aside in Agenda 2000 for the EU of 15. This clearly falls a long way short of addressing the challenges facing the fisheries sector and the regions that depend on that sector."
"Increasing the budget earmarked for this Fund will play a key role in ensuring support for small-scale, traditional coastal fishing, securing investment in renewing and modernising the fleet, taking socio-economic measures to compensate for the reduced fishing effort, financing recovery plans, and providing support for aquaculture-related industrial and commercial activities, with the involvement of fishermen and their associations, in line with the co-management principle."
"Lastly, we regret the rejection of our proposals to fund compensation for fishermen’s loss of earnings due to a recovery plan and to place owners and workers on an equal footing when it comes to public aid for permanent cessation."
"– European and French fishermen do not need a new financial mechanism – yesterday the FIFG, today the European Fisheries Fund – what they need is hope for the future."
"Sustainable development and the precautionary principle, general principles applied to the common fisheries policy, only serve to disguise a restrictive policy in terms of fisheries, fishing areas, fishing days and agreements with third countries."
"Under the pretext of protecting stocks, the fisherman is being eliminated – that is the overall approach of the European Commission which, moreover, does not impose the same constraints and costs on non-Community fleets as it does on European fishermen."
"To combat this policy, we intend to foster the development of the French fishing industry, which indirectly provides employment for 100 000 people, in order to reduce our trade deficit and allow fishermen to ply their trade in optimal conditions of work and safety."
". The Portuguese authorities and Portuguese representatives in Community institutions need to pay special attention to issues of fisheries."
"It is good news that the sea, including fisheries of course, has once again become one of the main headings of national development. It is therefore crucial that we attach the highest importance to this report, so that we can defend our legitimate interests."
"I refer in particular to replacing old vessels, to broadening the scope of measures to modernise the fishing fleet, to protecting small fishing, to aquaculture, to commercialisation and to geographical concerns. After all, Portugal must not forget that there are major conurbations in its coastal areas – due to the country’s history and geography – and there would be no justification for excluding those areas from Community support."
"As I said, these were the main factors that influenced my vote."
". The Casa report reopens the CFP reforms negotiated in 2002."
"The EPLP cannot back the report due to the report's inclusion of issues such as boat modernisation and renewal and joint ventures. The use of public money to build new boats and therefore to increase capacity cannot be acceptable at a time when so many fish stocks are under threat."
"If the European Parliament is serious about sustainability then it is a sad day that so many have backed this report."
".The adopted resolution, which is, it must be said, unsatisfactory in certain areas, seeks to modernise the principle of equal treatment between men and women in matters of employment and occupation."
"Unequal treatment can occur not only in the workplace but also in access to jobs, to training and to promotion."
"The monitoring of these practices should therefore cover all of these areas."
"What the Member States need to do, in conjunction with the social partners, is to combat the problem of the continuing gender-based wage differentials and gender segregation on the labour market by means of regulatory measures enabling both men and women to combine family and work commitments more easily."
"This will entail regulatory measures covering parental leave arrangements, which can be taken up by both parents, and the establishment of accessible and affordable childcare services and care for dependents."
"Furthermore, if we are to achieve equality between women and men, changes applicable to both men and women will need to be made."
"It is therefore important that the Member States, in collaboration with the social partners, implement strategies to make equality between men and women a reality."
"We are completely in favour of women and men being treated equally in matters of employment and occupation."
"This is a crucial area with which international organisations such as the ILO are adept at dealing."
"We do not believe that the EU should regulate issues of this type in far-reaching reports along the lines of political programmes."
"It is not for the EU to take charge of significant national issues such as working time regulations and parental leave."
"These are matters that the Member States can usefully deal with independently in accordance with international agreements already adopted."
"– When the European Commission takes steps to simplify and strengthen the legal basis and codify Community legislation, it can count on us."
"For me, this is an encouraging initiative because it concerns Community legislation on the equality of treatment and opportunity for men and women, which has developed since 1975."
"In spite of its imperfections and the shortcomings in the way it has been applied, this legislation has made a major contribution to reducing discrimination against women, especially in the workplace."
"Belonging to a generation which has suffered all possible and impossible types of discrimination, I understand the true value of the Community policy of equality of treatment."
"Of course, in addition to codification, it could be the subject of innovation."
"Our demands, which are intended to improve it, have been set out here, also in relation to self-employed workers and assisting spouses."
"Our rapporteur and I, with other colleagues in my group, have had great difficulty in thwarting the preposterous demands of certain extremists, demands which are counter-productive for employment and the very equality of opportunity for women which they claim to want to foster."
"Our amendments are intended to prevent unreasonable delays in adopting this important legislation at second reading, by bringing it into line with the Council’s general philosophy."
". The principle of equal treatment has been enshrined in Community legislation for decades, yet it has thus far not been possible to put an end to inequality between men and women."
"Wage differentials between men and women in the EU have remained alarmingly high in recent years, even though the rate of women’s participation in the labour market has risen."
"The average gender-specific wage differential in the European Union is still 16%."
"This is often directly linked to how well family life and employment are reconciled."
"I therefore give my backing to the report on the Commission proposal aimed at modernising and simplifying Community law in the area of equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation."
"I believe that the Member States must take further steps to implement Community law, by promoting information campaigns to change attitudes in the world of work."
"At the same time, the social partners can play a decisive role in this by promoting flexible working arrangements which allow both women and men to combine work and family life more successfully."
". Mrs Niebler has lent her backing to the Commission’s primary objective, which is to use this directive to simplify and clarify the law in force."
"I share her view that this new version of the directive represents a step in the right direction for Community law in the area of equal treatment between men and women."
"I support Mrs Niebler’s report, which draws attention to the need to meet the objective of modernising and simplifying Community legislation in the area of equality between men and women in matters of employment and occupation, in order to give greater clarity and legal certainty."
"The rapporteur rightly points out that it has not yet been possible to put an end to inequality between men and women."
"The legal conditions are there on paper, but we have yet to achieve success in this area, which is a key element of Europe’s social objectives."
"– If there is one field in which the rules must be clear and certain, it is the legal field in relation to contractual obligations."
"And that is the great merit of Mrs Wallis’ report, which helps to improve legal certainty in this area."
"Rather than seek an artificial unification of all rules of law, she achieves unification by proposing a harmonisation of the rules governing the conflict of laws and jurisdiction – which is the correct approach – in order to determine which law is to apply, and this makes it possible to combine the package of national rules with the demands of legal certainty."
"With regard to the damage to personal reputation or private life due to attacks by the media, it should be emphasised that obtaining compensation has become extremely difficult."
"The necessary right of reply, in particular, tends to be substantively violated due to the procedural difficulties with which it has to contend, all in the name of an abusive interpretation of press freedom."
"In this context, the proposed solutions are reasonable but must not restrict the rights of the persons subject to attack."
"We shall vote in favour of this report."
"We are in principle well disposed towards the proposal to create standard conflict-of-laws rules for non-contractual obligations."
"The proposal would supplement the Brussels Regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, together with the Rome Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations."
"It would contribute to increased legal certainty and an efficient internal market."
"We think it important, however, to guarantee that the regulation does not come into conflict with freedom of the press and freedom of expression."
"The protection of press freedom and freedom of expression, afforded under the Swedish Constitution, must continue unchanged."
"Nor would it be appropriate for foreign law to be applied in assessing the permissibility of industrial action taken under Swedish law on Swedish territory."
"In both these areas, it is moreover doubtful whether there is a legal basis in the EC Treaty for such a regulation."
"We therefore support those amendments whereby the law in the country in which the actions are carried out is applied to industrial action, and we reject the amendments entailing unacceptable interference in national rules on freedom of the press and freedom of expression."
". Environmental issues are at the heart of policies on Europe’s future."
"As such, the establishment of nationwide pollutant release and transfer registers (PRTRs) will be a key factor in providing the public with transparent and coherent access to information."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"We voted in favour of the report on the mandate for the 2006 budget conciliation procedure before the Council’s first reading."
"It constitutes a sound basis for the continued budget process."
"We believe, however, that the structure of the EU budget must become more modern."
"This requires, for example, reform of the common agricultural policy, with a reduction in the intervention prices in the agricultural markets, a reduction in direct aid and a gradual transition to national cofinancing."
"A reduction in the amounts for the international fisheries agreements is also justified."
"We also believe that cohesion policy should focus on the needs of the new Member States."
"We are voting in favour of the report on the mandate for the 2006 budget conciliation procedure."
"We believe, however, that the EU budget should be reformed and modernised in the future."
"This mainly requires reform of agricultural policy."
"We believe that the amount appropriated to agricultural aid should be reduced."
"We also believe that cohesion policy should be focused mainly on the needs of the new Member States."
"– Madam President, I would like to comment on the Bozkurt report on the position of women in Turkey."
"We eleven New Democracy MEPs supported the report, which our various and numerous amendments helped to shape."
"We set great store by this report for various reasons:"
"Firstly, it emphasises that women's rights are an integral part of human rights, of the which the candidate countries have an obligation to adopt and apply."
"Secondly, it sets the framework for our continuing negotiations with Turkey."
"It is even emphasised in this report that the report drafted by the European Commission, which will form the framework for negotiations between the European Commission and Turkey, must also include the situation of women and Turkey's obligations with regard to this part of the ."
"Our reservation concerns the criminal code, which is why we voted against paragraph 4."
"We welcome the application of the said criminal code, but we note that this has been a satisfactory point so far and we need to encourage steps in this direction."
"However, it is not enough for the Turkish criminal code to be applied; it must also be reformed, because it does not refer to honour killings."
"We believe that the EU is a union of values and that Turkey is part of its neighbourhood."
"We therefore also support the report aimed at increasing the role of women in Turkey."
"We support Turkey’s closer association with the EU but believe that neither Turkey nor the EU is at present ready for union."
"Turkey does not, for example, fulfil the human rights requirements for becoming a member."
"The EU must also change."
"The rigid bureaucratic structure and the expensive agricultural policy must be fundamentally reformed before Turkey can become a member."
"– This report, or rather this indictment, should suffice to make it clear to all supporters of a Europe without frontiers, without culture and without a past, that Turkey is not a European country and that our western democratic model is not necessarily shared by a nation whose heritage has other sources."
"This report is a litany of all the serious abuses of women’s rights committed by the Turkish State, be it different types of violence, the access of women to the employment market or their absence from the representative political institutions."
"This report also highlights the discriminatory system which, from the earliest age, forces women into a marginalised and subservient role."
"Finally, it is clear that Turkey has a system for the oppression of minorities, particularly the Kurdish communities."
"The limited steps that the Turkish Government has resolved to take in this area and the practical difficulties in implementing them rule out the possibility that Turkey will meet the conditions – which, moreover, are inadequate – for accession to the European Union."
"In view of this, and mindful of the instructive outcome of the French and Dutch referenda, we demand an immediate halt to accession negotiations with Turkey."
". I voted for this report which draws attention to the situation of women in Turkey."
"It rightly notes that Turkish women face economic hardship, a high rate of violence against them and a low rate of participation in politics - only 44 of Member's of parliament are women."
"However, it is also correct to note that the situation is improving and recent legislative reforms, especially in the Penal Code, have improved the situation."
". The Turkish Government’s efforts at improving the position of women represent an attempt on its part at approximating to Western standards."
"Women themselves benefit from the rights accorded them by law to varying degrees: while equality appears to have become established in elite circles, little has yet happened to affect the broad mass of people."
"The contrary is the case, for, as the benefits of state-sponsored modernisation continue to be out of their reach, they are more and more likely to throw in their lot with Islamic parties that enjoy a surge of popularity by offering what they claim to be ‘solutions’."
"Many elements militate against the success of this approach."
"In the first place, political and social involvement was, or is, fostered only in so far as it does not cause the relationship between the sexes to be questioned, or, to put it another way, only on condition that women remain subservient."
"Another problematic aspect is the way in which the lack of social contact between the various ethnic or religious groups or social classes have resulted in entrenched divisions between some women and others."
"It also testifies to the low esteem in which women are held that the state’s official statistics make no reference to unemployed women, on the assumption that they will resume their ‘normal role’ as housewives."
"This not only prevents Turkey from serving as an example, but also presents a distorted image of it, and this is something to which closer consideration needs to be given in view of the accession negotiations."
". I agree with the general approach of Rapporteur Dimitrakopoulos on EU-Iraq relations which contains a serious and realistic assessment of the present situation in Iraq, including a great concern over the deteriorating security."
"The Report also incorporates key PES demands for the EU and its Member States to promote a new UN Security Council Resolution on Iraq which would lead to a decision on ""substitution of foreign troops in Iraq by a UN peace-keeping force"", the withdrawal ""to be progressively implemented following a clear timetable."""
"I consider that Amendments 10, 11, 12, and 13 are vital to a balanced and acceptable way forward."
"The UN has an important role in the reconstruction of Iraq and in ensuring that democratic institutions are set up."
"We support those parts of the report that emphasise the UN’s role in constructing a democratic and stable Iraq."
"At the same time, the report is clearly aimed at strengthening the EU’s foreign and security policy mandate."
"A strengthening of the EU within this area would be in danger of weakening the UN."
"We therefore choose to vote against the report as a whole."
". This report draws a veil of silence over the scandalous attack on Iraq by the USA and its allies, the 100 000-plus dead and the murder, oppression and torture carried out by the invading troops."
"This is a report that seeks to expunge the ‘past’ (which is after all the brutal present); a report that calls for ‘more multilateral’ ‘conflict management’, by which it means the invasion; a report that equates the Iraqi people’s legitimate resistance with ‘terrorism’; a report that glosses over the torture carried out by the USA, calling it ‘violations of rights’; a report that hypocritically, calls on Iraq’s neighbours not to interfere in the country’s affairs, without a single word of condemnation of the USA’s invasion and occupation; a report that seeks to share that occupation and plunder with the USA, under the UN umbrella; a report that, in an appalling act of meddling, advocates implanting capitalism, its instruments and its policies."
"In other words, for the dominant players in Parliament, any misunderstandings that may have taken place between the EU and the USA must be overcome. This is indicative of the trend for compromise, with a view to satisfying the interests of big business, and for retreat, in the face of the USA’s hegemonic intentions, whereby the UN is manipulated and reduced to a supporting role."
"Hence our vote against."
". I support the rapporteur's efforts to move the debate on Iraq away from the rights and wrongs of the war and the pre-war situation in the Country, onto an analysis of the present situation and the future of Iraq."
"The report clearly condemns all forms of terrorism and acts of violence."
"I welcome its references to the need for respect of international legality and for relevant international covenants of human rights, the respect of women's rights and all minorities in the Country and the condemnation of the violations of prisoner's rights in Abu Grahib prison"
"The report suggests a series of workable measures for the humanitarian, social and economic rehabilitation of the Country."
"."
"By legitimising the war of aggression against Iraq, the resolution submitted to this House for a decision on ‘the EU’s increasing involvement in Iraq’ takes us in quite the wrong direction."
"By expressing ‘the need to move on from past events’, it dismisses at the very outset the fact that no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, with the evident intention that the waging of a war of aggression against Iraq by the USA and its allies should be forgotten."
"While the resolution calls for ‘support for the active work of the European Union with the Iraqi authorities in the fight against terrorism’, it does so without a single reference to what the causes of terrorism might be."
"Although the EU is meant to be making even more funding available in the future, the fact is that the funds already provided are being administered in part by the World Bank Trust rather than entirely by the United Nations; moreover, it is also the case that the World Bank Trust has so far made actual use of only a fraction of the funds at its disposal, and the Iraqi authorities have simply failed to produce any transparent account of what has been done with them, thus making it impossible to ascertain where European taxpayers’ money is going."
"All this adds up to no kind of guarantee that Iraq will be reconstructed along democratic lines."
". I voted in favour of the final version of this report because it was improved substantially by the amendments made to it."
"This is not the time for reopening the debate on military intervention in Iraq, an issue on which I have spoken before."
"The important matter for debate now is what role the EU should have at this stage of Iraq’s political life."
"As I see it, the EU must act in conjunction with its traditional allies and with the Iraqi authorities, bearing in mind the extraordinary courage shown by the Iraqi people, who responded positively to the call to the ballot box despite the terrible threats issued by the terrorists who continue to operate over part of Iraqi territory."
"I also feel that this cooperation must, of course, fall under United Nations policy on Iraq."
"In conclusion I believe that the EU must cooperate unreservedly with the legitimate Iraqi authorities, and must condemn unequivocally those who continue to destabilise the country by force."
"We had our differences of opinion on military intervention, but we must show a united front in support of the Iraqi people currently suffering at the hands of terrorist groups."
". To be consistent with previous votes on Iraq, I have abstained on the whole report and all amendments."
"This report is badly drafted and detracts from the main issue before the House today which is 'Making Poverty History'."
".– The report on Iraq expresses the EU's efforts to create preconditions so that it will have a larger portion when the area is shared out."
"Since the summit in Athens in 2004 and in its subsequent resolutions and decisions, the ΕU has already legalised the imperialist war against Iraq and recognised the occupying government, demonstrating that it and the USA have a single imperialist policy against the peoples."
"This is also expressed in the approval by the ΕU of the US-ΝΑΤΟ plan for the Middle East as a whole, which endeavours to control the wealth-producing resources and the countries of the area in order to safeguard the interests of the multinationals, big business and imperialist sovereignty."
"At the same time, antagonism between the imperialists is increasing in their bid to safeguard a bigger share of the spoils."
"There can be no solution for the benefit of the Iraqi people as long as there is foreign intervention and occupation by the US and European military."
"We voted against the report, calling for the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces as the precondition to the finding of a solution by the people of Iraq, who alone are responsible for determining their future."
"Iraq should be paid compensation for the damage which it has suffered and the US and its allies who unleashed the unjust, imperialist war should pay."
"The right of the peoples to determine their future is non-negotiable."
". I fully support this Joint motion."
"It is totally unacceptable that extreme poverty affects over one billion people, and that in sub-Saharan Africa about 300 million people live in absolute poverty and millions of people die each year from a lack of health care, clean water, decent housing and adequate nutrition."
"There is an opportunity for the EU and its Member States to demonstrate leadership on poverty and fair trade at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles, at the MDGs Conference in New York in September and at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December."
"Attaining the MDGs and combating global poverty will require all donors to increase the quantity and improve the quality of aid, make trade fairer and abolish unsustainable debt."
"I spoke in our plenary meeting in Luxembourg all those years ago in support of the first Live Aid event."
"Today we have just seen the enormous upwelling of support again following Live 8 for Making Poverty History."
"Yet politicians have failed to deliver, with almost a billion people in the world living on less than one euro a day."
"Words are not enough; we need action."
"The Globalisation Intergroup in Parliament, which I chair, has over 100 members."
"We commit ourselves to pursuing fair trade and further aid here in Parliament."
"This will require enormous resources."
"We believe one source will be through promoting a capital transfer tax."
"France and Belgium have already passed the necessary legislation and Italy is considering the same."
"I call on all other Member States to look urgently to emulating them and, in doing so, to raise enough funds to provide basic housing, healthcare, sanitation and education for all those living on less than one euro a day."
"We wholeheartedly support the fight against global poverty."
"We believe that the EU can make a valuable contribution to this very important struggle by campaigning for radical reform of the EU’s protectionist trade policy, phasing out the EU’s destructive fisheries agreements with third countries and ceasing to pay export subsidies to European manufacturers of products such as, for example, milk and sugar."
"However, the resolution contains extremely limited wordings when it comes to urgent reforms of this kind."
"Our view is that the EU should not concern itself with aid issues. Instead, significant issues of this kind should be dealt with by the respective Member States."
"International aid efforts should be coordinated by organisations that have long experience and wide-ranging legitimacy, such as the UN and UN bodies."
". I warmly welcome this resolution as a further step towards the realisation of the Millennium Development Goals, especially with regard to the G8 Summit currently being held in Gleneagles and the UK Presidency of the EU."
"I particularly support the resolution's call on the UK to use its Presidency of the G8 to put poverty at the heart of the international as well as the European agenda, and for Member States to underline their commitment to the eradication of poverty by seizing the opportunities offered in the coming months."
"Whilst focus on development policy must remain a key feature of the European Union after 2005, I strongly believe we must also be careful to maintain a balanced approach to the eradication of poverty, using Trade as central tool."

"‘Fighting poverty in Europe: last week, in Paris, the elections were deferred at short notice, and hundreds of thousands of people protested, facing violence at the hands of police units."
"Many of them were killed."
"Almost unanimously, the European Parliament denounced the security forces’ action and promptly appointed a committee of enquiry to determine whether any of the demonstrators had been killed by units trained by the EU."
"At the same time, it passed a resolution to the effect that all EU military advisors should be recalled from France at once.’"
"This is a true story – apart from a few details."
"On 30 June, in the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, people who had responded to opposition parties’ calls for peaceful demonstrations against the deferment of elections were attacked by soldiers and police."
"According to agency reports, several of them were killed, and a state of emergency declared."
"The European Union, in the shape of ‘EUPOL Kinshasa’, is currently in Congo training police units, some of which are deployed in Kinshasa."
"EU military advisors (EUSEC D.R. Congo) have also been working ‘in the Defence Minister’s office’ and ‘with the General Staff’ since 8 June this year."
"This House did not, of course, hold a special sitting to debate these things, any more than it appointed a committee of enquiry to find out whether police units that the EU had trained had had any hand in the killings."
"The EU’s military advisors continue to function at the highest levels in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
". It is our duty and in our interest to promote better living conditions throughout the world."
"A noteworthy series of initiatives to fight poverty was put in place a number of years ago, but it did not even fulfil the lowest of expectations, let alone produce the results that one would have wished to see."
"There are countries and regions in the world where that fight has borne some fruit, not because poverty has been eliminated – far from it – but because it has emerged that they are moving in the right direction, and this is true of parts of Asia and Latin America."
"Unfortunately, this is the exception rather than the rule in Africa, where we must redouble our efforts, but where those efforts must be reciprocated locally."
"It is impossible to help those who do not allow their people to be helped, those who harm their people, those who foment the causes of poverty, not least corruption."
"I therefore feel that EU-backed initiatives must attach the fight against poverty to the fight to create conditions for local development, by promoting democracy, freedom, human rights and a market economy."
"Handing out money – or writing off debts – does not go far enough, and nor is it always the right way forward."
"We must do and achieve more and, above all, better."
". The 'Make Poverty History' campaign has placed the plight of the world's poorest at centre stage."
"There is an opportunity, as the G8 begins its deliberations today in Scotland, to make real progress on Africa and climate change."
"I hope the leaders will grasp this 'thistle' and make a real difference to those most in need."
"The June List supports the Swedish Government’s demand that cohesion aid be reduced from the proposed EUR 336.1 billion to not quite EUR 200 billion in the financial perspectives for 2007-2013."
"The reports should be about the most suitable ways of reducing expenditure so as to come closer to meeting the G6 countries’ demand for a budget not exceeding 1.00% of the Member States’ gross national income."
"The basis for any cohesion policy must be that aid needs to go to the very poorest countries."
"At present, far too much money goes to poor regions in relatively rich countries."
"The current system is not only unjust towards the poorest countries. The system may also appear cynical because rich countries are not themselves permitted to help less well-placed regions in the same way as they could if the larger part of cohesion policy were re-nationalised."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the Balkans 10 years after Srebrenica."
". Mr President, I am delighted to be here at the European Parliament at the start of the British Presidency of the European Union."
"The next six months will be a critical time for many of the western Balkan states."
"As Minister for Europe, I am looking forward to pursuing the inherited agenda and working to help the countries of the region move further along the road to Europe."
"Next week – as recognised by the title of this debate – marks the tenth anniversary of the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995."
"Seven to eight thousand Muslim men and women were killed in cold blood in the worst act of genocide in Europe since 1945."
"We recognise that the international community failed to realise what was happening until it was too late and failed in its duty to protect innocent civilians, unarmed men, women and children."
"However, whatever the sins of omission of the international community, which we deeply regret at this time of sadness and remembrance, let us not forget the sins of commission by the attacking Bosnian Serb forces."
"The ultimate responsibility lies with those who murdered, raped and tortured in cold blood."
"As we all know, some have already been tried and found guilty of their part in these atrocities, others have been acquitted."
"But those held most responsible – Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic – are still at large as fugitives from justice."
"Ten years on from this terrible event, it is surely time for the authorities in the region – in Serbia and Montenegro, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in Croatia – to grasp the nettle and meet their international obligations to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia."
"But it is also time for them to honour their obligations to people to remove the outstanding obstacles to them taking their rightful place within the European family of nations."
"I call upon all those in a position to make a difference to work together to remove this poison from the body politic, and to hand over all outstanding fugitives indicted for war crimes so that they may face justice in The Hague."
"It is also a privilege, in taking over the European Union Presidency at this time, to be faced with so much hope and, indeed, opportunity."
"Croatia is on the cusp of opening accession negotiations to become a full member of the European Union, only ten years after the end of the war in 1995."
"As the European Council has made clear on a number of occasions, it is Zagreb’s responsibility to remove the one outstanding obstacle to these negotiations: the continuing failure to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague."
"As the European Union Presidency, we stand ready to open negotiations as soon as the Council is satisfied that this obligation has been met."
"Clearly, the easiest way to overcome this obstacle would be to arrest and hand over the fugitive Ante Gotovina."
"It would be a sign of our commitment to all the western Balkan countries and to the Thessaloniki commitments that they are all prospective candidates if we were able to open accession negotiations during our Presidency."
"But the ball lies firmly in Zagreb’s court."
"The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has also made much progress since the outbreak of ethnic conflict in 2001."
"Whilst there is still work to do to implement fully the terms of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, later this year the Commission will publish its opinion on the Republic’s application to join the European Union submitted last year."
"As with any other applicant, full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria is a precondition."
"We look forward to assisting the authorities in Skopje in making further progress on the terms of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, especially in targeting corruption and organised crime and implementing economic and judicial reform."
"The timing of opening negotiations will depend on the authorities’ commitment to tackling these issues in deed as well as in word."
"In Albania, it would appear that the recent elections passed in a generally peaceful manner."
"While the count continues, we urge all political forces to respect the due electoral process and resist premature judgements on the outcome."
"Nevertheless, we hope that a new government can be formed as soon as possible to ensure that Albania can continue her progress towards a stabilisation and association agreement."
"In this respect, the new government will need to tackle the endemic problems of corruption and organised crime and implement judicial reform if it is to fulfil its European aspirations which we fully support."
"One of the greatest challenges we face, of course, is Kosovo."
"The time is fast approaching when we should address the difficult and sensitive issue of Kosovo’s final status."
"Any outcome must work for all of Kosovo’s communities and reinforce regional stability."
"That is why the contact group and the European Union have both ruled out any return to the ante-1999 or any internal partition of Kosovo."
"Neither would serve the interests of the people of Kosovo or the region."
"As for independence, that is clearly one option."
"But I would remind those who advocate independence that they must convince all communities and the world at large that independence can work and that the rights of Kosovo’s minorities as well as those who have yet to return to Kosovo after the violence of 1999 will be fully respected."
"If the people of Kosovo wish to join the European mainstream, they must learn to live together as equals, respecting their differences."
"The current comprehensive review of standards is therefore a critical challenge."
"How positive the review will be depends on progress on the ground."
"Its outcome is not a foregone conclusion."
"I recognise that there has been real progress with standards implementation, but more needs to be done."
"A failure to demonstrate commitment for further work in key areas would not bode well for a positive outcome to the comprehensive review."
"The future is therefore in the hands of the Kosovo authorities in Pristina."
"In the meantime, the European Union has an important role to play in supporting further progress, in particular in the area of economic development."
"Serbia and Montenegro have clearly made great strides in the last six months."
"In April, the European Commission concluded a positive feasibility study recommending that the European Union open negotiations with Serbia and Montenegro on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"The Council of Ministers has accepted this recommendation and invited the Commission to prepare a negotiating mandate."
"This is an important step for Serbia and Montenegro’s progress towards European Union integration."
"By 5 October, which marks the fifth anniversary of the democratic changes in Belgrade, or by the tenth anniversary of the Dayton-Paris Accords in November at the latest, we would like Serbia and Montenegro to have begun negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement."
"But cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal must continue to improve and in this respect Mladic and Karadzic are key, all the more so in light of the anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, which we will commemorate next week."
"I would also like to underline the importance of dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina in the interests of all the people of Kosovo."
"Only through participation in the democratic institutions of government can Kosovar Serbs ensure that their concerns are taken into account."
"We have welcomed Belgrade’s decision to encourage the Kosovar Serbs to participate in the decentralisation working groups and look to Belgrade to carry this through."
"Bosnia and Herzegovina have also recently made important progress towards the opening of negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement with the European Union."
"This prize is within Bosnia and Herzegovina’s grasp but will remain out of reach until it has met the relevant conditions, which include agreeing on police restructuring, reforming public broadcasting and demonstrating full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia."
"We would like Bosnia and Herzegovina to open SAA negotiations under our Presidency by the tenth anniversary of the Dayton-Paris Peace Agreement, but that requires further progress by the Bosnian authorities to meet the feasibility study priorities."
"I have attempted today to summarise the present situation regarding our priorities for the Western Balkan countries over the next six months."
"There are certainly big challenges ahead, but let me end on a note of optimism."
"In the last ten years so much has changed for the better: free and fair elections have been held throughout the region; changes of government via the ballot box are routine; large-scale conflict no longer threatens; countries of the region work together to improve the lives of their citizens."
"The European Union and other international partners are united in working with the region to maintain stability and create prosperity."
"The dark days of the early 1990s seem predominantly to be a distant memory."
"But as we move further down the road to closer integration between the western Balkan countries and the European Union, it is up to the countries concerned to make their cases irrefutable."
"We understand that the European Union’s commitment to the regions has to be honoured and we undertake to do so."
"But during this time of introspection within the European Union and of uncertainty about its future shape and direction, it is all the more important that the countries of the region fulfil their own commitments, not in the interests of the European Union – although that is important – but for the sake of their people who for far too long suffered at the hands of those who claimed to represent their interests but who in fact only fomented hostility and strife."
"Thank you, Minister."
"I should like to congratulate you on winning the contest for hosting the Olympic Games."
"I hope – and I am sure everybody here feels the same – that it will be not only a world event, a British event, but also a European event."
". Mr President, almost 10 years ago to the day, on 11 July 1995, Srebrenica fell."
"No-one should ever forget the horrors that unfolded during the following days and weeks."
"We have a duty to remember so that we will see no other Srebrenicas; so that ethnic hatred and destructive nationalism will be definitively buried in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the Balkans and in the whole of Europe."
"I shall go to the commemoration ceremony in Srebrenica next week to honour the victims and their families."
"I shall go there to express Europe’s support for peace, reconciliation and democratic development and for the European future of the Western Balkans."
"I also expect all the parties to ensure that the ceremony will be a dignified event and will contribute to the reconciliation process."
"Reconciliation is a very painful process after a devastating war like this, after violations of the most fundamental human rights, but it is also a necessary process."
"The European Union, as the greatest peace and reconciliation project, can testify to that and serve as an example of what can be achieved, including in the Balkans."
"Justice is an essential element of reconciliation."
"There can be no reconciliation until war crime suspects are held accountable in a court of law."
"In this respect, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the ICTY, plays a crucial role."
"The countries’ cooperation with the ICTY has steadily improved, which is an encouraging sign, but more remains to be done to achieve full cooperation."
"Only then can this very sad chapter in the region’s history be truly closed."
"The people carrying the main responsibility for the Srebrenica massacre are still at large."
"This is unacceptable."
"Mladić and Karadžić should have no place in the region."
"Their place is in The Hague."
"The European Union has major responsibilities in ensuring peace and stability and enhancing democracy and prosperity on our continent."
"This is what the European Union is all about."
"As Mr Alexander stated regarding the EU’s policy in the Western Balkans on behalf of the Presidency, the inclusion of our Balkan neighbours in the European integration process has been a powerful incentive for enhancing stability, human rights, the rights of minorities and the rule of law in the region."
"This is no small achievement, and we must make this perspective firm and tangible and thus ensure steady progress towards the respect of European values."
"An important and intensive period for the Balkans lies ahead of us."
"The Kosovo standards review is a work in progress and the status talks are likely to start in the autumn."
"The prompt resolution of this issue is very important for the stability and progress of the whole region."
"We are about to open negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia and Montenegro."
"The Commission is ready to contribute to the timeline Mr Alexander presented, i.e. this autumn, to get the negotiations started."
"We also aim to start negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina soon, as long as the country fulfils the remaining criteria."
"When we have fully examined the conduct of last Sunday’s elections in Albania, we can determine the future pace in the negotiations on a Stablisation and Association Agreement with Albania as well."
"The Commission’s opinion on the membership application of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is under preparation."
"We are also looking forward to opening accession negotiations with Croatia, as soon as the one remaining condition is satisfied."
"We are all aware of the serious problems that we are presently facing in the European Union."
"It is only natural that enlargement policy will be a part of the broader debate on the future of Europe."
"I was therefore satisfied that the June European Council very clearly confirmed the Union’s existing commitments on enlargement policy and on the European perspective of the Western Balkans."
"This was very wise."
"Our enlargement policy has helped transform countries in regions that are still very fragile."
"We shall continue to help them to become stable, democratic and prosperous societies able to join the Union."
"The building of a better future for the Western Balkans is indeed the best way to commemorate the victims of Srebrenica."
"It serves the cause of peace, stability and prosperity in Europe, and our own vital interests."
"I am looking forward to continuing to work closely with European Parliament and its relevant committees to this end."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after 1945, the promise was made that there would be no more mass murder, Srebrenica is a byword for its having been broken. Ten years on from Srebrenica, the Western governments have to ask themselves why they did not intervene in good time to prevent expulsions, murder and war."
"At the beginning of the 1990s, they looked the other way and let Milošević, Karadžić and Mladić have a free hand to expel people from their homes, to rape them and, eventually to put them to a gruesome death, which is what happened at Srebrenica, where, in a cowardly manner, Serbian criminals slaughtered thousands of Muslims before the eyes of UN troops acting under an inadequate mandate."
"As we commemorate this massacre today, we call on everyone to endeavour to get Karadžić and Mladić, who bear responsibility for it and are now on the run like the cowards they are, handed over to the Tribunal."
"There is no hope of reconciliation in Bosnia and Herzegovina if they are not."
"Good though it is that high-ranking Serb politicians will be attending the commemorations at Srebrenica, they should also prevent certain Serbian politicians from naming in the same breath the Serb victims of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the victims of Srebrenica, as if they were talking about one and the same thing."
"The failure of the Serbian parliament and of the parliament of Republika Srpska to condemn these massacres testifies to their lack of either maturity or penitence."
"How are the Serbs to show either if those who represent them do not first give a good example?"
"Today is an opportunity to remind the Serbs in particular that reconciliation is possible only when one acknowledges one’s own guilt, and, as a German, I know what I am talking about."
"It took a relatively short time after the war for our relations with the rest of the world to be restored, and that was because we admitted our responsibility for the heinous crimes committed in Germany’s name."
"By no means are all Serbs guilty today, any more than all Germans were guilty then, and so those holding political power or religious authority, and the media, should do everything in their power to make reconciliation possible."
"At the same time, though, the EU must neither stint in its efforts nor shirk its responsibility in helping the countries in the region to put their tragic past behind them and set their sights on a better future."
"The young people in the region have gained the right not to be left high and dry by us, but it is their politicians, their parents and grandparents upon whom the obligation rests of preparing for the day when they will be able to name the events at Srebrenica as the crimes they were and to reach out the hand of reconciliation."
". Mr President, it is with embarrassment, indeed with shame, that we commemorate the victims of the massacre at Srebrenica."
"Many of those who carried it out have not yet been arrested, but we too, as representatives of the people of Europe, cannot fail to be aware of our share in the blame for the tragic events in the Balkans, and to face up to the consequences, and it is not only the victims and their families who have the right to hear us acknowledge our guilt and express our regret."
"It is also for the sake of Europe’s future, for the sake of the region’s future, for the sake of Serbia’s future, that there must be an acknowledgement of one’s own guilt, an acknowledgement without which forgiveness and reconciliation will be impossible."
"Acknowledgement and sorrow are needed, not in order to humiliate Serbia, in order that the Serbs as a whole might be condemned, and not in order to excuse the misdeeds and crimes of other peoples, but we do expect them."
"We must be clear in our minds about the fact that contemplation of the past helps to build a better future."
"It is now for Europe to give this region a clear vision of what the future can be like."
"History shows us how the countries of the Balkans were for too long at the mercy of the interests and schemes of the great European powers, as well as of Turkey, which you may or may not, depending on your point of view, regard as having been one of them."
"What I say now I say not only as rapporteur for Croatia, but also as one who is committed to the region as a whole: we have to give them a chance to put their own house in order, to show that they have learned their lessons from history, that they take human rights – and the rights of minorities in particular – seriously."
"As Mr Alexander and Commissioner Rehn have described to the House the various processes by which it is intended that these countries should be brought closer to the European Union, I would like to make it abundantly clear that the object must be to give them the chance to accede to it as Member States."
"It may well be the case that other sentiments prevail today, and people fight shy of enlargement, but we, in Europe, must be clear in our own minds about the need to prepare ourselves for an enlargement along these lines."
"Nor must we lose sight of the fact that these countries are themselves under an obligation to do their homework and do their bit in making their accession possible."
"Many of their young people, though, look to Europe as their ideal, and it is for their sake that, as Mrs Pack has just said, we must hold out to them the prospect of one day, when the time is ripe and they have overcome their own problems, being in a position to become Member States of the European Union."
"Whatever our criticisms of the way in which the European Union is developing, we have to concede that, for many people in the Balkans, the great hope is that they will one day belong to the European Union and be part of one single Europe, and we must give them the chance to do that."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, next Monday, it will be ten years ago since Srebrenica was captured by Bosnian Serb troops under the UN troops’ noses, that the slaughter of more than 80 000 Muslim men and boys began, that thousands of women, children and elderly were deported and hundreds of women were raped."
"Immense misery was inflicted and still persists to this day, while those responsible are still at large, because not all victims have been recovered, many of the deportees were not allowed to return home and, above all, because the misery inflicted is not recognised by many Serbs."
"This was only recently evident when the Serb parliament rejected a resolution in which the slaughter in Srebrenica was acknowledged and condemned."
"From our own experience, we know that post-war reconciliation is possible only when those who were formerly on opposite sides manage to agree on the history of the events, to ask for forgiveness for the misery inflicted and to bring to justice those responsible for the genocide and crimes against humanity."
"The tragedy has also painfully exposed the shortcomings of the EU’s foreign and security policy at that time, as well as those of UN peacemaking and peacekeeping policy."
"Some of these have since been rectified, but unity of foreign and security policy is still not guaranteed, mainly because of a less than total willingness on the part of the EU governments."
"The European Union and its Member States did manage, though, to stabilise and improve the situation in the Western Balkans both under their own steam and with NATO backing."
"These efforts must be continued and the prospect of accession to the European Union must be kept open."
"That will only be possible, though, when all authorities in the region fully cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and bring those responsible before this tribunal."
"Mr President, some people of our generation find it difficult to talk about Srebrenica, because it is true that we have always asked ourselves what we would have done when, for example, the fascists came to power in Germany."
"For a long time, we in Europe have been onlookers: the British, by tradition, tended to be pro-Serb, as did the French; the Germans were for Croatia and the Bosniaks had nobody."
"For years, we left the Bosniaks alone."
"It was following the tragedy in Srebrenica that we understood the necessity for a European position, in other words a position that could not be either British, German or French, but that had to be a common position."
"Today, when we discuss the Srebrenica massacre, we must question the behaviour of Europeans, question the behaviour not of the Dutch soldiers who were in Srebrenica but of the UN itself, because, while the UN’s mandate in Srebrenica authorised the 50 000 soldiers posted to Bosnia to do everything, to control the traffic and so on, it did not authorise them to protect the population."
"As Europeans, we must examine that, and consider what we did."
"Mrs Pack was right to bring up the role of governments: her government, at the time headed by Mr Kohl, closed its eyes just like the socialist government in France."
"That was also the reality of the time."
"Today, the European Union provides political stability."
"The Dayton Agreements provided stability, but nobody here is talking about the problems posed by the Dayton Agreements."
"Those agreements, which were necessary at the time, contain an ethnic definition of the region, an ethnic definition that is included in the Bosnian constitution."
"The tragedy in Srebrenica cannot be overcome unless we address the problem of the Dayton Agreements, unless we address the problem of the ethnic definition of the region, because it is that ethnic definition that is now preventing not only the Serbs but also the Croats and Bosniaks from admitting their crimes."
"That is why we are calling on you, Mr President, Mr Alexander and the Commission, to launch a European initiative to re-open the debate on the Dayton Agreements."
"Ten years on, we need to re-examine what was decided."
"The Bosnian constitution is an ethnic constitution that will not allow Bosnia to join the European Union."
"In conclusion, if we do not have the courage to challenge the Dayton Agreements, we will never learn the lessons of Srebrenica."
". Mr President, ten years ago, the presence of the Dutch armed forces gave the people of Srebrenica a false sense of security."
"This place that was proclaimed a safe haven was an indefensible island in the middle of the much bigger Serbian Republic, which was, and still is, considered a safe haven by another section of the population."
"By completely misjudging the situation, action was not taken in time to prevent the inevitable surrender from culminating in retaliation and even mass murder."
"My group takes the view that the ultimate outcome would not have been much different had there been an EU centralised common foreign policy or a mandate that authorised Dutchbat to use more force and ensured support in the form of aerial bombardments."
"If you want to guarantee the peaceful coexistence of the three nations in Bosnia, you have to look for solutions that are backed by all parties and not just by one or two that enjoy our favour."
"Only a federative model that recognises diversity, along the lines of Belgium and Switzerland, can do justice to everyone."
"We have to take as our starting point the reality that the North and East are very much oriented towards Serbia, and the South West towards Croatia, and that it is in those areas that most of the people live."
"That is why Bosnia and Herzegovina need open borders with the neighbouring countries."
"Any attempt to create a centralised, united state can only result in a permanent battle for power between the different sections of the population."
"No one group should be able to dominate another; that is the lesson we should have learned from Srebrenica and from the chaotic implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement."
"Mr President, today’s debate on the future of the Balkans is being held on the 10th anniversary of the crime which was committed in Srebrenica, and which was the worst in Europe since the end of the Second World War."
"There can be absolutely no doubt that part of the reason for the wars and massacres in the Balkans was the lack of action by the European Union and NATO in this region."
"The EU institutions acted like Pontius Pilate, who simply washed his hands of responsibility."
"I am delighted that things are changing in this respect, and that in 18 months’ time Bulgaria and Romania will join the EU."
"It is also to be welcomed that EU military and political forces are working to stabilise the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and indeed I had an opportunity to see this for myself in April of this year."
"Yesterday I returned from an observation mission to the parliamentary elections in Albania, and it has to be said that these elections were a step in the right direction."
"They were more democratic than previous elections in the country, and we should acknowledge this progress."
"Question marks remain, of course, and there are still a great many questions left unanswered."
"Among other things, they relate to the future of ‘Solania’, the state named after Mr Solana, and that of Serbia and Montenegro, given that Montenegro wishes to be an independent state."
"One thing is certain, however, namely that the EU still holds an attraction for these countries, despite the crisis in which it finds itself."
"It has gone out of fashion to talk about EU enlargement, but it should be stated quite clearly that EU accession for a number of Balkan states would be a very good idea."
"This is the only means whereby economic and political stability can be achieved in this region, and such stability will benefit the EU in the future."
"I should like to conclude by saying that putting fires out in the Balkans costs more than preventing them in the first place."
"– Mr President, I agree absolutely with my honourable friend, Mrs Doris Ρack, that Srebrenica should be a permanent living memory."
"The tragedy, which claimed thousands of lives, marks and imposes the end of a chapter and the final move from the tragic past in the area to a new era of peace, security and prosperity."
"It marks and imposes the overcoming of ethnic standards and historical and cultural bondage through dialogue and assent."
"The European Union failed to act as a reliable power for the production and export of security to its neighbours."
"If the reason was the immaturity of the European political system, then the message is the need to arm the European Union with the qualities of a single and genuine political identity."
"The Western Balkans continue to lag well behind in terms of economic development and regional integration."
"No one doubts the efforts of the European Union."
"However, the approach of each Balkan country separately, on its own, has proven to be inadequate."
"In my opinion, an advanced and cohesive strategic plan is needed for the area, a single contractual framework for a privileged partnership between the ΕU and the Western Balkans."
"I am talking, Commissioner, about a plan which will articulate the development priorities of each country in a single regional entity."
"The programmes under which the European Union intervenes must be of a cross-border, cross-regional character."
"This will help regional economic integration and the construction of a climate of political collectiveness, cooperation and trust."
"The immediate challenge for relations between the European Union and the Western Balkans can be reduced to the following triptych: articulated political dialogue, cross-border infrastructure networks and the opening of the markets."
"I wish the British Presidency good luck."
"Mr President, our primary concern today is, of course, to remember the most horrifying event from recent European history, namely the murder of thousands of men from the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1995."
"The story of Srebrenica has had an enormous impact in Europe and the rest of the world, but particularly in my country, the Netherlands, for it was Dutch wearers of the UN’s blue helmets who, at that time, appeared incapable of offering citizens, inhabitants and refugees the protection they needed."
"Ten years on, this debacle is still a subject for debate in the Netherlands."
"The sense of horror and sympathy for the victims of this mass killing and their surviving relatives is great."
"Our thoughts are mainly with those who cannot live with the fact that those responsible for this crime, the then Bosnian President Karadžic and General Mladic, are still at large."
"Remembering should, though, go beyond sympathy with the victims."
"We must learn from the lessons and try to move on."
"First of all, to the countries of the Balkans, whom we must support if they are to be able to come to terms with the experiences of the wars they have lived through, we make our pledge: ‘Never again’."
"While remembering the past, though, we must above all look to the future."
"The support given by the EU needs to be within a clear framework, with an important role played by the prospect of integration into the EU, which the Council has held out."
"Support from the EU will help bring about peaceful, stable and prosperous societies."
"Let there be no doubt, though, that the responsibility for the future rests, in the first place, on the countries of the Balkans themselves."
"There is now, fortunately, peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but they have not fully come to terms with the past, and that is forming an obstacle to the functioning of the state and society, and so important decisions on such matters as the return of refugees and the arrest of those suspected of war crimes are not being taken."
"I believe that coming to terms with the past is as important as working towards the future."
"A second lesson is broader, and that is the lesson that has been hotly debated in the Netherlands."
"‘Never again, not in Europe, but, above all, not anywhere else in the world’ means that vigilance is called for to prevent dormant conflicts from escalating into bloody and hopeless situations."
"We must be more alert and act more rapidly, and where necessary, take a tougher line, when what happened at Srebrenica threatens to repeat itself, in order to prevent European troops from ever finding again themselves in the same situation as Dutchbat ten years ago."
"Mr President, representatives of the Council and the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in the 59 seconds available to me I would simply like to point out a small detail."
"There is something that you should be ashamed of, although you do not realise it."
"Yesterday evening in this Parliament a commemoration was held and next week ceremonies are planned in Srebrenica."
"Among the many embarrassments that have been got rid of there is one in particular, called Emma Bonino."
"Emma Bonino has been got rid of: she does not exist any more, she is not invited."
"I understand the reason behind this, because Emma Bonino, when she was in Srebrenica in her role as European Commissioner, tried desperately to warn the Dutch Government, which did not listen to her, and we are well aware of the consequences."
"Yes, Emma Bonino was there, as Reuters can bear witness."
"All the recordings have been found."
"At the time of the tragedy Emma Bonino got through twice to Radio Radicale, and also to the BBC, to say that thousands of people were missing."
"Mr Morillon, we will be able to speak again about the issue of responsibility, and of all the initiatives, on another occasion."
"Mr President, thank you, my time is up.We shall see whether it will be possible to commemorate Srebrenica in another way, by giving it, at the least, the tribute of truth and an acknowledgement of the cowardice of Europe and the UN."
"Mr President, in this debate and at this time, a great deal of attention is being paid to the past, and rightly so."
"How was it possible for what happened in Srebrenica to occur and what are the lessons we should draw from it?"
"Srebrenica not only has a painful past, it also has a painful present."
"There are people from Srebrenica who are languishing in refugee camps, still unable to return home."
"Children are given a totally one-sided view of the events ten years ago, as a result of which a necessary conciliation is not forthcoming."
"The identification of victims is desperately needed if those left behind are to begin to accept their loved ones’ terrible fate, but because identification is expensive, it takes far too long."
"What we now need is not just to consider what happened ten years ago, but also Srebrenica today, which will involve understanding it and, where necessary, providing funds to rescue it."
"Fortunately, a second Srebrenica is not likely to happen in the Balkans today, but the wounds inflicted across the whole region then can be healed structurally only if the countries of the Balkans know themselves to be welcome in Europe."
"I am therefore completely behind the Commission’s position that stated that the countries of the Balkans still have the prospect of membership."
"The Balkans are in Europe. So is Srebrenica."
"Let us never forget that lesson."
"– Peace will not be achieved in the Balkans until we stop applying different standards to the different communities."
"Anyone who thinks that the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia applies the same standards to everyone is very much mistaken."
"It is quite intolerable that the pilot of the plane that fired two missiles at a train travelling over a bridge, the second one of which hit a pillar and destroyed both the bridge and the train, has not yet been brought before the Tribunal."
"There is no point pretending that you are unaware of these things, ladies and gentlemen."
"How many Albanians or foreign Muslim mercenaries have been sentenced so far?"
"Some of these people are now ruling over Kosovo, and they have your backing."
"Can you sleep soundly at night, ladies and gentlemen?"
"Are you quite happy to discuss such matters calmly in this Chamber?"
"As if that were not enough, you even want to endorse their split from Serbia."
"You should be ashamed of yourselves."
"Paragraph 4 of the motion for a resolution quite rightly says that all those guilty of war crimes must be caught and brought before the Tribunal, and I believe that you are quite serious about this."
"If that is the case, then you should monitor the work done by the Tribunal."
"If you have even a shred of honour, then we should try to ensure that this issue appears on the agenda again in the near future."
"If you believe that those in power are and will continue to be exempt from punishment, then you should say so quite clearly."
"The public in the EU and in the rest of the world will doubtless react in such a way that makes it quite clear what they think about such hypocrisy."
"The amputated heads and maimed bodies of the victims should not be forgotten, and both friends and enemies should be subject to the same justice."
"Hundreds of thousands of refugees are still waiting to return home, for example to Slavonia and the border regions between Croatia and Bosnia."
"Today the Czech people are commemorating the 490th anniversary of the burning at the stake of Jan Hus by the Catholic church."
"He has not yet been rehabilitated."
"Mr President, we could talk for many an hour about the errors of the past, and, having done so in the places where they were made and also, in the past, in this House, I would rather concentrate on the errors of the present time."
"Let me start with the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council to the effect that negotiations with Croatia, a country crucial to the stability of the region as a whole, could begin only as and when Mr Gotovina is extradited."
"It is very interesting that, in saying that, you put yourself at odds with the Luxembourg Presidency, and are acting as if the United Kingdom were to be allowed to assume the Presidency of the Council only on condition that the Loch Ness Monster were caught first."
"Nobody in this House has any idea where Mr Gotovina is."
"If you have any knowledge of his whereabouts, then I would ask you to inform both this House and the Croatian Government."
"We should be treating Croatia in the same way that you – wrongly – want to treat Turkey, which is to say that we should start negotiating with it, and it is only if full cooperation turns out to be lacking – and we have a committee to monitor whether that is the case – that we should abandon or suspend them."
"The fact is, though, that Croatia is a Central European democracy with a stabilising influence on the whole region, and so a start should be made on the negotiations."
"On Bosnia, to which I turn secondly, Mr Cohn-Bendit is absolutely right to say that the Dayton Agreement has failed."
"What is needed is a Bosnia-Herzegovina made up of three people with equal rights and, above all, of free citizens."
"Failing that, the structure will be a source of new dangers and grave conflicts."
"Thirdly, there is Kosovo, which I visited only a few days ago, and where radical elements will gain in strength if we carry on letting President Rugova miss the mark with his policy of seeking peace."
"In view of the bombings a few days ago, I appeal to the Council to tarry no longer and to move towards the inevitable, that being an independent Kosovo – subject to stringent conditions, planned for long-term existence, and monitored by the international community."
"The fourth point I want to make has to do with minorities, about which we talk endlessly."
"In Kosovo’s Assembly, minorities are guaranteed representation."
"In Serbia’s parliament, a new electoral law, introduced a few years ago, makes it impossible for any representative of a minority to have a seat."
"What we need is uniform standards across the board, without which we will not be able to arrive at a credible policy."
"One of the major reasons and perhaps the key reason for the tragic war in the former Yugoslavia was the fact that the international community was neither consistent nor even-handed in its approach to solving the key question, that is, the right of people to self-determination."
"At the moment there is peace in the region, but we are still some distance from the kind of progress that would bring about long-term prosperity."
"It is right and proper that with this report and the action of the Commissioner we are sending a message to the region that it is welcome in the European Union, and it is also right that we are placing emphasis on economic progress, although it is as yet insufficient."
"The European Union faces a task that in a certain way it faced before the tragic war took place, namely to have a consistent and even-handed view of the basic questions of status relating to the peoples and states in the region."
"The Dayton Agreement cannot secure progress in Bosnia and Hercegovina because what that country needs is a modern constitution."
"We must find a solution to the question of the independence of Kosovo and the rights of Serbs and Montenegrins to self-determination."
"We cannot accept that the Macedonians do not merit the name they have given themselves."
"These are all fundamental questions of status."
"I would like to support the Commissioner in that the European Commission should be more active in this policy than it has been hitherto."
"Mr President, the resolution we shall vote on tomorrow is important, not only because it comes at a time when, ten years after the massacre, there are still people who do not believe that it happened, but also because neither the Serbian nor the Bosnian-Herzegovinan Parliament has been able to agree upon such a resolution."
"The Serbian Members of the Bosnian Parliament could not accept either the wording of the resolution or the compromise proposals."
"As recently as today, someone has placed an explosive charge by the monument erected in Srebrenica in memory of all the victims."
"As someone born in Bosnia who experienced the war we are talking about today, I feel a responsibility to convey to you at least a few of the many feelings we were forced each day to deal with during the war."
"The world was shocked by the video images shown recently in The Hague of young men being executed."
"We lived those images."
"I therefore want to describe to you what it is like to be on the other side."
"I am now going to read out part of an accused’s statement to the Hague Tribunal, written down by a journalist and writer who followed the proceedings."
"‘In the corner of his eye, the accused saw a young boy get off the bus."
"The boy may have been fifteen years old or perhaps younger."
"He looked at the soldiers and then at the rows of dead bodies in the field."
"His eyes widened as if he could scarcely believe what he was witnessing."
"When the prisoners fell to their knees, just before the soldiers were ordered to shoot, the accused heard the boy’s voice: ‘Mummy’, he whispered;"
"That day, the accused heard people pleading for their lives and grown men crying."
"He heard them promise the soldiers money, cars and even houses."
"That boy, however, called for his mum, as children do when they have had a horrible dream.’"
"If we are to have any chance at all of moving on after the Balkan wars, we must primarily ensure that everyone who is guilty of crimes is brought to justice: not only those who are accused before the Hague Tribunal but also those who are still free and who should be prosecuted before the national courts as soon as possible."
"We owe that not only to those who were murdered but also to those who survived."
"– Mr President, in a few days' time, it will be ten years since the greatest barbarity to shake Europe since the end of the Second World War. I refer to Srebrenica."
"This is one of the blackest pages in the history of European and European civilisation."
"Today we have an obligation to strengthen the memory of history, we have an obligation to honour the innocent victims of the ethnic violence in Yugoslavia, the Muslims, Serbs and Croats, without selective sensibilities and without any philosophy when it comes to bloodshed."
"Ten years later, Bosnia is still deeply divided."
"Ten years later, this country has five presidents and two prime ministers and is being kept alive artificially."
"The international community and the European Union must take initiatives to review the Dayton agreement in order to bring about a functional, federal, democratic and multi-ethnic state."
"The European Union has a political and strategic responsibility to defend and strengthen the European prospects and the integration of the countries of the Balkans into the European institutions."
"We need to firmly oppose those who contest enlargement today with a strategy of political and social democratisation, peace, security and stability through the progress of the Balkans towards Europe."
"If we deny the peoples in the name of political expediency, we shall have contributed to the prevalence of the most extreme ethnic forces."
"Europe made a great many mistakes in the 1990s."
"It must not repeat them."
". Mr President, thank you for your gracious words of congratulation on London’s Olympic bid."
"I would have been delighted if any European city had been successful in Singapore today, but I am particularly delighted that London has secured this."
"I hope that the 2012 Games will be a great European success."
"I would like to thank all the Members of the European Parliament and the European Commission for their contributions to what has proved to be an insightful and wise debate this afternoon."
"It is clear that there is a real commitment by all of you to support the European aspirations of the Western Balkan countries."
"We certainly aim during our Presidency to work towards bringing the region within the European family of nations and will be working assiduously to achieve that."
"We are conscious of the many challenges ahead, but we are committed to working together to overcome them."
"I shall respond to some of the main points that have been raised by Members on both past and future issues."
"Mrs Pack spoke powerfully on the need for reconciliation."
"I recognise the need for a wider recognition of responsibility and this was a subject that I discussed only last week with the Reis-ul-Ulema, the Grand Mufti of Bosnia, who has been leading efforts to achieve exactly this reconciliation within and between communities in the regions."
"Mr Swoboda rightly recognised the need for countries to have opportunities to right past wrongs."
"That is certainly true but, as Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck reflected, it is necessary for all the countries in the region to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit spoke of the Dayton Accords and urged the international community to now take the initiative."
"Whilst listening with care to the points that he made, I would respectfully remind him that only the three constituent communities of Bosnia can make changes to the constitution."
"Mr Czarnecki questioned the European Union’s policy towards Serbia and Montenegro."
"The Serbia-Montenegro state union is a loose federal arrangement, created in 2003 largely through the initiative of Javier Solana."
"Under the terms of the state union Constitutional Charter, either republic can hold a referendum on withdrawal after February 2006."
"It is looking increasingly likely that Montenegro will seek to dissolve the union in 2006."
"The European Union continues to support the state union as the best means of promoting stability and ensuring faster progress towards Euro-Atlantic integration."
"However, the European Union recognises the terms of the Constitutional Charter, which allows for a referendum to be held after three years and emphasises the need for any dissolution to be constitutional, consensual, negotiated and transparent."
"Mr Papastamkos spoke of the need for a clear regional approach, so let me say a further word about the European Union’s priorities for the Western Balkans during the United Kingdom’s Presidency."
"During the next six months, a number of key issues will come to a head."
"The Commission will publish its opinion on Macedonia, Lord Ashdown’s mandate in Bosnia will come to an end and a positive assessment of standards implementation in Kosovo could lead to a process to determine Kosovo’s final status, a process in which the European Union will have a key role to play."
"Across the range of Western Balkan issues, the Presidency will help the region make progress towards European standards and values."
"The Presidency will continue to drive forward the European Union’s Stabilisation and Association process, designed to build stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans and guide these countries towards eventual European Union membership."
"The progress of each country within the stabilisation and association process will be judged against established political criteria."
"Full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal, as I have already mentioned, remains a key political requirement."
"Mr Posselt raised the issue of Croatia."
"As a proud Scotsman, I do not want to disabuse him of his apparent certainty that the Loch Ness monster exists, or to dissuade him from the opportunity of visiting Scotland to continue the search, but let me make a deadly serious point to him."
"The European Union has made it clear that it stands ready to open accession negotiations as soon as there is full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia."
"We hope this will happen during the UK Presidency, but it is ultimately up to Croatia to take the necessary steps to ensure full cooperation."
"The easiest way for Croatia to address doubts about Croatia’s commitment to ICTY is to cooperate in locating and detaining Ante Gotovina."
"Mr Beglitis raised the question of how European Union help to Bosnia-Herzegovina in implementing the reforms necessary for European Union integration can be taken forward."
"The European Union is providing a range of instruments to help the authorities carry out the necessary reforms."
"The European Union Police Mission aims to help the Bosnian police force reach European standards."
"It focuses on police reform through the monitoring and mentoring of middle-ranking to senior officers in the police force."
"The EU CARDS Programme also supports reforms for European Union integration."
"The European Union Special Representative and High Representative, Lord Paddy Ashdown, plays a coordinating role between the different European Union presences and has played a leading role in encouraging the Bosnian authorities to take the reform agenda forward."
"I pay tribute to his work today."
"His Mission Implementation Plan closely reflects the 16 priority areas identified in the European Union feasibility study published in November 2003."
"In addition to the terrible anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, which has been mentioned by so many speakers today and which we will commemorate next week, this year will also mark the tenth anniversary of the Dayton Accords, as was also mentioned in passing by at least a couple of speakers, and the end to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"I believe that the next six months therefore offer an historic opportunity for these countries to demonstrate their wholehearted commitment to European values, to tolerance and the rule of law, to good neighbourly relations and to the difficult but very serious process of reconciliation, which a number of speakers have talked about today."
"None of this will be easy."
"Each country will face particular and different challenges, but I encourage them to work jointly and to encourage each other on this path."
"In this respect, I echo the sentiments expressed by Commissioner Rehn."
"I cannot stress too highly the importance of full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia."
"Handing over the last remaining indictees for trial in The Hague, notably Karadzic, Mladic and Gotovina, is not just an obscure European Union condition, but is required under several United Nations Security Council resolutions."
"This will not only transform the nature of these countries’ relations with the European Union but will also serve to transform their societies and contribute to the long-term process of rehabilitation that has been spoken about so convincingly today."
"In that respect the joint statement by the presidents of the Dayton signatories issued following the recent meeting of the Mount Igman initiative in Belgrade was a welcome step."
"It will contribute to the normalisation of relations between those three countries."
"It represents an excellent basis for further work and we look forward to the implementation of the important commitments it contains."
"The forthcoming tenth anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre is a vivid reminder of how far the Balkans have come, but also of how much remains to be done."
"Thankfully armed conflict is and must remain a thing of the past although, as Mrs Ibrisagic reminded us, recent discoveries of explosives have shown that there are still those minded to advance their cause by violence."
"The European Union has recognised the region’s aspirations to join the European family once conditions have been met, but corruption and organised crime are still far too prevalent and economic growth is lacklustre."
"But whilst we stand ready to help, the answer to these challenges lies not in Brussels, The Hague, London or, with the greatest of respect, Strasbourg."
"It lies within the region and within the people whose energy and talents have outlived the years of conflict and it depends on their willingness to demand that their decency, hope and integrity are fully reflected."
". Mr President, after President Chirac’s ill-informed views on British and Finnish cuisine, I feel free to congratulate London as the European city for the venue of the 2012 Olympic Games. ."
"I thank the honourable Members for a dignified and substantive debate that fully respects our duty to remember and draw conclusions for the present and the future."
"There was a wide convergence of views on a number of issues."
"First of all, on the country’s need to cooperate fully with the Hague Tribunal."
"Clearly there is no lasting peace without historical truth and justice."
"We have to learn from what happened so that history does not repeat itself."
"I also note wide support for the continuation of our prudently managed accession process, combining the historic mission of European integration for peace, democracy and progress with consideration for our citizens’ legitimate concerns about the absorption capacity of the Union."
"We therefore have to practice strict conditionality in our enlargement policy."
"The future of the Western Balkans is clearly in the European Union."
"It is fair to say that the European perspective is the glue that keeps the Western Balkans on a peaceful and stable track."
"So is the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the European Union."
"The Dayton Accord managed to put an end to the war, but I agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit that it is certainly not an ideal constitution on which to build a properly functioning, multi-ethnic modern state."
"Therefore it is important that Bosnia and Herzegovina can itself reflect on the constitutional changes that can serve the country and its people better than the current construct."
"It is up to the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and their representatives to play a key role in this exercise."
