"There are points that concern only the geographical indications report that I want to mention."
"These are the use of ingredients in processed products and the origin of raw materials."
"I confirm that your proposals concerning the use of protected names in relation to ingredients for processed products meet some of the Commission’s concerns."
"However, the general rules on labelling already cover cases of misleading information."
"Further restrictions on the use of registered names for processed products would mean a major policy change that deserves to be adequately and thoroughly assessed."
"I took note of various amendments concerning the labelling of origin or other conditions applicable to raw materials."
"The Commission shares Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf’s objective that people should not be misled in this respect."
"However, we have to be very prudent."
"Any policy change in this field may affect rights already granted to users of certain designations."
"Finally, I shall make a few points on the TSG report."
"The current regulation on traditional specialities guaranteed has no definition for the term ‘traditional’."
"We propose to introduce the obligation to prove usage for a time period of at least 25 years."
"We believe that this is a good compromise."
"As a result, the Commission can in principle accept the following amendments in the report on geographical indications: Amendments 1, 10, 11, 15, 25, 29 and 31."
"Of the last-minute amendments tabled for this part-session, the Commission can in principle accept Amendments 41, 43, 49 and 54."
"In the report on traditional specialities, it can accept Amendments 6, 10, 13 and 16."
"The Commission cannot accept the other amendments to these reports."
"– The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"– The next item is the debate on the oral question by Mr Gargani to the Commission on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs on legal professions and general interest in the functioning of legal systems (O-0003/2006 – B6-0005/2006)."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am actually here to represent my colleague Mr Gargani, who, as Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, is the real draftsman of this question."
"Nevertheless, it is an honour for me to do so."
"Before I give detailed reasons for this question, I should like to say a few words about the background."
"The history of this issue, namely that of liberal professions, in particular legal professions – to whom this question relates – goes back several years."
"Parliament dealt with this issue in the previous parliamentary term on the basis of two questions for oral answer in the corresponding resolutions, particularly in the light of the activities of the Internal Market and Services Directorate General under Mario Monti, the former Commissioner for competition, and also in view of the study by the Vienna Institute for Advanced Studies that sparked off this whole debate."
"I do not wish to conceal the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs actually always held a broad conviction – even across the political spectrum – that this Vienna study took a very biased approach, one biased towards economic aspects, and did not take sufficient account of the specific role of the liberal professions, particularly the legal professions, in administering justice."
"The Committee also feared – and this was borne out to some extent by the documents – that the Commission had not always drawn the correct conclusions from the documents of the Vienna study and, furthermore, was consciously conducting a policy that we doubted was the right course in the case of some particular issues."
"After all, liberal professions, with their particular importance, quite simply cannot be compared with the supermarket round the corner in terms of competition policy and competition law."
"Their origins are different, their importance to the functioning of society is different."
"Presenting another question for oral answer today, following the latest Commission interim report presented by Commissioner Kroes – an accompanying resolution will follow in the coming week – practically continues the tradition from the previous parliamentary term."
"I should like to make it crystal clear at this juncture that we, too, are of course well aware that antiquated customs should be dispensed with."
"We are no longer living in the Middle Ages, and the guild system is a thing of the past."
"Nonetheless, particular account must of course be taken of the distinguishing features of the liberal professions: in particular the legal professions, which are what interests the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"These features form part of the judicial system, and have to function."
"If the system does not function, the public suffers, being afforded insufficient legal protection, and this means that an intrinsic part of democracy, namely the rule of law, is also called into question."
"That is why the rules for the liberal professions have to be scrutinised very carefully and in great detail, and why we have to consider carefully what is needed in order to afford legal protection and access to justice for all citizens that is as effective and safe as possible, including in practice. Naturally, this should be done with particular regard to the case law of the European Court of Justice."
"I should now like to turn to a specific problem which has, of course, also been addressed in conjunction with this question, and which was one of the reasons that the Committee on Legal Affairs wanted a further debate on this issue today in plenary."
"That problem is the specific role of tariffs in the liberal legal professions, since, in many EU Member States, these have a special nature and importance, especially in connection with the rules for reimbursement of legal expenses, and also in situations in which companies providing legal-expenses insurance wish to make reimbursements themselves on behalf of their clients."
"Such things are virtually impossible without tariffs, and are also deeply rooted in the legal traditions of many Member States. As such, they should not be called into question without good cause, because they also represent a fundamental aspect of consumer protection."
"This should be made quite clear at this juncture."
"The case law of the European Court of Justice has taken great care when dealing with such issues in the past."
"Just recently – a few weeks ago – we saw a specific instance in which the Advocate General, too, attempted to show due care in such issues."
"It is very important to us that the Commission cease dealing with this fundamental issue – which is extremely important to the functioning of the legal professions in many Member States – in this way, as the Commission’s documents would suggest."
"The Commission cannot treat the liberal professions in the same way as it does supermarkets."
"These professions have a special importance and role."
"Some EU Member States have now abolished tariffs and, interestingly, this has meant an increase in prices for lawyers and consumers, for example – in some cases they are considerably higher, on average, than those in Member States who still have such a system. Particularly with regard to the price trend, this system has ensured that legal protection for consumers continues to be accessible and financially sustainable."
"We would now welcome a reply to our oral question from Commissioner Kroes, who has already had the opportunity to discuss this issue with us in committee, on behalf of the Commission."
"We shall then have the opportunity to respond to it, both in the context of the debate and, in the coming week, in the context of the resolution."
". Mr President, the Commission thanks the Committee on Legal Affairs for its question and Mr Lehne for doing a great job here this evening."
"He presented his views quite clearly."
"The Commission recognises the special role of the legal sector in the good administration of justice and in promoting access to justice – by the way, in response to the example cited by Mr Lehne, the Commission also recognises that supermarkets are very important and very honourable members of our community – we are certainly not challenging this."
"But we are saying that we need to look afresh at the current regulation of the sector to see what can be modernised to promote new types of services and new ways of doing things."
"That is in the interests of the users of these key services."
"So we are proposing that Member States use a proportionality test to see how far current regulations are all really serving the public interest."
"This approach fully respects the subsidiarity principle."
"It allows for national circumstances, and the special characteristics of the legal sector, to be taken fully into account."
"The Commission certainly agrees with the need for some regulation."
"I repeat: our initiative is about better regulation, not deregulation."
"We also recognise that it is the Member States’ right to determine the balance between state rules and self-regulation by professional bodies."
"On the question of the right of Member States to fix tariffs, I would underline the position of the Commission in its report of February 2004."
"In our view the judgment suggests that state measures delegating regulatory powers to professional bodies in order to fix tariffs can be challenged under the competition rules – for example, Articles 3(1)(g), 10(2) and 81 EC – if the state does not have the final word and exercise effective control of the implementation of these tariffs."
"We are expecting further clarification on this when the Court delivers its preliminary ruling in the case (case C-202/04)."
"Finally, there are the internal market rules."
"These are at issue in another case pending before the European Court of Justice, the case (case C-04/04), again concerning the Member States’ responsibility for price fixing."
"The Commission considers that minimum prices for lawyers’ services are a restriction on the freedom to provide services because they neutralise the competitive advantage of service providers from other Member States."
"Moreover, we see no justification for minimum prices under the proportionality test, since they do not per se guarantee quality, access to justice, or good ethical conduct."
". Mr President, the question from the Committee on Legal Affairs is appropriate since relations between lawyers and notaries, and the legal professions in general — as Mr Lehne has said — and their clients must be given special consideration."
"The European Commission must not deal with these cases as if they were a question of a mere business relationship between client and service provider."
"The relationship between a solicitor or notary and their client affects the administration of justice, a sensitive issue in terms of democracy, as Mr Lehne has also pointed out."
"The work of the professional associations of legal professions in the different countries is very beneficial to relations, not just corporate relations, but also those in defence of the public interest."
"The judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, which Mrs Kroes is so keen to see, has so far recognised that systems such as the Spanish system conform to European legislation, whose fee rates are merely guidelines, rather than minimums, which help the judicial administration to set costs, which is ultimately always controlled judicially."
"Neither should the opposition of many lawyers from many countries to the pact be questioned."
"This pact violates the dignity of work and shows a lack of consideration and respect for the profession."
"The prohibition of the pact has also been accepted by the national courts, Mrs Kroes."
"I would call upon the European Commission to respect the work of institutions which, like the colleges of lawyers and notaries, have generally speaking been working well for more than two centuries, despite the ups and downs and interruptions of history."
"Do not forget that constitutions, such as the Spanish Constitution, recognise the essential role of professional associations and the fundamental work they do."
"The European Commission should be loyal to the European tradition, and not to the newer United States tradition."
"We must support small legal practices."
"Do not make any mistakes."
". Mr President, as will be clear, most of the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs are very passionate about the legal profession."
"For many of us, myself included, it was our profession before we came here and, in that sense, we have an interest."
"Yet however passionate I might have been about my former profession and its independence, I am more passionate about access to justice and legal services in general and how we make those services available to serve the public interest."
"The public interest in access to justice must, I believe, be our overriding goal and not the protection or convenience of lawyers who may find it more comfortable to continue to provide services in the way they have always done."
"The profession needs to be independent, but its protectionism should only serve the public interest."
"It seems to me that, in Europe, we have a wonderful opportunity to look around and see what exactly best serves the public interest."
"For example, I have always thought that the fee scales in Germany at the lower end work well to ensure that claimants with low value problems can pursue justice."
"In my own country, this is often a problem because the costs are so high and, where we have some form of fixed fee, the fees are so low that lawyers decline the work."
"These are delicate balances, but Europe gives us the chance to look at many answers that may be available to these problems and to pick the best for the society we try to serve, and we should not be frightened or protective about looking for the best."
"I believe that so long as the Commission shares that aim, we should be able to work together."
". Mr President, I am totally in agreement with Mrs Wallis’s conclusion."
"Let us look for the best and do it together."
"That is the only way we can face all the clients and potential clients of those professionals that we are talking about."
"I should like to re-emphasise some key messages about our aspirations in this area."
"Our initiative is about better regulation."
"What does that mean?"
"It means a regulation that is balanced and no more restrictive than is strictly necessary."
"We want to promote, not hinder, access to justice."
"That is what really makes sense."
"Opening the way to greater competition in that sector will do just that; it will result in the emergence of new and innovative types of services."
"That is surely a great advantage."
"It will benefit all by releasing the potential of the sector in terms of growth, in terms of jobs, as well as providing better-quality services and more choice for consumers."
"I should like to make a more detailed comment on the crucial question of price fixing, which has been put on the table as the main issue this evening."
"Generally, I do not see how wide-scale price fixing, even for in-court work, can be objectively justified for all consumers and business users."
"There may be certain limited circumstances in which price regulation is justified: for example, where there is a need to provide special protection for certain disadvantaged groups, including the lower paid."
"That may require very limited and carefully targeted price regulation."
"More generally though, consumers and business users are likely to be better off with a number of offers from different service providers to compare and to choose from."
"In systems where legal costs are borne by the defeated party, I can, however, see some merit in having a guide for judges when they need to decide on costs."
"I am not saying that removing price regulation or that lower levels of regulation will automatically lead to lower prices, more choice for consumers or the creation of new jobs."
"As to the removal of price regulation in the UK leading to high legal costs, I am not aware of any evidence to show that price deregulation in the UK has meant problems for UK citizens in accessing legal advice and representation, or that UK legal fees have escalated disproportionately as a result."
"In fact the Law Society in the UK noted in 1999 that introducing greater competition into the area of conveyancing of property transfer led to price falls of up to 24% in the 1990s and opened the way for consumers to shop around to get the best deal."
"In the country I know best, research in 2002 found that the introduction of competition in conveyancing resulted in fees falling."
"Finally, a word on quality."
"We all want European consumers to have access to quality legal services."
"That is essential if access to justice for all is to be a reality."
"But I do not think fixed prices are always essential for this."
"I am not aware of any evidence to suggest that removing fixed tariffs has led to a deterioration in the quality of legal services in Member States where this has happened, though quality has a price."
"A fixed price does not in itself guarantee quality."
"The motto I will take over from Mrs Wallis is: ‘let us look for the best and do it together’."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in Brussels on Thursday, 23 March."
"– The next item is the statement by the Commission on preparations for the COP-MOP meeting on biological diversity and security (Curitiba, Brazil)."
". Mr President, the European Commission is committed to implementing and further strengthening international obligations related to biodiversity."
"The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment has underlined the need to take drastic steps if we want to avoid irreparable loss of the ecosystem services on which human wellbeing depends."
"If we do not pay attention to the links between economic development and biodiversity, we will also put at risk the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals."
"The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment concludes that ‘an unprecedented effort is needed to achieve the 2010 target of a significant reduction in the rate of biodiversity loss at all levels’."
"That global 2010 biodiversity target was adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity and endorsed at the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development."
"High-level political commitment is therefore needed to strengthen and implement the Convention on Biological Diversity and achieve the 2010 target."
"The eighth conference of the parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity will take place during the next two weeks in Curitiba, Brazil."
"The COP-8 is preceded by the third meeting of the parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety."
"Those are major international environmental events and Commissioner Dimas will attend the ministerial segment of the eighth conference of the parties from 26 to 30 March."
"The Environment Council of last Wednesday adopted conclusions setting out the EU priorities for the eighth conference of the parties."
"The conclusions are: first, strengthening the implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity and monitoring progress towards achieving the 2010 biodiversity target; secondly, making progress in implementing the programme of work on protected areas of the Convention on Biological Diversity, and in particular on its objective to establish a global network of comprehensive, ecologically representative and effectively managed national and regional protected area systems."
"That should be done by 2010 for terrestrial areas and by 2012 for marine areas."
"That will also require progress regarding marine areas that lie beyond national jurisdiction."
"The Convention on Biological Diversity should establish scientific criteria for the identification of marine areas and species in the high seas requiring most urgent protection."
"The third conclusion concerns making progress with the negotiations of an international regime on access and benefit-sharing."
"As regards the ongoing third meeting of the parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, our priorities are to finalise the adoption of documentation requirements for cross-border movements of GMOs, to develop further guidance on risk assessment and to discuss additional measures on compliance."
"Capacity-building issues will also be centre-stage at the third meeting of the parties."
"The Commission is strongly committed to the inclusion of Members of the European Parliament as observers in Community delegations negotiating multilateral agreements and has already done so on a number of occasions."
"The Commission therefore welcomes the participation of Members of the European Parliament at COP-8 and believes that they can make an important contribution."
"Within the limits imposed by the available staff resources at the COP, the Commission will keep Members of Parliament regularly informed of developments in the negotiations, in accordance with the interinstitutional agreement."
". Mr President, it is now 13 years since the UN Convention on Biological Diversity was signed, and yet biological diversity on earth is becoming poorer and poorer."
"When the eighth conference of the parties to the agreement begins next week, the world situation will be one where some 16 000 animal species and 60 000 plant species are under threat of extinction."
"We are exploiting our ecosystems in an unsustainable way."
"Globally, the major factor causing the impoverishment of diversity is land use which changes the natural environment to make it more profitable."
"Every year, some 2% of the earth’s original natural environments become agricultural and forestry land or part of the built environment."
"Because the problems of habitats, their species and the impoverishment of hereditary diversity are generally only seen after some time has passed, the nature of the biodiversity ceiling as part of global change has not received sufficient attention."
"As a result of the deterioration in ecosystems, their function and the free services they provide for humans, such as the production of clean water and the maintenance of the hydrological cycle, carbon binding, the pollination of edible plants and the recycling of nutrients, could be very adversely affected."
"Ecologists and economists have calculated that the value of the free services provided by nature amounts to the incredible sum of approximately EUR 23 billion a year, which is more than the combined national product of the entire world."
"The services provided by an ecosystem can to some extent be returned, for example, by afforestation of logging areas prone to erosion, but forest plantations will not compensate for the diversity of natural forests."
"We therefore share the same clear desire: we want to halt the impoverishment of nature."
"Where, however, will the wisdom be found to embark on effective ways of doing so?"
"The resolution contains many worthy recommendations, but when you look at nature itself, you cannot help but marvel at its wisdom."
"Nature itself is infinitely productive, creative and even extravagant, but at the same time efficient and practical."
"Nature provides a model for what a natural economic system of production is actually like, and what to aim for with an ecological product design."
"Nature is not concerned about integrated product policy from start to finish: for nature, everything is always the start of something new."
"We need the same sort of wisdom – but also an unbiased approach – to be able to overcome the difficulties that lie ahead."
". – Mr President, there is broad consensus on the need to strengthen international environmental management."
"Climate change is the biggest of the global environmental problems, but unfortunately not the only one."
"The decline in the number of species in the world is already threatening the viability of our society."
"For this reason, we need real results from the forthcoming UN Conference of Parties regarding biological diversity in the EU."
"The Convention on Biological Diversity is the most widely adopted existing international agreement on the conservation of biological diversity."
"It has 188 signatories, including all 25 Member States of the European Union."
"In order to ensure that the Convention has the widest possible impact, it is essential that it should be implemented effectively in the various policy areas, and that it is compatible with other international agreements on the environment and that they can all be coordinated together."
"The biggest problem for effective implementation, however, is the insufficient number of indicators describing biological diversity."
"We do not know what is happening in our environment or how we might best respond to this challenge."
"The Commission needs to work hard to produce these indicators."
"The European Union must be the one to point the way in strengthening the global dimension of sustainable development."
"We should be prepared to agree on targets which are binding on all of us, in order that we might be able to stop the impoverishment of nature and safeguard its riches; not just for us, but for our children as well."
". – Why do we need to preserve biological diversity?"
"The answer is simple – because it is directly linked to us – people."
"Man is a part of biological diversity; man affects living organisms which surround him and is affected by them himself."
"However, every day, namely man destroys an unknown number of life form species, as his actions induce climate change, increase pollution of the environment and destroy the natural habitats of plants and animals."
"Human activities, for which there is no analogy in nature, are usually disastrous from the point of view of biological diversity."
"An assessment of available data held by various European states on the condition of bird and mammal populations and changes in their abundance shows that the long-term conservation of many of these species cannot be guaranteed without an urgent and determined change in biological protection strategy and policy."
"The so-called simplified environmental protection strategy, which has previously been used, only tries to take into account the needs of those species most at risk of extinction."
"Such strategy is no longer suitable."
"I take a very positive view of the European Union's ambitious goal of halting the decline in biological diversity by 2010."
"To realise this goal it is necessary to create a biological indicator system, which would help to assess the progress in the implementation of obligations undertaken under the Convention on Biological Diversity."
"We must draw up national action plans and coordinate the collection, analysis and publication of data on an international scale."
"Clearly this also requires financial investment."
"Today is World Consumer Rights Day."
"It is symbolic that today of all days we are discussing the conservation of biological diversity."
"The ever growing promotion of consumerism, which as it has been affirmed, increases economic growth and the welfare of every person, increasingly harms the environment on a daily basis."
". Mr President, this resolution provides a vital opportunity for Parliament to send a strong resolution to the parties meeting in Brazil about the value that Europe’s citizens place on the world’s natural resources and biodiversity."
"I want to focus on just two such resources."
"The world’s last ancient forests are being lost at a rate of more than 13 million hectares a year with devastating impact."
"A global network of protected forest areas must be established and funded, and countries must set measurable time-ban targets to ensure that the use, consumption and trade of biodiversity resources come only from sustainable sources."
"We must also urgently speak out on the issue of crops engineered using terminator technologies."
"These crops produce sterile seeds so farmers will be unable to save seeds from one year’s crops to sow the next, forcing them into buying seeds each year from biotech corporations whose control over seeds is already enormous: just ten corporations control more than 50% of global seed sales."
"The consequences for food security, especially in developing countries and for the livelihoods of poor farmers, would be huge."
"Any proposals to undermine the moratorium on field testing and marketing of these suicide seeds must be firmly rejected, and that is what our group has tabled an amendment on tomorrow to strengthen that point."
"– Mr President, in the last two centuries, population growth, the exploitation of natural resources, and environmental pollution have resulted in a rapidly increasing loss of growth."
"As has been said many times today, man is dependent on biodiversity."
"Forests, for example, not only supply us with the raw material wood and increase the oxygen content of air, but also clean our water and prevent erosion and flooding: a function of which awareness is growing in all corners of the world as the impact of climate change is increasingly felt."
"As the Commissioner said, a decision was taken at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss."
"At that time, the European Parliament delegation strongly criticised this insufficiently ambitious demand."
"Within the EU, we went beyond that demand and said that, by 2010, the trend towards biodiversity loss was to be reversed."
"I believe that the Commission and the Member States should continue to play a leading role and ensure that, at the 8th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, agreement is reached on measurable objectives and a specific time frame for the achievement of such objectives."
"The EU and the Member States should also pay particular attention to marine biodiversity, and the EU must look at its own performance on this."
"I should like to make just a fleeting mention of the European fisheries policy, a subject that is currently being discussed with our ACP colleagues on account of the alarming fall in stocks of various fish species."
"– To wind up the debate, I have received one motion for a resolution(1), pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"The Independence and Democracy Group has informed me that as of yesterday, 15 March 2006, it is made up of the following 22 Members."
"Gerard Batten, Bastiaan Belder, Johannes Blokland, Godfrey Bloom, Jens-Peter Bonde, Graham Booth, Derek Roland Clark, Paul Marie Coûteaux, Nigel Farage, Hélène Goudin, Georgios Karatzaferis, Roger Knapman, Patrick Louis, Nils Lundgren, Michael Henry Nattrass, Kathy Sinnott, Jeffrey Titford, Philippe de Villiers, John Whittaker, Thomas Wise, Lars Wohlin and Vladimír Železný."
"For this reason, as of the aforesaid date, the following Members are non-attached."
"Umberto Bossi, Matteo Salvini, Mario Borghezio, Francesco Enrico Speroni, Dariusz Maciej Grabowski, Urszula Krupa, Bogdan Pęk, Mirosław Mariusz Piotrowski, Bogusław Rogalski, Witold Tomczak and Andrzej Tomasz Zapałowski."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I simply ask that it be recorded in the Minutes that Mr Bossi, Mr Borghezio, Mr Speroni and Mr Salvini object to the entirely irregular procedure that has been followed with regard to the subject of the communication presented just now by the President."
"We have not been informed of any meeting."
"This decision by the Independence and Democracy Group is entirely unjustified and irregular, and therefore the communication presented this morning by the President must also be regarded as being based on an irregular and unjustified decision."
"Many thanks."
"Your comments have been noted."
"(Mr President, I am interrupting to request a change to the Minutes."
"I had omitted to sign the list of people present yesterday."
"I was there, of course, as is clear from the minutes of the voting session, and, indeed, I contributed to the debate on the Cottigny report."
"Thank you for noting that, Mr President."
"Many thanks."
"Your comments have been noted."
"Mr President, I wish to speak in relation to Rule 172, with regard to the Minutes of the previous sitting."
"On Tuesday I presented a question to the Council on an issue which is extremely urgent for my region, the Canary Islands, relating to the humanitarian disasters involving immigrants, who are arriving in my region in their hundreds."
"I did not receive a reply − the Council replied to very few questions − but I expected at least to receive a written reply."
"Today, Thursday, I have received the verbatim report: the reply does not appear there either and I have no way of knowing what that reply is, because Parliament’s services are not giving it to me."
"I wished to protest at the delay in the operation of the services, because I believe that for urgent subjects, which is the purpose of these questions, the time between a question not being answered and the reply being received is too long, given that the written reply already exists."
"I wished to register my protest and I hope to receive a written reply as soon as possible."
"Many thanks."
"Your comments will be noted."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the communication on my exclusion and that of other members of the Independence and Democracy Group, you replied that you were taking note of this matter and that it would be recorded in the Minutes."
"I consider that to be an unsatisfactory reply, however."
"Through the head of our delegation, Mr Borghezio, we pointed out some irregularities in the procedure of excluding Members from the group, and so I call on the presidency to verify whether they are in order."
"If the presidency determines that everything is in order, then I shall consider myself no longer attached. However, I should like the presidency to verify whether the correct procedures have been followed."
"Thank you very much."
"We will consider this matter in a separate procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the report (A6-0030/2006) by Mr Trakatellis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Programme of Community Action in the field of Health and Consumer Protection 2007-2013 – Health aspects [COM(2005)0115 – C6-0097/2005 – 2005/0042A(COD)]."
". Mr President, I should like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, for his excellent work in preparing this report."
"However, I should also like to thank the members of the two committees for their excellent work in studying and examining this programme."
"I am truly delighted at the large number of both speakers and proposals submitted on this programme."
"Similarly, I want to say as of now that I could not in fact, under different circumstances, disagree with the substance of the proposals made."
"We may, as regards the split into two programmes, have different approaches, but the recommendations add to the actions under the programme, extend its scope and make it more effective, so that it covers more sectors."
"In addition – and this is equally important – not only is provision made for the resources sought by the Commission in order to support the programme, but also its budget has been further increased."
"Unfortunately, however, under present circumstances – and I refer here in particular to economic circumstances – we must be careful and – to use a word which I do not particularly like – 'realistic'."
"The most serious issue which is pending at the moment is the closure of discussions on the financial perspective and Parliament has an important role to play here."
"At this point, I would highlight the support and positive positions of Parliament and the Commission on the financial strengthening of the programme."
"It is a fact that, if the compromise achieved in the European Council in December is maintained, this will mean considerable cutbacks to the programme."
"President Barroso has already sent the relevant letter to President Borrell, in which he points out that, if the arrangement stays as it was in December, the health and consumer protection sector not only will not have sufficient resources, but also this sector will have fewer financial resources in 2007 than it had in 2006."
"In other words, there will be less money for the Europe of the 25 and 27 Member States than there was for the Europe of the 15."
"I believe, as President Barroso also points out in his letter, that this approach cannot be justified, especially at a time when we want to bring Europe close to its citizens."
"That is why President Borrell is asked for Parliament to make one more effort to cooperate in this sector."
"The Commission proposal for the programme is also reflected in the relevant budget."
"If, however, the considerable reduction to which I referred earlier ultimately comes about, this will mean that numerous actions and numerous sectors of the proposal will have to be abandoned, because there is no point in allocating small amounts to numerous sectors in such a way that, in essence, no sector is supported effectively."
"That is why the whole programme needs to be reassessed, priorities need to be set and the actions, initiatives and sectors covered need to be reduced considerably, so that we can cover effectively even just the few sectors selected."
"Of course, I would like to hope that, in the debates which follow, this situation will be remedied and it will be understood that this was perhaps a mistake and that, given the huge political significance both of the issue of health and of the issue of consumer protection, even just some small amounts will at least be added to the programme."
"As far as the question of splitting the programme is concerned, I understand the positions expressed."
"I know that both committees would prefer there to be separate programmes, I understand the arguments and I understand the concerns."
"We, however, continue in essence to consider that there are benefits if a joint programme is maintained."
"Better use can be made of resources."
"However, in all events, until the matter of the financial perspective has been cleared up, the Commission is not in a position to take a final decision on the extent to which it does or does not accept the split."
"That is why, at the present stage, the Commission will reject the amendments which promote the split into two programmes and, once we have the final outcome of the debate on the financial perspective, then we shall re-examine the matter."
"Parliament has made its position clear and we have noted that."
"I will not go into other details due to lack of time."
"I had the pleasure of discussing the programme with the competent committee."
"I merely wish to emphasise, because there is no time and there are a great many amendments, that the Commission's position on each of the amendments will be circulated in writing and I would be obliged if it could be included in the Minutes of this debate(1)."
"However, I would insist on the fact that the amendments which are being rejected are not being rejected due to disagreement in substance with their tenet. I would remind you, of course, that many of them are being accepted, but those which are being rejected are mainly not being accepted because of the need for there to be, on the one hand, some priorities within the framework of the financial situation and, on the other hand, because of issues of subsidiarity, in other words so that we do not intervene in the competences of the Member States and, of course, so that we do not overlap and do not repeat actions which are covered by other Community policies and actions."
"To close, I should like to thank you once again and I shall follow the debate by the Members with a great deal of interest."
"– Mr President, the problem of bird 'flu was – I am sure you will agree – an opportunity for the Union and the Member States to act in a coordinated and effective manner, by strengthening citizens' confidence and feeling of security."
"However, it also provided further proof of the value which Community action has in the field of public health."
"That is why I consider the timing of this debate to be the right time to support the present report, including the increased financing which is the necessary basis for achieving the objectives, objectives which, like the basic lines of action, safeguard the continuation and, at the same time, the development of the previous programme."
"This is achieved by a combination of objectives and actions, such as the protection of citizens from health threats from physical, chemical or biological sources, infectious diseases and so forth."
"We need a common defence system and a coordinated response at European level for possible pandemics, as the topical issue of bird 'flu proves."
"The promotion of policies which result in a healthier lifestyle – health determinants."
"We owe it to our children, to future generations, to work for the adoption of lifestyle standards, taking serious account of health determinants: proper eating habits, stopping smoking, social and economic conditions that do not result in excessive stress."
"Disease prevention cannot but be based primarily on addressing health determinants which demonstrably affect physical and mental health."
"Helping to reduce the incidence of morbidity and mortality for major diseases and injuries is a further line of action which also requires coordinated and joint action."
"Improving the effectiveness and efficacy of health systems: we need to examine jointly the health systems of the Member States in order to safeguard their compatibility, as this will allow them to perform better for the citizens of Europe."
"Better information and knowledge, on the one hand, in order to develop health and, on the other hand, in order to incorporate the objectives of policies applied in the health sectors in other policies must be available to everyone, both those employed in the health professions and simple citizens."
"Better medical practice which not only constitutes the most effective means of combating diseases, but also restricts further losses to our health."
"It is obvious that the criterion for evaluating treatments cannot be the financial cost and must be effectiveness, which also works out cheaper in the long run."
"In addition, emphasis is placed on actions such as the effect of the environment on health and the collection of data relating to low birth rates, low fertility and sterility, which are developing into a scourge for aging European communities, which are already under threat from the demographic problem."
"The collection of data and the development of strategies for patient mobility, the further development of the electronic health card, mechanisms for the promotion of organ transplants, cooperation between the Commission and the Member States and with international organisations such as the World Health Organisation and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, are needed for there to be exchanges of opinions and for the promotion of health actions."
"The Member States are also being called on to play an important role, given that a large proportion of the data comes from them."
"The element of coordination of the programme is, I think, material and instrumental to its success and certainly the open method of coordination can contribute to issues of subsidiarity through the strengthening of strategies in the health and healthcare sector, such as patient mobility."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I could continue with an endless catalogue of prevention and care issues."
"However, I am certain that the need for a coordinated intervention that will combine joint action at European level with the facility and ability of the Member States to improve their efficiency now constitutes common ground."
"This truly ambitious aspiration is served by the proposed second programme."
"It is more integral and, given also the experience which we have acquired, I believe that it will return comparatively better results."
"From this point of view, I believe that Amendment 64, which recommends a higher amount, because the programme is now fuller than and different from that tabled by the Commission, is needed because, without financing, the best programmes will not bring about any results."
"Consequently, as rapporteur, I cannot encourage you enough to vote in favour of Amendment 64 and I believe that, in doing so, you will send a message of decisiveness to the Council and a message of hope to the European citizens that we too really are concerned with and interested in the health of the citizens of Europe."
"– Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Trakatellis on the sterling work he has done on the matter we are debating today."
"This is most certainly one of the areas for which real grass-roots support may be secured."
"There is a lot of talk about there being a rather defensive approach to European cooperation at the moment, especially after the votes in the Netherlands and France on the Constitutional Treaty."
"All investigations show, however, that it is very difficult to find grass-roots opposition to cross-border cooperation on precisely the areas we are debating today."
"It is, of course, therefore also important for me to emphasise that we support the work done so far."
"We support the attempt to split the two programmes up, and we are in favour of securing as substantial funding for the programmes as it is reasonably possible to obtain."
"I would particularly emphasise that the report includes a proposal from the Committee on Budgets, designed to ensure that the Commission can grant core funding on a two-year basis by means of network partnership conventions."
"The idea is to make sure that as few resources as possible are expended on bureaucracy and that most go into increased efforts in those areas about which we are in agreement."
"With that, I should like once again to thank Mr Trakatellis for his considerable efforts. I hope that we really will succeed in sending a clear signal to Europeans that the EU can make a difference of benefit to us all in this area."
". Mr President, I warmly commend my colleague’s report and indeed I welcome what he and the Commissioner said in their opening statements about the budget."
"I think that is something Parliament needs to listen to."
"At the moment we have an absurd budget of 0.15 cents per EU citizen – that is the total we spend each year on health in this European Union – and yet we have so many health threats, health challenges and health opportunities."
"This week I met with iatrogenic patients."
"The Commissioner and my honourable friend the rapporteur will understand what that means, because it is Greek, but for other colleagues it means patients who have suffered severe disability or severe health problems as a result of accidents in hospital."
"It is one of the patient-safety issues on our agenda and was rightly put there during the British Presidency."
"We face the challenge of an ageing population, with people living longer – mainly healthy – lives, but then becoming frail in older age and facing all the neuro-degenerative disease challenges that brings."
"We now have a drugs bill for Parkinson’s disease higher than the drugs bill for cancer."
"We need to raise standards, and we raise standards in the European Union by describing good standards, not prescribing them."
"That is the way forward; it is not very expensive; we have done it on cancer screening, starting with the Irish Presidency and continuing with the Austrian Presidency."
"We are calling for that on diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, and the Commission itself is calling for something along those lines for mental health, one of the biggest challenges of our time."
"One in three of us will probably, at some point in our lives, have cause for concern, and indeed thanks are due if we have managed to make headway in that field."
"But the budget is a concern."
"One of the greatest threats at the moment is the flu pandemic."
"One of the greatest needs is the establishment of the effective running of the European Centre for Disease Control."
"One of the problems, as we have heard directly from that board, is that it is under-resourced, under-financed and will not be able to do its job properly if the pandemic hits in the coming months, or even years."
"That must be a priority for us, but it must not be a priority which destroys the rest of our health work."
"We must devote time and energy and some resources to getting right the opportunities that are coming through the European courts for patient mobility."
"We need to concentrate on all those ranges of disease where there is public concern, whether it is heart or respiratory, rheumatological or brain disease."
"We also need to think of the entire range of medical science, including those newest areas, like complementary medicine, which can play their part."
"I recently benefited from a course of acupuncture to remove the pain of sciatica and can guarantee and vouch for the effectiveness of at least one type of complementary treatment."
"I also commend that element of this report to the House."
". Mr President, firstly I want to join those who are congratulating Mr Trakatellis for his work and for the open and cooperative way in which he has conducted the drafting of this report."
"We all know that the EU has limited powers and limited resources, maybe even smaller resources than we would hope, to carry out work in field of health."
"It is, therefore, important that we focus our work on areas where the EU can add value and make a real difference."
"That is why the PSE Group has tried to ensure that we have real focus in the health programme."
"We need a health programme that forms part of a health strategy for the European Union."
"At the moment we have a lot of ad-hoc initiatives, often coming from Presidencies, on this or that condition."
"That is not good enough: we need a strategy and we need to define what the strategy should cover."
"For my part I say it should include trans-border health threats; we have heard about those, we know about the flu pandemic."
"Secondly, it should include patient health mobility issues: with more and more people travelling, we have got to get the health card right."
"I get a lot of casework from people who still have problems with their health card."
"Then there are people travelling, who want health care abroad with the E112."
"We have to stop letting the Court make the rules about healthcare; the legislators have to make the healthcare rules."
"Thirdly, there is the area of cooperation, of exchange of good practice on tackling health determinants."
"As Mr Trakatellis said, that is extremely important."
"We get a lot of lobbying on this from organisations asking us to include in the programme actions on one or other disease or condition."
"The PSE Group does not support including a list of conditions in the report, because we feel we should be focusing on the health determinants."
"We do not want to create a hierarchy of diseases and conditions, because many of these diseases and conditions are terrible for those who have them."
"Keeping this sharp focus on health in the health programme is not going to be easy."
"We need only look at the number of amendments tabled for plenary – nearly 200 – and at the many competing demands that are being made."
"However, unless we have focus in the programme, unless we can show that the EU is adding value and not just making a series of declarations at summits or conferences, it will be very difficult to convince the Council and the public of the need for an increased budget."
"So, it is over to the Commission."
"I hope it will come forward with a health strategy, I hope we will have focus in a future health programme."
"We will be voting for Amendment 64; we think it is very important to send a signal that healthcare matters."
"We know the public is sceptical about Europe, but if people see us acting on things they care about, they might feel friendlier towards Europe."
"I very much hope we will defend a good budget but also keep an eye on focus in the programme."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, health policy falls essentially within the competence of the Member States."
"There is a good reason for that. Health systems are paid for out of contributions and taxes, and the various systems are geared to specific needs."
"Moreover, the principle of subsidiarity applies for the field of health services and medical care."
"Article 152 of the EU Treaty requires Member States to ensure a high level of health protection."
"The EU can also take measures in support of Member States’ policies."
"I sometimes get the impression that the Commission and some of our fellow Members, too, would prefer to compete with national policies on health."
"We have the same problem with health policy as also constantly recurs in other fields: Europe is suffering from being unable to do the important things it ought to be concerned with."
"The upshot is that the EU embraces many areas of policy which, if in doubt, would be better dealt with by the Member States and interferes assiduously in their affairs."
"That does not of course mean that Europe should keep its hands off health policy."
"Rather, the EU must concentrate on things that have real European added value, and here I can pick up directly what the previous speaker was saying: Europe should take action primarily on cross-border questions that one Member State is unable to deal with alone."
"Top priority must be given to improving the exchange of information and to closer cooperation in coordinating the fight against epidemics and infectious diseases."
"The health risks resulting from bird flu show the urgency of cross-border coordination of measures."
"The same goes for HIV and Aids, a major problem in the new Member States in particular, and one which is increasingly being forgotten and neglected even though infection rates are rising."
"The EU should set stronger priorities for fighting disease."
"My group has tabled amendments on this, for which I would again like to canvas your support."
"The focus should be on the most important widespread diseases, such as diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases; that is where the EU’s measures and scarce resources must be concentrated."
"We should not take it upon ourselves to make a shopping list."
"In Committee, we discussed at length what diseases and what preventive measures should have priority in the action programme."
"Let us be consistent in our demands here."
"Parliament’s December 2005 resolution on the work programme calls explicitly for measures to combat diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases."
"The terms of the proposal for the Commission action programme were too general, too broad."
"It is time for us to set political priorities and concentrate on the most widespread diseases."
"I would also like to say a few words about the budget and the funding of NGOs."
"My Group supports the rapporteur’s proposal that the budget for the action programme be increased to EUR 1.2 billion."
"If we are serious about the priorities we are setting with this programme, we will of course need the resources to match."
"Patients’ associations and non-governmental organisations are playing an increasingly important role, which justifies them receiving EU support."
"When funding NGOs, however, we must ensure there are strict criteria and transparency."
"It cannot be acceptable that some organisations – as happens in the environmental field – are so lavishly endowed that they can pay for Brussels offices as though they were subsidiaries of the EU Commission."
". Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance quite clearly supports an independent, well-funded health programme."
"Health heads the European public’s wish list, and we must give a very clear sign today that health policy is also a priority for us in the European Parliament, in the European Union, too."
"Services and systems are of course organised at national level, but we must discuss the objectives of health policy internationally and jointly in Europe."
"If a billion euros a year are spent subsidising tobacco, then health policy must be worth the same amount."
"On the financing of NGOs, we in the Group of the Greens are quite clear that only NGOs that are independent of industry should be funded."
"Sadly, we have a very large number of NGOs that are in the pay of the pharmaceutical industry and are its mouthpiece, their only purpose being to advertise over-expensive medicines."
"That is not what we want."
"We want to support NGOs that are independent."
"And, Mr Krahmer, it is a contradiction to say they must not get state funding as well."
"What else are they to get?"
"Are they really to be financed by the pharmaceutical industry and kept on a leash?"
"We do not want that!"
"Of course these NGOs also need funding to pay for their public relations work."
"Support for complementary and alternative medicine is quite central for us."
"I am pleased that there have already been positive experiences with it."
"We have millions of people in the European Union who have had very positive experiences with complementary and alternative medicine, not forgetting environmental medicine."
"It is therefore discriminatory of the European Union to pay no attention to this field of medicine, which does not yet have even a shadowy existence."
"If the Commission is serious when it proclaims in Lisbon that we are an innovative society, then we must use the knowledge and innovation of alternative and complementary medicine, develop it and make it available to the people of the European Union."
"That is really quite central and I think the Commission has staked far too much on the interests of the big pharmaceutical companies alone with its demand for blockbuster drugs."
"That cannot be allowed to continue."
"We must not go in for covert industrial and pharmaceutical research here, but our aim must be to really get innovation moving. Complementary and alternative medicine must of course have its place there."
"My final point is this. We all again expressly ask that there really should be no discrimination, no genetic selection."
"We would therefore like to press Mr Trakatellis once again to accept our amendment as an additional clause in which we quite clearly say: work in this field should only continue postnatally and only where therapies are also available."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Trakatellis, I must congratulate you on the truly excellent job which you have done on such a complicated issue and agree with you on many counts, especially as regards the increase in the financing framework for the programme."
"Nonetheless, I cannot agree with your wish that certain diseases, which are the big killers, should not be named and certainly they are not shopping lists, as Mr Krahmer said."
"Cancer: one in four deaths is due to cancer."
"One in three European citizens will suffer from some form of cancer during their lifetime."
"Cardiac diseases: first cause of death."
"Rheumatism: over 150 diseases and syndromes."
"One in five Europeans are in permanent therapy for rheumatism or arthritis."
"Rheumatism is the second most frequent cause of visits to the doctor."
"In most countries, 20% of primary care is for people suffering from rheumatism."
"Then there are other diseases, such as diabetes and mental illness."
"Given that the diseases which I have mentioned affect such a large proportion of the European population, and are so directly linked to the quality of life of Europeans, I am of the opinion that they should be included by name in the programme in question."
"Consequently, I have tabled the relevant amendment on behalf of my group – Amendment 156 – which I should like to ask you to support."
"It is a fact that the rich members of our society enjoy direct and easy access, not only as regards information on health matters, but also as regards access to health services."
"They are well informed of the dangers and threats as regards health matters and have the facility to consult doctors regularly and in time."
"By contrast, those in financial difficulty do not have direct and easy access to information and it is almost certain that they will have to wait a long time for medical care."
"Consequently, we need to make a huge effort to include the needs of these groups and the organisations that represent them in our health systems."
"We must take account of their experiences, so that we can create specially designed health systems which meet the needs of the Europeans who are victims of discrimination and receive poor treatment."
"That is why the relevant amendment has been tabled – Amendment 157 – which I again call on you to support and, to close, I wish once again to congratulate Mr Trakatellis on the truly excellent job he has done."
". Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Trakatellis for his work on this dossier."
"His commitment to improving public health in Europe is commendable."
"Whilst I can support the gist of the report, I should nevertheless like to make three observations."
"Firstly, with regard to the budget, Amendment 64 increases it substantially, albeit only indicatively."
"In my view, this amendment does not belong in this report, since the level of the budget is not decided upon today, but depends on the outcome of the negotiations on financial perspectives."
"Secondly, I should like to speak out in favour of Amendment 148 of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Genetic screening can be a valuable addition to the present diagnostic techniques, but only if it is used in an ethically responsible manner."
"We must, for example, prevent insurance companies from excluding certain people from their policies on the basis of genetic profiling."
"Lastly, I should like to draw the Commissioner’s attention to the very bureaucratic manner in which the research budget is now shared out."
"It has come to my notice that a single application can cost as much as a few thousand euros."
"Also, applicants are left in the dark as to the criteria on which basis they will eventually be tested and as to the basis on which applications can be granted or turned down."
"Moreover, whilst the Commission is very strict on the applicants when they exceed deadlines, there are no repercussions when the Commission postpones a decision."
"Needless to say, this leads to much frustration."
"I suggest we introduce a preliminary procedure in which applications are tested on a limited number of points."
"Full applications would then be requested only of the projects that have real chances of success."
"This will reduce the work pressure in the Commission and can also considerably reduce the burden on the part of the applicants."
"I should like to hear a reaction from the Commissioner on this."
". Mr President, public health in each country is crucial to the citizens and is clearly a matter for each Member State."
"One of the great advantages, however, of being a Member State of the European Union is having access to other Member States’ cooperation and knowledge base."
"It matters in any field and, in this case, if public health, by reason of its scale or effects, can be better achieved through the cooperation of Member States, then this should be encouraged."
"The Irish Government continues to aim for top-quality healthcare for its citizens, including appropriate, prompt and safe healthcare in the right setting: healthcare provided in a way that is fair to patients, taxpayers and health professionals."
"It aims to provide professional staff ready for the job, training, equipment and support for promoting healthier living in a healthier environment."
"In this age, in Ireland and across the European Union, we have major health challenges to tackle: cardiovascular disease, neuropsychiatric disorders, cancer, digestive diseases, respiratory diseases, sense organ disorders, obesity and diabetes, to mention a few."
"No one country can tackle this alone."
"The European Union, through the experience of its Member States and experts and by virtue of this proposal, which has been greatly improved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, is rising to the challenge of assisting Member States in public health."
"I also wish to compliment Mr Trakatellis on his contribution in this report."
"Communications, education, access to modern methods, application of sound medical advice and bridging gaps in the issue of public health at Member State level are vital."
"Further, and more specifically, I welcome the amendments regarding the inclusion of alternative medicine in the programme."
"Better knowledge about complementary and alternative medicine can provide an important contribution to the ability of citizens to make better informed and responsible choices regarding their health."
"Mr President, many of the diseases that people in Europe suffer from today are more or less directly related to our lifestyle."
"One only has to think, for example, of the increase in nutrition-related diseases or in those caused by lack of exercise."
"The approach of promoting strategies for a healthier lifestyle is therefore certainly an important one."
"Their success will be doubtful, however, if some EUR 1.4 billion are put into an information system on health issues that serves only to exchange health reports."
"Most of the diseases people suffer from, even here in Europe, are not caused by a lack of available information."
"The truth is that health starts with your attitude to life."
"Every child knows that people who take plenty of exercise and eat sparingly but naturally stay healthier."
"People have known for a long time what is harmful to health without it being written on cigarette packets, beer and wine, sweets or finished products; that is imposing on people and taking decisions for them, when they want to make their own judgments."
"Such supposedly deterrent measures are of doubtful success and I do not believe the public wants them."
"As you may know, 66% of respondents in a survey were in favour of promoting health-conscious behaviour, by discounting insurance contributions for having regular medical check-ups, for example."
"We ought to move more in that promising direction. What is more, one thing is perfectly clear: preventing disease would also reduce the financial burden on our health system."
"Mr President, good health is always at the top of the European public’s wish list."
"If Europe can contribute to this, then that is very legitimate, and that is, in fact, what we have to do, for the Treaty requires of us that we guarantee a high level of public health."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the programme."
"He has been open to the justified wishes of his fellow Members, and the Commission has tabled a sound programme, which Parliament did, however, tweak in a few areas."
"If I may start with one of those improvements, it is now expressly stipulated that the Member States must cooperate in making the purchase and supply of health care easier."
"I come from a border region with university hospitals in Maastricht, Liège and Aachen."
"Standing on top of the Vaalser Berg – which stands just over 300 m tall, so we Limburgers call it a mountain – you can almost make out the three academic top hospitals."
"Surely it would make sense, also putting cost before benefit, if those regions joined forces, thus making sure that those top facilities did not grind to a standstill, and costing us all a great deal of money."
"I am therefore pleased with the extended programme that included those cross-border options. That is the first point I wanted to make."
"The second point is about health systems that are under pressure everywhere, partly due to demography and partly because we need more, and also often therefore more expensive, facilities."
"Every Member State is adapting their care systems."
"Why do we need to re-invent the wheel everywhere?"
"Why can we not learn from each other?"
"Attention should go to that area too."
"With regard to funding, cost must go before benefit."
"With bird flu, it is not if, but a matter of when."
"When I see – and Mr Bowis has echoed this sentiment – that the management team in Stockholm for contagious diseases asserts that ‘it cannot function at a time when a disaster of that kind strikes’, then I think we have to draw up fresh agreements with each other, and I hope that is exactly what the Commission will do."
"I also believe it to be important that this programme should extend into complementary alternative care and provision, and that more should be done for diseases such as cancer, diabetes and Parkinson’s."
"– Mr President, allow me to congratulate Mr Trakatellis on his willingness to cooperate."
"The Community action plan in the field of health is an important text, in that it aims to safeguard effective prevention, improved health services and a better quality of life for everyone, something that is our primary political objective."
"The basic priority of the programme is to combat inequalities in health by strengthening existing networks in the field of public health."
"As far as people with disabilities are concerned, we need to take account of the fact that a disability is not an illness or an inability; it is a different state of health that needs to be taken into account when processing and applying all Community policies and programmes."
"It is hugely important to develop strategies and exchange best practices in the aim of promoting the health of people with disabilities and providing reliable information in forms accessible to the disabled, who are one of the target groups of the programme."
"We also need to safeguard equal access to the corresponding medical and pharmaceutical systems."
"Another basic priority is to safeguard the added value of Community actions in relation to national actions for health, in order to strengthen transnational cooperation in innovative sectors, such as telematics in medicine."
"For people with disabilities, these actions can forge new paths which will allow them to seek improved quality of life and timely and suitable access to health services while, at the same time, they will help to rationalise spending in the field of health."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Trakatellis, on his fine report."
"In the Commission’s new Community action programme in the field of health and consumer protection for 2007–2013 the Commission has emphasised the European Union’s important role in reducing the number of illnesses, that is – and I would emphasise this – in the field of serious diseases."
"Cardiovascular diseases, as we all know, are without a shadow of a doubt one of the main causes of death in Europe."
"Each year two million European Union residents die as a direct result of these diseases."
"The decisions taken by the Council during the Irish Presidency were – and continue to be – a good start in our efforts to prevent cardiovascular diseases."
"I therefore believe, like many others of my colleagues here, that in this legislative document cardiovascular diseases ought definitely to be mentioned too."
"We should call a spade a spade."
"I would therefore like to call on my fellow Members to support Amendments 142 and 143, which make it clear what can be considered to be the main diseases in Europe, against which we must work together by putting in place prevention, screening and treatment."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Mr President, I warmly welcome Mr Trakatellis’s report."
"I thank and congratulate him for his excellent work on it."
"I also want to add my voice to those who deplore the reduced funding for the area concerned."
"My group will support Amendment 64."
"In fact my group originally proposed an even higher level of funding, as you may recall."
"I should like to highlight, once again, one of the key issues that has already been raised and on which my group has tabled an amendment, namely the contribution of complementary and alternative medicine."
"Over 100 million EU citizens are already using complementary medicine and its popularity is growing rapidly."
"Improving people’s knowledge about complementary and alternative medicine can be an important way of enabling them to make more responsible and better informed choices about their health."
"Therefore, I believe it is vital that we bring that area of medicine out of the ghetto and into the mainstream and recognise the very real benefits it can bring."
"Heightened public awareness of the dangers of chemicals in the food chain, growing resistance to antibiotics through over-use and concern about the side-effects of some conventional drugs are all contributing to a massive re-think about the way we live and how we seek to regain our health."
"Complementary medicines with a holistic and person-centred approach are attracting an ever-widening public."
"It is important to acknowledge that as a phenomenon."
"Yet there is still a huge disparity between public demand for those medicines and the negligible amount of funding for research in that field."
"It is vital that we close that gap."
"I strongly support those amendments which refer to the seriousness of environmental pollution as a risk to health and a major source of concern for European citizens."
"That needs to be addressed urgently as part of a preventive healthcare strategy."
"As Mrs Breyer has already set out, our group believes that the participation of civil society is vitally important to the formulation and implementation of European health policy."
"I welcome the proposed increase in funding to enable its greater involvement, as I do the criteria outlined in Amendment 53, which makes clear the need for independence from industry, commercial and business interests."
"Amendment 141, by the Liberals, however, muddies the water and takes away precisely the legal certainty that Amendment 53 sets out."
"For that reason I would urge colleagues to reject it."
"Mr President, current fears regarding any possible mutation of bird flu means that the public is aware of the need for a joined-up strategy in relation to communicable diseases."
"At the same time, we need to recognise that non-communicable diseases are by far the greatest causes of the burden of disease and we need to put our resources where they will be most effective."
"I also ask the House to support the amendment that calls for the involvement of disadvantaged communities in the shaping of future health policies."
"We cannot hope to tackle the inequalities in health without the active input of those whose life experience makes them experts in this field."
"I also support the inclusion of complementary and alternative medicine in the action supported by the programme and I strongly support health as a separate programme from consumer protection."
"The Community action programme in health has the potential to support the mainstreaming of health in all Community policies."
"The EU is in a unique position to complement the work undertaken in Member States, to study the impact of other policies on health, to promote access to information, to improve the early detection evaluation and communication of risks and to make recommendations on best practice."
"– Mr President, as a doctor I would like to draw particular attention to the fact that modern science is seeking the psychological basis of the majority of diseases defined as psychosomatic, ranging from obesity to circulatory problems and high blood pressure, as well as autoimmune diseases and tumours, and that a knowledge-based society, and particularly the legislators in the European Union, should be informed of this."
"Community polities can also play an important role in the prevention of diseases and the protection of public health, not just in respect of those diseases defined as diseases of civilisation, but also of mental illness."
"There does, however, need to be a change in lifestyle from a liberal model that does not observe any ethical principles, to a lifestyle based on ethical and moral values, as mental order and mental integration help to prevent personal underdevelopment due to mental illness and all forms of dependence, including nicotine, alcohol and drug addiction and other self-destructive forms of addiction."
"Vast financial resources are being poured merely into remedying the effects of such dependence, but these are simply wasted due to the lack of legal restrictions."
"There is a similar problem with consumer protection, which is sometimes nothing but high-sounding phrases because of the predominance of wealthy monopolies on the market which look after their own interests and pour vast resources into advertising."
"The flood of such manipulative information should be countered, at the very least by ensuring that EU slogans about protecting basic rights become a reality."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank Mr Trakatellis for an excellent report."
"I fully support his idea of splitting it into two parts, one dealing with health promotion and the other with promoting consumer protection in 2007–2013."
"I too have contributed several amendments to this report, and I am glad that some of them have been adopted, in particular the amendment concerning the new Member States, which is the most important one to me."
"There are some striking differences between the healthcare systems of the EU Member States."
"The new Member States seem to be in an inferior position in this regard, as they face major healthcare challenges and have little funding available for improving the situation."
"Insufficient spending on healthcare is a major obstacle to the development of these states and to the growth of the European Union as a whole."
"It is necessary to increase awareness of the possibility of financing healthcare programmes from EU structural funds."
"For the new Member States, this information could be a source of hope, providing an opportunity to raise the quality of services."
"It is unfortunate that, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, the healthcare sector does not fall under the purview of the European Union and is therefore subject to national legislation."
"I appreciate the effort to include the protection of patient safety in the report."
"The difficulties faced by EU citizens in accessing healthcare services while abroad constitute an obstacle to free movement."
"It is necessary to define more clearly the ambiguous regulations on reimbursements for medical services, as European citizens are finding the present-day provisions and rulings of the European Court of Justice unclear and difficult to understand."
"It might benefit patients if a database were to be set up with information on healthcare service providers in the other Member States."
"It would definitely improve the situation for patients, and would possibly eliminate long waiting lists for some services."
"The mass media are also in a position to contribute to improving the health status of the population."
"It would be a good idea to replace various ‘reality shows’ with programmes that use an attractive format to highlight nutrition-related issues, the neglect of which may ultimately contribute to the onset of obesity, cardiovascular disease and cancer."
"Encouraging the mass media to focus on healthcare issues is also important in terms of state security at the moment, because of the threat of possible attacks in the form of bioterrorism."
"In case of an epidemic, the public would be better informed about the basic strategies for containing the spread of disease."
"It is necessary to focus more and allocate larger budgets to healthcare, as we know that it will be impossible to attain the Lisbon Strategy goals without having a healthy population."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Mr Trakatellis for the excellent cooperation and his excellent report."
"The three common core EU policy objectives in the fields of health and consumer protection are clearly brought out: to protect the public from risks and hazards over which the individual has no control and which cannot be effectively or completely dealt with by individual Member States."
"The focus is quite clear."
"Strengthening people’s ability to make decisions affecting their health – in this connection, a Commission initiative aimed at reducing the restrictions in the pharmaceutical industry’s information policy is also commendable."
"Thirdly, the incorporation of health policy into the other areas of Community policy."
"In the field of health, this report introduces three new core subjects that relate to the new challenges of our time: the response to threats – taking as an example the epidemics that are at present very much in our minds with bird flu."
"Secondly, the prevention of diseases and patterns of behaviour – citing here only smoking, obesity, addictions and lack of exercise as examples."
"Thirdly, the necessary cooperation between national health authorities, where there is surely still room for improvement at many levels."
"I see no undermining of subsidiarity here, but on the contrary greater cooperation, effects of synergy and a strengthening of subsidiarity."
"I believe the separation into consumer protection and health protection to be important and correct, since they are two fields of policy with different bases in law, which means they also entail different EU powers within the Community."
"Personally, I find all that we are wanting to do with 1.5 billion in seven years astonishing."
"I hope that a lot of it will be achieved."
"Let us only bear in mind that statutory social insurance has a turnover of EUR 180 billion a year in the Federal Republic of Germany alone."
"I support Amendment 64 on expanding the financial framework."
"I believe it is the minimum if we are to do any meaningful work at all."
"Compared to what the Community spends in seven years on subsidising the cultivation of tobacco, this amount is still vanishingly small."
"It amounts to only about one fifth of tobacco subsidies."
"We certainly cannot satisfy every desire of Europe’s citizens and institutions in a framework programme."
"We have tried to be as fair and balanced as possible."
"I see this as a great opportunity to take Europe a bit further into the midst of the citizens again through joint public relations work."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to extend warm congratulations to Mr Trakatellis."
"His expertise on health is a considerable asset to our debate."
"Health is an important political topic, but is, first and foremost, a national concern."
"It is justified that Europe should devote attention to health, but Europe should only stir into action if there is a clearly added value to be had."
"Nevertheless, Commissioner, I expect a great deal from your policy."
"First of all, I hope that you will actively encourage your fellow-Commissioners to adopt healthy policies."
"Have a look at agricultural subsidies through the eyes of health."
"Should we really continue to subsidise fat, sugar and tobacco?"
"I would prefer us to opt in favour of vegetables and fruit."
"Alternatively, Commissioner, I invite you to plant yourself in the middle of the scrap between DG Industry and DG Environment on air quality, chemicals and plead strongly in favour of health."
"This will not cost any money and is one of the biggest favours you can do the European citizens."
"Secondly, I would urge you to engage in the battle against inequality, and I would echo what Mrs Belohorská said in this connection."
"Access to adequate treatment for the citizens of Europe is very lopsided."
"Cancer patients have considerably higher chances of survival in some countries than in others."
"Methods of treatment differ, access to health is unequal."
"The patients’ knowledge of their diseases differs in each country."
"Prevention does not have the attention it deserves in all countries."
"I would invite the Commissioner to pool knowledge."
"Member States, hospitals, patient associations and treatment providers can all learn from each other."
"Combine prevention and treatment."
"I would urge you, above all, not to collate statistics on the general health situation, but rather collect very practical information on the most important diseases, including cancer, rheumatism, diabetes, lung disorders and naturally heart and vascular diseases, and then assess where improvements can be made."
"You may be able to set up knowledge centres and networks that can be a valuable source of information for the treatment provider and patient alike."
"In that way, the European Union can make a worthwhile contribution."
"I would finally like to urge you all to sign Declaration No. 1, which is about diabetes, and has been tabled by various Members of this House."
"We already have 260 signatures, and we need 80 more, so please let us have yours."
"Mr President, Commissioner, health and consumer protection are two fields − as is shown repeatedly by each successive Eurobarometer − for which the people demand more of Europe, and therefore I must thank our two rapporteurs, Mr Trakatellis and, for this afternoon, Mrs Thyssen, who had the good sense to propose to us the splitting of the two programmes."
"Having made this opening remark, I should like to join all those who are with Mr Trakatellis, with you, Commissioner, and with a number of others, who have expressed their support for an ambitious Health programme, even though, as we well know, we will not obtain the billion and a half euros we asked for, and will not reach that very symbolic threshold of the percentage of the European budget."
"Ultimately, then, we shall have to make cuts, painful sacrifices."
"That is why I believe it is important to concentrate our efforts on the five to seven diseases that are the main causes of mortality in Europe."
"We must, therefore, take into account what the WHO tells us and support Amendment 142, proposed by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and not be afraid to specify certain diseases and work twice as hard at the prevention, for example, of cardio-vascular diseases and various cancers, because being ambitious does not mean trying to do too many things at once."
"Our citizens want Europe to be effective and transparent."
"We must not fail them by spreading resources too thinly."
"They are asking us also to be responsive and to reassure them, especially today."
"It would not be right, therefore, to leave the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Stockholm without a decent budget."
"Let us remember, after all, that it was launched in 2005 following the lightning spread of SARS two years ago."
"It is therefore very much in our interest to see the ECDC fulfil its purpose now that avian influenza has arrived in our continent."
"So, in conclusion, Commissioner, I have a question for you and, likewise, for the Council."
"How are you going to fund the health and environment action plan and reconcile it with this new public health programme?"
"Europe must, we know, equip itself with the means of combating environmental pollution, which affects the most vulnerable among us, pregnant women and children."
"Protecting the very youngest among us is also the way to give every chance to the Europe of tomorrow."
"Mr President, I should like to thank both Mr Trakatellis and Mr Kyprianou, who have done a sterling job."
"We are, however, in an absurd situation in which we spend five times more money on tobacco subsidies than on promoting public health, that is to say five times more money on ruining people’s health than on improving it."
"What I like is the fact that this report focuses on preventive work."
"Resources are so limited that they are only sufficient for the purposes of cooperation, sharing good examples and disseminating information."
"However, it is at national level that the big money is to be found and where the bulk of the work will take place."
"What I think is good about the European Parliament’s changes is Amendment 53, the importance of which I want to emphasise."
"Since there is so little money, it should not go to organisations that lobby, openly or otherwise, on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry."
"It is good that there would be careful monitoring to ensure that that did not happen."
"We have not so far mentioned Amendments 92 and 144, which deal with gender equality."
"I think that this is an important aspect, which we must consider."
"Too large a portion of the available money goes to men and men’s health care and too little to women’s health care."
"However, it is in the relationship between public health and trade that Europe can make the biggest contribution in this area."
"The Treaty’s articles on public health are scarcely applied at all to trade policy."
"Where is the health dimension in alcohol policy?"
"The same applies to chemicals and pesticides."
"It is in these areas that the really big efforts must be made."
"Commissioner, you can make an initial contribution to bringing about that more comprehensive view by not approving the eight new pesticides that are coming on the scene and that are biopersistent, endocrine disruptive and class 2 carcinogenic – a wordy enumeration of the perfect reasons for banning chemicals."
"You can take the opportunity to do so now."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr Trakatellis on the report."
"It is important to reaffirm that health is a national competence."
"However, it is appropriate for the EU to encourage health-promoting lifestyles and at least require minimum health service standards in the various countries."
"That is especially so in a country like mine, Ireland, which has the strongest economy in Europe while its health service is inadequate and people are put at risk because they cannot get the basic health services they need."
"Diabetes is a good example of a disease that is under-funded in my wealthy constituency."
"We have half a diabetic nurse post to cater for 250 people, when there should be one for 50 people in order to be effective."
"Other experiences in the Irish health system have informed my reading of this report."
"On human organs, tissue and blood, I will request an oral amendment to include the concept of traceability."
"Our hepatitis C scandals in Ireland illustrated the medical dangers of not being able to trace sources of contamination."
"In the Irish organ retention scandal, dead children were routinely stripped of organs without the knowledge or consent of their families, illustrating the ethical necessity of traceability to ensure that human products are obtained legitimately."
"To conclude, Europe has a role to play in promoting health."
"However, I do not think EU funds should be used to promote profit-making health industries; they have plenty of funds to promote themselves."
"– I warmly applaud the work that Mr Trakatellis, rapporteur and Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats member, has devoted to preparing this report, in which Parliament has had its say."
"The citizens and healthcare professionals also welcome the new action plan before us in this debate."
"Most importantly, according to the report, politicians and healthcare managers will work together to mark out the path for solving problems that cut across Member State borders."
"The report paves the way for a modern strategy, especially as regards the coordination of activities, but unfortunately, after the Council radically amended the EU budget, this is not accompanied by adequate funding from European sources."
"Much remains for the Union to do, and in particular those tasks that individual Member States are not capable of accomplishing themselves."
"This is not only a matter of combating serious infectious diseases that cut across borders, such as AIDS and influenza, but also of combating the spread of drug addiction and lifestyle diseases."
"The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control was set up for this very purpose, in conjunction with the national reference laboratories."
"Budget cuts are not good news and are indicative of shortcomings in the priorities of the EU’s political elite and of some MEPs."
"I should at this point like to highlight a further problem."
"Modern medicine provides people with a longer, higher-quality life, but this comes at an ever-higher cost – some 60 to 90% of the public purse."
"The higher the proportion of Community funding for healthcare services, the less responsibility individual citizens take for their health."
"It is also the case that the more the state regulates, the further the law reduces personal responsibility on the part of individuals."
"Evidence of this can be found in countries that experienced centrally run and completely regulated healthcare, in which decisions on patients’ health, prevention and treatment – and in turn on the cost of that treatment – were taken without the patient being involved."
"Although specific reforms have been made, they have brought about a less effective system and more expensive services; old ideas and habits die hard among patients, doctors and politicians."
"I should therefore like to say that programmes intended to help health service clients to be better informed, and to help system compatibility, should not under any circumstances be cut."
"These resources pay for themselves many times over."
"I have further qualms about the effectiveness of certain regulations – supposedly crucial to the protection of health and the environment – that we have foolishly adopted."
"I fear that sometimes the aim is to please certain industrial pressure groups and not enough money is spent on the citizens’ health."
"I therefore call on the Commission to devote a larger proportion of the budget to analysis based on empirical evidence."
"In this way, our decision-making on regulations can be more responsible, and we can become aware of the true impact on public health, the economic cost, and in turn, the impact on the European economy."
"For this reason I also support Amendment 64."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I should like, as other Members have done, to express my approval of the decision not to merge the health and consumer protection areas of the Community action plan within the field of health and consumer protection."
"Quite apart from the different nature of the European Union’s competences in these two fields, health policy cannot be regarded as a consumer good."
"Although I support the introduction of ‘e-Health’, this must not be used to provide a covert means of testing out an information policy."
"I thank Mr Trakatellis for proposing a considerable increase in the budget allocation for this programme, an increase that is necessary if we are to see our objectives and actions brought to a successful conclusion."
"More funding would have been preferable in view of the challenges to be faced, but we shall already have cause for a certain satisfaction if the Council agrees to increase the funding allocations for health within the context of the financial perspective for 2007–2013."
"I wish to emphasise two priorities."
"Firstly, we must improve cooperation and coordination in the field of health in order to respond more rapidly to cross-border health threats."
"Had that been the case, we should have been able now to avoid the extent of the spread of the chikungunya epidemic."
"This ought to prompt the European Union, the Member States and the pharmaceutical laboratories to establish a system for monitoring and for research into these kinds of disease, which may be rare in terms of world population but are catastrophic at a local level."
"My second priority is this: to achieve the objective of a better standard of health for all Europeans, we must take into account the impact of environmental and social living conditions on health."
"In order to treat certain illnesses better we have to address the causes."
"Everyone knows that people who are vulnerable and socially excluded are more prone than others to certain diseases."
"We have to help the weakest."
"If the Member States made rapid progress in these two areas, our people would feel a little more protected by the European Union."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr Trakatellis on his report, which was excellent as expected."
"An important aspect of the EU's health problem is protection against disease through prevention."
"The three main preventable curses affecting human health – tobacco, excessive alcohol and poor nutrition – are responsible for the premature deaths of millions of European citizens every year."
"Tobacco especially is thought to be implicated in the cause of death of one in every three smokers."
"Smoking kills far more people than drug addiction, road traffic accidents and HIV infection all put together."
"So, with tobacco being such a big killer, are we really doing enough to help our citizens get rid of this self-destructive habit?"
"I think not quite enough."
"First, we continue to subsidise tobacco growing in the EU."
"Surely this is unwise, as has been mentioned by many colleagues already."
"Second, we allow the ever-more powerful multinational tobacco manufacturers to lobby and influence important decision-making centres freely; they certainly freely lobby MEPs."
"Third, we lag behind in implementing an effective information strategy."
"For instance, we put scary warnings on cigarette packets which nobody takes any notice of any more, whereas the tobacco companies pay for movie star idols to smoke on screen."
"We have no structured anti-smoking teaching programmes in our schools."
"We build expensive hospital departments to treat patients suffering from serious diseases caused by smoking, and yet we tolerate many doctors working in such departments giving the worst possible example by smoking in public themselves."
"Many Member States pay for expensive departments for smoking-related diseases, but they do not pay for smokers to go on anti-smoking programmes before they become ill."
"Finally, many Member States still leave passive smokers at the mercy of smokers, be it at work or in places of entertainment."
"Now that we have a strongly anti-smoking Health Commissioner it is perhaps time to wage a truly full-scale war on the tobacco giants of death and be reasonably optimistic of winning."
"Mr President, let me start by saying that I agree with absolutely every word the last speaker said;"
"I shall not repeat it all, but well done! I should like to thank Mr Trakatellis for an excellent report and I also thank the Commissioner for being so honest with us here this morning and stating that this Community action plan on health already needs to be reviewed if it is to be effective, so that we can prioritise areas, because of – and I use his words – ‘the accounting muddle’."
"All I can say about that is that it is an embarrassment!"
"The EC Treaty states that ‘a high level of human health protection should be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Community policies’."
"This report is an important first step in making our citizens’ right to health protection, enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a reality."
"While health is a Member State competence, the European Community can add value and complement the activities of Member States through urgently needed coordination and collation of best practice models so that we can learn from each other and create centres of excellence."
"By mainstreaming health into all EU policies, by conducting extended health impact assessments and evaluations on all EU legislation and by promoting healthy lifestyles, the EU can provide the necessary platform for joined-up thinking across its Member States."
"According to the World Health Organisation, in 2000, for the first time in history, the number of overweight people in the world equalled those who were underweight – more than one billion overweight, 300 million of whom are obese – with the huge implications this has for morbidity."
"In this respect, it is imperative that we encourage a preventive approach and I welcome a number of recent Commission initiatives in this area."
"The broader behavioural, social and environmental factors that determine health can be optimally addressed at Community level through a holistic, as opposed to fragmented, approach."
"Complementary and alternative medicines, where scientifically substantiated, must be included in any Community action programme in the field of health."
"The European Community is optimally positioned to combat transnational health problems, such as the threat posed by epidemics of infectious diseases and food-related incidences."
"BSE, SARS and the recent avian influenza concerns have all, to our cost, underlined the imperative of having proactive, pre-emptive coordinated action in the area of health."
"The proliferation of EU agencies in the field of health – the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the European Food Safety Authority and others – is a very welcome and necessary development in tackling these health threats."
"However, these bodies cannot function without a clear Community-level policy and the necessary designated financial resources to underpin them."
"If the money is not secured in the budget and a preventive approach cannot be taken, the consequences, financial and otherwise, may be much greater."
"Less money from an EU of 25 than from an EU of 15 is not acceptable and is, frankly, irresponsible."
"Could the Commissioner tell us where our health services directive is and when we will have a draft proposal?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to sincerely thank Mr Trakatellis for his excellent report."
"It is in fact very difficult to do the greatest possible justice to all legitimate interests here while at the same time remaining cogent."
"I therefore regret, for example, that cancer is no longer explicitly mentioned as a priority in the new health action programme."
"You are more than right, however, Mr Trakatellis, to point out in your report that there must of course also be sufficient resources for all the objectives we have set ourselves."
"At present we are a long way from that, however, not to mention the fact that we shall today be rejecting the Commission proposal for a joint action programme for health and consumer protection as totally unacceptable."
"In health policy, too, the public wants more protection from Europe, not less."
"Health policy takes fourth place among the European policy priorities you mention."
"That itself makes it a matter of urgency that health should be given its own action programme again."
"I cannot understand how even the Commission could propose such a low budget allocation or how the Council could cut it still further."
"We are therefore trying to remedy two cardinal errors here today."
"We want two separate programmes, and we want more money."
"I am saying that primarily to the Council."
"If the further reduction you want were to become reality, it would mean we only had one third of the previous funding for what will be 27 states."
"That would mean, however, that we would be completely unable to provide primary and secondary prevention of certain diseases or the urgently necessary protection against the risks of disease occasioned by globalisation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should, of course, like to start by congratulating Mr Trakatellis not only on his sterling report, but, above all, on the way in which he always had time for all Members, who were keen that their concerns should eventually be reflected in the report."
"It is a very important report, because it formulates the Community action programmes in terms of public health for the next six years, which cannot be fleshed out by the individual Member States."
"I think it is safe to say that the rapporteur has successfully managed to combine all relevant and specific aspects in such a vast, and at the same time sensitive, area as public health."
"I am particularly delighted that for the first time, it is possible to include complementary and alternative medicine in the actions, as a result of which the public can make more informed and responsible choices in connection with their own health."
"I am all too aware that alternative methods of medicine are all too often greeted with jeers, but the many people who derive benefit from them claim otherwise, of course."
"Nevertheless, the Commission has quoted a figure according to which no less than 30% of the population and some hundreds of thousands of doctors and therapists demand these alternative methods."
"Better knowledge of complementary medicine will be a major step forward for public health, and so I wholeheartedly endorse the tackling of the problem of the shortage of organs on an EU-wide scale."
"Both the setting up of common platforms for donors and recipients, and the development of activities to improve safety and the quality of organs can help in this throughout the EU."
"As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I should, above all, like to stress that health is affected by environmental factors."
"All too often, people remain oblivious, for example, to the impact of exposure to certain toxic substances."
"Providing clear information, backed by scientific research, could go a long way in preventing much suffering and also avoid misunderstandings."
"The action programme provides specific measures in the area of prevention, detection and raising awareness as well as in terms of information about serious diseases."
"As a member of MAC, ‘MEPs against Cancer’, recently set up at the heart of Parliament, I can do no other than applaud these concrete steps."
"There is one thing, however, that I, like many other Members, find hard to digest."
"For as long as no agreement is reached about the financial perspectives for the next period, discussion of this action programme will remain merely academic."
"Even so, the need is considerable, the ambitions even more so, and Parliament will therefore need, in the next few months, to ensure that the necessary funds are actually made available."
"– Mr President, even though healthcare services fall within the competence of the Member States, the European Union should make the best possible use of its opportunities to supplement actions taken at national level in the interests of the entire Community."
"It is for this reason intolerable that in future years the EU budget will cut spending in areas that affect the quality of life of its inhabitants, including in particular healthcare."
"The European Union can and must contribute towards protecting the health and safety of its citizens, particularly since the recent enlargement has increased the imbalance between Member States as regards healthcare."
"The marked disparities in citizens’ average life expectancy, health and access to healthcare are closely related to the level of development of individual Member States."
"New healthcare programmes with an overall aim of improving the health of citizens and ensuring prevention in the broad sense of the word ought to level out these imbalances."
"High standards of healthcare should be the aim of all EU politicians."
"Efforts should now in particular be taken to reduce inequality of access to and quality of healthcare in Member States by introducing comparable standards and securing greater transparency of national healthcare systems."
"The new programme could prove particularly helpful in the case of cross-border public health threats, as it would make it possible to implement common strategies and actions to protect health and safety and to eliminate any threats, and to promote healthcare-related economic interests of citizens and reduce the cost of healthcare to citizens."
"Better information exchange on available medical services and the opportunity for having costs reimbursed on the territory of the European Union will also lead to the promotion of patient and healthcare specialist mobility, as the author of this very important report, Mr Trakatellis, correctly pointed out."
"– Mr President, I have expressed quite a few views on the Commission’s health programme and kicked up a bit of a fuss. I do think, however, that it is really commendable, and I therefore wish to thank not only Mr Kyprianou but also Mr Trakatellis."
"It has been self-evident to me that health is primarily an issue for the Member States, and I am delighted that the majority in this Chamber are of the same view."
"What we do at EU level needs to provide clear added value to patients."
"There are three aspects of this subject that I have been involved in and fought for and that I particularly want to emphasise today."
"First of all, there is the point of departure for this report, which is, and always must be, that the individual’s own commitment to his or her own health is what is most important."
"Where health care and work in the public health field are concerned, we politicians must always regard people, even if they happen to be ill, as adults with rights and duties, including the right to control their own lives and health care."
"We must never forget that active involvement in our own health is always the best medicine."
"That is precisely what is so unfortunate about the fact that the Social Democrats wish to remove the wordings designed to promote just such active involvement in our own health."
"As Members of the European Parliament, we must also facilitate movement within and between countries so that everyone can seek the treatment and care they themselves most believe in."
"At present, those who enjoy least freedom of movement in the EU are those who need it most, that is to say the patients."
"For them, Europe’s borders become little Berlin Walls standing in the way of their ability to obtain treatment."
"For them, freedom of movement may be a matter of life or death."
"We must not believe that the most important aspects of the good society can be regulated and organised using the planned economy, which has so clearly proved to be the economic model most destructive of creativity and sound housekeeping."
"We must have more freedom of choice and of movement."
"We must also make efforts to ensure that we as decision-makers, together with those who implement the decisions and, in particular, those who use health services obtain better access to information from those services."
"We must be able to compare results and not only, as at present, costs."
"These developments are needed not only so that we might learn from each other but also so that users might take advantage of the freedom of movement and of choice given to them by the European Court of Justice."
"These developments would be to the advantage of European patients."
"Up until about the time of the Second World War, people coming into contact with health services were victims."
"More often than not, they were healthier before the doctor was called than after."
"Through the development of treatment methods and the advent of drugs, we have become patients in our health care systems."
"I am, however, convinced that, within the not too distant future, we shall be health care consumers, and that is a shift in perspective that we must help bring about: victims yesterday, patients today and health care consumers tomorrow."
"That would be a fantastic development that I believe would make us not only healthier but also freer."
"– I also wish to join my colleagues in thanking Mr Trakatellis for the excellent piece of work we have before us today."
"It is every government’s priority to establish a health system, for the health sector is of relevance to everybody without exception."
"It is a sector without frontiers, and one that is at the heart of every country."
"The Charter of Fundamental Human Rights sets all this out and emphasises that the European Union should give the health sector the necessary attention and priority."
"The European Union is duty-bound to intervene by establishing objectives for improving the public health system, helping prevent contagious diseases and trying to eliminate every risk that might endanger the health of the Community."
"It is therefore very important that we look at the Community action programme in the field of health in an objective and distinctive way that focuses exclusively on this particular sector."
"We cannot agree to have just one programme serving two different sectors, however these may be related to each other."
"Otherwise, what is essential might, I am afraid, be lost, and more harm than good might be done."
"What I am saying applies also to the consumer protection programme, which is in itself a complex subject to which separate attention needs to be given."
"We want to see a programme that, on the one hand, brings the health systems of the various countries closer together and, on the other hand, helps every country achieve its own individual aims."
"I cannot neglect also to mention the particular importance that needs to be given to cases of persons suffering from chronic diseases or from disabilities."
"We have to make sure that they are not marginalised and, over and above that, that they also enjoy a high standard of living."
"Those with difficulties should have the opportunity to benefit from assistance that makes their lives easier, as well as from research programmes to improve the conditions under which they live."
"We should also bear in mind the important role played by those who take care of people with difficulties, and we should have programmes whereby those who provide care are given the necessary training to carry out their duties more efficiently."
"We have a programme that will be an important tool enabling patients to benefit from the best treatment and medicines."
"We have a programme that will educate Europeans and help them make better choices in the interests of their health."
"This programme will help reduce the imbalances in health care that exist from one EU country to another, so that every country enjoys a higher level of services."
"Yes, we have a challenge before us, a challenge that must lead to our achieving effective prevention, a more efficient health service and a better quality of life."
"Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Trakatellis for his excellent and thorough work."
"Health is our most important asset, and therefore it is good that the European Union, too, addresses this issue."
"I agree with the words of Mr Fjellner, and as an MEP from a new Member State, I am pleased that the areas of health protection and consumer protection have been separated, as in our country, these two areas face entirely different problems."
"A long life is not sufficient; it is equally important that we stay healthy for as long as possible."
"Therefore, I consider it particularly positive that the programme focuses on extending the healthy life expectancy of citizens, because enjoying good health for as long as possible is crucial to the welfare of European citizens."
"In light of the demographic challenges we currently face, this also has a great significance for the sustainability of social care systems."
"This is a particularly important task in Hungary, where healthy life expectancy is ten years shorter than in the older Member States of the European Union."
"Therefore, the new programme must include special efforts to reduce the differences between the health levels of European Union citizens."
"Our most important task is to ensure prevention, which is also a priority of this programme."
"This was the reason why I suggested in my amendment proposal that the programme should focus on the health of children and young people, because a healthy lifestyle adopted early in life is decisive in the prevention of problems that may occur later."
"Finally, I would like to call attention to the fact that every cent we spend on improving the health of our citizens will bring a multiple return."
"We could hardly find a more profitable investment for the money of European taxpayers than health."
"Therefore, I hope that the appropriate financial resources required for the successful implementation of the programme tabled before us will also be available."
"Once more, I would like to say thank you, on behalf of all of us, to Mr Trakatellis for his thorough work, and I do hope that everything contained in this programme will be implemented."
"Mr President, I would like to add my thanks to those already expressed to Mr Trakatellis, he has really worked very hard."
"I would also like to express my thanks to the Commissioner, however, because the Commission is also working very hard, especially in the closely related field of bird flu."
"Health is certainly the field of greatest interest to us all and of course also to our citizens."
"We do of course find that life expectancy has risen tremendously over the years."
"There are figures to show that life expectancy has been increasing steadily by two and a half years per decade since 1840."
"That of course also brings new challenges for our health and social systems."
"It means that while we are living longer, we also need to ensure – especially from the political and medical side – that the expectancy of a healthy life becomes longer and that people do not only get older but also healthier."
"We are faced with new challenges."
"Some of them have already been mentioned, such as bird flu, which could mutate into a pandemic and present Europe with problems such as it has not experienced before."
"We need to be well prepared for this if we are to be able to take the right action in good time."
"I would also like to point out that problems surrounding Aids, cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease must remain on the agenda because they still represent major risks for our citizens."
"We must also be clear that the Member States are of course basically responsible for health."
"We on the European side need to think, however, where we can actually contribute this much vaunted European added value, where we can do something from Europe that will help our citizens to live longer healthy lives."
"This cross-border factor is certainly one area. Diseases do not stop at borders."
"Knowledge is certainly another factor. I would like to mention another figure here."
"Medical knowledge in particular has increased tremendously, and it does of course entail costs."
"If we were to take the level of knowledge of Bismarck’s day and apply it to our own, then only 1% of our health budgets would be taken up."
"The remaining 99% relates to knowledge that was gained later."
"That also means, of course, that health costs money."
"I therefore back the rapporteur’s call for EUR 1.5 billion from the European Union very strongly."
"We cannot adopt lavish health programmes and not make the necessary money available."
"Another point is the whole area of provision."
"As I have already said, people are getting older."
"That also means that healthy lifestyles and provision will increase. More importantly, a lot of research needs to be done here in order to put our health budgets on a sound footing in the long term."
"Over all, we are on the right road, but we must not close our eyes to the challenges that lie ahead."
". Mr President, I should like to thank the Members for a very interesting debate."
"I will make a few brief comments."
"First of all, on the issue of the agencies, I totally agree that both the ECDC and EISS are very important policies, but they should not be at the cost of the other health policies."
"Unless we have increased financing, we will be faced with the impossible choice of either funding fully the two agencies and doing absolutely nothing else, or splitting the money, which I am not sure would be of benefit either."
"That is an important issue."
"With regard to funding, I should like to thank the Members for their support."
"Given the way that we work in the Union in the area of health, which involves mostly non-legislative initiatives, more money is required."
"When you legislate, it is much easier to send the proposals that have been adopted and expect Member States to implement them."
"But when you want to take other initiatives of coordination, of recommendations, or of exchange of best practices, then you need more money."
"I agree that we will not expand into the competence of the Member States."
"We will emphasise and target areas where we can have European added value by taking action at European level."
"That is in fact what the programme is doing."
"Health services fall within the competence of Member States."
"There is no question about that."
"But in a Union of solidarity, I do not believe we can accept the health inequalities that exist today in the European Union, where we have a life expectancy variation of more than ten years from one Member State to the other."
"Patient mobility is an important issue."
"It is a reality that we have to deal with."
"We will produce proposals in that respect."
"But the target should be that patients be offered a high level of treatment where they live, where their families are, where they speak the language."
"That can be achieved through programmes of centres of reference, exchange of best practices, coordinating Member States, coordinating healthcare systems and working together and achieving the highest level of service."
"I repeat: that would not interfere with the issues of competence and subsidiarity."
"We are working not only with ‘blockbusting’ medicine; on the contrary, I would like to remind you that there is provision in the programme for rare diseases, which is also followed by orphan drugs."
"We are promoting that area as well."
"As regards tobacco, I could not agree more, and I would be very happy if we ever have the opportunity to have a specific debate on the tobacco area."
"The issue of subsidies is correct, but I would also like to add that subsidies will eventually be phased out and that is a decision which has already been taken, but the tobacco fund that we financed in European-level campaigns gets money through those subsidies."
"Once the subsidies finish, we will have no more money left for Europe-wide campaigns on tobacco, so that, again, is an impossible situation and I hope we come up with a solution in the near future."
"As regards alcohol, I would like to remind you that by the end of this year, or some time after the summer, we will produce the Community strategy proposal for a European strategy on alcohol."
"I have noted the comments made about pesticides."
"On financing, I would like to address Mrs Doyle: I raise an accounting error – or, at least, I hope it is an accounting error – because I cannot really believe that it was intentionally decided to reduce the funding of health and consumer protection."
"I hope in the overall arrangement that somebody noticed the impact that compromise would have on those two specific areas, which means it can be corrected."
"If it was intentional, then I very much regret that and I cannot say much more than that."
"On the issue of complementary medicine, I have noted the comments made."
"We feel that this is more of an area of subsidiarity."
"The Commission proposal does not deal with specific medicine as such."
"Regarding environment and health – I am addressing Mrs Ries – we already have measures under the current programme and they will continue under a new programme especially as regards environmental determinants on health."
"Coming to the various diseases, I can assure you that cancer is our priority among other diseases, but we have included a new strand which provides for the reduction of disease burden, but we believed that in a seven-year programme we needed more flexibility, so we do not list specific diseases; however, that can be done through different decisions that can be taken in the course of the programme."
"By listing some diseases, you effectively exclude others, so we wanted a more flexible approach on this."
"I would also like to remind the Members that I will be bringing forward a proposal on the health strategy, which will be more detailed and will elaborate on the programme based on the funding that we will eventually obtain; so there will be a fully-fledged, broader strategy and that will be done together with the stakeholders and citizens."
"In conclusion, I would like once again to thank Mr Trakatellis for the excellent job he has done, as well as the members of the committee."
"I thank you again for your support in this very important policy area."
"The debate is closed."
"We all thank Mr Trakatellis, once again, for his excellent work."
"The vote will take place today at voting time."
"The Commission can accept Amendments 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 17, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 30, 34, 35, 36, 44, 51, 55, 59, 60, 61, 65, 66, 69, 70, 72, 78, 80, 84, 85, 86, 88, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 106, 108, 111, 113, 119, 120, 122, 123, 124, 126, 132, 135, 139, ."

"The Commission cannot accept Amendments 5, 33, 47, 54, 58, 64, 68, 82, 83, 89, 95, 96, 98, 104, 105, 112, 128, 130, ."
"The Commission rejects mainly on grounds of split or resources Amendments 1, 2, 3, 15, 18, 19, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 48, 49, 52, 53, 62, 74, 75, 76, 77, 87, 92, 93, 94, 97, 107, 109, 114, 117, 121, 125, 127, 129, 131, 133, 134, 136, 138, 140 and ."
"(Amendments underlined are new amendments tabled by political groups on 8 March 2005.)"
"The next item is the report (A6-0032/2006) by Mrs Thyssen, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a programme of Community action in the field of health and consumer protection (2007–2013 – consumer aspects (COM(2005) 0115 – C6-0225/2005 – 2005/0042B(COD))."
"Before handing over to the Commissioner, you may be aware, ladies and gentlemen, that we have only about 20 minutes left for the debate before Voting time."
"You will realise that, under these circumstances, we shall not be able to finish the debate."
"I prefer to tell you that straight away. I shall be obliged to suspend the debate."
". Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Thyssen, and the Members of Parliament and the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for their excellent and close cooperation and the support they have expressed for the consumer programme."
"I would like to apologise in advance for repeating some things I have already said regarding the health part of the programme."
"However, given that we are having separate debates, it is important to make some statements again in relation to the consumer programme."
"The problem of the budget is again a similar one: a reduced budget means reduced policies and, again, it means less money for the Union of 27 – 25 plus 2 – than we had for the 15."
"In the age of consumer protection, where we have to take strong initiatives, especially in the new Member States and the acceding Member States, this will cause serious problems and will of course affect the assistance we offer to consumer organisations, especially as regards funding of projects and training of staff."
"On the same issue, I would like to remind you again of the letter sent by President Barroso to President Borrell raising these concerns, explaining that if the compromise stays in place it would mean less money than we had in 2006 and asking for additional efforts in this area."
"Again, as in the health area, if eventually we are left with such a major cut or reduction in our funding, it will mean that we cannot spread it thinly over many actions."
"Limited funds mean we have to re-evaluate and prioritise and decide where we actually want to concentrate, where we can achieve the greatest benefit."
"I hope that this can be corrected, that eventually the funding will be provided and that we will be able to cover the programme as it was proposed."
"On splitting the programmes, I have to repeat that I fully understand the position of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection in this respect."
"I understand why it would prefer to have two separate programmes."
"As I said earlier, we believe that there would be some added value if we adhered to a merged programme, where we clearly distinguish between actions in health and in consumer protection; but we can benefit from having common areas and achieve better economies of scale."
"Nevertheless, given that the financial perspectives negotiations are still ongoing, this would and will affect the Commission’s position on the splitting of the programme."
"At this point, therefore, we cannot take a final decision regarding splitting and have to reject the amendments relating to splitting."
"On the conclusion of the debate on the financial perspectives, the Commission will review this issue again."
"I repeat that Parliament has made its wishes very clear and I have taken note of the very strong – almost unanimous – position of Parliament."
"I shall not comment on the amendments separately."
"A full list of the Commission’s position on each of the amendments is being made available to Parliament and I should be obliged if it could be included in the Verbatim Report of this sitting(1)."
"The amendments we are rejecting relate mostly to the splitting, and we are doing so either for the reason I explained earlier or because they go beyond the scope of Community consumer policy."
"It is not that we disagree with the substance of these proposals, but that we feel they go a bit further than the scope of Community consumer policy and – given the existing situation – we would not be able to finance some of them."
"We agree on the other issues, especially as regards the need to integrate consumer interests into other policies."
"I count on Parliament’s support to ensure that consumer interests are given proper attention in many other key consumer policy initiatives."
"That is a brief overview of the Commission’s position on this issue."
"I look forward to a very interesting debate."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I should like to confirm explicitly what was, in actual fact, already obvious from the previous debate."
"The Committee is opposed to an integrated public health and consumer protection programme, and with the backing of the Conference of Presidents, we are asking for a separate multi-annual programme for consumer protection."
"Since the Commissioner does not strike me as entirely convinced, here are the reasons again in a nutshell."
"The Community competences in each of these two areas are too dissimilar from one another."
"This is also true of the social objectives of the civil-society organisations involved; internal distribution of competences, also in the Member States, is often at odds with an integrated approach."
"A patient is slightly different from a consumer and at the very least, we would like certainty in relation to the proportion of the budget that is available for consumer affairs and we want to prevent a situation, when we are faced with a public health crisis, where consumer policy would be the budgetary victim of an urgent public health need which should normally be resolved by means of a flexibility instrument."
"If the truth be known, I feel, given the lack of financial perspectives, a little uneasy talking about this report today, because we have no idea as to the level of budget."
"At the same time, I am acutely aware that the extent of the budget and the fleshing out of the programme in terms of content are two sides of the same coin."
"It is difficult, though, to restrain our ambitions in the area of consumer policy."
"For years, all European institutions have used Community consumer policy to illustrate that Europe is very much concerned about the care of normal people."
"In times of enlargement, when the need to give the internal market a consumer dimension is greater than ever, when we also need to let the European Union keep its human face, in times like these, we cannot curb the ambitions in the area of consumer protection without this having any repercussions."
"Since the three institutions are present today – and I assume that the Austrian Presidency is adequately represented – it is for that reason alone that I consider it useful today to argue in favour of keeping the budget as specified in the Commission proposal."
"I think we should really stick to it."
"In consultation with Mr Trakatellis of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we have carefully carved up the budget according to the scale of apportionment used by the Commission."
"Accordingly, for consumer protection, we arrive at a sum of EUR 233 million spread over seven years."
"In agreement with our financial perspectives negotiator, Mr Böge, we did not add anything in IMCO, but let us not misunderstand each other: this does not mean in any way that we will be satisfied with less at a later stage."
"The three budgetary authorities are asked to take this message literally."
"We are not satisfied with less, given the importance of the subject matter, the increased sphere of action resulting from enlargement, and the consumer’s vital confidence in the internal market."
"I should like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, because they are right behind us on this, and also because we managed to confine ourselves to two major additional areas of concern at the Commission’s proposal which, incidentally, the Commissioner did an extremely good job of explaining."
"1. We want the proramming procedure to be more open to involving the Member States that do not have a long tradition of consumer protection, consumer movement, the capacity development of consumer associations and their participation in policy preparation."
"2. Special attention should go to the phenomenon of ageing among the population and also to other vulnerable consumer groups."
"People knowledgeable in the area of consumer law know that we cannot adequately provide for these vulnerable groups in legislation, which, by definition, has a general scope, but in a consumer programme, we can focus on target groups and we can accommodate this vulnerable consumer, and that is what we must do if we want to move towards a warm and human society."
"This is the first report of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection in more than ten years in which its late chairman, Mr Whitehead, has not taken the floor."
"We still miss him, and years of warm and friendly cooperation with him have led me to dedicate this report to him."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I ask your support for all of this, I also ask the Commission and the Council to support our proposal."
"I thank you for the cooperation, I thank you for your respect for Mr Whitehead, for we owe this to him, and I am also indebted to the people of the Committee’s Secretariat who have plotted the course of this dossier very professionally."
"Mr President, allow me say a few words by way of conclusion."
"It is unlikely that all Members will have a chance to talk before lunch; as such, we will need to reach an agreement on the vote, because this is not a codecision report."
"If not everyone speaks before lunch, I would suggest moving the vote to next week’s part-session in Brussels, for I think that we cannot let coincidences determine the outcome of this, and that we cannot vote on a topic of this kind with a very small number of people present."
"That is my suggestion as rapporteur."
"Mrs Thyssen, your request for a postponement of the vote will be put to the House in a moment, right at the beginning of the voting session, by the Vice-President who takes my place."
"Mr President, I want to mention the very situation that Mrs Thyssen has rightly raised."
"Yesterday we complained – and rightly so – that people were taking the floor and Commissioners were being called on to speak while Members were still coming in and no one could really hear them."
"Now we have the very same situation again."
"If this House is unable either to organise debates so that they keep to time or else that some time is actually left between the vote and the end of the debate, then we really should think about other ways of doing things."
"On one point, at any rate, I fully support Mrs Thyssen’s suggestion: the vote should be postponed to a time when Members can actually be here."
"I quite understand, Mr Rack, but I must point out that it is at the request of the rapporteur herself, who, as I understand it, cannot be here this afternoon, that we have decided to begin the debate on this report this morning."
"We shall now hear from the draftsmen."
"Mr President, as well as their health, which we have just debated, the 460 million Europeans want us to give better and better protection to them as consumers."
"In the context of past and present health crises, or in that of globalisation, which no longer guarantees the traceability of all products, European consumer protection policy, therefore, takes on its full meaning."
"The internal market cannot indeed function properly without the confidence of consumers."
"By demonstrating to Europeans that it is genuinely concerned for their health and safety and that it is really equipping itself with the means to take action, the European Union can improve political clarity for them."
"I should like to thank Mrs Thyssen for the quality of her report."
"The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) has proposed a budget of EUR 233 million spread over seven years specifically for the ‘consumer protection’ action; this budget, which is an increase by comparison with the current programme, is essential if the objectives are to be achieved, ambitious as they are given the new obligations that enlargement entails."
"Let us hope that these actions will not be affected by drastic cuts in the event of a minimum financial perspective because what European consumers need is a budget that is able to deliver on the policies that they expect in response to their anxieties."
"This would not be possible if the European Union is on a starvation diet!"
"I deplore, however, the fact that the amendments on information and the fight against counterfeiting adopted in the Committee on Budgets were not taken up by the IMCO Committee."
"From the economic viewpoint, however, counterfeiting is a veritable curse as much for health as for consumers."
"It affects the major brand names, SMEs and all areas of economic and human activity: adulterated medicines, defective household appliances, substandard spare parts, dangerous toys, toxic cosmetics, to give but a few examples."
"I feel it is important within the scope of a policy for consumer protection to give better information to the potential clients of counterfeiters about the risks involved."
"That is why, even if the fight against counterfeiting is included in other actions of this programme, I must insist once again on this aspect of consumer protection."
". – I would like to congratulate Mrs Thyssen for preparing a splendid analysis of the European Commission's document."
"We must also celebrate the fact that the leaders of the European Parliament have decided to separate the consumer rights protection document from the health protection document."
"Had this not been done, consumer protection would continue to be overshadowed by health protection."
"However, the separation of the document still does not mean the actual separation of these problems."
"If control of these two systems is not divided, both of these areas will be run by the same agency."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs believes that to improve consumer rights protection it is essential to integrate consumer protection into civil law."
"Meanwhile, the Commission's Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection must cooperate closely with the Directorate-General for Justice and the Directorate-General for the Internal Market, as consumer protection is also partly the responsibility of these directorates-general."
"It is perfectly clear that with the expansion of the internal market it becomes practically impossible for an individual state to implement consumer rights protection without cooperating closely with other EU Member States."
"Therefore, the EU Consumer Rights Protection Agency must also cooperate closely with national agencies, especially public bodies, as they hold all the information on consumer rights violations."
"We must recognise that the most vulnerable consumers are children and the elderly, as they are unable to defend their rights effectively."
"Agencies must pay particular attention to these categories of people."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has submitted amendments, which consolidate the aforementioned propositions."
"I urge everyone to endorse Mrs Thyssen's report together with the amendments proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, I have a little problem that I will explain to you very briefly."
"We have just listened to the draftsmen of the different Committees responsible."
"I am supposed to stop the debate at this stage before the block of speakers giving their opinions on behalf of the political groups."
"However, the speaker for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Stubb, cannot be here this afternoon and has asked if he may speak now."
"His speaking time is three minutes."
"For the sake of fairness, I must ask the others speaking on behalf of the groups, that is, Mrs Patrie, for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mrs Malmström, for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mrs Svensson, for the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, Mr Batten, for the Independence and Democracy Group, Mr Kristovskis, for the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, and Mr Mölzer as a Non-attached Member, if they agree to allow Mr Stubb to speak this morning."
"If a single one of the Members I have just named objects, then I cannot allow Mr Stubb to speak."
"On the other hand, if there is no objection, Mr Stubb will speak for three minutes."
"Does any one of the six Members I have just named object to Mr Stubb speaking now?"
"Nobody objects, and I thank them all for that."
"Mr Stubb, therefore, will be the last speaker this morning in this debate, which will resume at 3 p.m."
"Mr President, there is an old Swahili saying: ‘Never stand between a river and a hippopotamus’."
"I should like to thank Mrs Thyssen for an excellent report."
"On behalf of my group and myself, I support each and every line."
"I should like to make three points."
"Firstly, I do not believe that we need a separate consumer programme for new Member States."
"We are one big family."
"Let us stick to that basic line."
"Secondly, we must improve cooperation, but we do not need a new agency to do that, so I would call upon the Commission not to create another agency."
"Thirdly, let us try to activate the consumers and remember that the money we are allocating for consumer policy is really not that much: EUR 40 million per year, which is 0.03% of the total budget."
"I should again like to congratulate Mrs Thyssen on her excellent work."
"Thank you for allowing the hippopotamus to get back to the river!"
"The debate on Mrs Thyssen’s report is suspended."
"It will resume at 3 p.m. this afternoon."
"The Commission can accept Amendments 13, 26, 28, 34, 35, 42, 43, 44, 47, 48 and 54."
"Amendments 10, 41 and 50 can be accepted in part."
"The Commission rejects Amendments 14, 17, 36, 37, 38, 39, 49, ."
"The Commission rejects on grounds of split Amendments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 15, 18, 19, 20, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 40, 45, 46, 51, 52, 53 and ."
"The Commission rejects/can accept consumer content in: Amendments 8, 12 and 16."

"(Amendments underlined are new amendments tabled by political groups on 8 March 2005.)"
"( Ladies and gentlemen, the people of Belarus have begun a silent protest against the dictatorial regime entrenched in their country by lighting candles in their homes on the 16th day of every month. In connection with the upcoming presidential election next Sunday, I would like to ask, on behalf of my colleagues Petr Šťastný and Milan Gaľa, that you light a candle in your home or office at 4 p.m. sharp as a sign of solidarity with the Belarus nation, and in so doing, express support for the democratisation of Belarusian society."
"The next item is voting time."
"The fact that such covert action, counter to all democratic principles, has been taken means that there can only be one reason behind it: the money of the uninvited Members."
"The Commission has put forward a programme of Community action in the field of health and consumer protection, combining two previous programmes in these fields on the premise that this would harness the energies of both."
"This overlooks the fact, however, that the two programmes overlap in terms of objectives, strategies and instruments."
"On 30 June 2005, the Conference of Presidents decided, however, to split this programme once again."
"Accordingly, this report refers solely to the health programme, which in any event had a restricted scope and low funding levels."
"There is nothing more important than health, of course, and protecting it is of interest to everyone, without exception."
"Against this backdrop, the report before us in Parliament today broadens these powers and proposes to increase both overall funding, and specific funding for measures to be pursued."
"We are aware that it will still fall well short of what is required to satisfy demand and the interest aroused by this programme, yet we voted in favour of the report, as it improves considerably on the Commission’s proposal."
"I think that designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs are often helpful because, in contrast to the dominance of the WTO’s trademark giants in the global market, they boost and develop local production and trade."
"I am, however, opposed to the EU’s deciding about compulsory labelling for these goods."
"That is a matter that, in the future too, should be voluntary."
"."
"The purpose of this Commission proposal is to replace Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92 on certificates of specific character for agricultural products and foodstuffs with a new text, laying down clearer and simpler rules, in compliance with the decision adopted by the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body in response to complaints submitted by the USA and Australia."
"The deadline for compliance is 3 April 2006."
"As I appreciate the need to amend this Community legislation, I agree with the thrust of the Commission proposal and shall be voting in favour of the Graefe zu Baringdorf report."
"Mr President, it is well known that many empires in history fell because they grew too quickly and were unable to control their conflicting cultures and movements within that growth. A debate about the European Union’s ability to admit new members is therefore in my opinion long overdue."
"We must not forget that the name European Union itself implies a clear limit simply with the term Europe. We must also be clear in our minds that Europe rests on a foundation of Christian values."
"On the other hand, it must nevertheless be said that the events of the recent past in particular show that the belief in boundless tolerance, which is so widespread today, is misguided."
"Tolerance ought to work both ways, but so far, in our increasingly multicultural society, that tolerance has taken the form of Muslim immigrants expecting the Christian host countries to adapt and increasingly demanding it with violence."
"In the accession negotiations, Turkey has repeatedly shown its true face briefly, for example in the Cyprus agreement with threats of punishment for supposed insults to the state and now also in the dispute over the cartoons. It is time the truth finally dawned on the last of the starry-eyed supporters of enlargement that we must set clear European limits."
"Mr President, I would like to state separately that I voted in favour of Amendment 13 in Mr Brok’s resolution, which calls for the racist and anti-Semitic Grey Wolves organisation to be declared illegal."
"The organisation is responsible for repeated terror attacks on Christian and Jewish institutions in Turkey. The wording is strong, of course, but this is an unfortunate reflection of reality."
"This group terrorises people just as Hitler’s gangs did before he came to power; not on such a large scale, but with the same arrogance and using some of the same methods."
"In my opinion, the problem deserves the attention of this Chamber. Jewish communities and Christian churches have become targets of physical and spiritual terrorism at the hands of the Grey Wolves, and the matter calls for international attention."
"We Swedish Social Democrats want to see an open EU in which solidarity is the rule and which welcomes new countries into membership on the basis of the Copenhagen criteria. We therefore regret the fact that the report focuses too much on the EU’s own capacity for absorption, because it can give the impression that the European Parliament questions the EU’s ability to include more Member States."
"This own-initiative report discusses the important issue of the EU’s continued enlargement."
"The June List is, in principle, well disposed to continued enlargement of the EU, provided that the proposed Member States share the fundamental values that constitute the basis of the EU in terms of what it stands for. These include, above all, human rights, democracy and the principle of the state governed by law."
"The rapporteur also proposes a very considerable increase in the budget, corresponding to approximately SEK 25 billion, and that is something to which we object."
"We have therefore voted against the report."
"I voted against the resolution on the Curitiba conference on biodiversity."
"Parliament is making a big mistake in confusing biodiversity and genetic engineering."
"All the diversity of living things is the result of changes in the genetic structure of all living organisms. Those people who, in Europe, continue their reactionary battle against transgenic agriculture do not want to know that it causes no harm to human health in the rest of the world."
"In 2004, nine million small farmers cultivated almost 90 million hectares of GMOs in the world, while in the European Union of 25, 11 million small farmers cultivated 97 million hectares, of which some tens of thousands consisted only of transgenic crops."
"Europe is in the process of losing another battle."
"– Mr President, the Community action programme in the field of healthcare and consumer protection for 2007-2013 defines the way in which the EU intends to improve healthcare and boost consumer confidence by applying the provisions of the Treaty."
"The joint strategy in the field of consumer protection in the European Union is a collection of actions such as better understanding of consumers and markets, better consumer protection regulations, improved means of implementing the law, monitoring and settling claims, and better provision of information to and education of consumers."
"Genetically modified foods are multiplying on the EU market. These foods are unwanted and are potentially damaging to human health and to the environment."
"Society feels threatened by GMOs. This has been expressed in numerous protests, in a growing anti-GMO public movement and in local authority regulations."
"Another threat to health and consumers, aside from the spread of genetically modified food, is the increasing concentration of agricultural production which squeezes out family farms producing healthy food. Chemicals in farming and the pollution of the soil, the water, the air and of many food products are not beneficial to humans."
"The time has come for human health and wellbeing to become the highest value of all, so that humanity may benefit."
"I beg your pardon, but allow me to make a suggestion to our fellow Members from the new Member States, who are accustomed to reading out their speeches in Parliament. Reading out the speech too quickly compromises its translation and makes it impossible to understand the speech itself."
"I therefore suggest that you omit a sentence, provided that the speech is read out at a manageable speed for the interpreters, or else that you submit your speech to the interpreters beforehand so that they might keep up with the speed of your delivery. Doing so will help us understand our parliamentary business."
"– Commissioner, the so-called Moldovan Republic of Transnistria, which covers one fifth of the territory of the independent state of Moldova and the majority of its industry, is being recognised as a state despite international opposition. I urge you to pay attention to the violations of human rights, media restrictions and the populist-authoritarian system in Transnistria, which flies the flag of the former Soviet Republic of Moldova."
"Non-governmental organisations are having particular problems functioning in Transnistria."
"The new political initiative of President Igor Smirnov and the international youth corporation Proryv is modelled on Nashi, the pro-Putin youth movement in Russia."
"Proryv is an extreme populist organisation whose aim is not to allow democratic changes in Transnistria. Its ideology is based on a Soviet/Slavophile ideology of pro-Russian nationalism."
"Proryv is associated with the Transnistrian section of Vladimir Zhirinovsky’s Russian party, and collaborates closely with the Eurasian Russian movement."
"The European Union must take a closer interest in the situation in Transnistria from the viewpoint of human rights and democratic development in this part of Europe."
"– Mr President, today we have talked a great deal about Belarus, and I should like to speak out in defence of the country."
"It is untrue that Belarus is the least democratic country in Europe. The leader of this black list is the so-called Moldovan Republic of Transnistria."
"Nobody in the world recognises this country other than Russia, a country which does not recognise human and civil rights."
"Evidence of this includes the political prisoners being held and the attacks on non-governmental organisations, which the press has described as parasites."
"This situation does not prevail in the Republic of Moldova either, but we welcome that country’s efforts to move towards full democracy and, in time, the European Union."
"The Moldovan President, the Communist Mr Voronin, talks of the demilitarisation, democratisation and decriminalisation of Transnistria. For its part, the official newspaper of the regime of Transnistria’s President Smirnov is advocating the of Moldova and calling for help to democratise the country, or in other words to rid the Republic of Moldova of the Communists and their leader."
"This may be laughable, but it stops being funny when human rights are violated and people are locked up in prison. That is when the joke turns sour."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Kazakhstan(1)."
"Mr President, just a brief word. This lunchtime, Mrs Pleštinská said that people are putting candles in their windows in Slovakia and many other countries today as a sign of solidarity with the opposition and the freedom movement in Belarus."
"To avoid setting off the fire alarms, we have only brought a small symbolic candle into plenary, which is burning at Mrs Pleštinská’s place, but it is intended to make clear the strength of our ties with the freedom movement in Belarus."
"Mr President, not everything is pitch-black in Kazakhstan. Compared with a number of other countries in the region, positive things too are happening, for example the moratorium on the death penalty and the prosecution of policemen accused of torture."
"The latest development is, however, that, paradoxically, when the opposition is growing and becoming stronger, so too is the oppression directed against it."
"These two murders have exacerbated the situation."
"In reality, it was quite unnecessary to rig the election, because, according to all the opinion polls, Mr Nazarbayev would still have won it. Given the media situation in Kazakhstan, these developments are not perhaps so odd."
"A climate of fear also prevails. Governors did not dare report the worst voting figures and did not hesitate to season them with a few extra votes out of a fear of seeing their positions, financial or otherwise, undermined."
"We cannot have such a climate in a democracy, and we must be on our guard."
"In reality, the European Parliament is not demanding a lot: only that Kazakhstan obey its own constitution and that court decisions be required in connection, for example, with arrests."
"The FBI has been invited to take part in the investigations of the murders, and we should ensure that other international bodies too be allowed to study information concerning these crimes so that we have some grasp, and clarification of, the investigation."
". – Mr President, we in Europe are dismayed that survivors of the genocide orchestrated by Slobodan Milosevic could not see him convicted in the Hague."
"In Africa, the victims of governments that violate human rights and of war criminals have the right to justice and are seeking justice."
"Their names are: Hissène Habré, Charles Taylor, Mengistu Haile Mariam and Robert Mugabe."
"A few days ago in the Committee on Human Rights, we heard a lawyer from Chad underline this in relation to the dictator Hissène Habré, who has lived in exile in Senegal for a number of years."
"The lawyer advocated his extradition to Belgium, where a court is seeking him at the request of the victims."
"She also explained that extradition is needed because in the context of the African Union, there are unfortunately no mechanisms yet in place, nor is there the political will, to try this criminal, who was responsible for the political assassinations of over 40 000 of his compatriots and the detention and torture of many more."
"She went on to say that the Senegalese authorities referring the matter to the African Union was intended not to facilitate justice and to preserve African dignity, but to block justice and to cause further offence to the victims seeking to bring Hissène Habré to justice."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I was recently in Senegal, where I spoke to human rights activists, members of the Senegalese Parliament and journalists."
"All confirmed the same impression, unfortunately: The EU has responsibilities in Africa and this is why we have adopted this resolution today."
"Hopefully, as a result, Portuguese politicians will use their influence and seek an end to impunity for all of these criminals in Africa."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place immediately."
"That concludes the vote."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 16 March 2006."
"Before we look at the agenda, I must tell you of some news which is positive for once: a positive piece of news relating to a situation in Spain, but one which I believe is good for the whole of Europe."
"I am referring to the communiqué issued today by ETA, announcing a permanent ceasefire."
"We are being offered a glimpse of a future without terrorism."
"This is a time to act calmly and prudently. It is also a time to remember the victims of terrorism, and there have been many."
"It is a time for hope, for the uniting of all democratic political forces."
"I would say again that this is good news not just for Spanish society, but for the whole of Europe, because it shows that terrorism can be fought through the power of democracy."
"Thank you for your applause, ladies and gentlemen."
"Would the political groups like to speak following this communication from the Presidency?"
"Mr President, as you can imagine, the information you have given this House has provoked a lively response within our Group today."
"One of the 200 members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is herself a victim of ETA terrorism, since her husband was murdered by ETA."
"I hope you will agree to my asking my colleague Mrs Dührkop Dührkop to say a few words on behalf of our Group."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ETA’s announcement of a permanent ceasefire, which has been confirmed, is extremely hopeful news for all of the citizens of Spain and hence for all of the citizens of Europe."
"We would call for unity amongst all European democrats now and in the future, in order to achieve a definitive peace."
"As you have said, Mr President — and I say this with profound emotion — this is a time to remember the victims."
"Mr President, our highly respected fellow Member Mrs Dührkop’s concluding remarks would also have been my first, namely that our thoughts today are with the men and women murdered by ETA and with their families."
"Pleased as we of course are at this announcement, we are equally firm in saying there must be no political reward for such an announcement by ETA."
"At a time such as this, when we hope for a peaceful future for the whole Basque country and the whole Spanish nation, our thoughts go out to people all over the world who are dying because of terrorism or who are being deprived of their individual liberties, as at present in Belarus, where some of the opposition is being imprisoned."
"As freely elected Members of the European Parliament, it is our moral duty to speak out whenever the protection and dignity of human life are at stake."
"Because the dignity and the protection of human life is the supreme value in Europe and in the world."
". Mr President, normally if you invite the political group leaders to take the floor it is because of some tragedy which has afflicted our world."
"It is a pleasure today to be invited to celebrate something which can only be regarded as a victory."
"In western Europe, thanks to the political leaders of the post-war generation, we enjoy democracy."
"In a democracy, a change comes through the ballot, not through the bullet."
"The actions of ETA, the IRA, the Red Brigades and the other terrorist groups we have known in the past have been unjustifiable terrorist actions."
"On behalf of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I welcome the process through which ETA has announced this ceasefire."
"I look forward to seeing dialogue and democracy as the basis for change in Spain and across our continent."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our group heard the news about ETA’s communiqué around two hours ago, and we would like to make the following statement."
"This statement from ETA demonstrates two things."
"Firstly, that democracies are right to oppose terrorism."
"Secondly, the statement shows that, although democracies are right to oppose terrorism, they must also be able to negotiate and talk things through."
"That was what happened in Northern Ireland and that is what is happening in Spain, too."
"I congratulate all the political forces in Spain, which have been able to take a stand and negotiate since, in order to prevent a massacre from taking place, the different sides must be able to talk to each another."
"I therefore congratulate the Spanish Government and I congratulate all those who have had the strength to show that they are taking a stand and that they are not giving way but, rather, that they want to have done with terrorism, and the end of terrorism always hinges on negotiations."
"Moreover, we have requested that ETA send its ceasefire letter to Hamas so that Hamas might take inspiration from it."
". Mr President, I should like to join my colleagues in welcoming this decision by ETA."
"Unfortunately, it is too late for many of the victims, but just think of the future victims whose lives have been saved because of the decision taken today."
"As we look to the future of peace and negotiation that will take place in Spain as a result of this decision, I want to put into people’s minds the idea that ceasefires and negotiations do not mean subjugation."
"There must be a parity of esteem between the different sides of the argument; there must be respect for the divergence of opinion; but, most importantly of all, we must never forget that lives have been sacrificed needlessly because people refused to talk to each other on an equal basis and on an equal footing."
"If anything, the European Union has proven, over its 50 years of existence, that it is the best possible peace process that can be seen, because it is based on dialogue, mutual respect, understanding, tolerance – not acceptance – of all different ideas."
"It is based on respect for people with different ideas and focuses on ways to work together."
"Finally, the opportunity that is now presented by this decision from ETA is a groundbreaking one, but do not forget that opportunity comes to pass, not to pause: we must grasp it now and work to fulfil the ideas within it."
"Mr President, I would like to endorse everything the previous speakers have said and to thank Mrs Dührkop Dührkop in particular."
"I want to make one thing perfectly clear: nothing can justify terrorism."
"It is important that all democratic parties, all citizens who live in democracy and peace, clearly say: there is no way we will accept terrorism, that is not what we want, we want to live in peace and friendship with one another."
"Every victim of terrorism is one victim too many."
"Democracy and human rights: these are the values for which we all stand."
"I hope that this day with the ETA announcement really will result in a political and peaceful solution to problems in Spain."
"Mr President, I certainly join in welcoming this announcement. I also join in the expressions of regret and sympathy in respect of ETA’s very many unnecessary victims."
"I do that somewhat from a personal perspective in that we, in Northern Ireland, likewise suffered unnecessary decades of terrorism."
"I would join in your words of caution from the experience in Northern Ireland."
"Certainly it is good to see this ceasefire."
"We hope it is permanent, but Mr Poettering is absolutely right: there can be and should be no reward for doing what is right."
"The mistake that was made in my country, when the associate organisation of ETA declared its ceasefire back in 1994, was that everyone rushed forward with political rewards for that which had been done."
"That proved to be disastrous, because it encouraged a belief that you could keep a foot in both camps."
"You cannot be a terrorist by night and a politician by day."
"There must be a total transition to exclusively peaceful means."
"The Spanish authorities should therefore learn from the experience in Northern Ireland."
"They should test ETA’s commitment and bona fides and realise that you should not and cannot give rewards for doing that which was necessary and right."
"In welcoming the ceasefire, I offer that advice and that caution from the experience in my country."
"Mr President, I too wish to welcome the ceasefire and the fact that weapons are being laid down and replaced with voting papers."
"I come from an area between Denmark and Germany where there have been war and conflict for donkey’s years and where, by granting reciprocal rights, respecting national minorities and having the border determined by referenda, a situation was achieved in which old enemies became friends. I have experienced this process in Northern Ireland."
"When we visited the province for the first time as Members of the European Parliament, we were thoroughly checked for weapons before we went into our hotel."
"On subsequent occasions, it was a peaceful Northern Ireland that we visited."
"The process is possible."
"I hope that peace will also finally be established in Spain and the Basque country."
"Mr President, the communiqué from the terrorist group ETA does not alter the situation in Spain in any way."
"The communiqué tells us that ETA is going to stop killing for as long as it sees fit and that it is doing so in order to achieve its supposedly political objectives."
"The communiqué, which does not contain a single word of remorse, which does not contain any request for forgiveness, which does not contain the least demonstration of submission to the rule of law, does nothing more than demonstrate the cynicism and moral meanness of this criminal group once again."
"I hope that the Spanish Government will only accept one kind of communiqué from ETA: one which announces that it is disbanding and handing over its weapons and one which asks for the forgiveness of so many people who have undergone such suffering and such unjust pain at its hands."
"Thank you to everybody for your reactions to ETA’s communiqué."
"Mr President, I would like to join with you and the people of Spain in welcoming the good news you have received."
"I think it is very good for your region."
"As someone who also comes from Northern Ireland, during the earlier part of my 16 years in this House, I had to rise nearly every month to express condolences to the people of my area."
"It is the one thing I do not miss having to do in this House now that we have some degree of normality in Northern Ireland."
"I hope that goes for the people of Spain as well."
"I would echo the words of Mr Poettering – and indeed I have learned from my own experience – that it is much easier to make war than it is to make peace."
"I agree with Mr Poettering when he said that those who have been waging that war and taking those lives should not be rewarded for bringing an end to that now."
"Mr President, I believe that we are dealing with a very important piece of news, not just for Spain, but also for the European Union, because ETA's announcement is a fact."
"A new prospect is opening up for exploring a process of negotiation which could lead to a definitive peace in the Basque Country and hence in a part of the European Union."
"We are entering a complicated and difficult stage and I hope that this European Parliament will, in second place – because Spain is in first place; it falls to the Spanish Government ― help to overcome all of the obstacles which I am sure will arise during the process of negotiation."
"I therefore believe that we are unquestionably facing a new situation which deserves the attention and support of all of us in seeking a definitive solution to this problem."
"Mr President, I also come from an island which had suffered almost 30 years of terrorism."
"We have had a peace process in place for ten years or more."
"I very much welcome the announcement today by the ETA organisation."
"My criticism of it would be same criticism I have applied to the IRA in Ireland for very many years: that it was engaged in a useless, pointless, undemocratic way of seeking to pursue its objectives."
"However, at the end of the day, as politicians, we have to find a way of achieving a democratic political solution to the problem."
"It seems to me that the Spanish Government is to be congratulated in bringing about a situation in which a ceasefire has been announced."
"It is a matter for all democrats – both in Spain and in Europe – to back the Spanish Government in taking the process forward, because if we allow organisations like ETA or the IRA to see a gap between democrats as to how peace can be built, then we will fail and they will win."
"Mr President, I had no intention of speaking following the heartfelt speech of my colleague, Mrs Dührkop, but following the speech by the Vice-President, Mr Vidal-Quadras, I just wished to say one thing, because I believe that all of us here are united in calling for European democrats to come together in order to support this process."
"I just wish to say to Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca that I hope that his political party and his group will behave in the way that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament did when the People’s Party and the People's Party government were responsible for starting a negotiation process following a ceasefire that was similar to this one but which did not have the same content."
"That concludes the speeches on this subject."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to inform you that a delegation from the Danish Parliament, headed by its President, Mr Christian Mejdahl, is currently attending our sitting from the official gallery."
"I have had the opportunity to hold a meeting with Mr Mejdahl and his delegation and now I would like to welcome them most warmly to our Chamber;"
"I hope that your stay in Brussels and your visit to the European institutions are fruitful and positive."
"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 16 March 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"Mr President, I refer to Rule 103 and Rule 130 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Rule 130 is concerned with the agenda, Rule 103 with statements and proposals by the Commission."
"I am not referring to today’s agenda, however, but to the agenda for the next plenary session, and I have the following request."
"On the agenda for the next plenary session of the European Parliament we have a debate and a resolution of the European Parliament on the situation in Belarus."
"Since the President, Vice-President and other members of the Commission are present, I am taking this opportunity to ask the following."
"The situation in Belarus is cause for concern."
"I do not believe the European Union can stand idly by while a dictator shamelessly destroys democracy in Europe."
"Thought must therefore be given to the measures the European Union can take to put Mr Lukaschenko in his place."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commission today to put forward suitable proposals on this agenda item before the debate in the next plenary session and to explain the measures which it – the Commission – is proposing or is able to propose for taking action against Belarus and its present government and for strengthening the opposition there."
"Mr Schulz, the agenda for the next sitting will be set by the next Conference of Presidents."
"We take good note of the fact that you want this item to appear. It will be discussed by the Conference of Presidents."
"Mr President, then I request that the item be placed on the agenda of the next Conference of Presidents."
"Very good, it will be on the agenda of the next Conference of Presidents."
"Mr President, with reference to Rules 133 and 144 of the Rules of Procedure, Mr Schulz is talking about the following plenary part-session, but I wonder why we are not taking the opportunity of this part-session of this House to discuss the situation in Belarus."
"We can indeed wait for the Commission to come up with measures, but we can also produce some of our own."
"It is absurd that we should not make use of the momentum generated by the people who are taking to the streets."
"I propose that we have a debate on Belarus either today or tomorrow."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert."
"We are making considerable progress because the Members asking to speak on a point of order are now saying which Rules they are invoking."
"This is progress."
"But as well as invoking them, you should read them, and then you will see that they say that these requests must be presented in writing at least three hours before the beginning of the sitting."
"Pursuant to these Rules, therefore, I cannot put your proposal to the House."
"I am sorry, but that it is what our Rules of Procedure say, and we will therefore discuss this issue at the next Conference of Presidents."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be very brief;"
"I refer to the Strasbourg part-session."
"Specifically, I request an explanation of the statements by the Presidency during the Strasbourg part-session on the composition of the IND-DEM Group."
"I would like to inform the Presidency that today the members of the delegation to which I belong and the members of the Polish delegation have been called to a meeting of the IND-DEM Group to be held at 2 p.m."
"We would like to know, however, under what status we have been called, since the Presidency announced that the IND-DEM Group had excluded us, using a procedure that was totally incomprehensible and completely irregular."
"I would just like to state that this meeting does nothing to resolve the irregularities committed by the leadership of the IND-DEM Group towards 11 Members forming the so-called minority within the group, who, perhaps not by chance, are also declaring that they are totally unconnected with the obscure events which have brought the leadership of the group to the attention of the European Court of Auditors."
"Mr Borghezio, Members cannot come to the House and ask for the floor simply in order to explain any problem they may have."
"You have not invoked any Rule to justify your words."
"The problem you are raising is strictly one involving the internal organisation of your political group."
"The Presidency knows nothing about it and has no power to interfere in the way your political group does or does not call meetings for any reason."
"I therefore regret, Mr Borghezio, that I was not able to cut you off as I should have done."
"Mr President, I would also like to come back to the points based on Rules 133 and 144."
"I understand that, technically speaking, you may well be right about the fact that the request should have been submitted three hours before the start of the sitting."
"That was a mistake."
"But does that mean that we in this House are not now going to discuss Belarus, where people on the streets are demonstrating, simply because of the technical problem that we did not submit a request three hours before the sitting?"
"Politically speaking, that is completely ridiculous!"
"Please disregard the three hours and let us vote on whether we are going to discuss Belarus."
"Maybe people do not want to discuss it: fine, they can vote ‘no’."
"However, let us not allow bureaucratic reasons to stop us discussing something which is so topical and in so doing make ourselves completely useless as a Parliament."
"Mrs Buitenweg, when Rules do not suit us, we call them bureaucratic."
"But the Rules are the Rules, and if you want me to tell you what the Rule says — and you should know it — it does not just talk about presentation in writing before the sitting: it says that it must be presented by a committee — which is not the case — by a political group — which is not the case — or by at least 37 Members — which is not the case either."
"None of the requirements laid down in our Rules of Procedure are fulfilled, therefore."
"The President must conform to the Rules of Procedure and act accordingly: the matter is closed."
"It is closed: 37 Members before the sitting; before the sitting."
"I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen: the Rules of Procedure demand presentation in writing before the sitting."
"If it was so important to you, you could have taken the trouble to present the request in writing before the sitting, because I imagine that you did not just discover the issue of Belarus half an hour ago, did you?"
"Please take the trouble to read the Rules of Procedure and apply them."
"Mr President, there are situations where one has to come to an understanding."
"You are no doubt correct in your interpretation of the Rules of Procedure, but we have another sitting tomorrow morning and I request, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that we debate the situation in Belarus here in this House tomorrow ...,"
"in order to express our solidarity with the democrats in Belarus."
"Thank you very much, Mr Poettering."
"The plenum is sovereign and the appropriate action will be taken according to the support expressed, but the President must conform to the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, I agree; our Group accepts that."
"We can debate Belarus here tomorrow morning, that is no problem at all."
"But we shall also have to discuss the hypocrisy that has just been shown here."
"If a Group believes that this subject ought to have been debated here today or tomorrow, Mr Poettering, then a telephone call would have sufficed."
"I spoke with you by telephone five minutes before the start of this sitting and I heard not a word from you on this subject."
"I have just requested here that we debate it in the next sitting, then a fellow Member asked that we do it now."
"You also show your democratic credentials in your ability to listen!"
"I have nearly finished."
"A fellow Member asked that we do it now; that can be discussed quietly."
"But to rehearse this revolt here, as though you – and you alone – were the defender of Belarus’ interests, we cannot go along with that."
"We can debate the matter tomorrow, but not with your farcical behaviour."
"Mr President, I do not have a special theme I would like to discuss with you: this still concerns Belarus."
"We are now collecting 37 signatures."
"I think we can proceed very early tomorrow morning with the request of our group chairmen."
"I do not expect to submit a written statement on it, but the 37 signatures collected here during the sitting should be enough, and I look forward to receiving your confirmation."
"– I should like to alert my fellow esteemed colleagues who are currently calling for us to become involved as soon as possible in the situation in Belarus – some of whom are from Austria – to the fact that the EU imposed sanctions on Austria some time ago."
"While Mrs Ferrero-Waldner calls for pressure to be put on Belarus, she was a member of the Schüssel Government that faced sanctions from the EU."
"Please think carefully about the steps you are taking, so that you are not faced with the embarrassing prospect of having to ignore them in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I am always pleased when the grand coalition starts to shake."
"That is always good for Parliament."
"The second thing I would like to say – and there is no need for excitement, because I think Mr Poettering is quite right, even if he did perhaps only see the light when he was in this Chamber, which would not be a bad thing either, Mr Schulz – is that we, the European Parliament, must debate this situation and take a clear stance towards Belarus and towards Russia, because Mr Lukaschenko would no longer be in power at all without Mr Putin!"
"If we do that tomorrow, we will have earned the stars of the European Union."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, we are dealing with points of order;"
"I would ask you not to get into the matter itself."
"Mr President, I rise to commend you for ensuring respect for the rules of the House, for showing the flexibility to meet the demands of our colleagues for a vote tomorrow morning and I move that we proceed forthwith to next business."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I came into the Chamber just now – and I am only speaking because Mr Schulz addressed me – I thought, this is the first sitting since I have been Group Chairman in which I do not need to speak."
"It has turned out differently – you made the announcement about ETA and I responded because others spoke."
"When I spoke on the telephone with Mr Schulz, on his initiative, at five minutes to three or five minutes to two – I do not exactly remember – I certainly had no idea that there would be a debate on Belarus here today."
"Please believe me, I am putting my cards on the table, when I say that if I had wanted to instigate such a debate I would have spoken not only to Mr Schulz, but also to Mr Watson, Mr Cohn-Bendit, Mrs Frassoni, Mr Wuertz, Mr Cawley, to everybody."
"I came into the Chamber not knowing about this debate, heard my fellow Members’ reactions and thought I would show my good will by suggesting that we debate in the morning."
"I still believe that is a good suggestion."
"Alright, let us adapt the Rules of Procedure, but we must respect them, because if we do not respect them today on the grounds that we think a Rule is nothing but an irritating bit of bureaucracy, then tomorrow others may take the same line and we will end up without any Rules at all."
"So if a request is presented this afternoon signed by 37 Members or by a political group – as the Rules of Procedure stipulate – the debate on Belarus will take place tomorrow."
"But please conform to the procedures laid down."
"(1)"
"Before giving the floor to the Members who are speaking on behalf of the groups, I would like to inform the House that the Foreign Affairs Minister of Peru, Mr Maúrtua de Romaña, is in the diplomatic gallery."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Peruvian Government for the wonderful way it helped us in holding the Latin America and Caribbean Conference in Lima, in June last year."
"All of the Members of this House who took part in that Conference — in particular Vice-President dos Santos — talked about how well they were treated and about the excellent organisation."
"Please pass on our thanks to the government of your country, Minister."
"The next item is the Commission Statement on the 2007 Annual Policy Strategy."
"The President of the Commission has the floor, I would apologise to him for the delay."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our debate today consists of taking stock and planning for the future, as well as finding a consensus regarding the priority actions for 2007."
"It is a question of working together so that we can properly prepare the ground for future actions."
"The Commission has placed the effective implementation of its policies at the heart of its objectives, but if we are to implement them effectively we need a genuine partnership between the European institutions."
"The 2005 report shows that the caricature of a Europe in the grip of paralysis was far removed from reality."
"We have in actual fact made considerable progress."
"The Commission has focused on its objectives and has achieved a rate of implementation of nearly 90% for its priority actions."
"The Stability and Growth Pact, the revised social agenda and the sustainable development strategy have been steered in a new direction."
"Above all, however, I believe that, this week, we will see that the revision of the Lisbon Strategy on employment and growth has been a turning point in terms of finally providing the strategy with the tools it needs to turn aspirations into reality."
"The Hampton Court Summit helped achieve a new consensus on the key elements of the Union’s action in a world that is heading in the direction of globalisation."
"It opened the door to the measures that are emerging today."
"I am thinking, for instance, of European energy policy and of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"The Union demonstrated its ability to respond rapidly to people’s needs after the tsunami and the London bombings."
"It has also shown that it is capable of working as one body, with the European consensus on development, to which the European Parliament itself also subscribes, being the expression of a genuine common approach."
"Admittedly, our task is not complete."
"As far as the financial perspective is concerned, however, I believe that we are closer than ever to reaching an agreement."
"If we find a solution very soon, then we will still have enough time to get under way with implementing most of the programmes at the start of next year, something that is particularly important for the less wealthy countries and regions of our continent."
"As for the future of the European debate, we can still take advantage of the events and make use of that period in order to find a genuine consensus regarding which direction we need to take."
"I believe that we are on the right track: the annual progress report on the Lisbon Strategy, the Green Paper on energy policy, biofuels, the European Institute of Technology and the road map in the field of gender equality are so many major initiatives that are already on the agenda."
"So, what about 2007?"
"I believe that 2007 will be a crucial year in terms of achieving the strategic objectives set by our Commission for its term of office."
"Our strategic objectives over five years – prosperity, solidarity and security – and, of course, their influence outside the EU remain fully relevant."
"They form a coherent political framework designed to guide the action of the European Union."
"They reflect the challenges facing Europe and the main anxieties of Europeans, which they strive to address."
"They will remain the cornerstone of the Commission’s action."
"I believe in fact that they constitute a sound basis from which to re-assess the direction that our Union must take."
"With the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome coming up in 2007, attention will rightly be focused on the great values and the general objectives of the European Union."
"The main target must continue to be sustainable growth to provide more and better jobs in Europe."
"With a more positive macroeconomic outlook, we must seize every opportunity to accelerate reforms and put them into practice."
"I know that this Parliament is committed to playing its role in a real partnership for growth and jobs."
"In 2007, several Member States should be speeding up their preparations for adopting the euro."
"Provided they meet the necessary conditions, in 2007 we shall see the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, and I look forward to their contribution to the European Union."
"Energy will continue to attract our attention."
"We will pay special attention to the promotion of sustainable management and the protection of natural resources."
"We will make proposals for a European Union maritime policy."
"We will follow up on the Green Paper on labour law."
"The year 2007 will also be the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All."
"In the field of security and freedom, the main target will be the extension of the Schengen area, migration and border controls and the fight against crime."
"Health issues will remain central, with greater preventive efforts against pandemics."
"Beyond our borders, we will ensure a proper follow-up to the Doha Round, progress in the stabilisation of the western Balkans – in particular in Kosovo – and completion of partnership agreements with the ACP countries."
"As you can see, we will be very busy in 2007."
"The year 2007 will also see new directions for the second half of the Commission’s mandate."
"We shall be preparing for the future, with intensive work on the comprehensive review of the Union’s budget leading to a White Paper in 2008-2009."
"This review needs to be based on a profound reflection and must take the full range of views into account."
"This will naturally include the European Parliament and I welcome your intention of close association with this process."
"Let me also say a few words on our ability to deliver on these priorities."
"We need to translate them into practical actions and implement them through the most appropriate instruments."
"The Commission has made progress in this direction."
"Firstly, we have a strategic planning and programming cycle ensuring an effective and timely delivery of our priorities and concentrating our resources on these tasks."
"The Commission states its intentions, consults on them, adopts its work programme and reports regularly on its implementation."
"However, we need to further strengthen the political relevance and substance of our discussion on our strategic planning and programming."
"Secondly, we have implemented a range of instruments to promote better regulation and good governance, which I believe is having a real impact on the rigour of our work and the quality of our output."
"We have made significant efforts to carry out impact assessments on our major proposals."
"We have completed more than one hundred so far, and we will continue to improve their quality and ensure that they make a real difference in our decision-making process."
"The Commission will also carry through its simplification agenda, covering various fields from environment to industry, the modernisation of labour law, the promotion of consumer rights or key internal market sectors."
"However, let us not forget that governance and better regulation are the shared responsibilities of all the European institutions and the Member States."
"As I have said before, better regulation is crucially important for liberalising our economic potential, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"What our business needs in Europe is a red carpet, not red tape."
"Efforts must be pursued at all levels to show that European initiatives are well founded and add real value."
"In many areas – be it at European or national level – we do not need so many regulations."
"As Montesquieu said – in the best possible way – and I shall say it in French:"
"Roughly translated, that means ‘useless laws weaken indispensable ones’."
"This is the very principle of the good European tradition."
"So what are the next steps?"
"The annual policy strategy decision forms the basis for our dialogue in view of preparing the Commission’s work programme for 2007."
"Every Commissioner now stands ready to discuss with committees the political priorities put forward in her or his area."
"It is crucial to take time away from the topic of the day in order to prepare for the future."
"I very much welcomed Parliament’s initiative last year to draw together the threads in its report."
"That had a real impact on this year’s work programme."
"Mr President, honourable members, the Commission puts this strategy forward in a spirit of partnership."
"I look forward to your views on where Europe should devote its energies in 2007."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in 2005, the people of Europe had the opportunity to tell us not only that they were expecting great things from us, but also that they were wondering about their future and about that of Europe in a context of globalisation."
"The political strategy for 2007 must enable us to provide sound answers."
"Without either the interinstitutional agreement or the financial perspective for the moment, where do we go from here?"
"We are in a situation that I would describe as complete hypocrisy."
"We want to debate actions that are important for Europeans, while, for its part, the Council, ever deaf to our arguments, is proposing practically no budgetary development."
"Our Parliament will not give up on the financial perspective."
"The needs are huge: youth training, research, transport, health programmes, the environment; a full list would be too long."
"Mr Barroso, you talk to us about a potential forthcoming agreement, but I have not heard you say the word ‘ambitious’ – an ambitious agreement – and I therefore remain sceptical."
"In the dialogue that we are embarking upon, you can count on the momentum of our Assembly in formulating its political priorities for 2007."
"I am pleased, moreover, to see that the European Commission is finally recognising that economic cohesion, solidarity and environmental protection can be reconciled with our objectives regarding growth and employment."
"You propose four priority areas: knowledge, businesses – and specifically SMEs – employment and ageing and, lastly, energy."
"We must in fact represent the best of the knowledge-based society."
"We can see what is happening in Asia and we must not remain helpless in the face of it."
"The European Union will only cope if it rises to the challenge posed by knowledge, knowledge that takes the form of technical and industrial developments."
"As regards SMEs, we must create a competitive regulatory environment and help our businesses to gain a better foothold in international markets."
"You also intend to do away with the European laws that serve no purpose, those notorious useless laws that you just mentioned to us, which weaken the necessary laws."
"We totally agree with you, Mr Barroso, and our Parliament plans to be closely involved in the decisions taken to simplify legislation."
"Being simple, however, also means expressing oneself clearly."
"You want to make 2007 an important year where communication is concerned, and I approve of your ambition."
"Coining new words, however, has never been part of a good communication strategy."
"In the context of the main priority, that of employment, you introduce an awful word, ‘flexisecurity’."
"What does that mean?"
"Europeans are going to run away faced with that highly technocratic word."
"‘Brussels has invented yet another forgettable word’ – that is what we are in danger of hearing."
"Energy is the fundamental issue."
"The year 2007 will have to be a decisive one where the guidelines on energy policy are concerned."
"We will have to be objective, disregard all ideologies, no longer treat nuclear power as a taboo subject and keep in mind that our energy dependence must never exceed 50%."
"As we have seen recently, energy is becoming a genuine weapon with which to exert political pressure."
"Furthermore, if, in the future, a non-EU country decides to cut the supply and plunge Europe into darkness, how will we respond?"
"We therefore need to improve the means of transporting energy and to think, first and foremost, about solidarity among the Member States."
"In the area of security and freedoms, the extension of the Schengen area worries our fellow citizens."
"They still have the impression that our borders remain porous and that the debate on immigration is still at the stage of wishful thinking."
"The future enlargement to incorporate Romania and Bulgaria will have to be decided in the course of this year."
"While I am on that subject, we note with interest your indispensable condition: that those countries will have to comply in full with the Moreover, if the neighbourhood policy becomes a policy in its own right, then I regret that more is not being done in terms of establishing the strategic partnership."
"The 2007-2013 period will also mark the launch of new European programmes. There will be a large number of them, and, if we are to launch them, then we need the financial perspective."
"We are only too familiar with the debate on Erasmus."
"Finally, we will pay a great deal of attention to the preparation of your White Paper on the reform of the EU budget."
"We ask you to involve our Parliament in this task."
"The year 2007 will mark the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome."
"Might not this be an opportunity, on the one hand, to see the European Constitution enter into operation and, on the other, to make 2007 the year of Europe in all of the Member States, so that the double standards stop at last and so that the truth can be told about how Europe benefits people’s everyday lives?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we are talking about the Commission’s strategic programme, we must also ask what role the Commission itself will play in putting that strategic planning into effect."
"That is what I want to speak about."
"We are all in broad agreement, Mr Barroso, about the content of what you have said and what you have presented in writing."
"A revised Lisbon Strategy?"
"Of course!"
"Defining Europe’s role in the globalised world as regards migration?"
"Fine!"
"A key challenge!"
"Improving Europe’s energy supply, greater energy efficiency, greater energy security?"
"Unity throughout the House!"
"Promoting technology, investing in the technologies of the future to preserve and enhance Europe’s global competitiveness as a knowledge-based continent?"
"Agreed!"
"Strengthening internal security and expanding Europe’s role in international security?"
"Agreed!"
"Wonderful!"
"Great!"
"We will hear many more speakers today saying, ‘this is just what we need!"
"Mr Barroso is right, that is the way forward!’"
"What we have not been given, however, is a Financial Perspective to match, that is the necessary resources to achieve that."
"We haggle with the Council – Mrs Grossetête is right there – for a billion more or less."
"The bold approach which you and your Commissioners pushed for when presenting your Financial Perspective, Mr Barroso, was cut by EUR 200 billion in the European Council."
"You asked for EUR 1 022 billion for seven years, the Council decided on EUR 840 billion."
"I wondered what happened to Mr Barroso’s strategic outcry against such incorrect financial policy."
"You told this Parliament you would fight for these strategic objectives with this financial allocation."
"And then you told Parliament the Council’s decision was a success."
"There is nothing else you can do, I understand that, because you will not get any more money, at least not unless we fight a bit more for it."
"As Commission President, you have to live with the stupidity of the Heads of State or Government."
"My criticism is therefore directed not so much at you and your Commission as at the partners on the other side."
"We will not achieve these strategic objectives if we define the objectives without making the necessary resources available to the institutions that have to act."
"That is certain!"
"That is why I am saying that the Commission’s strategic objectives are the right ones, but you must also argue the matter with the individual States!"
"As President of the Commission you must call a spade a spade!"
"In every single case, you and your Commissioners must go and say that we cannot announce we are going to give Europol more power, that we can fight terrorism and crime more efficiently at European level – incidentally, the joint fight against crime and greater internal security are the European matters getting the highest rate of approval from Europe’s citizens – and then have the Council cut the appropriations by EUR 7.8 billion – and that three days before adopting the additional programme for Europol that sounds so good in the newspaper."
"Your strategic objectives are the right ones."
"But the Commission must take up the cudgels with those Heads of State or Government, with those ministers and councils of ministers, that are not willing to pay the price on Monday for the speeches they made on Sunday."
"I expect the Commission to do that."
"You can expect us to support your strategic objectives – you have named the right strategic objectives – but we expect you to stand at our side in our battle, as Parliament, with the Heads of State or Government for a little more credibility for European policy."
"If we agree this together for 2007, it will be an exciting year and I am sure a successful one for the European institutions."
". Mr President, today we debate the Commission’s priorities for 2007, but tomorrow our Heads of State and Government must find the means, the guts and the grit to make these priorities a reality."
"We have before us a blueprint for the future with its emphasis on knowledge, enterprise, jobs and energy."
"The 2007 Annual Policy Strategy succeeds in putting flesh on the bones of the Hampton Court proposals, which could help make Europe the most dynamic and competitive economy in the world, if Member States would only move beyond the platitudes dished up at the annual Lisbon Spring Council."
"I have seen the draft Council conclusions."
"Fine words from such faint hearts!"
"Europe deserves better."
"It deserves the shared responsibility of which Mr Barroso spoke."
"That is why Liberals and Democrats welcome the ambition displayed by the European Commission."
"This paper promises what previous annual policy strategies manifestly failed to provide: practical proposals for European renewal by creating legal migration channels and a common European asylum system – and their corollary of better border management – to provide the workers and security that Europe needs; by fast-tracking a European energy policy; completing the internal market for energy and gas; investing in clean coal technologies; and balancing flexibility and social protection with the demands of markets to boost growth and competitiveness."
"There is one thing that the Commission has not learned."
"It puts the use of resources and environmental protection under the heading of solidarity."
"It should put them under the heading of prosperity, because until we learn that the environment and green growth is part of prosperity rather than solidarity, we will not have the correct perspective on such matters."
"Add to these the enlargement of the eurozone and the welcoming of Bulgaria and Romania, and 2007 could be a seminal year for Europe, particularly if we get the constitutional process back on track."
"However, success hinges on a factor that has been absent up to now, and cannot be replaced by any number of Commission proposals: national ownership of necessary reforms by Member States."
"Who will trust leadership which says one thing and does another; which agrees policies, but then backtracks, disrupts and weakens their implementation?"
"I refer not only to attacks on the services or takeovers directives from economic protectionists, I am talking about a more general myopia that prevents Member States from seeing the bigger picture; the myopia which prompted the Council to throw out proposals to name and shame poorly performing countries and refuse adequate funding for Europe’s priority areas."
"It is also one reason why the ambitions of last year’s annual policy strategy to make progress on Doha, on the Lisbon goals and on the Constitution came famously unstuck."
"So that is the challenge facing Europe’s leaders when they convene for tomorrow’s Spring Council."
"Europe needs them to construct a coalition of the coherent."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are now discussing another strategy, another paper and another set of priorities; in the same way in which we debated the others, we would like to place the emphasis on two or three issues – firstly on the agreement concerning the financial perspectives."
"Mr President, you know very well that coming to an agreement now, today, with the Council would mean a dramatic reduction in our ambitions and, naturally, those of citizens."
"We therefore call on you to make an agreement and to work for an agreement, but subject to our conditions, which ought also to be yours."
"I fully agree with the agreement on the financial perspectives, but not subject to the Council’s conditions."
"Until we can count on agreement and a clear alliance with the Commission on this point, debates like today’s will remain somewhat devoid of substance."
"Secondly, you mentioned other topics and I would like to refer to two in particular: one is the issue of immigration and internal security."
"You said that the priorities will be Schengen, controls and borders, but you said nothing about one point although it is mentioned in the text: the problem is an aspect that we consider a priority, which is legal immigration procedures."
"This element is present in your texts, but it is absent from what is done and what is said!"
"The fact that the Commission is not able to say one word – not even one – on the subject of the thousands who have died between Mauritania and the Canary Isles and on the fact that my country, Italy, still has an unknown agreement with Libya that has been hidden from you and from this Parliament, which has caused the death of a huge number of people in that desert, means that debate about a common immigration policy is still just empty words."
"We would be delighted to hear just one word from you on this subject that is not merely a general remark."
"Thirdly, there is the issue of energy."
"We have a problem; you are aware that there are differences of opinion on this matter, and particularly that in our view nuclear energy and renewable energy cannot be placed on the same footing – they are two different things."
"We acknowledge the fact that there is nuclear energy on this continent, but we cannot believe that this is an energy of the future for our continent, partly because – and this is not a minor consideration – we still have to import uranium, whereas we do not have to import sun or wind!"
"This is an important point, at least from a conceptual point of view, and nuclear power should not be placed on the same footing!"
"We have to understand, very clearly and very specifically, that we cannot depend on nuclear power."
"Nuclear power today meets only a part of our requirements and it is certainly not an option for the future."
"In addition, on energy issues, there is still a gaping hole in the Commission’s strategy: its silence on the transport question."
"Seventy per cent of our dependence on oil relates to transport."
"Even in this Parliament we have not been able to help very much, I agree, with regard to an innovative transport policy, but I believe that the Commission ought to help us on this matter."
"I would like to end, Mr President, by saying that there is another priority which is being ignored in this area, and that is our cities."
"Cities are an opportunity not only as a kind of laboratory but also for Europe’s use, and currently insufficient use is being made of them both from the viewpoint of financial support and from the viewpoint of major strategies."
"Perhaps it is better to start with cities rather than with major infrastructure, which in any case will not be financed by Europe either."
". – Mr President, the major question raised by my political group lies not solely in the policies for which specific provision is made for 2007, but also in the doubts which are being created in our mind in connection with the broader strategic direction being given to the European construct as a whole."
"It is unacceptable for us to become witnesses every day to the tempestuous concern and protests which have been stirred up by the new anti-grass roots employment laws in France; we have frequently become witnesses recently of citizens' reactions to various directives."
"It is unacceptable when the Union buries its head in the sand by following through on policies which promote benefits not for the workers but for large companies."
"It is following through on the Lisbon Strategy which, in a bid to disorientate the workers, is now allegedly a 'reformed' strategy."
"Has it perhaps been reformed or changed in substance since when it was first decided or has it managed to promote the development of a social policy agenda designed to safeguard basic social standards, quality employment and the reconciliation of work and private life?"
"No, it has not."
"In the name of competitiveness, workers rights are on the receiving end every day of the fire of capitalist Europe."
"Working times are being extended, wages are being cut, collective agreements are being abolished, unemployment and unequal pay are increasing and the welfare regime is being swept away completely."
"The first to suffer are young people, the people on whom we are calling – and that is the irony – to build a Europe with a future."
"At the same time, policies are being promoted which allegedly oil the wheels of immigration."
"How can that be, when their objective is once again the criteria laid down to safeguard the economic interests of Europe, when immigrants and people who need international protection are being kept on European territory under conditions of detention when their only crime has been to seek a humane life?"
"European resources should be used not to finance policies to strengthen closed borders, deportations and repatriations, but to remedy the real causes of immigration and to promote human rights in a substantial manner within the framework of a mutually beneficial neighbourhood policy, far from the philosophy of the reforms of the World Trade Organisation and the World Bank and from the philosophy of military intervention."
". In order to reduce the gulf between the European Union’s Lisbon targets and reality, the Commission’s programme of work for 2007 needs to be ambitious."
"Action by the Commission ought to cover all spheres, and at the same time it should choose as its priorities those initiatives that are important not only in one specific sector but also for the overall development of the European Union."
"In the Commission’s programme, the launching of the space programme and the regular evaluation of strategy were among the most important measures mentioned for the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy in 2007."
"While not contesting the importance of these measures, I believe that specific measures to foster the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and the development of the services sector would offer broader support to the Lisbon process, but such measures were not included in the list."
"Although the development of small and medium-sized enterprises appears among the priorities listed, this priority is not reflected at all in the list of principal actions."
"It is the development of this sector, however, that can actually make the most rapid contribution to achieving the goals of employment and growth."
"Although the development of the services sector is and remains one of the main instruments for implementing the Lisbon Strategy in the Commission’s strategy for 2007, no specific measures for the development of the services sector are mentioned."
"We hope that it was not as a result of a deliberate move, but of a failure to coordinate the strategy established with operational measures, that the reform of the services sector was not included in the Commission’s policy strategy for 2006."
"The adoption of the Services Directive in 2007 will also clear the way for new initiatives by the European Commission in sectors that have been identified for liberalisation of services."
"The creation of one-stop agencies would be one specific move in this direction."
"2007 will be decisive for debates about the future of the European Union."
"One of the main criteria according to which the European public will judge the European Union’s viability and future prospects in 2007 will be the concrete results of action taken by the European Union’s institutions, including the Commission."
"This specificity ought, however, to be already apparent in the setting out of priorities and tasks, by defining the measures planned for 2007 not only in terms of continuing work already begun but also in terms of achieving concrete results."
"Mr President, the Commission has broken a clear pledge to present a full annual programme, setting out all proposed legislation and its legal bases."
"As yet, we have received details of only a small selection of the laws and regulations produced by the Commission. We have not been given precise information about the legal bases, so we cannot see whether the Commission is proposing voluntary coordination or binding rules."
"It is difficult to debate strategic guidelines in the dark."
"Does the Commission want more power, centralism and Byzantine regulation, or does it want to inspire the Member States to pull together in the interests of job creation and to encourage countries to compete in doing things as best they can?"
"The Independence and Democracy Group wants greater freedom for the Member States and less power centralised in Brussels."
"The Commission must be open with people."
"Tell us who is giving good advice in your 3 000 secret working parties."
"Let us see what is behind the advice."
"Tell us how you use taxpayers’ money."
"Give the EU’s auditors, the ombudsman and the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control full access to investigate all expenditure."
"Put your mail on the Internet so that we can study all approaches from lobbyists."
"Show some confidence in people."
"Give us the information we request, unless there is, exceptionally, a sound argument for excluding public discussion."
"May I also thank the President for quoting Montesquieu."
"He too was in favour of the threefold division of power, although not in a way that corresponds fully to the Commission’s mix of legislative, executive and judicial powers."
"It seems to me that Machiavelli was more of an inspiration than Montesquieu when the Commission’s powers were designed."
"– Mr President, President of the Commission, 2005 will unfortunately be remembered by Europeans as the year in which the Constitutional Treaty was rejected in two of the EU’s founding Member States."
"This should serve as a warning to us politicians that we are paying insufficient attention to our citizens."
"The European Union has not yet managed to become unified following its most recent enlargement to include 10 new Member States, and yet it is already preparing for the future accession of Turkey."
"The year 2007 could be a year of opportunity in terms of achieving a more unified Europe that demonstrates more solidarity if the old Member States open up towards the new Member States, particularly as regards liberalising their labour markets."
"Unfortunately there appear to be few countries with the courage of Spain and Portugal, which know from their own recent experience how difficult it is to be a second-class citizen in the European Union."
"I propose that any future enlargement of the European Union should either be full, or that it should not happen at all."
"I hope that in saying this I am also reflecting the will of the people of the Netherlands and France."
"It is not yet too late to deepen European unity by ensuring that it has a budget that lives up to its ambitions."
"2006 has drawn the attention of Europeans to the problem of energy supplies."
"Today more than ever, Europe needs a common energy policy."
"This would provide a good opportunity to improve the prospects of farmers, particularly in the new Member States, who could become involved in biofuel production."
"The worldwide process of globalisation is inevitable."
"Europe should regard it as a new challenge and as a development opportunity."
"It is our duty to help developing countries, but also to enhance our European social model and to care for those of our citizens who are least able to look after themselves."
"Mr President, as already stated by other Members of our Group who have spoken before me, we welcome the ideas concerning Commission policy for year 2007."
"I welcome them both in respect of the procedural issues and their content."
"In respect of procedural issues, I am pleased about the initiative that had already started last year as a result of the agreement reached between the European Parliament and the European Commission, ensuring that the European Parliament, including its committees, will have a greater involvement and opportunity to participate in the drafting of the annual policy strategy and legislation programme."
"I hope that the difficulties experienced last year will be eliminated this year."
"The content of the document submitted by the Commission, too, has undergone a significant change compared to previous years, and it points in the right direction."
"Paradoxically, we could also say that the fact that the document does not contain budgetary specifications due to the absence of financial perspectives has had a positive effect on it, as it enabled a better concentration on the political goals and tasks facing the European Union."
"At the same time, we should not forget the context in which this plan has been created, either."
"Over the past years, we have felt on several occasions that Europe is not moving forward, but backwards, and it does not take necessary steps."
"In the course of last year, we managed to take a few tentative first steps in the right direction, but we have a huge number of unfinished projects."
"Let us have a look at them, one by one."
"One such project is the Constitution, which I think we need to complete as soon as possible."
"If we want to avoid a European Parliament full of Euro-sceptic groups, we should make sure that the Constitution is routed in the right direction before the start of the European Parliament elections."
"We do not have a financial perspective, either."
"Therefore, the goals that are correctly formulated in this seven-year budget are not in place and do not have a firm foundation at the present time."
"We have made a correct step in the right direction in this respect, too, but we, here in Parliament, are not currently satisfied with the budget."
"When we talk about 2007, we also talk about enlargement, because Romania and Bulgaria will most likely become Member States of the European Union by then."
"While we feel that the tensions that had arisen in the European Union in relation with the last enlargement, due to a decrease in solidarity, are still unresolved, let us step into year 2007 in such a way that we work on the tensions that had come into existence in the course of the last enlargement."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, I would ask you to give more thought than you do in your paper to how you might better communicate to the public the contents and objectives you so rightly define."
"Mr Barroso, competitiveness is one of your important themes, it is one of our important themes!"
"I nevertheless see many citizens who believe it has nothing to do with them, that it is a matter only for industry, for big business."
"No, without greater competitiveness we will be unable to maintain the social system in Europe, without greater competitiveness we will be unable to maintain the social model of Europe."
"It is much the same with education."
"Education is not something of interest only to an elite."
"Education must reach broad sections of the population if we want to achieve one of Europe’s essential objectives, namely to prevent the exclusion of people or groups."
"Education is especially important, too, when we consider that we are a continent of immigration."
"It is most important for the integration of new immigrant citizens that we develop the education sector accordingly."
"So far as the Globalisation Fund you mention is concerned, we will in fact only be able to finance it if we also increase our competitiveness so that we do not risk having to call on this Globalisation Fund too often."
"A second example I would like to take, because you place a great deal of emphasis on it in your paper, is energy policy."
"I do not want to anticipate what the Members who will speak after me will have to say, but one important subject that you touched on is security of energy supply."
"I am very pleased that you visited Moscow recently and – from what I have heard – not without success, even though it is in many respects still up to Russia to take decisions, on the Energy Charter in particular."
"Finally, I have also heard that you have said we should also talk about nuclear energy."
"You are right and I am very pleased that we shall be hearing from the Commissioner responsible for energy shortly."
"Although I am sceptical about nuclear energy, we must still talk about it, and also about the risks it entails."
"If we are discussing proliferation these days in connection with Iran, then more nuclear energy also means more dangers unless we ensure, jointly and multilaterally, that the associated risks are minimised as much as possible."
"I think more ought to be said about this subject in particular, both by you and in the Green Paper."
"That is particularly the case, too, for infrastructure development."
"Because without more infrastructure – pipelines in particular, but in other areas as well – we will never be able to give this continent energy security and we will not give Europe the corresponding new technological boost."
"I fully support you on that."
"I wish you more strength and courage, however, in putting these decisions into effect."
"You mentioned Montesquieu, and someone else wanted Machiavelli."
"I wish you the wisdom of a Montesquieu, but also the strength and cunning of a Machiavelli, to get your programme through."
"Mr President, President Barroso’s quotation from Montesquieu prompted me to search the annual policy strategy for a clue as to what the Commission proposes to do with the Constitution."
"There are no clues."
"A policy strategy that fails to address the principal political blockage in front of the Union should be assessed fairly critically."
"Without the Constitution, the Union will fail to have the capacity to act to fulfil the Commission’s ambitions for it."
"Public opinion will remain sceptical about the European project and, without the support of public opinion, the Commission will lack the necessary clout inside the Council."
"The classical function of the Commission would be to broker an agreement between the warring partners in a crisis."
"I hope that Mr Barroso, when he addresses the parliamentary forum on 9 May, will be able to lay out a comprehensive Commission strategy towards finding a way out of the crisis."
"For all the value we find in Plan D, the best way to boost trust through action will be to salvage the Constitution."
"Perhaps it is now time for Plan B."
"– Mr President, Mr Barroso's intentions are certainly innocent."
"However, I fear that you will not be able to implement them, precisely because you do not have the money."
"There is no way, nor is your policy a policy which will allow Europe to flourish."
"There is not one, not one European citizen who this year will be better off financially than last year."
"Factories are leaving Europe for other countries."
"Women buy handbags with French labels which are made in Morocco."
"Your leather jacket is by a European designer, but it was made in Turkey."
"What does this mean?"
"It means increased unemployment."
"It means increased redundancies."
"It means that we are all becoming hostages to industry, which imposes policies like those in France, a policy which you did not rebut."
"It therefore means a worse life."
"It means increased prices."
"Nothing of all that you have in mind can be creative unless we get off the hook of the Maastricht indicators."
"Unless Maastricht is revised, Europe will develop into a poor neighbourhood."
"– I like Portugal and the Portuguese."
"Mr President, Commissioner, may I give you a very deeply felt piece of unambiguous advice?"
"Starting in May 2007, when Portugal will probably have the Council Presidency, history is once again offering you a historic open window for the European project."
"Yes, I am talking about Mr Duff’s Plan B and a lot more besides."
"You will have another chance to fit this European thing we have in front of us together in a meaningful way."
"I mean the very big thing."
"You may be able to lift it and go down in history with it, or you may fail completely."
"But please look now at the contributions that are really being made to the debate on the Constitution and the positioning of the European Union."
"Try to get out of the old thought patterns that got us into all these problems."
"Look across the wide ocean!"
"Think a little like Vasco da Gama – and I am not talking only about Chindia – and then fit it together so that we can really take advantage of this historic opportunity, which will present itself again, before the European project simply falls flat or implodes."
"I am curious to see what you will be able to say to us after May 2007."
"You ought to be telling us now that you will have something to say then, because otherwise it will be the same old trick again and that will quite certainly result in failure."
"Mr President, when I spoke on the Commission’s policy strategy at the end of last year, I commented on the fact that we had no sense whatsoever of priorities in that strategy."
"We have 62 priorities in this splendid new document."
"I also see that we have now proceeded from ‘moving up a gear’ to ‘boosting trust through action’."
"I am not sure whether Mrs Wallström is still there, and I do not know whether she is responsible for inventing these wonderful phrases, but we need a much more structured and practical strategy approach from the Commission than these gimmicky words."
"I also observe in here, Mr Barroso, that you are going to ‘take delivery up to cruising speed’!"
"Well frankly, that means that at the moment things are proceeding at a walking pace."
"We want some take-off from the Commission, not just cruising along."
"The problem with your strategy is not that we are short of new ideas or new initiatives, but we are actually short of real delivery of the policies that are going to create the jobs and growth of which you are so fond."
"Where is there a sense in here that you are putting some real resources and priorities into sorting out the problems of the internal market?"
"There is a little paragraph in here that you are going to streamline the regulatory approach, that is great, but where is it in your priority actions?"
"You used a great phrase – and I applaud you for it – about putting out the red carpet for small enterprises."
"There is not one single priority action, President Barroso, that mentions small enterprises."
"So, it is very welcome that we are having a debate about this, but we need better-quality material; we need material that is much more focused on real strategy and resource utilisation, rather than on these gimmicky words that Mrs Wallström appears to be giving you."
"We want something with a real sense that you are putting priorities on delivering the real foundations of the European Union and making the internal market work better, and not just coming out with a whole set of uncosted priorities that look good on paper but in respect of which there is no idea as to whether they are really going to work in practice."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, today I should like to concentrate on some of Europe's priorities for 2007 from the perspective of European enlargement."
"It can now be said that the 2004 enlargement has been a great success for Europe, from a political, security, economic and social point of view, and I am sure that 2007 will see that success continue."
"In 2007, the first new Member States are set to enter the euro zone."
"In this regard, I should like to challenge the Commission to be proactive in helping those countries to prepare for the arrival of the euro, and strictly to monitor compliance with entry requirements, the so-called Maastricht criteria."
"I am convinced that meeting the criteria, whether of Maastricht or of the Stability and Growth Pact, is crucial to preserving the political, financial and community credibility of the single European currency."
"In 2007, the new Member States of Central and Eastern Europe will also become part of the enlarged Schengen area."
"The scrapping of internal border controls between Member States, enabling genuine freedom of movement within the Union should under no circumstances mean enabling freedom of movement for all manner of criminality, illegal migration, and so forth. The fight against crime and violence in Europe, along with the launch of the second generation of the Schengen system should, to my mind, form part of the EU's clear and practical priorities for 2007."
"Lastly, 2007 should also be the year of the next enlargement, with the accession to the Union of Romania and Bulgaria."
"In this regard, I should like to call on the Commission to help these two countries to prepare for accession and to ensure that they fulfil their entry requirements in every respect."
"Romania and Bulgaria must be as properly prepared for accession as were the 10 accession countries in 2004."
"I believe that this is extremely important for the credibility of future enlargements and if the European public is to accept this process."
"I would like to inform Members that Mr Barroso, President of the Commission, is obliged to leave and has therefore requested permission to bring forward his speech in order to furnish some replies and clarifications."
"I give him the floor now, and immediately after his speech we shall resume the debate."
". Unfortunately, I have to leave shortly, as I have an official engagement with the Belgian authorities."
"I did not expect the sitting to carry on as late as it has, following the first part of proceedings in the Chamber before the beginning of this item on the agenda."
"Come what may, the Commission will be present until the end of the debate."
"I will still be able to answer some of the questions."
"I should first like to express my gratitude for the comments, which were for the most part in favour of our programme."
"There is obviously the underlying question of the financial perspective, which I shall discuss in a moment. In general, however, I feel I can say that the Commission's objectives for 2007 have been received positively."
"More specifically, Mr Watson asked why we put objectives relating to energy conservation and environmental protection under the heading of solidarity and not that of prosperity."
"Of course, they could and should come under the heading of prosperity, but we put them under solidarity in order to highlight their enormous importance, given that the term ‘solidarity’ refers to solidarity with future generations."
"The struggle for a clean environment and for sustainable development is of direct relevance to our future as a whole."
"This was what led us to put environmental issues under the heading of solidarity, in terms of presentation."
"As regards immigration, Mrs Frassoni said that we have never given our opinion on the issue of illegal immigration and the tragedy of the many Africans who die in the Mediterranean."
"I am sorry, but this is not true."
"There have been a number of clear Commission positions on this issue, expressed by Mr Frattini, and the truth of the matter is that we are fighting to achieve a joint approach, where possible, among the Member States on these issues."
"Mrs Frassoni also asked about the absence of any mention of transport in the context of energy policy."
"I am sorry, but the Green Paper says that we have proposed the following possible actions to the Member States, and I quote, from page 11 of the English text:"
"‘a major effort to improve energy efficiency in the transport sector, and in particular to improve rapidly urban public transport in Europe’s major cities’"
"Of course this is only a Green Paper, for consultation purposes, but that line is there."
"When it comes to energy efficiency, we feel that the transport sector is crucial."
"Let no one be in any doubt about this."
"One of the honourable Members mentioned the opening up of labour markets in Europe."
"You know that the Commission is in favour of this."
"On the back of our report, a number of Member States – not only those mentioned, namely Portugal and Spain, but also Finland and the Dutch Government – have announced their intention to promote the liberalisation of the labour markets in Europe at the earliest opportunity."
"This is moreover the case in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden."
"I gather that others are also considering facilitating the free movement of workers in the EU."
"Mr Swoboda asked how this can be better explained to our citizens, or, in other words, what we can do to explain Europe’s added value, which is a very important question."
"This is easier on some issues than others."
"Today, in fact, we announced a very important measure, the air safety ‘blacklist’, which is the first piece of legislation adopted by this Commission, with the support of Parliament and the Council."
"This is an issue on which the advantages of Community-level action are abundantly clear to the citizens."
"On issues such as these, we need to go the extra mile to provide explanations and argue our point of view."
"This is indeed the Commission’s job, but I should like to add, if I may, that all of us are responsible for doing this: it is also the responsibility of Parliament, the honourable Members, national parliaments, of all those who have Europe’s interests at heart and those who feel the necessity to explain the added value that Europe brings."
"On the nuclear issue, Mr Swoboda, our position is very clear: we respect the subsidiarity principle."
"This is a tough question in Europe; there are Member States in favour and others against."
"The way forward, as far as I am concerned, is not to avoid debate."
"Mr Swoboda mentioned my meeting with President Putin."
"I wish to tell you that, despite Russia's wealth of natural oil and gas resources, President Putin has stated that one of Russia’s main priorities in the future is to develop nuclear energy."
"This is therefore an issue that we cannot avoid; it is an issue that is on the agenda and that must be discussed frankly."
"The Commission is not taking sides in the nuclear energy debate. What we are promoting is the principle whereby each Member State finds forms of long-term, sustainable energy in its energy ‘mix’, whilst ensuring compliance with the subsidiarity principle."
"Mr Duff and others raised the question of the Constitution."
"This is not what we are discussing here today, but I should like to confirm that the Commission remains devoted to the principles and the values enshrined in the draft Constitutional Treaty, and we are working on this issue."
"We are thinking of bringing some ideas on the future of the European debate to the June European Council. Hopefully these ideas will make a worthwhile contribution."
"Although the Constitutional Treaty, as the name suggests, is an intergovernmental Treaty, the Commission is committed to honouring its responsibilities and will thus want to make its own contribution to this period of reflection."
"I do not know if it will be a contribution to rival the explorations made by Vasco da Gama in terms of ambition, as suggested by Mr Martin, but in any case it will be our contribution."
"In any event, I was happy today to hear Montesquieu, Machiavelli and Vasco da Gama mentioned in our debate, which shows that the level of debate in Parliament is moving ever upward."
"And now I shall make some comments in English – I always speak in English when I speak about money!"
"I got used to it during the British Presidency."
"So, now some remarks in English about the financial perspectives."
"My understanding is that real progress was made yesterday between the institutions."
"On the basis of compromise texts presented by the Commission, a third trialogue took place yesterday afternoon with the Austrian Presidency, the negotiating team from Parliament and the Commission."
"Our understanding is that the outcome of the meeting was largely positive."
"On the interinstitutional agreement itself, there is almost full agreement, including on the idea of adding a new Part Three on sound financial management."
"Subject to final technical verifications, texts have been agreed on important points such as the Financial Regulation, certification by Member States and the review clause."
"When I say ‘agreed’, I mean agreed between the delegations."
"They are agreements ."
"All these points have been considered key elements in various resolutions adopted by Parliament."
"I am pleased to see that the three institutions have been able to reach consensus on them and I am proud of the contribution that the Commission made to that agreement."
"As regards figures, Parliament and the Council have exchanged their views and evaluations based on the ceilings agreed at the December European Council."
"Let us be frank."
"There is still a big difference between the figures proposed by Parliament and those proposed by the Council."
"I want to be clear about this. The Commission supports the most ambitious possible agreement."
"The question, frankly, is: how far is the Council prepared to go?"
"I therefore appeal for a compromise to be reached as soon as possible."
"If there is no compromise, it will be negative for all of us in the European Union, in particular for the new Member States and those Member States and regions that really need our solidarity for their development."
"The solution could be to find the appropriate mix between three elements: flexibility, ways of mobilising the funds on the various flexibility mechanisms and, finally, the overall ceilings."
"There is light at the end of the tunnel!"
"A final trialogue is scheduled for 4 or 5 April 2006 in Strasbourg."
"It is my firm conviction that an agreement can be reached at that meeting."
"In the meantime, the Commission will continue to play its active role in seeking the most ambitious position, but, in the end, we need ambition with an agreement."
"Therefore, I approve of ambition but with realism and responsibility, trying to bring all the institutions on board."
"I know that the Austrian Presidency is actively seeking an agreement with all the Member States."
"Let me tell you that at the various meetings I have had with the Heads of Government – and this week I have had several – I urged them, both publicly and privately, to accept an increase in overall expenditure."
"I quoted, in particular, the need for education and culture: the Erasmus and citizenship programmes."
"There, at least, we should make a real effort and some progress is possible."
"Let us all work hard towards reaching a good agreement and then, if we have good intentions, a good strategy and good policies."
"Let us hope that we also have good instruments in terms of the financial perspectives."
"– Mr President, it is very important that Parliament should have the opportunity to hold a debate on strategy."
"2007 will be a crucial year for the future of the European Union."
"In order for a strategic debate to take place in Parliament, choices need to be put to the House."
"The President of the Commission has not explained the choices open to the Commission, even though politics is the art of choice."
"In first place is the constitutional question."
"Does the European Commission believe that the Constitution will be adopted in 2007, and does it have the opportunities and methods necessary to achieve this?"
"In second place is the important issue of employment."
"Is the answer to unemployment economic growth and reliance on economic freedom and the free movement of labour?"
"If not, why not return to Colbert and economic protectionism, which was once called economic patriotism?"
"In third place, the issue of the Lisbon Strategy is a key problem for the future of the European Union."
"The matter has been reduced to rhetoric, as on the one hand we claim that the future of the European Union depends on the Lisbon Strategy, while on the other hand, when deciding on the budget and on budget cuts, the first cuts are made to scientific research and the education system."
"The European Union has the ability to make Europe a place of innovation and a global partner, but to do this it needs a strategy."
"It is my belief that today’s debate is evidence of the importance of Parliament, and it would be a good idea if all the other European institutions took Parliament seriously."
"Mr President, I have read all 15 dreary pages of this document and believe it to be a report of the past rather than a document for the future."
"The phrase that comes to mind is one often seen on a schoolboy’s report: ‘could do better’."
"Indeed, if your dream is to change the minds of the people of the European Union, it is a ‘must do better’."
"We are treated to terms like ‘strategic objects’, ‘policy strategy’, ‘new directions’, ‘effective communications’ and ‘genuine dialogues’."
"We are promised that more money will be spent on regional funds, cohesion funds, social funds, globalised funds, fisheries funds, etc. – all this to gain the trust and commitment of the citizens."
"But where are the words ‘freedom’, ‘choice’ and ‘the individual’?"
"George Orwell’s comes to mind – except that I believe he got the year wrong, but it is just around the corner; then it will be ‘control, control, control’ of the individual."
"Given the referendums on the EU, or even the elections, the true sentiments of the people will show that most want to say ‘no’ to this bureaucratic nightmare."
"Mr President, I am sorry that President Barroso has been summoned by the Belgian authorities."
"I am sure if he parks his car more carefully in future he will be able to stay until the end of our debates, but no doubt the message will be taken back to him."
"I welcome the title of this document: ‘boosting trust through action’."
"Sometimes you boost trust through action, and sometimes by non-action."
"Sometimes it is by withdrawing action, by sunset clauses, by reviews, and it is always by checking the small print of the proposals."
"We do nothing to boost confidence among our electors by having silly stories as we have had in the United Kingdom this week about church organs, and the European Union’s intention under the WEEE Directive to ban church organ repairs and building because of the lead content."
"That is daft and I hope if there is any threat of that there will be a swift telephone call from the Vatican to say that St Peter’s Basilica will not stand for such nonsense."
"However, that is the small print."
"I believe we should be reconnecting with our constituents, we should relocate that purpose of our European venture and we should communicate it to the public."
"You do that for example by the next debate on energy, by showing that we are working together in solidarity to face any threats that there may be."
"Montesquieu has been quoted."
"As Dumas wrote, ‘all for one and one for all’: we need the European grid of energy which can resist any attempt to pick off any one of our Member States."
"It is also about working on health to make sure that we have the collective work done on the flu pandemic preparations."
"We must take up the Austrian proposal for a diabetes framework; we must work hard on the Commission’s own proposal on mental health."
"Mrs Wallström will agree with me that we must work hard to convince the public that we can get it right on chemicals and on pollution issues, eco-labelling and all those other things which would make sense to the public."
"They would see it as value added by the European Union and then we will not have the same problems that some of our Member States had recently in terms of voting in referenda."
"Based on my own country's experience of reforms, there is only one thing I can say with confidence: economic and political programmes are impossible to implement, unless there is reform of the actual institutions."
"I find it hard to imagine why the European Commission, which declares the simplification of regulation as its aim, is not changing its own structures, not reorganising the work of its institutions, which after all create those complex documents."
"These things are simply incomprehensible and inconsistent."
"Let me give you a simple example."
"Recently a delegation of Lithuanian lecturers paid a visit."
"They went around various directorates hoping to acquire information on the work of a directorate."
"Everywhere they were given the same information."
"And the Commissioner who came to our Budget Committee even said that not all funds are used for public relations and publicity campaigns."
"But all work is duplicated."
"The Lithuanian lecturers were quite astonished."
"We absolutely must do something with the reform of the European Commission's work."
"The European Parliament at least is showing some initiative and aims to reform its work, so that we can implement those ambitious goals."
"I always regret the fact that we do not draw upon the experience of the new countries."
"We, the new countries, really understand that, first of all, we must reform our institutions."
"I trust that the European Commission will present a reform programme for its government structure as soon as possible."
"Mr President, I would like to make three points."
"The first point is that I am actually playing the ‘good cop’ as opposed to the ‘bad cop’ like Malcolm Harbour."
"I think this strategy is quite good."
"The Commission is coming forward with this at a very opportune time, when there is an atmosphere of nationalism and protectionism."
"As a matter of fact, unlike many of the strategies that you have provided before, Mr Barroso – I would call them ‘nato’: no action talk only – this one has a lot of action."
"However, I agree with Mr Harbour that you might want to come up with an alternative name."
"You call this document – not necessarily very aptly – ‘boosting trust through action’."
"Perhaps you should seek some advice from an advertising agency before you come up with the next branding."
"It is a tough thing to do but that is not going to do it."
"The second point is that I agree with the focus on communication."
"Mrs Wallström, you of course play a very important part in doing that."
"We do not have a democratic deficit, we do not have an information deficit – we have almost too much of it – but we have a communication deficit."
"The paper that you put forward on European communication is quite good."
"We have big problems: John Bowis was talking about church organs a second ago and of course we know that it is utter rubbish."
"However, when respectable broadsheets like come up with headlines like ‘EU forces you to recycle dildos’, then you are in trouble."
"It was about a directive on electrical appliances: if you take the appliance back to a store, it must be recycled."
"However, it is this type of communication that we really need to get rid of."
"The final point I wanted to make is that the EU is very often used as a scapegoat."
"Everything that is bad comes out of the EU, everything that is good comes from the Member States."
"Therefore, I would encourage you, Mrs Wallström, to focus more on communication on the Constitution."
"It is a good Constitution, we need it; keep it alive until spring 2007 and let us see what happens after that."
". Mr President, we bring this document and annual policy strategy to the European Parliament in order to receive your input and ideas on how to improve it."
"We therefore listen to you very carefully."
"We have already heard a number of points that would improve our paper."
"The same goes for the discussion I had with the Conference of Committee Chairmen."
"This will give us a lot, since we are able to have a truly political discussion about our priorities, the balance we want to achieve and the messages we want to send."
"I think we are coming back to the fact that we want to achieve results and we want to win trust."
"These are basic and core conditions for us in order to build a stronger European Union."
"Whatever title we choose, there will be linguistic or other problems with it."
"I am not sure we will ever be able to find something on which everybody agrees."
"However, our aim is that, by showing good results and by delivering on our commitments, we will also be able to build trust."
"If we engage in a democratic discussion and debate with citizens, it will also be easier to explain why we need constitutional reform in order to achieve those good results."
"That is the way we have to go: we have to engage with citizens in a democratic manner."
"I am very happy to have the opportunity to tell all the people in the UK that church organ pipes are not covered by the directive on electronic and electrical waste."
"You can fill all your churches with as many leaded pipes as you want."
"The Commission will not interfere with that."
"Just make sure that now and then the poor people in the UK hear the truth, as they rarely receive correct information."
"You can rest absolutely assured that the directive does not cover church organ pipes."
"I also hope we can open up the Council meetings."
"The Finnish Presidency is now preparing to make that a reality, and this will definitely help to end the blame game."
"If citizens can follow what their ministers do in the Council – the kinds of positions they take and statements they make, if they are there at all – it will help to end the blame game."
"Acting in partnership, we will all have to explain what the European Union does and what it is."
"Perhaps we can make some progress."
"I hope that during the Austrian Presidency we have made progress, because this is also a concern of yours."
"Definitely under the Finnish Presidency, where we can take it a step further, we should make progress."
"Thank you for all your wise comments on the annual policy strategy."
"I will definitely take all your comments back with me and pass them on to all the other Commissioners."
"– The debate is closed."
"– The next item is the oral question to the Council (O-0007/2006 – B6-0009/2006) by Mr Chichester, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the security of energy supply."
". – Mr President, I am delighted to be putting this question on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"It follows the question that was debated in January on the subject of security of supply of energy."
"The world has moved on a little since then."
"We have now the Green Paper from the Commission and the conclusions of the Council meeting last week."
"Both of those are of great interest and show clearly that many of the points raised in debate previously have been taken on board."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner and congratulate the Council for doing that."
"It is also welcome that energy matters have risen to the top of the agenda."
"This is an issue crucially about import dependence on a range of fuels."
"Therefore, our question asks what the Commission will do in order to react appropriately to developments and changes in the geopolitical, strategic and diplomatic situation."
"However, I wish to emphasise that I feel those aspects are more within the purview of our colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"I am very happy for some of my colleagues who will follow in this debate to make those points."
"The most important point to make about security of supply is the essential requirement of diversity: diversity of fuel, diversity of source and diversity of technology."
"This is absolutely essential."
"I should like to make the point that I was a little disappointed in the Green Paper – which we look forward to debating in full and due course – because perhaps not enough recognition was given to the crucial role of nuclear energy in providing the largest share of electricity in the European Union."
"Parliament recently adopted an amendment seeking an ambitious but realistic target of 60% of electricity in the European Union coming from ultra-low or non-carbon-emitting sources."
"This is only possible with a combination of renewable energy sources and nuclear energy."
"I note with great pleasure that the Council conclusions refer to ‘sustainable and efficient energy systems’."
"Nuclear energy springs to my mind in that context."
"However, there are other energy sources that we must remember."
"Since the EU enlarged, our proportion of dependence on imports of coal has gone down from 50% to 35%, because one particular Member State is a significant producer of coal."
"We should not lose sight of the benefits and potential of clean coal technology when we have this significant indigenous energy source."
"The motion for a resolution attached to this oral question places emphasis, among other things, on greater efficiency in the transport sector."
"It places emphasis on the importance of researching and developing future energy technologies and it looks to proposals for improving energy efficiency in buildings."
"We have given the Commissioner four questions and we look forward to hearing from him in due course."
"We want to know what we can do about reducing our dependence on imported oil and gas."
"We want to know what other sources he thinks we may develop."
"Perhaps he has some thoughts on gas supplies, management of gas stocks and storage facilities for gas."
"Finally, we look to the Commission to weave into this issue of security of supply the related question of climate change and how we adjust our energy policy in a post-Kyoto era to achieve our three aims of sustainability, competitiveness and security of supply."
". Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Mr Chichester for the question."
"It comes at a good time."
"As a matter of fact, the Austrian Presidency was exactly eight hours old when the point was driven home to us that energy is a European problem, a problem for all of us, because at 8 a.m. on the morning of 1 January 2006, the gas conflict between Russia, Ukraine and Moldova actually began."
"It became evident that we needed to address this problem, despite it not being entirely new."
"However, its importance has become evident, especially during the course of this year."
"It is quite clear that for Europe, energy supply is a question of the highest importance."
"This is why the European Council meeting tomorrow will deal with this matter as one of its priorities."
"We also convened an additional extraordinary Council meeting of energy ministers, to which you have alluded, in order to prepare for the European Council meeting in the best way possible."
"That meeting of energy ministers came up with very useful and helpful suggestions which will be discussed tomorrow and the day after."
"It also became evident that, in connection with the gas dispute between Russia, Ukraine and Moldova, the question of energy supply is not only a question that we can discuss among ourselves."
"When I had the pleasure of reporting to the Committee on Foreign Affairs yesterday it was very much stressed that this is a question of the foreign policy of the European Union."
"This is because we need to cooperate with our partners and with our neighbours in order to take their problems into account."
"It is important for us to emphasise the political and economic stability of the transit country, for example."
"We also need to include countries of supply and consumer countries in our debates."
"This is why we have intensive relations in this connection with OPEC, Russia and other important countries such as China and India."
"We are also active as regards international instruments."
"I will just mention very briefly the International Energy Agency, the International Energy Forums and Euromed, which plays an important role."
"There are other important international agreements, such as for example the energy agreement with south-east Europe."
"I hope, Mr Chichester, that we will get the agreement of this House very soon, as we hope to receive this before the Ministers’ meeting in June."
"There are of course also other important aspects to the security of energy supply, such as the question of the diversification of our energy sources, especially to include domestic energy sources, in particular, too, the question of renewable energy sources."
"Demand management, including improving the efficiency of energy use, is also of highest importance in this connection, however."
"In talking to its partners, the Council regularly emphasises that adequate investment in infrastructure and exploration are also crucial."
"For this reason, the Council also considers it of the highest importance that the resolution of the European Parliament and the Council on trans-European energy networks should be adopted soon, since it will be impossible to diversify supply and hence have greater security of supply without resources to expand the European energy network."
"So far as the security of supply in particular is concerned, the Council has in the past already adopted legal provisions, which I will not mention in detail now for reasons of time."
"I will refer briefly also to the Directive on measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply, which was adopted in 2004."
"Turning now to your question about alternative energy sources, Mr Chichester, the Council believes that two main components of energy policy deserve particular mention here, and I have already referred to them briefly: the question of diversification of fuel sources and energy efficiency."
"As has already been said in today’s debate – energy was a key element in the debate you have just concluded, and rightly so – the Member States must themselves decide on the energy mix they will choose as an expression of their national policies."
"Whatever the Member States decide, diversification of fuel sources naturally includes – and I think this is particularly important – diversification of supplier countries, so far as energy imports are concerned; but renewable energy sources are also particularly important here."
"In this connection, the Council can also point to a whole series of instruments, which I shall mention only briefly here."
"Regarding the diversification of fuel sources, especially through the use of renewable energies, the Council and European Parliament have already adopted a Directive on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in 2001."
"I would also like to draw your attention in this connection to the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and the Council on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport."
"In December last year, agreement was also reached with the European Parliament on the draft directive on energy efficiency and energy services, which I hope can be adopted in the next few months; we are working to that end."
"So much on the question of energy saving."
"I would also like to point out that the ‘Intelligent Energy for Europe’ Programme is already making an important contribution here as part of the sixth Framework Research Programme."
"The seventh Framework Research Programme and the ‘Intelligent Energy for Europe’ Programme currently under discussion as part of the CIP Programme will also contain an appropriate and relevant priority."
"There are also measures in the non-legislative sphere; only last year, for example, the energy ministers made a contribution to the 2005 Spring European Council."
"The Council is currently looking very urgently and attentively at the Biomass Action Plan, which has a high priority for us."
"Mr Chichester, I would like to conclude by referring to your question about Kyoto post 2012, the security of energy supply and the competitiveness of the European Union and saying that in our view this effect may be fundamentally positive."
"It seems to me particularly important to say that we are convinced that a well-designed environment policy will have a positive effect on growth and employment."
"Measures to promote energy efficiency lead to ecological innovations and environmental technologies, and demand for such innovations is growing steadily all over the world."
"This is also creating opportunities for our economies."
"By diversifying energy sources and especially by promoting renewable energy sources, we also want to make a contribution to the security of energy supply and at the same time to stemming climate change and increasing the competitiveness of the EU as a whole."
". Mr President, the previous debate on the Commission’s work programme focused a lot on energy."
"I am very grateful for this and for the question that was put to the Commission and made this debate possible."
"In a way, the Green Paper on a European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy has given the answers as to how we should proceed in addressing the challenges set out in your question."
"We should also realise that this is a global challenge: the tightness of supply and demand, climate change, import dependency and investment needs in the energy sector are all global challenges."
"The response from the European Union is a common energy policy."
"We have significant support from citizens."
"In a recent opinion poll, 47% of European citizens supported action at European level."
"We received a lot of support from many Member States and national parliaments after the publication of the Green Paper."
"It is clear that the main added value of this Green Paper lies in this common approach where we stress that security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability cannot be separated in our energy policy."
"All three should interact."
"At the same time, it is also clear that we cannot find a silver bullet and there is no silver bullet."
"It means that in the area of energy policy we should focus on a set of measures in specific areas."
"Firstly, it is important for security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness to provide a really competitive, open, transparent EU internal market."
"That is also crucial for security of supply."
"We provide for some actions that really provide for not only stronger competition but also cross-border trade: cross-border energy transactions."
"This is an extremely important area and I expect support from this House in the future on these issues."
"The second issue, which is extremely important – as the President-in-Office indicated – is solidarity."
"The Union is strong when there is solidarity."
"Solidarity means, firstly, being ready for extreme situations; secondly, it involves the solidarity mechanism and, thirdly, it involves a lot of information on what is happening on the energy markets."
"I agree that diversity is the most important issue, but to use this diversity in the best possible way we need a lot of information and a lot of transparency."
"We provide for such measures by revisiting the oil stocks directive, placing more focus on the security of supply of electricity and gas and looking for new mechanisms that really correspond to the needs of our citizens, who would like to know that should an extreme situation arise, we have a mechanism and reserves in place that could be used in such a situation."
"Then there is the issue of the energy mix."
"That should be the responsibility of each Member State – it is a question of subsidiarity."
"However, we know that action in one particular Member State influences all the other Member States, at least the neighbouring Member States."
"That means that we should take action taking into account our neighbours’ energy policies and try to boost the best possible actions."
"A strategic EU energy review, which would allow us to revisit these issues continually, is necessary to provide the best approach in terms of each state’s energy mix."
"Energy efficiency and renewable energy development will definitely be on the rise in deciding an energy mix."
"However, at the same time, I also believe that the nuclear energy that is now in the energy mix will be used in many Member States."
"It is important, however, to ensure that this energy is used in a safe and sustainable way."
"I also believe in the diversity that could bring us new technologies and in clean coal, carbon sequestration and so on. We now have a good example with the Shell and Statoil project involving carbon sequestration and post-combustion."
"This is not a demonstration project: for the first time, a real industrial project involving 860 megawatts is bringing new possibilities for a diversification in the energy mix that corresponds to the objectives of our energy policy."
"Some people have indicated that there is not enough focus on energy efficiency."
"I disagree, as there is a lot of emphasis on it."
"Parliament has debated the Green Paper on energy efficiency."
"We will propose a very ambitious European action plan on energy efficiency, which will place a lot of emphasis on transport."
"However, the focus on energy efficiency will be continued in all Member States through their national action plans and this is extremely important."
"Regarding technology, I mention just one example: Europe is able to provide for new technologies, but we should use all the possibilities in a coherent way."
"I believe that the European strategic energy technology plan really could make a difference."
"Last, but not least, the areas I should like to bring to your attention are international."
"The best response for security of supply is not only diversity, but also lies in global, transparent and competitive gas and oil markets."
"This is the vision that could provide the necessary diversity."
"For this to happen, we need to stabilise the countries that have gas and oil resources."
"We should build infrastructure that allows us to bring more gas from different regions in the world, because only in this way can we provide security of supply in gas and oil."
"We should promote our vision of the market to the near neighbourhood."
"The energy community should be expanded."
"Tomorrow, the European Council will have the opportunity to debate these issues."
"I believe that the momentum created by the Green Paper for establishing a European common policy in energy will be continued."
"I am very grateful for the debate and I look forward to working with this House towards establishing a European energy policy that corresponds to the basic needs of our citizens."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner Piebalgs, ladies and gentlemen, for several months we have been in the middle of a new strategic debate."
"We see the conflict with Iran, and the war in Iraq, but we also see conflict with OPEC countries where we would not have thought that such developments would occur."
"We see that China is making strategic purchases on the energy markets; we see that Russia is moving away from a continuous, reliable policy; and we see that world markets are undergoing very dynamic developments."
"We therefore need to stand by our goals, the goals of the Lisbon Agenda."
"We want growth and employment."
"Therefore, energy policy – and I should like to thank Commissioner Piebalgs for putting the focus on energy efficiency – is a top priority."
"This could open up whole new areas of business to our small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It creates jobs in craft trades, and small business cycles that give us energy security."
"On the other hand, we must not forget the competitiveness of our energy industry."
"In this respect, I call in particular on the Commission to look closely into the impact of the Kyoto Protocol post-2012 on our energy-intensive primary industries, such as the steel and aluminium industry and many other sectors, and on our generation of energy."
"I think that we also need to look at the environmental aspects of sustainability, with particular reference to competitiveness."
"I call on the Commission and Mr Barroso to make use of the various services of the Commission – be it with regard to communications strategy, taxation policy, external economic relations, foreign policy, competition policy or environmental policy – in taking on this important task, which is hugely significant for our future in Europe."
". Mr President, we live in a world that is increasingly starved of energy."
"The main consumers – the Americans and Europeans – cannot deny the Chinese, Indians and others the right to strive after our living standards and to consume more energy."
"With an increasing global demand, the consumer countries must unite in the face of markets that are organised into cartels with the aim of influencing the level at which prices are set."
"In a context such as this, energy savings and increased energy efficiency are the main priority."
"The International Energy Agency has calculated that if computer manufacturers were simply forced to reduce the amount of energy consumed by computers in standby mode to one watt, instead of the current ten watts, this would save the equivalent of twenty 1 000 megawatt power plants."
"We need to make more use of renewable energy sources: Brazil produces 700 million litres of ethanol, a by-product of its sugar industry;"
"Mauritius saves 20 000 tonnes of oil by burning fibrous waste in its power stations;"
"Sweden is going to force all of its service stations to offer biofuels; and, in Fiji, diesel engines are being run on copra oil."
"That being said, renewable energy sources cannot totally replace traditional energy sources."
"Technological breakthroughs are needed in relation to solar energy, hydrogen cells and so on. Even wind power, for which Europe has significant offshore potential, requires substantial investment to make the networks secure."
"The world will not be able to give up coal and nuclear power in a hurry."
"These choices are the responsibility of the Member States, which must freely decide what their energy mix will be."
"Europe will have to invest more in research on energy efficiency, on renewables, on carbon sequestration, on clean coal, on nuclear safety and on fusion."
"The Union will have to implement a more united energy policy."
"It must complete its internal market by preventing a situation whereby the markets are divided up to the advantage of oligopolies."
"I will conclude by saying that the Spring Council must make a decision: a Europe without a common energy policy will be nothing other than a weak power."
"Mr President, Commissioner, representatives of Austria, ladies and gentlemen, it is hard to conceive just how incredibly dependent Europe is on imports, and that puts us in a very worrying situation."
"We need to overhaul production and distribution and to regulate the market in such a way that it operates properly."
"In other words, consumer rights and transfer capacity need to be regulated, and the dominant position of the big energy companies looked into."
"We are not using existing technology."
"We are reducing research appropriations in the ongoing budget negotiations, and industry is not being given the clear signals it needs if it is to dare to invest and to do so on a long-term basis."
"The Member States themselves choose their energy mix, and that is all to the good."
"We are now at a stage at which the Green Paper has arrived."
"We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe support the Green Paper and find it extremely constructive, as, too, we do Mrs Kroes’ work on the issue of competition."
"Mr Winkler, you began, however, by saying that, at eight o’clock on 1 January, Europe was given a shock where energy was concerned and that we were given it by Russia."
"In this situation, many heads of national governments are now getting nervous and wish to re-regulate."
"They want to see protectionism within the energy sector, a development that would be diametrically opposed to what the Council has previously said it wanted to see and to what the Commission and Parliament want to see."
"That is a disgrace when we are at a stage at which, by siding with them, we can help the new Member States obtain stability where the supply of energy is concerned and at which we can solve major environmental problems."
"It is a disgrace to put forward these arguments when we can also create so many jobs in Europe."
"I am sorry to say that our own Swedish head of government, Göran Persson, has today said that he wishes to re-regulate the Swedish energy market."
"If you go on doing what you have always done, you will go on getting what you have always got, as the saying goes. We cannot, however, afford to have such a situation in Europe any longer."
"We need extremely tough decisions to be taken, and Austria, which will chair tomorrow’s meeting of the Council of Ministers, has a heavy responsibility."
". Mr President, the Heads of State or Government will meet tomorrow for an energy summit."
"Will they discuss energy?"
"I fear they will not; tomorrow Mr Berlusconi will put on a big show, and Enel will announce that it is going to take over Suez."
"In other words, it will be a show for the Italian elections, and Mr Villepin and President Chirac will use the whole affair to paint themselves once again as national heroes in a French government that is falling apart."
"These are all just smoke bombs over the internal market."
"What is the real issue in the EU's internal market?"
"As it currently operates, it is the biggest economic mistake that Europe has ever experienced."
"Enel fleeces Italian consumers, Endesa fleeces Spanish consumers, Suez fleeces Belgian consumers and E.ON fleeces German consumers."
"And now we are supposed to be discussing whether we have national champions or – as Mr Barroso says – even bigger European champions that are even more dominant in their markets and put consumers and competitiveness in Europe at even greater risk."
"No, that is not the question!"
"The real question is this: will we ultimately win through politically, and be able to regulate appropriately and independently and separate the networks from everything else?"
"Transport policy must be central to energy policy, and, until it is a central element, all of these documents are just paper tigers."
"The most important contributions we have to make by means of our policies are long-term goals, renewable energy, efficiency and CO2 targets – otherwise there can be no security of investment."
"What this debate is lacking, it seems to me, is a new methodology."
"We have not so far managed to achieve good coordination at all levels."
"In other words, we need new partnerships."
"And what is Mr Barroso doing, going around like a bull in a china shop as usual?"
"He is putting energy, an issue that divides European citizens more than any other, at the centre of the debate!"
"Is it even possible to act with less political sense that Mr Barroso is currently doing with regard to the press?"
". Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, we know the large oil companies’ forecasts."
"They say that by 2030 approximately 80% of the world’s energy will still be produced from fossil fuels."
"History shows that these forecasts are credible, even if we were to do everything possible to save energy, improve energy efficiency, support the use of alternative forms of energy and use biofuels, and even if we were to build more nuclear power stations while decommissioning the old reactors."
"It is a well-known fact that there are no longer any major oil deposits in the EU countries and the gas in our region will also be used up over the course of the next 10 years."
"According to the Green Paper just out, EU import dependency as a whole will have risen to 71% by 2030."
"If the oil companies’ predictions that our energy needs will mainly be met by using fossil fuels come true, there will be fiercer competition for these fuels."
"The EU wants to satisfy all of the growth in its energy needs by using gas."
"The development of the liquefaction of gas will aggravate the situation, favourable to the EU countries, whereby the majority of the world’s gas reserves are on the Eurasian continent at the end of pipeline connections."
"The availability and price of oil and gas are crucially influenced by competition for the same natural resources by China and other countries in the Far East, resources which hitherto have been almost exclusively used by the OECD countries."
"Our group supports the Commission in its search for alternatives."
"There is no other solution which is as simple."
"If we continue with a policy of burning fossil fuels, the EU will need to establish good commercial relations with Russia."
"Finally, let me say a word about ‘European solutions’."
"A policy that results in the price of electricity rising in some countries in order that it can come down in others is unacceptable."
"For some countries, this is a form of solidarity that is too expensive."
"Mr President, Mr Piebalgs, ladies and gentlemen, what has happened in recent weeks with the Suez-Enel case and what is happening at the moment regarding E.on’s bid for Endesa, which has been blocked by the Spanish Government’s decree increasing the powers of the national energy council, confirms a regressionist tendency of the Member States with regard to the principles and rules on which the European Union is based."
"Only yesterday, Mr Barroso said, ‘I hope that the heads of government will answer the question: do they have the political will to find European solutions to European problems?’"
"The energy problem has been examined by the Commission in all its aspects in a valuable, almost point-by-point analysis, which I do not want to go into here because it is well known to all."
"In the joint resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group concerns are voiced that all European citizens today share, and solutions are put forward that a majority of citizens and Member States would like to see."
"On one point, however, the proposal is deficient, and that is in relation to the decision-making centres."
"How many are there, and which are they?"
"In yesterday’s statement, again, Mr Barroso spoke of the existence of 25 different energy markets and 25 different policies in the sector."
"In addition to this devastating statistic with regard to the hoped-for converging policies of the EU, there is the need to guarantee the physical security of Europe’s energy infrastructure against the risks of natural disasters and terrorist attacks, as well as its security against political risks, including interruptions of supply."
"The question I put to each and every one of us is: ‘Can Europe be governed by 25 different governments, or has the moment perhaps been reached when European strategy regarding foreign policy, security and energy should have a single decision-making centre in order to be able to deal in a timely and consistent manner with the challenges now thrown up by the fast-moving modern world?’"
"Mr President, recent interruptions to the energy supply have resulted in a renewed awareness of the vulnerability of imported energy."
"Energy is essential to every country."
"What lessons can we learn about security of supply?"
"It is now a fact that energy policy and foreign policy are inter-related."
"The European Union has to beware of pressure from energy-producing countries, and if it is to do that, then greater diversification of energy suppliers is a political necessity."
"Furthermore, the crisis situation involving Russia and Ukraine has made the option of importing liquid natural gas from other regions a live issue once more."
"The fragile functioning of the internal market is also demanding our attention, and recent debate on the creation of national champions should not distract us from that."
"The Member States already possess powerful instruments to deal with issues of security of supply; in addition to drawing on a wider variety of sources of energy, they can also call more upon their emergency reserves."
"Such measures, as well as enhanced cooperation between the Member States, enable us to move forward in ways in which a detailed European energy policy does not."
"Caution is also a prime requirement in concluding an energy agreement with Russia."
"Critical distance is preferable to further integration in the energy sector with countries with which our relations are less than stable."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe’s dependence in the energy sector is worrying, as the Commission’s Green Paper shows."
"Italy is even more dependent in the energy field, as Enea and Istat data irrefutably confirm."
"Italy has an energy production capacity of only approximately 30 million tonnes of oil equivalent and has to import energy from abroad, and its dependency has grown to about 85% in 2005 as against 83% in 2001 and 81% in 1995."
"Within the European Union, only Ireland, Luxembourg and Portugal are more energy-dependent than Italy."
"Italy’s energy needs are therefore strongly dependent on oil, which comprises 45%, and gas, comprising 32%."
"The rise in energy prices translates for everyone into greater expenditure on petrol and on electricity and gas bills, and environmental concerns also influence choices in this field, to the extent that the nuclear option is becoming topical again."
"In order to combat energy dependence we have to make the supply system more flexible, rationalise the use of energy, distribute energy locally both with small conventional facilities and with renewables, and invest more in research: it seems that it is no longer possible to delay thermodynamic solar power, geothermic energy, the use of biomass, the introduction of new combined gas cycles in electricity generating systems and, lastly, the revival of nuclear power."
"These are the issues and the challenges of the future, but we need to ask ourselves why Italy and Europe are still losing ground to Russia and, above all, to China."
"Gas and oil from Iran to China and Russia, energy flows and resources in which European companies have for decades invested a huge amount of research capital – all this has been wasted for the sake of servility to non-EU interests."
"This means that Europe is once again missing a great opportunity for development, security and social well-being, and is increasing its dependence in terms of both energy and politics."
"Europe must find the courage to make geopolitical choices appropriate to its interests if it truly wishes to secure a future for its peoples."
"This is the kind of revolutionary action, above and beyond existing directives, that Europeans expect from the Commission and the Council."
"Mr President, energy, as we have recently witnessed, is also sometimes treated as a weapon for exerting political influence by states which enjoy a quasi-monopolistic position, as in the Russia/Ukraine case."
"That is what really triggered this sudden interest in energy policy."
"The problem should therefore be considered as a foreign and security policy issue and so, besides Commissioner Piebalgs, I would willingly address Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner."
"It is essential for the EU to develop a true external security policy dimension in relation to gas and oil deliveries, which is distinct from energy policies ."
"We should not mix them up."
"The question is, what added value can the EU offer in the event of politically motivated cuts in energy supplies?"
"Proposals, as included in the Green Paper, go in the right direction, although they are still too modest."
"Solidarity, as one of the main principles of European integration, creates an obligation to assist all those Member States which are in difficulty."
"We must extend this solidarity principle to problems related to energy supply shortages caused by political action."
"What is needed is cooperation and solidarity, not competition among Member States in securing external energy supplies, as happens today."
"The forthcoming Spring Council should, above all, consider three issues of utmost importance: first, mutual assistance among Member States in case of energy supply cuts; second, mutual consultation mechanisms among Member States for major gas and delivery contracts; and third, the inclusion of an energy security clause in all EU treaties with third countries, which are either a source of energy or a transit country."
"An energy security clause should impose an obligation to follow a certain code of conduct and to promise not to use energy delivery as an instrument of political pressure."
"The time has come to move beyond declarations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, energy policy has a clear external dimension, which emerged dramatically in the January crisis between Russia and Ukraine."
"For its part, the European Union has in recent years put in place policies such as strategic cooperation with Russia, the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, the Neighbourhood Policy and the agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council."
"These relations involve the main oil and gas producing countries."
"The energy issue has been tackled in a disjointed manner: from liberalisation of the markets to security of supply, efficiency and better use of resources."
"To date, all this has not looked like a structured policy."
"The European Council meeting tomorrow and the day after will tackle these issues, but European governments seem divided over whether we need to have a common policy or whether we should continue with bilateral relations based on historical, geographical or political factors."
"As the European Parliament, we support the Commission’s efforts and at the same time ask for more."
"This will not be possible, however, without answers to some major questions."
"Are we intending to reduce overall dependence on fossil fuels?"
"By how much?"
"Are we able to estimate future needs on this point?"
"Are we setting ourselves the target of coordinating demand with other importing countries, above all developing countries?"
"Will we submit a single, unanimous proposal at the next G8 meeting in Saint Petersburg?"
"The answers to these questions presuppose something very like a European energy plan."
"The Green Paper constitutes a first step, but there is a lot more to be done and the European Parliament naturally wishes to be fully involved in this policy."
"This resolution is a very important and timely document, expressing the European Parliament's position on the changing situation in the European Union energy sector."
"The resolution marks the beginning of the debate on the Green Paper for a safe, competitive and harmonious energy policy."
"Alongside energy consumption efficiency, the variety of energy sources mentioned in the resolution is the fundamental factor in reducing European Union states' dependence on the supply of energy resources from third countries."
"Significant attention is paid to the area of nuclear energy, as nuclear energy is an inseparable part of the European Union energy sector."
"It is very important for Lithuania and other states, which have insufficient wind, solar and geothermal power or other alternatives to gases and oils."
"It is right that initiative to develop nuclear energy should remain the prerogative of Member States."
"Legislation must be laid down so that part of the funding allocated to agricultural policy is available for biomass growth, production and energy needs."
"The principle of energy solidarity between Member States is extremely important."
"It is important in talks with the wider world."
"When planning energy sector projects, Member States should assess the consequences these will have on other countries."
"Therefore, I believe we should focus on revising the annexes of the TEN-E."
"The project list contains conflicting views of what I would call the political Northern Pipeline in the Baltic Sea."
"Unfortunately, it fails to mention any of the projects which are important for the Baltic countries and Poland, such as the ‘Amber’ pipeline or electricity connections, allowing the isolated Baltic region to be quickly switched into the European area."
"– Mr President, I greatly fear that the Commission proposal on natural gas, which comes in the wake of the Russian/Ukrainian crisis, is not commensurate with circumstances or requirements."
"It is inadequate."
"If we want to achieve the objectives set by the Commission, we need to invest more and more in drastically strengthening renewable sources of energy, in saving energy, in developing energy networks."
"With the budgets that you are preparing, these objectives cannot be achieved; we cannot make serious progress in constructing a common energy policy, we cannot achieve cheaper and better technology for renewable sources and energy savings with the money provided under the 7th framework programme for these objectives and, with the steps that you propose for the common energy policy, we cannot combat the practices of the cartels that rule – live and rule – at the expense of consumers and of a unified Europe in energy matters."
"One more thing: renewable sources of energy are one thing and nuclear energy is another."
"Do not try to put everything in one basket and use renewable sources of energy like a big curtain to cover the truth, which is that a large proportion of European citizens feel anything from reservations to opposition to the use of nuclear energy and that cannot be made to disappear with a magic wand."
"– Mr President, the reliability of energy supplies to the European Union is dwindling with each passing month as our reliance on imported energy grows."
"The only thing we can afford to lose in this respect are unreliable and unpredictable partners."
"Their role on the European energy market should be kept within safe boundaries."
"To the surprise of many – but by no means all – European countries, Russia has recently proved to be one such unreliable partner."
"Russia’s supplies have recently become restricted because of climatic conditions in Siberia, the lack of security for pipelines in the north of the country and the uncontrollable urge to use energy as a means of exerting political pressure on the country’s western-oriented neighbours."
"For this reason energy cooperation cannot be confined to countries within the European Union."
"Our energy problems come precisely from outside the European Union."
"However, some of the solutions also lie outside the European Union, for example the Norwegian oil fields, which is why not only energy policy, but also trans-European networks should transcend the boundaries of the European Union."
"This is why an enhanced neighbourhood policy should incorporate energy, and this is why the Polish proposal for an energy pact based on solidarity, and boldly transcending the boundaries of the European Union, should be the subject of more serious discussion at the coming summit."
"Energy security is above all a matter of foreign and defence policy."
"It is naïve to pretend that new sources of energy or the imposition of restrictions on industry, such as climate agreements, are the solution."
"For a long time to come, renewable sources of energy will remain an expensive addition to our energy resources."
"Imposing excessively severe restrictions on European industry, often on the basis of dubious scientific assumptions, is a factor restricting our competitiveness."
"Mr President, the EU’s shambolic liberalisation of the energy market has already resulted in gross distortions."
"Good Europeans, like Britain, diligently liberalise their markets but bad Europeans, like France and Germany, have refused to do so."
"Liberalisation has directly resulted in enormous increases in the wholesale gas price in the UK."
"The EU has added more than GBP 200 per annum to the average UK gas bill."
"Now the EU wants a common energy policy so it can get its hands on what remains of Britain’s gas and oil reserves."
"Mr Chichester asks how the Council and Commission will react to developments in the world energy market and how supplies will be secured: it is the right question, but it has been put to the wrong people."
"He should be putting it to the British Government."
"The Conservative Party, in the form of Mr Chichester, is yet again inviting the European Union to meddle further and deeper in Britain’s affairs."
"Britain should follow the example of France and Germany and protect its own national interests and those of its domestic energy consumers."
"Mr President, over the coming days, the Heads of State or Government will debate the possibility of launching a common energy policy."
"Both the governments and the citizens have become aware of the seriousness of the situation, of the vulnerability of our system of supply, of our dependence on imports and of our urgent need to take measures which are a match for the circumstances."
"The European Parliament fully shares the citizens’ concerns and we in this House must therefore send a clear and strong message in favour of energy independence for the Union."
"To this end, we must support a complete energy mix, with a prominent role for emission-free energy sources, such as nuclear and renewable energy."
"The time has come seriously to consider the possibility of investing in alternative supply routes, in order to reduce the impact of situations such as the recent crisis between Russia and Ukraine."
"On the supply side, we must place the emphasis on improving energy efficiency at all levels of consumption and production."
"In this regard, the dissemination of information and good practices is crucial."
"We must take a firm position in favour of a genuine free internal energy market, improving infrastructures and interconnections and leaving behind once and for all the outmoded notion of great national champions."
"We are in the 21st Century, in an increasingly integrated European Union, and this is not the time to move backwards."
"Let there be no mistake: protectionism does not just harm our economies and our competitiveness, but above all it harms the consumer."
"In a globalised world, the national giants are minnows at world level, and Europeanist speeches are of little use if, when it comes to making decisions, words have not been followed up with concrete actions."
"I shall end, Mr President, by calling upon the Council not to miss this opportunity."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are caught up in a persistent energy crisis."
"The reason is obvious: the gap between consumption and supply is so narrow that almost anything can make prices soar."
"This can happen, for example, as a result of a storm on the other side of the ocean, and many other things."
"We have a good solution to this problem: energy cooperation within the Union."
"That, however, is being prevented by an ‘anti-solidarity movement’ on the part of certain Member States, which has actually grown among the founding members."
"They do not permit competition in their own countries, but they buy up energy companies in other countries using this idle money."
"Nothing is achieved this way. They also did the same in the telecommunications sector, when the telecom markets were to be opened up."
"As a consequence, we had buyers from abroad once again."
"If we in the European Union do not show solidarity, we can forget about the energy solutions which are being discussed here."
"One condition of a common energy policy is to have shared objectives, which our leaders commit to and which they do not simply take advantage of, as is now the case."
"How should this be achieved?"
"I suggest that Finland should hold an energy summit, where government leaders can agree on a ."
"By doing this we can steer a path away from a situation in which we are continually crisis-prone."
"Finland could organise the meeting as a favour, especially since the question of Russian energy is very relevant there, something that many Members have alluded to."
"We have long experience in this area."
"The Russian energy dialogue, which has made rather poor progress and is fairly secret because the Council hardly ever participates in it, could be linked to the summit at the same time."
"That way we could kill two birds with one stone and increase solidarity."
"Mr President, I am pleased the joint resolution is balanced and not a knee-jerk reaction."
"Energy has shot up the political agenda, but geo-political initiatives are only one part of tackling the security of supply problem."
"The way forward still lies largely in our own backyard."
"We need to tackle the demand side of the equation by putting real effort into implementing energy efficiency measures and by developing indigenous sources of energy, particularly renewables."
"This is underlined by the paragraphs on sustainable energy sources and amplified by a number of amendments which we in the ALDE Group will be supporting."
"Even on the issue of gas supply, much of the answer lies close to home."
"Heavy industrial users in the north-east of England have had to fight to get hold of gas supplies even at inflated prices because the market is simply not working."
"The Spring Council tomorrow needs to bite the bullet and name and shame those Member States who have failed to open up their gas markets."
"– Mr President, the supply of energy and the use of all sources of energy are a political option which must aim to take a combined approach to all grass-roots requirements, such as reducing energy dependency, saving energy, ensuring residents are safe, protecting the environment and safeguarding energy products as a social – not a commercial – commodity."
"The European Union is promoting the policy of liberalisation by sacrificing the satisfaction of grass-roots requirements to the profitability of private investors."
"The Green Paper comes within this framework of competitiveness and the anti-grass roots Lisbon Strategy and even uses renewable sources of energy as a vehicle for introducing private capital into the energy sector."
"Citing environmental protection is hypocritical and conceals the spiritual objectives of the European Union concerning the speeding up of liberalisation, the promotion of the relevant Community products and the restriction of dependency on imported fuel."
"A way out could be found through a single energy agency which would belong to the people and would function within the framework of an economy with nationalised basic means of production."
"This would address the crucial issues and ensure that energy is a social, not a commercial commodity."
"– Mr President, Poland is particularly susceptible to policies that exploit supplies of natural gas and crude oil to the country as a means of exerting political pressure."
"Such policies are implemented by the main supplier of these fuels, namely Russia."
"That is the reason behind the Polish Government’s initiative, which has been submitted to the European institutions and which would enable us to implement a solution to the problem of energy security based on the principle of ‘one for all and all for one’, or in other words the principle of solidarity."
"Unfortunately this initiative was received rather coolly by the largest EU Member States, as most of them are trying to push through solutions that benefit themselves, even if it is at the cost of other Member States."
"A perfect illustration of such a policy is the construction of the northern gas pipeline across the Baltic Sea, following an agreement between Russia and Germany."
"Although this will indeed greatly improve Germany’s energy security in the future, it will threaten the economic interests and energy security of countries such as Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and others outside the European Union, such as Ukraine."
"What is required is therefore concerted action by the Member States, or in other words a common energy policy."
"This is why the Polish initiative I mentioned earlier merits serious debate."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, I want to talk, not about energy policy as such, but about the foreign and security policy actions associated with it."
"In view of the fact that Russia, it seems, is using energy as a political weapon this winter, and in view of the situation in the Middle East, we need to realise that the issue of security of energy supply is an extremely problematic matter, more so than we have experienced in a long time."
"For this reason, we need to develop and implement a number of things in close cooperation between the Committee on Foreign Affairs and your committee, Mr Chichester; for example, we need to call on Russia to finally settle the Energy Charter and to ratify it, in order to guarantee energy security."
"We must make it clear – perhaps through foreign policy measures, but also by promoting competition – that there must be a difference in ownership between the producers and the suppliers who own the pipelines, in order not, for example, to make Gazprom even more likely to be not only the biggest producer but also to control the supply chain and thus to hold all the trumps."
"I think we need to work much more closely with Ukraine and the southern Caucasus to modernise and develop energy networks."
"In particular, though, I think that we need networking within the European Union – networking that is not aimed against anybody, that is not an 'Energy NATO', but instead forms an internal network ensuring that, if someone wants to cut a country off, that country is automatically supplied by all the other countries."
"Why would those countries then not be cut off?"
"Because this would be too expensive for the country of supply, particularly as it would then have no revenue at all."
"I think that solidarity clauses comparable with the NATO Treaty are the wrong way to go; what we need is a network of solidarity that is not aimed against others, and it is through such networks that we need to organise internal solidarity in practical terms."
"I would therefore quite particularly like to say that the previous German Government's decision to construct this pipeline under the Baltic Sea, bypassing Poland and the Baltic states, was a poor one."
"As an example for such networking, we need to ensure that there are branches, for example going to Poland, so as to ensure security."
"Looking at the situation of the Baltic states, they too need to be given the opportunity for secure energy supplies, in case there are no more supplies from Russia."
"We need to resolve this internally, too; this is something we need to discuss."
"Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mr Winkler and Commissioner Piebalgs for their contributions."
"I agree with you that it is absolutely essential that we follow a true common energy policy."
"The question should be not whether, but how we can realise a European energy policy that meets the aims of security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability."
"One part of this – as some Members have already mentioned – is an internal market for energy with truly fair competition, and we know that we are still a long way from achieving that."
"I had actually expected a rather clearer statement from you in that respect."
"(Can I just ask why the clock is not running? I cannot tell how much time I have left.)"
"You both emphasised the need to further develop renewable energy."
"I wholeheartedly agree with that."
"At the same time, though, I had hoped for some more specific proposals."
"As you know, we currently have targets only up to 2010: targets for electricity, for biofuels and for energy as a whole."
"As you also know, the European Parliament has called for a target of 20% by 2020."
"The Commission's Green Paper raises the question of whether new targets should be set at all."
"If I understand correctly, the Council is currently discussing a new target of 15% by 2015, which is clearly a step backwards."
"It would be more important to take a really good look into ensuring that we can achieve our target for 2010 – 12% of total energy consumption coming from renewable energy."
"It is therefore very important and necessary for what you, Commissioner Piebalgs, announced to Parliament to happen, namely for a directive on heating and cooling from renewable energy to be proposed, as it is precisely in this area that there are deficiencies."
"This is of the utmost importance, if we are to move ahead on energy security."
"Germany's example makes it very clear: Germany's phasing out of nuclear power means that 33 billion kilowatt hours will have to be replaced by 2010."
"According to current forecasts, by 2010 51 billion kilowatt hours will be produced from renewable energy sources."
"To date, reality has always exceeded the forecasts with regard to renewable energy sources."
"Therefore, to those who say that atomic energy is so important, I say this: we have the opportunity to replace this energy source."
"We also need to do so, because it is a non-renewable source and we are completely dependent on imports of uranium."
"In addition, it is vital to use energy efficiency."
"You both referred to this, and I really hope, Commissioner Piebalgs, that the energy efficiency plan you will present will be an ambitious one."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is definitely time for Europe to have a comprehensive, complete strategy for energy, in which, Mr Piebalgs and Mr Winkler, we would ask for Parliament to have a central role."
"An essential part of this strategy is the creation of a single European market and a consistent EU policy."
"Today, liberalisation has arrived in the individual national markets, but that is not enough."
"In the energy field some countries have gone beyond the monopoly philosophy but others have not."
"If we restrict ourselves solely to calling for the completion of individual national markets, we will end up with an asymmetric and therefore weak European market."
"It will be internally weak, in other words incapable of correcting those distortions that are well known to us, those limitations that have been analysed in our reports."
"It will also be externally weak, because it will be incapable of having any bargaining power with consumer countries."
"In addition, there is also a great risk that it will become a victim, as an amendment to our resolution puts it, of new oligopolies that may form among the world’s producing areas."
"The second vital point is that, in the energy mix that we must achieve, we must determine not just national choices but European objectives and corresponding reference indicators on energy saving and efficiency."
"We expected the Council to be bolder in its choice of objectives and infrastructure as well as research policy."
"These are European objectives of a Community energy policy."
"– Mr President, I should like to mention a couple of technical points after the political comments that have been made."
"Energy crises always arise in Europe because of a shortage of supplies of two energy sources, namely gas and oil."
"We are not self-sufficient in these, which leaves us with two options."
"The first is to create more of our own European sources of energy, and the second is to diversify supplies."
"Creating more energy of our own requires above all research and development, greater energy efficiency and more renewable energy."
"We forget that Europe has vast reserves of lignite and hard coal."
"I cannot understand why clean coal technologies have been completely ignored in our parliamentary resolution."
"Others have had research and commercial programmes in this field for years."
"Nuclear energy is another necessity, especially with the threat of the greenhouse effect."
"More resources for research and new technologies should be a clear demand of the European Parliament."
"The second issue I should like to address is the diversification of supplies."
"We have not yet made use of the vast resources of one of our neighbours, Ukraine."
"Yesterday evening, not far from here in Solvay, the Ukrainian Government gave a presentation of the country’s potential – the largest natural gas reserves in Europe and gas and oil transit pipelines from Turkmenistan and the Caspian Sea, which are independent of Gazprom."
"All this could be the subject of cooperation between the European Union and Ukraine."
"It means leaving Ukrainian pipelines in the hands of Ukrainians."
"It requires investment, construction and repair of pipelines, and we, the European Union, must help Ukraine in these tasks."
"We have the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, trans-European networks and an enhanced neighbourhood policy at our disposal to do so."
"We would become more secure and demonstrate greater solidarity, and we would have a firm base for a common energy policy for the European Union."
"– Mr President, the EU’s energy policy has two dimensions: the external or geopolitical dimension, and a domestic dimension, because energy security also means the rational use of energy."
"At present, Europe needs to organise its own energy potential and to improve the use of this latter by increasing thermodynamic efficiency."
"Examples of how this could be achieved include modern thermal insulation of buildings and other structures, modernisation and a more widespread use of diversified sources of heat and electrical energy, particularly in the new EU Member States which have vast cogeneration and energy conservation potential, and sensible use of renewable energy sources, especially biomass."
"At the same time, however, I believe that the use of biomass to generate electricity is a mistake."
"By building cross-border networks, the enlarged European Union can tap into the considerable time differences between its easternmost and westernmost borders in order to ease peak loads on electricity networks, and it could also exploit seasonal temperature differences along its north-south axis."
"The energy used to generate national income also needs to be further reduced, and this must be reflected in customs policy."
"It is therefore incomprehensible why a customs duty of 6% should be levied on highly energy-intensive primary aluminium."
"Importing such aluminium is tantamount to importing energy, which the European Union would then save."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have the impression that the new situation since the beginning of this year has made it clear to everybody that energy is important not only for economic development in Europe."
"It is also increasingly clear that we are short of energy and that political dependencies are developing that obviously were not foreseen on this scale by a large part of society."
"However, this crisis also provides us with a huge opportunity, in that we are now finally discussing energy issues objectively and sensibly, and we might be able to come down from our trees, put old battles behind us and stop parading dogmas."
"That does however mean – and this is where I have a lot of questions about what the Commission has put forward – that we need to stand back and take stock."
"What is the situation, what opportunities are there, how much is there, where is it, where are the risks, where is the potential?"
"I am more or less certain that we will not find an answer with one single solution."
"It will not be the case, and it never has been."
"But we must make a combined effort to discuss all the issues openly and to find broad-based solutions."
"We cannot, as our fellow-Member from Poland has just said, do without current coal resources – that is out of the question."
"We do need to consider how we can use it cleanly, but we absolutely cannot do without it."
"We cannot ignore any potential sources – including renewable ones."
"However, we must also be honest enough to recognise that there are limits to their potential and that they will not solve our supply problems."
"I therefore also think that we cannot get around the fact, to be honest, that we cannot do without nuclear power."
"Our motto cannot be 'no coal, no nuclear power, but everything CO2 free and environmentally friendly'."
"I believe we need to stop debating on the basis of dreams and dogmas."
"We need a realistic and sensible debate."
"We owe it to our children to ensure that they will still have energy in the future, and enough of it, because it is a vital precondition for prosperity in our countries in Europe."
"I also think it is immoral that we are buying up all the energy potential in the world, because we have the resources to do so, when we could be leaving the countries that do not have the resources – by which I mean the developing countries – at the end of their tether."
"We have a duty also to use modern technology."
"The use of nuclear power is, for us, a matter of moral obligation."
"– Mr President, there is no longer any doubt as to the importance of Community subsidies in new and more energy-efficient technologies for renewable sources of energy."
"Moreover, by promoting differentiation as to the types of energy source, including wind and solar energy, the countries of origin and the passage through countries, we shall help to bring about new conditions for development, finding employment and strengthening sustainable development."
"I should also like in this direction to highlight and emphasise support for the production of biomass by drawing up national action plans which will safeguard the economic and entrepreneurial certainty and confidence of investors and producers and, at the same time, provide a way out of agricultural production."
"It should also be emphasised that the harmonisation of the internal market in the energy sector should target the protection of consumers and not impose more costs on them. These are policies which cannot be safeguarded from the operation of oligopoly concentrations."
"Finally, I should like to say, in connection with strengthening investments in new, more environmentally-friendly forms of energy, that the promotion can be achieved of a green tax, a tax in which nuclear energy is not and cannot be included."
"Mr President, Commissioner, throughout the ages and even now, major conflicts and wars have taken place for two purposes: firstly for energy and secondly for water."
"Europe must stand and confront this international problem with stable policies."
"Mr President, energy security and diversification of the source of supply has dramatically risen up the political agenda this year following the use of the ‘gas weapon’ by Gazprom against Ukraine and Moldova over the New Year period."
"It is no longer a technical matter confined to technocrats and has become as much a part of the CFSP as the remit of energy ministers."
"As rapporteur for the European Neighbourhood Policy, I was very conscious that many of the member countries – e.g. Algeria and Azerbaijan – were producers of oil and gas, and others were central to the pipeline transit systems of fuel to western Europe, such as Ukraine."
"I have repeatedly made a case for a stable Kazakhstan to join the ENP, as it is eager to get away from the risk of economic and political dominance by Russia and China and could indeed supply not just oil and gas but also uranium to the European Union, as we will inevitably have to build more nuclear reactors to satisfy Kyoto and not be over-reliant on unstable regions of the world –such as the Middle East, Venezuela or Nigeria, to name but a few – for fossil fuels."
"I respect the anti-nuclear countries, such as Austria and Ireland, but new technologies such as transmutation, will, I believe, one day solve the long-term, high-radiation waste concerns of the general public."
"Obviously, a lot also needs to be done by the Member States – preferably through intergovernmental cooperation – to work towards more energy efficiency, to develop more technologies in the form of renewables, but also to interconnect their electricity grids in a pan-European system, which will drive down prices and allow spare capacity."
"There is also a need to connect the existing oil and gas pipelines between the EU Member States."
"Spain is apparently virtually self-sufficient but isolated in this respect, and the Baltic countries are too reliant on connections to Russia, but have now agreed, much to their credit, to a new nuclear power station between themselves."
"I also believe Russia must be encouraged to join the Energy Charter to prevent it from stopping third countries using its pipelines."
"There is also a clear gap in that the International Energy Agency allows only for strategic oil reserves, not for gas reserves."
"Some Member States of the European Union seem to have no reserves at all."
"First of all, I would like to remind us all why this matter is being discussed here today."
"At the beginning of this year, the gas dispute which flared up between Ukraine and Russia demonstrated how very vulnerable the European energy system is, and more importantly, how energy can be used as an extremely powerful political instrument."
"The Ukraine-Russia gas dispute showed that if a country has a suitable leader, such as Lukashenko, it will get cheap energy from Russia."
"If the country’s chosen course does not suit Russia, as in the case of Ukraine, then it will not get cheap energy."
"The effects of this policy have sent shockwaves through the entire European energy system."
"As long as the European Union lacks a common energy policy, and as long as each Member State or head of government tries to secure for itself the best possible deal with a company in a large country outside the European Union, we will remain dependents, and victims of deals made on the side."
"Europe needs a common energy policy just as we need our common trade policy, which makes the European Union extremely effective in negotiations."
"Just imagine what position Germany or France, not to mention my own small country of Estonia, would be in if they were to be on their own in negotiations with the USA or China at the WTO."
"The present state of affairs, however, in which each country is responsible for its own energy supply and concludes bilateral agreements, is no different from that situation."
"In addition to all of this, there is the fact that the two gas pipelines which are planned to be built between Russia and China could threaten supply altogether."
"If you owe the bank 100 000 euros, the bank owns you."
"If, however, you owe the bank 100 million euros, you own the bank."
"The same applies to energy."
"With a disunited energy policy, we depend on the political whim of one country’s state monopoly."
"A common energy policy, however, would be decided by Europe itself."
"In relation to EU geopolitical strategy, I would like to point out the important (albeit well-known) fact that most of the new Member States are totally dependant on supplies of oil and gas from Russia, and in this respect differ from many of the old Member States, whose fuel supplies are more diversified."
"In this context, I am sure it will not be necessary to recount the recent negative consequences of dependence experienced by Ukraine."
"The new member countries observe the handling of fuel supply security issues with particular sensitivity."
"In the rush to catch up with the economic performance levels of the old Member States, security of energy supply is becoming an ever more pressing issue."
"With regard to electricity supply in particular, a number of new Member States have inherited an energy supply mix dominated by nuclear energy generation."
"I, for one, think that the subsidiarity principle should apply to the development of this type of energy."
"However, I cannot disregard the solidarity principle, which should enable individual Member States to develop this type of energy without at least being exposed to negative external interference."
"I welcome the Commission’s initiative to support research in this area aimed at improving further the safety of nuclear power generation, for example through research into recycling or nuclear fusion technologies and other related fields."
"I must, however, emphasise that the new financial perspective lacks sufficient funding for this research in particular."
"The Green Paper on energy policy focuses more on renewable energy sources."
"I have no major reservations with that."
"However, the Commission must act responsibly and accept the fact that some Member States would like to continue developing nuclear energy in the future, for two reasons in particular."
"Firstly, the potential for developing renewable energy sources is not great in those countries, and as such it is not possible to count on the long-term sustainability of these sources; secondly, those countries have had very positive experiences with nuclear energy, which is safe, environmentally friendly and sustainable in the long run."
"Mr President, I welcome this resolution as a recognition that there is indeed an energy crisis in Europe."
"I can tell you that, as a MEP representing the United Kingdom – where gas prices are three times the price of gas in the Netherlands and where factories have been warned that they may have to close for a while due to gas shortages."
"The single European energy market does not work."
"The answer is not to retract into narrow nationalism, but to cooperate and make the system work better."
"We need to develop the common European energy policy."
"Hurricane Katrina and Gazprom/Russia’s recent behaviour are two major incidents which have forced our hands on this issue."
"Since the encouraging noises that we heard in Hampton Court, I am afraid we have seen some disappointing new moves from the Member States: their continuing failure to implement current existing legislation in this field; price-fixing in the energy market; new protectionism and the establishment of new national champions."
"None of this bodes well for the forthcoming meeting tomorrow where we hope we do not see more back-pedalling by the Council."
"This is the first time that we in Parliament have had a chance to comment on the Green Paper."
"Our first initial reaction must be one of disappointment: there are no new targets and no concrete proposals to establish a common energy policy."
"There is no way you are going to get investment of one trillion euro without more long-term planning."
"This paper entirely ducks the issue of transport and aviation and their contribution to the energy debate."
"It needs a lot of work by Parliament."
"I hope that we will be able to cooperate in this field and that we do not need a third serious incident to make the Member States realise we have to act in this field."
"Mr President, security of supply as a formula for a real problem should contain concrete eventualities of insecurities, which should also be listed specifically."
"We should provide measures on how to cope even if there is a bombing of pipelines or electricity transmission wires."
"Both have been experienced recently by Georgia, where nobody was in any doubt about the political masterminding behind these acts."
"There are also categories of natural catastrophe able to interrupt supply."
"The document on the security of energy supply in Europe avoids mentioning Europe’s preparedness for such disasters, let alone any blasts in one’s mind affecting supply."
"A potential attacker when eager to use energy as a weapon may be stopped only by the knowledge that his move brings no political gains and only drawbacks for himself, while the targeted state is immediately assisted and compensated by actions of communal solidarity of the Union."
"That is what we should work on without any delay. The resolution omits this."
"As we are now debating security versus insecurity, there is also the real environmental insecurity related with building a pipeline and supplying the West in such a vulnerable way as via the bottom of the Baltic Sea."
"There is a strange silence about chemical shells and bombs from World War II lying in huge quantities, rusting and waiting for their own Armageddon."
"As the clock is ticking this mechanical work of building of pipelines may move ever faster towards an enormous disaster."
"Who would suffer?"
"Nobody, but some unimportant smaller nations on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea."
"Who is giving guarantees to us Baltic nations about both energy and biological survival?"
"Germany?"
"Commissioners of the split Union?"
"We have a right to expect proper policies and concrete European guarantees."
"Only then will Europe have the reason to use the word solidarity."
"Mr President, in relation to our common European task where energy policy is concerned, there are two things that are important to define and that I think we have to clarify."
"The first is that one of our obvious joint tasks is to guarantee that the internal market operates properly."
"There are now already a lot of obstacles to its doing so."
"We have to do everything from ensuring that companies can grow together across borders to making sure that the internal market can operate both legally and technically."
"We need common networks because they offer a way of achieving many of the objectives we have in common."
"Through common networks, we obtain more competition and lower prices."
"If renewable fuels are to be given scope to develop, we need a larger market where they can also be marketed and developed on a commercial basis."
"Through common networks we can reduce our vulnerability and, at the same time, have the opportunity of obtaining access to safe and cheap electricity."
"The second joint task where energy policy is concerned obviously relates to matters covered by both foreign policy and trade policy."
"In these areas, too, I again believe that, when it comes to solidarity between our countries, it is crucial for us to have the common networks."
"We can talk about solidarity and solidarity clauses however much we like but, basically, the fact is that it is only through common networks that it will be possible for countries such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – or any other country that may be exposed to political blackmail - successfully to achieve solidarity in practice."
"Such solidarity will then become a reality and not just a set of political objectives."
"In foreign policy and trade policy, any cooperation with Russia must be based on clear and transparent conditions governing trade and distribution."
"The EU must support a policy that leads to Russia undertaking to deliver energy sources under secure conditions to each individual Member State."
"In that way, we should obtain a sound energy policy, solidarity and a better Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is too dependent on fossil fuels."
"The last few weeks have made it clearer than ever that this has to stop."
"Prices are increasing dramatically for industry and for private consumers."
"There is no real security of supply, and there is no guarantee that our current energy supplies are sustainable in climate terms."
"This morning, Mrs Morgan spoke about Katrina."
"There have been a whole series of other hurricanes, and the scientists tell us that this is very probably a symptom of climate change."
"That is why we need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels."
"I think three things are decisive."
"The first is nuclear power: we must not shut down safe nuclear power stations just for political reasons."
"I therefore advocate adopting the amendment proposed by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on this point."
"I find it regrettable that the German Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, could not say so in her speech this morning because we are in a coalition with the social democrats, but I am pleased that the social democrats here in the European Parliament are beginning to reconsider; perhaps in a year's time Mrs Merkel will be able to defend nuclear power on behalf of the entire Federal Government."
"There is a range of other points that Mrs Merkel and all of us can support, and she will do so in her main speech at tomorrow's summit: we need energy efficiency."
"Energy is being wasted in Europe, and we cannot let it continue."
"We need an efficient expansion of renewable energy."
"It is vital that we use more renewable energy, but we need to do it without long-term subsidies."
"I would therefore point once again to this House’s demand for a directive on heating and cooling."
"This is an area in which there is a very great deal of potential, and in which costs are relatively low, and we should therefore move towards the delivery phase quickly."
"I support this resolution because it contains these demands and because it encourages the Commission and the Council to move more quickly on this matter."
"Mr President, Mr Piebalgs, ladies and gentlemen, in order to create a common energy policy the Commission must first of all bring to completion the liberalisation of the gas and electricity market."
"Enough of asymmetry, enough of rogues."
"The Commission must combat all measures designed to block the free circulation of capital, avoiding all forms of distortion of competition caused by governments’ protectionist support of ‘national champions’; your own credibility depends on it, Mr Piebalgs."
"Energy, as is well known, is both a production factor and a consumer good, and both are essential for the development of our economy and for maintaining high standards of living."
"The common energy policy, together with a common foreign policy, are the tools with which to achieve these goals in our enlarged Europe."
"This is the political question – will we be able to do this?"
"Europe is divided into two camps: those who trust Russia and those who are hypercritical of it, even though we depend almost exclusively on its energy resources."
"In the European energy market Russia is an unavoidable supplier, to which we should not, however, remain too tightly bound."
"Diversification of energy supply is, therefore, essential, and it is vital to find European solutions in the supply sphere."
"In short, we must speak with one voice – will we be able to do this?"
"Diversifying supply sources seems a mandatory response, just like improving the networks for transporting energy, the gas pipelines and the ports."
"It is important to develop an energy dimension in the European Union’s strategy and security and to increase public and private investment in alternative energies and renewables."
"Will we be able to do this?"
"In brief, an energy policy as a fundamental component of the new Europe – this is the message to give to our citizens; will we be able to do this?"
"Mr President, when the lights went out in California, in Turin and even in my own home town of Wexford – not to mention the recent Gazprom incident – there was a sudden concentration of minds on the security of energy supply, which is of critical importance to us both strategically and economically, particularly with energy import dependency and costs growing exponentially."
"As the recent Green Paper on energy policy tells us, unless we can make our domestic energy more competitive in the next couple of decades, 70% of the Union’s energy requirements will have to be met by imported products, compared to a figure of only 50% today."
"Most of this is from regions threatened by geopolitical instability."
"This figure, however, masks the higher energy import dependency of peripheral and geographically isolated energy markets such as the Baltics, Ireland and other island communities."
"In Ireland, we have gone from 65% dependency on imported energy in 1990 to over 90% dependency today, and rising."
"Our indigenous fossil fuel supplies – peat and natural gas – have been rapidly depleting since 1995, while record economic and industrial growth has pushed up demand."
"While the energy mix must continue to remain a Member State competence, in a single market, an attack on one is an attack on all in energy terms."
"Solidarity within the EU will be vital in securing equitably distributed supplies from outside our borders, through the completion of a competitive, integrated, internal energy market."
"This cannot happen without additional physical capacity, in the form of trans-European energy networks, to connect us all to a European grid."
"Within each Member State, effective ‘unbundling’ of network and supply activities in gas and electricity must be made a reality: in Ireland this has yet to happen."
"Through EU-level and Member state incentives, we must seriously target the development and mainstreaming of the 21 types of renewables, not least because of our obligations in relation to climate change."
"I get the impression that, especially where biofuels are concerned, there is no lack of interest: the research and investment communities are circling, but afraid to take a leap in the dark."
"Talk, goodwill and interest are not enough; we need serious financial and regulatory catalysts to increase research and roll out the development of pilot projects using cutting-edge renewable technologies."
"The decoupling of economic growth and energy consumption and the whole story of demand side management cannot be ignored."
"World energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions are expected to rise by 60% by 2030."
"By increasing energy efficiency measures alone by 2020, we can reduce demand by over 20%."
"Commissioner, do not wait until the lights go out again!"
"Let us act now and keep energy security at the top of the political agenda in peacetime."
"– Energy is fundamental to our activities, and is central to our success in the implementation of the policies we have set out."
"The situation in the field of energy will determine in no small measure how we accomplish the goals of the Lisbon Strategy and indeed whether we accomplish them at all."
"Commissioner, you are aware of this state of affairs, which is why you brought things forward and published the Green Paper on a common European Energy Policy earlier this month."
"It is indeed high time that we sought answers to these questions: how do we ensure secure and adequate energy supplies at competitive prices, and at the same time care for the environment?"
"How should our energy mix be formulated in the future?"
"How stable are the areas from which we can import energy resources?"
"What is their current cost and how much will they cost in the future?"
"How does their use affect the environment, and so on?"
"Our answers to these questions must be a realistic assessment of the contribution of primary energy sources in the overall European energy mix, and an honest evaluation of the effectiveness of existing technologies and the potential of new, evolving technologies, and the natural resources of the Member States must also be considered."
"The time has come for us to avoid political rhetoric and to face up to the real state of affairs."
"I would particularly like to point out that nuclear energy cannot and should not be a taboo subject in the European political arena."
"Right now nuclear energy produces no greenhouse gas emissions, it allows us to import uranium from a variety of countries, including those that are politically stable, and it is for this very reason that it enjoys a stable and competitive price."
"Future research and development work is expected to improve its efficiency, reduce the amount of radioactive waste and increase safety."
"It must now occupy a place commensurate with these factors both in European strategic documents and in the taking of concrete measures."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate today was a very important one in view of tomorrow's Council and in view of the very intensive discussions on the issue of energy that the Heads of State or Government will be having tomorrow, and I should very much like to thank all those who have taken part in it."
"I do not have the time to respond to everything that has been said – and some very important things have been – but I would just like to mention a few points by way of conclusion."
"Mr Rübig was quite right to say that a more comprehensive debate is needed on this problem and that all fields of activity in the European Union must concern themselves with energy."
"The Presidency is aware of this, and is of course working together with the Commission in this respect; at this point I should quite particularly like to thank Commissioner Piebalgs for his cooperation right from the start."
"I think he was the first Commissioner we worked closely with, and I am very grateful to him for that."
"However, the Member States also need to get involved, because only a joint effort will bring us to our goal of security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability, which must be the main focus points of European energy policy."
"Europe must speak with one voice to third countries when it comes to energy policy."
"That has been stressed by a number of speakers."
"Mr Brunetta said it, as did Mr Brok, the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"That, too, is particularly important and is a task to which we must apply ourselves."
"Mr Goebbels and Commissioner Piebalgs both referred to solidarity."
"Solidarity is indeed a quite essential factor, and tomorrow the Heads of State or Government will acknowledge this in their declaration and in the conclusions they adopt."
"Mr Goebbels called for a , and that is a good phrase."
"Mr Turmes has already anticipated what the Heads of State or Government will say tomorrow."
"I have to admit that I do not know: perhaps others are better informed."
"But there is one thing I can say: tomorrow's energy debate has been thoroughly prepared, including by the energy ministers and the General Affairs and External Relations Council."
"Of course, we do not know what the text adopted by the Heads of State or Government will ultimately look like, but it will – I can assume – contain some very important things."
"It will not be a declaration of national interests; rather, a European energy policy is going to be adopted tomorrow."
"That much we can already say."
"Mrs Ek mentioned the need to maintain competition."
"I would like to refer you, first of all, to the debate ten days ago in Strasbourg, where I, on behalf of the Council, along with the Commissioner responsible for competition, mentioned very clearly that we are very much in favour, and that we need to maintain the rules of competition, especially in the field of energy."
"I would like to mention a small paragraph on the energy policy for Europe."
"The paragraph dealing with exactly what you asked about points out that in fulfilling its main objectives, the energy policy for Europe should ensure transparency and non-discriminatory markets; be consistent with competition rules; be consistent with public service obligations and fully respect Member States’ sovereignty over primary energy sources and choice of energy mix."
"Much of that has also been said here, and I can only confirm and emphasise it."
"Mrs Rothe called for specific targets for the expansion of renewable energy sources, and on that I totally agree with her."
"The Austrian Presidency is very committed, and very ambitious."
"As this debate has shown, however, there is a lack of agreement on many points."
"A coherent, consistent energy policy for Europe cannot be built overnight."
"It is important for the Heads of State or Government to give a significant stimulus tomorrow, and for the Member States, the Council and the Commission then to build on the principles drawn up and adopted tomorrow, so that we ultimately achieve what we all want: security of supply, greater efficiency and constructive dialogue with third countries, so as to guarantee the use of clean energy in future and for future generations."
". Mr President, after such a challenging and interesting debate, I would like to take the liberty of speaking a little longer than usual to end the debate."
"In the situation we are currently facing, we would usually look to history for courageous decisions which have been taken on energy policy."
"So far I have found one: it was before the First World War, when Winston Churchill, who at the time was responsible for the Navy, decided to change the fuel for the British Navy from coal – which was domestically produced in Wales – to oil."
"When asked about security he said that diversity was the answer."
"We face as big a challenge as he did."
"However, we should also have courage."
"Neither OPEC nor Russia hold the ace in our poker game."
"We do."
"I believe that, in the current challenge, the most competitive advantage will be that part of the world will not only be energy-efficient, but will also be capable of managing demand."
"This is the key to success."
"Otherwise, even with the best diversification, we will not be sustainable."
"This is a key challenge that we have to face."
"The second important issue is that, if in a more complex environment – not just one in which we switch from coal to oil – we would like to be successful and achieve the goals we have agreed on, we should be aware that we are able to achieve them, just as we have been able to achieve our previous goals."
"This is crucial."
"Solidarity is extremely important."
"However, we should all understand that solidarity imposes some ‘homework’ on us to prepare for this, and that there is a price to pay."
"We should believe that, for example, the power bridge between Lithuania and Poland is not only a commercial issue, but also one of solidarity."
"It should be built, but not on the basis of commercial arguments."
"I heard a lot of sceptical remarks in relation to markets."
"However, the market actually provides the strength of the European Union."
"There is a lot of emotion about national champions."
"However, each case will be judged on the basis of European competition law."
"If there is a need to strengthen the law, that is a different story."
"Debate will always make emotions stronger."
"But the law will be applied exactly, and competition will prevail."
"New technologies are definitely necessary."
"The price of oil is actually stimulating development."
"I recently received a very interesting proposal concerning super-grids that bring together many offshore wind farms."
"When you meet representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises dealing with renewables and heating and you ask them what they would support, they claim that oil prices should stay where they are."
"This gives more diversity and stimulates technological development among our researchers."
"But, this again brings us back to the fact that we will only be as strong as our will."
"If we are weak and do not believe in it, nobody else will help us – neither Russia nor Saudi Arabia."
"We must help ourselves."
"In this respect, I believe that such debates are necessary."
"The strategic EU energy review will provide for a very competent debate and for the right decisions to be made."
"But I still believe that the basic answer lies in our strengths as a Union: i.e. in democracy, our vision in international relations and the market."
"But for the market to work, we should provide for stable and predictable investment conditions."
"The market will then provide what is asked for."
"Thank you very much for your debate."
"I really believe we will come back for the debate and agree on the content of a European energy policy."
"To wind up the debate, I have received five motions for resolutions(1), pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"The next item is the statement by the Council on criteria for peace-keeping operations, especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we can all agree that the European Union is based on values and that it is very involved in promoting those values throughout the world."
"This includes concrete contributions to peace, sustainable development, respect for human rights and the development and strengthening of democracy throughout the world."
"The European Union has a very broad array of instruments for taking action in these areas."
"These include a trade and development policy, diplomatic initiatives as part of the common foreign and security policy, and civilian and military crisis management operations under the European Security and Defence Policy."
"The implementation of these diverse resources can be particularly well demonstrated in our Africa policy."
"Today's debate on the European Union's involvement in the Democratic Republic of Congo is a particularly good example."
"However, we must also not forget about other activities in this connection, such as the action to support the African Union's AMIS II peacekeeping forces in Darfur."
"The comprehensive Africa strategy adopted by the European Council at the end of last year, the 'Common Position concerning conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa' and the 'ESDP Action Plan supporting peace and security in Africa' provide the European Union with clear guidance: the commitment made in these documents to peace and security as an absolute necessity for the development of Africa logically leads to a commitment to help resolve the conflicts in Africa by strengthening African crisis management capabilities, including with funds from the 'Peace Facility for Africa' and by means of appropriate operations as part of the European security and defence policy."
"The European Union's involvement in the Democratic Republic of Congo reflects the comprehensive nature of these European ambitions: the main basis for relations between the European Union and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and thus also for EU assistance to stabilise the country, is formed in the first instance by the Cotonou Agreement and the funds available from the European Development Fund in this connection."
"The funds from the peace facility that I have already briefly mentioned, which are not directly connected with the Cotonou Agreement, are also worth some attention here."
"Some of this money is being used to fund initiatives that make a very direct contribution to improving the security situation in Congo, for example by creating humane living spaces for soldiers and their families or by providing modern equipment."
"In the Democratic Republic of Congo, it has also become clear that the European security and defence policy can, with relatively meagre resources, make an important contribution to stabilising the country, by means of assistance in reforming its security sector in both the civilian and military sectors."
"I would point to the civilian ESDP mission, EUPOL Kinshasa, which has recently been extended to the end of this year."
"It provides training and advice to the 'Integrated Police Unit', and thus helps to ensure that policing in the capital city Kinshasa is not only efficient but also compatible with the basic concepts of a modern state under the rule of law."
"The military ESDP mission, EUSEC Congo, in turn supports the Congolese military authorities in pushing forward the necessary reforms and modernisation of the armed forces."
"I am sure I do not need to tell you that the work of the EU Special Representative for the African Great Lakes Region, Aldo Ajello, is extremely important for the stabilisation of the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"I would now like to emphasise a few points specifically about the mission in Congo."
"First of all, there are four central points that characterise the Council's position regarding an operation to support the United Nations' mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC)."
"Firstly, the European Union is responding to a specific request from the United Nations."
"On this matter we have confidence in the assessment of the Secretary General, Kofi Annan."
"You are no doubt aware of the fact that the Council has, in the past, made considerable efforts to support the United Nations, and that, as part of the ESDP, the United Nations presence in the region has been strengthened."
"I am sure you will agree with me that the European Union, being committed to multilateralism, is duty-bound to make an effective contribution here, as the Member States also wish."
"Secondly, both the President of the Democratic Republic of Congo and both of its vice-presidents are in favour of such a supporting action."
"The Supreme Defence Council has also specifically called for this mission, and this has also been included in a related press release."
"This shows us that it is in the interests of the Democratic Republic of Congo to have credible additional deterrents available, in order to prevent a military option."
"I would particularly like to emphasise that fact: this is a mission that should act to prevent the use of force, and we hope that the presence of this deterrent should prevent the actual deployment of military resources."
"This deterrent effect is worthwhile, even if, in the estimation of the Congolese authorities, the forces provided would not need to be deployed."
"But they should be available."
"We see no reason to question the Congolese assessment."
"Thirdly, the DRC is the largest and most highly populated country in the region."
"Not least for that reason, the European Union is, as you know, more closely involved in the process of transition to democracy in Congo than in any other African country."
"The European Union has, in the past, already used its extensive range of tools to bring an end to the conflict and to make progress in the peace process."
"We in the European Union have contributed EUR 700 million to projects to support the transition, EUR 200 million of which went to supporting the elections alone."
"I have already mentioned the police mission."
"As you are aware, we sent a military mission back in 2003 to prevent an escalation of the conflict in the East of the country, which was threatening the final negotiations in the peace process and thus the establishment of the transitional government."
"In the opinion of the Member States, it is now sensible and necessary to secure this earlier investment in peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and to ensure that the peaceful democratic development continues."
"Fourthly, the political and military parameters of the mission must – as in the case of earlier missions, including those in the Democratic Republic of Congo – be established and laid down in cooperation between the competent Council configurations and the operational headquarters."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard, the United Nations have requested and called on the European Union to make a contribution to the elections in Congo by sending a military mission."
"What should our answer be?"
"We need to bear in mind a number of things."
"First, we need to ask ourselves whether, at this point in time, the European Union has the capabilities needed to carry out such an operation."
"The second question is: do we not have other priorities in the immediate vicinity of the European Union, for example in the Balkans, where peace-keeping is our first and most important task?"
"Thirdly, is there not a risk here that we will become entangled in a conflict from which we will then not be able to extricate ourselves promptly?"
"These are questions that I, as an MEP, am repeatedly asked in this connection."
"On the other hand, we must, as the President-in-Office said, recognise that the European Union has an interest in the stability of this country in the heart of Africa."
"The fact that the European Union itself is also affected should be clear to anybody who has looked towards Ceuta, Melilla or Lampedusa and the terrible scenes played out at these borders with poverty."
"Stability in Africa is in the interests of the European Union and of its citizens."
"We must be conscious of our responsibility towards the UN."
"We must be clear that the prevention of violence, which is the aim of this operation, is very much in line with the European Union's security strategy."
"We should also not forget that a large number of election observers from the European Parliament and from other parliaments, under Mr Morillon’s leadership, are already working in Congo to secure the elections."
"What are our conditions for intervention by the European Union in Congo?"
"First, there must be a clear time limit."
"It cannot be the task of this kind of intervention to stabilise Congo as a whole – that is a long-term task, and the responsibility of the United Nations."
"That is why there are 17 000 UN soldiers in Congo."
"We must concentrate on helping to stabilise the elections on 18 June."
"Secondly, there must be a clear succession regulation, showing how the United Nations on the one hand, and the Congolese army on the other, will re-assume these activities after our intervention."
"There must also be a geographical boundary, and it must be clear, for example, that Katanga and the eastern provinces of Congo must continue to be the responsibility of the United Nations and not of the European Union."
"Furthermore, it must be quite clear that this operation is definitely European."
"It must not be just one or two European nations getting involved, but more European nations must really be committed to the task."
"We need a formal invitation from the interim government."
"Here, too, there still seems to be some doubt as to what the government of Congo has actually formally said."
"Above all, however, we need a convincing plan, a plan that is able to convince any troublemakers that it is better to accept the results of the election, and also to encourage the citizens of Congo to exercise their right to vote."
"Those are the conditions under which the European Union and we in the European Parliament could agree to such a mission."
"Now we need, and as soon as possible, to get answers to the questions that are still outstanding."
". – The situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo presents us – by which I mean those who in the EU take seriously the 'responsibility to protect' enshrined in the last high-level UN summit in September 2005 – with enormous challenges."
"The conflict that has devastated the Democratic Republic of Congo and the whole of the Great Lakes region is the bloodiest since the Second World War. It has already caused 4 million deaths, the overwhelming majority civilians."
"Real and lasting peace in the country is a vital prerequisite for peace in the Great Lakes and in Central Africa as a whole."
"In this context, the UN, which has the largest peace-keeping mission in its history in Congo, has called on the EU to help the elections scheduled for 18 June to pass off peacefully. The election observation team will be led by Mr Morillon, and this is a mission supported by all of us in Parliament."
"As far as we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are concerned, this election is something of a crunch moment for Congo."
"Either the institutions born in a context of civil war are replaced by democratically elected institutions, or, more likely, Congo will remain at the mercy of bloody militias."
"Yet these elections and the challenge laid down by the United Nations also constitute a moment of truth for the European Union."
"Will European security and defence policy prove credible?"
"Can we count on the Member States to implement the European security strategy?"
"I should like to highlight three points from the joint resolution that we tabled."
"This intervention should be viewed as one part of a temporary solution to the problem of the country’s internal stability, which will only be resolved when the Congolese army becomes a stabilising factor."
"It became clear during recent Congolese operations in the Katanga region that the population still has reason to doubt the ability of the authorities to protect them from the militias."
"The international community must channel its efforts into strengthening the integrated military units already in place and speed up the creation of others."
"Unless rapid improvements are made in the security sector, the EU and the UN may unfortunately be called on to intervene in Congo many more times in the future."
"Secondly, the political legitimacy of this mission must be a decisive factor in its success."
"Accordingly, it must be a genuinely European mission, and as such we welcome the news of the solid participation of various Member States led by Germany and including my country, Portugal. It must also be fully backed by the United Nations Security Council."
"All internal and external actors must be made aware that the current Congolese Government welcomes this mission. As part of the concept of this mission, the EU must be genuinely prepared to support the election process, despite the inherent risks."
"The primary objective of the presence of European forces is to make a visible and credible contribution to the stability of the Congolese election process."
"This is what the people of Congo and Africa expect of us."
". Mr President, Mr Winkler, what is currently taking place in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with the support of the international community and, more specifically, of the European Union, is crucially important for the future of this vast country, which has been torn apart for years by civil and foreign wars."
"The Congolese people are today united in their profound desire for peace and stability and in their aspiration for a democracy that allows a situation of that kind."
"They demonstrated this by registering to vote in overwhelming numbers in July 2005 and they demonstrated this in December, during the referendum vote in favour of a draft constitution designed to put an end to the current transitional period."
"As head of the observation mission for this referendum, I attended the ceremonies marking the promulgation of the Constitution on 18 February, in Kinshasa, and I was able to assess the intense emotion of the participants and of the nation as a whole."
"A hope was born that at the end of the next stage, which will see a president and a parliament elected this summer, the country will succeed in finally emerging from the chaos and poverty in which it is still submerged."
"It is the interests of the Congolese people, the interests of the entire African continent and, therefore, the interests of Europe that are at stake."
"There is a danger, however, that those who have benefited up to now from this chaos and this poverty will not take kindly to being deprived of their power by the ballot boxes and that they may be tempted, on the one hand, to use terror tactics to prevent a lawful election and, on the other, to use force to challenge the election results."
"The security situation is being overseen by the UN forces, which are mainly deployed in the Eastern provinces in which organised gangs still operate."
"In these conditions, and in order to increase the security of forthcoming elections, the UN has sought the help of the European Union, as you mentioned."
"It will be up to the Council to determine what form this help will take."
"I am one of those who believe that this commitment will have the value of being a very powerful political signal to any potential troublemakers and that it will have what we anticipate to be a deterrent effect, and that is why I will be among those giving their support to this operation."
"Mr President, the debate over the last few weeks has laid bare the whole dilemma of the lack of political direction here."
"It would be wrong for us simply to try and gloss over that."
"Since UN Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno’s letter of 27 December about military engagement in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which fell during the turn of the year holiday period and came as a surprise even to the Security Council, 12 weeks have passed and there are still more questions than answers. There is still a yawning gap between words and deeds."
"We remain to be convinced."
"We do not support the joint resolution, and let me explain why."
"We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are of course in favour of supporting the process of democratisation in Congo."
"But how has it happened that the issue of EU involvement has been reduced to military deployment in Kinshasa and counting soldiers?"
"How is it that we find ourselves discussing sending soldiers but not the issue of a large number of EU electoral observers?"
"How is it that the whole range of actions under the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the European Security and Defence Policy is not being investigated?"
"How is it that every single day new justifications emerge, such as Europe’s interest in refugee refusal?"
"I ask you, what has all that got to do with facilitating democratic elections in Congo?"
"These verbose discussions in recent weeks have raised the question of whether the planned deployment in Kinshasa is actually about democratisation or whether it is really about the EU saving face."
"I say saving face because the dynamic set in train by the inquiry has taken on a life of its own."
"Months have passed since the inquiry and the inconclusive fact-finding mission to Congo and since New York, yet there is still no sign of a political plan or a clear task."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a fine gesture by Mr Chirac cannot conceal the issues that have still not been addressed, that is to say how is dispatching 1 500 soldiers to Kinshasa going to guarantee free elections throughout Congo? How can we refute the accusation that we are taking Kabila's side?"
"My final point, ladies and gentlemen, is a very fundamental one. We talk so passionately here about Europe’s responsibility towards Africa, yet how can we reconcile today’s debate with our failure to act on the continuing genocide in Darfur?"
"Mr President, contrary to all reason, the European Union is planning a military deployment in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"Officially, it is a question of protecting the integrity of the elections, but something seems to have gone rather wrong in the run-up to the elections."
"Only 60 candidates have been nominated for 500 parliamentary seats, and the close of nominations is tomorrow evening, Thursday evening that is."
"The EU is planning to send 1 500 soldiers to Africa’s third largest nation, a country with an authoritarian regime. As one SPD politician from Germany has commented, it is as if 750 soldiers were to land in Europe and claim that would stabilise the whole of Europe."
"In military terms this deployment makes no sense at all."
"So what is the point of sending these troops?"
"The German defence minister Franz Joseph Jung has not minced his words."
"He has said that it is all about refugee refusal and that stability in regions rich in raw materials is also good for Germany’s economy."
"CDU MPs in Germany have confirmed this motivation, referring to strategic raw materials such as tungsten and manganese."
"And the German Government has now decided not to take a decision about military deployment until the beginning of May."
"The military is making it increasingly clear that it is not in favour of this deployment."
"The position is relatively clear: once you go into Congo, it is not so easy to withdraw again – this will not just be limited to four months."
"The motion for a resolution is not limited geographically and the time limit is only expressed in the vaguest terms."
"That is why we are asking all Members who are sceptical about this to vote against this motion for a resolution."
"I will make no bones about this: what is really at stake here is access to raw materials and refugee refusal by military means."
"As a group of the left we wish to say a very clear ‘no’ to that and we will not be voting for this motion for resolution."
"Mr President, apart from the technical debate on this deployment, there are also other aspects that should be discussed here too."
"In part, small-minded prejudices are involved here."
"In my country, Germany, instead of openly talking about a dark continent where people are permanently involved in internecine conflicts out of pure necessity, some CSU politicians, for example, suggest that Germany’s army would be better used guarding World Cup stadiums in the immediate future instead of being sent to the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"I think that we should make it crystal clear that this is an incredibly narrow view of the world."
"I admit, Mrs Beer, that there are a great many issues that remain to be resolved, very serious problems that have not yet been solved."
"I am also very confident that they will be solved, including by our colleagues in Germany’s Bundestag."
"What should interest us at European level, however, is something that has not been mentioned so far."
"I consider that in recent weeks serious deficits in the European decision-making process have come to light, deficits that remain to be removed."
"It is not acceptable for some people to say that they demand deployment plans before troops are made available while others say that deployment plans will only be drawn up once we are certain that we will not have to set off alone."
"That is not on, and would lead to a kind of self-imposed blockade."
"Without demanding unrealistic treaty amendments, we need to achieve an outcome whereby a review of decision-making processes is conducted without delay at Council level, so that in situations in which decisions have to be taken more quickly than is the case at present, it is actually possible to take those decisions."
"Mr President, it is excellent that the European Union is fully involved in supporting the election process in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and we even hope that it will be more vigilant with regard to the human rights violations that have been worsening, I am afraid to say, for some time."
"However, the way in which the EU military operation is taking shape in the Democratic Republic of Congo today is truly strange and odd to say the least."
"Figures of a few hundred men have been mentioned, whereas MONUC already has 16 000 men."
"You say that these men would not be directly involved, but merely on hand if they were needed: where might that be, then?"
"What would the mission of this military force be, and what mandate would these men have in the event of violence breaking out during or after the elections, especially in Kinshasa?"
"Can lessons not be learnt from the past, when the UN forces found themselves in impossible situations and were subsequently accused from all sides because they had neither a clear mandate nor sufficient resources?"
"There are therefore two possibilities: either the European Union thoroughly fulfils the United Nations’ request by laying down conditions and by investing substantial resources to support MONUC, or it dedicates these resources to the success of the electoral process, to the full involvement of civil society, to respect for human rights and, furthermore, to the control and transparency of the way in which the Democratic Republic of Congo’s so very precious and coveted natural resources are exploited."
"It is clear that, for our part, we much prefer this second prospect to one of supporting a military operation that, for the time being, is very limited, has unclear objectives and about which we have little knowledge at present."
"Mr President, it is right in our resolution to wind up this debate that we put emphasis on an integrated strategy for the mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a clear time-limit for troop deployment, together with an exit strategy, as well as stressing the need for protection for the forces themselves."
"However, I want to challenge the assumption in recital A that security in the European neighbourhood, particularly the Balkans, should come first."
"Of course the neighbourhood is crucial, but with Balkan countries moving towards accession and stabilisation, we should be talking about fewer EU troops, not maintaining them at current levels."
"Time after time this Parliament passes resolutions for a common foreign and security policy with Europe a leader in global affairs."
"We say that terrorism in our streets is generated from fragile states worldwide, why should we then seek to limit our ambitions to the European neighbourhood?"
"We pass resolutions to combat world poverty, yet are we ready to apply them in the ninth poorest country in the world, with one of the highest rates of infant mortality?"
"As the International Crisis Group says, ‘everything from elections, to humanitarian assistance, to economic activity depends on establishing a secure environment’."
"A decade of war in the DRC has cost four million lives, and still a thousand people a day die from war-related causes."
"We receive daily reports of massacres, civilian killings, widespread rape and sexual violence."
"These elections are a moment of hope."
"Europe is providing our biggest ever aid to support the election process."
"The request for them to be accompanied by security forces comes from all factions in the transitional national government."
"It is a request to which we should agree."
"Mr President, I am very much in favour of a developing common foreign and security policy in the European Union."
"Now that the European Union is larger than the United States, richer than the United States and gives more assistance to the Third World than the United States, it is only right and proper that we have a common foreign and security policy dimension to that."
"In that sense, of course, no one is questioning the value of the request from the United Nations for a mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"The problem is that the mission is being discussed behind closed doors and we need some democratic scrutiny."
"As we are increasingly sending missions to Aceh – which I very much welcome as the former chief observer to the Indonesian elections – and to the Democratic Republic of Congo, we need that democratic control."
"The problem is that unless we have some democratic scrutiny, in a post-election system where we may see deterioration of the situation in the DRC, there is a danger of mission creep and being sucked into a quagmire."
"We are sending an election observation mission, but we are sending this mission as well."
"Can we be reassured that there is some close coordination between the two?"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot answer all your questions, since, as I have already explained, the precise political, military policy and military parameters that will underpin the Council’s final decision are being worked out as we speak, and I am very grateful to Mr Kuhne for mentioning in this context that it is necessary for the appropriate basis for decision making to be worked out at this stage."
"Mr von Wogau asked what the government had actually said."
"In my first statement I said that very clear comments had been made by the President and the two Vice-Presidents, and I might perhaps quote just one paragraph from the press release issued following Monday’s Defence Council:"
"‘During its meeting held on Monday 20 March, chaired by the Head of State, his Excellency Mr Joseph Kabila’."
"The Head of State is the chair of this body."
"‘The Supreme Defence Council examined, among other points, the question of a European military contingent being formed at the request of the United Nations’."
"The Council then came to this conclusion:"
"‘Anxious to strengthen the security arrangements for the electoral process, the Supreme Council recommended, in the light of a report presented by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the initiative to deploy these European Special Forces be supported’."
"So that is a clear statement, and there are no grounds for questioning it."
"Also, the comments made regarding doubts about the advisability of the mission were also once again mentioned in this press release."
"‘It should be emphasised that this contingent will mainly act as a deterrent’."
"I am very grateful to Mr Morillon for specifically mentioning that too."
"I can only repeat what I have already said."
"I believe that it is the responsibility of the European Union to make a meaningful contribution to the democratic process in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"We need to be clear that, of the broad range of options open to us, the deployment of military troops needs to be considered alongside other types of intervention for assisting democratic development, such as development cooperation and assistance in establishing the rule of law and democratic processes and in protecting human rights."
"This is a responsibility borne by the European Union and one that the Council is fulfilling."
"To wind up the debate, I have received three motions for resolutions(1), pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"The next item is the oral question to the Council by Margrietus van den Berg, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the revision of the Cotonou Agreement and setting of the amount for the 10th EDF (O-0004/2006 B6-0006/2006)."
". Mr President, I should like to thank the Council for being here for this very important debate in relation to the European Development Fund."
"As the Council is aware, because of the ongoing debate on the budgetisation of the EDF, no provisions relating to the financial framework were included in the revised Cotonou agreement."
"However, in Annex 1 it states very clearly that ‘the European Union will maintain its aid efforts at at least the same level as that of the ninth EDF’."
"Therefore, in my view, President-in-Office, the ACP countries were misled into believing that they should feel secure about future funding under the tenth EDF."
"The Commission’s assessment was that for the tenth EDF, EUR 24.948 billion was the appropriate sum."
"In December, however, the Council in Brussels agreed on EUR 22.682 billion on current prices for the 2008-2013 period."
"President-in-Office, I give this history because I think it is relevant to the position adopted by Parliament’s Committee on Development, which is that the Development Committee requires reassurance and clarification before we agree to give our assent to the amended Cotonou agreement."
"Past agreements should dictate that both the Council and the Commission should understand that when the Development Committee takes a strong stance, as we have done on the DCCI, we in that committee will maintain a very strong position on our principles."
"Our principles centre around development, and if they are not addressed, then the Council should understand that we will not give our assent until that is clearly part of the way in which you are operating."
"One of our concerns relates to the fact that certain members of the Council say that we should accept that we deduct EUR 0.3 billion for the EU’s 21 overseas countries and territories and that a further EUR 0.9 billion should be deducted to cover administrative costs."
"Yesterday in committee, the Director-General of DG Development made it very clear that the position that you may have on the OCTs was not shared by the Commission."
"Will the Council therefore clarify what its position on the OCTs is?"
"As a British Member of this Parliament, I am very well aware of the position of the UK, the last Council Presidency."
"However, President-in-Office, I would like to know what your position is."
"Also, on administrative costs, how can it be sensible for the Commission to pay itself for the administration of its own resources?"
"This cannot make sense and I am sure is not something that you are familiar with in your own administration."
"Would the Member States – the Council – be prepared to consider giving additional money to cover the costs of the OCTs?"
"These are not unimportant caveats."
"I am not introducing them in a casual way, because I really want to know exactly from you how it can be the case that you make these decisions which say that you do not want to give us the assurances that the money that you are giving to the ACP for the ACP’s use are funds for those countries to use in a clear and transparent way."
"I would also take issue with the assertion that the tenth EDF represents a significant improvement on the ninth EDF."
"In real terms I would argue that it is nothing more than a stagnation."
"The Development Committee cannot and will not be duped by what we see as double-speak on this issue."
"The ninth EDF included funds left over from the previous EDF: ‘unspent money’."
"Once this money is added to the ninth EDF, the figures touted by the Council are comparable only in nominal terms."
"When things are finalised, the tenth EDF will have to be ratified and that presents us with enormous concerns when you consider that 25 Member States will have to be part of this ratification process."
"The results of an under-spend in the past have been that we have gone in for all these facilities – water facilities, peace facilities – which have had very limited democratic control."
"Surely this is a matter of concern for you, President-in-Office?"
"Our next debate will be on economic partnership agreements and one of the most contentious issues for us, and which we will raise, will be the financing of aid for trade in the economic partnership agreements."
"Will you clarify, President-in-Office, whether you will be offering additional funds for the EPA negotiations, or whether you expect such funding to come from the ACP’s tenth EDF?"
"Finally, if the African Union is to be included, how will allowances be made for the fact that many members of the African Union are not ACP countries?"
"Do you expect those countries to benefit from EDF money if the Council decides that you will support the African Union from the tenth EDF?"
"We are talking about a binding agreement with the ACP, and I trust that the Council will reflect that in the decisions it takes on the tenth EDF."
"– Mr President, Mrs Kinnock, I shall try to answer your questions as fully as possible."
"I fear that I shall not be able to answer all of them, partly because negotiations have not yet been concluded in all areas, and because the Council has not yet adopted a position on all these issues."
"Nevertheless, I hope I can give you some clarification."
"I would first like to refer to the agreement of the European Council of December 2005 on the budgetisation of the 10th European Development Fund and on the contribution key for the Member States, a process that was both difficult and drawn-out."
"You are of course familiar with the agreement reached, which provides for the future development financing of the ACP states not within the general budget, but within the framework of the 10th European Development Fund."
"You know the figures – the European Council agreed on an amount of EUR 22.6 billion."
"That is the commitment that the European Union made to the ACP countries when the Cotonou Agreement was revised in February 2005."
"In this context it is important to mention that as part of that process the ACP countries were given an undertaking that the aid effort would be maintained at the level of the ninth EDF, minus residual appropriations from previous development funds but adjusted for inflation and EU growth and taking account of the impact of enlargement to the ten new Member States."
"The reason for this is clear: we did not want to reward the inefficiency implied in the non-implementation of appropriations."
"This was a clear undertaking given to the ACP countries by the European Union."
"The Commission’s original proposal – and I hope this will answer your question – was for EUR 24.9 billion, and was based in the ninth EDF including residual appropriations from earlier funds."
"This was therefore right and was in accordance with the commitment made to the ACP countries to correct this Commission proposal."
"In reality – and I believe that we should also acknowledge this fact – the commitment promised by the EU, that is to say the amount I have already mentioned, represents a considerable real increase in funding compared with the ninth EDF, which as we know has a budget of EUR 13.8 billion."
"The average annual contribution is increased for all 15 old Member States on the basis of the new contribution key."
"The 10 new Member States will be taking part in and contributing to an EDF for the first time."
"This is entirely in accordance with the Council agreement of May 2005 significantly to increase public development aid by the year 2015."
"You also asked about the contributions from Bulgaria and Romania."
"Bulgaria and Romania’s planned accession in 2007 has already been anticipated in the calculation of the total volume of the 10th EDF and the individual contributions of the Member States on which the decision is based."
"As we know, the new 10th EDF can only start to run as from the beginning of 2008."
"That means that there will not be any additional funding for the 10th EDF when those countries actually accede to the EU."
"This is totally in line with procedure followed for earlier rounds of enlargement."
"The Council has also made available EUR 18 million for the new Cotonou member Timor-Leste from the ninth EDF, in order to cover EU development aid once Timor-Leste becomes an ACP State, and following the ratification of the Cotonou Agreement for 2007."
"It is a logical consequence of this that Timor-Leste will receive no further support under the budget line for Asia, and as from 2008 will receive aid under the 10th EDF."
"The Council is not at present in a position to give any information on the distribution of funds under the 10th EDF, as this will be discussed during the negotiations shortly about to start on the legal bases, that is to say on the finance protocol to the Cotonou Agreement and the internal financial agreements for the 10th EDF."
"The Austrian Presidency’s objective is to reach agreement with the ACP countries on the finance protocol at the ACP-EU Council of Ministers on 1 and 2 June 2006, in which I shall be taking part."
"There is one more point that I need to comment on, since you raised it, Mrs Kinnock, and that is how the overseas countries and territories and administration costs are to be dealt with."
"These are issues that are still subject to agreement and negotiation."
"The Commission proposal on the distribution of funds between the ACP partner countries is currently being discussed between the Commission and the Member States."
"Support for ACP countries in implementing the regional economic partnership agreements – I think you also asked about that – is expected to come from the funds earmarked for regional cooperation in the 10th EDF."
"The Council has also provided for support for the African Union to be continued under the 10th EDF."
"Time is of the essence."
"Back in January, during the Commission’s discussions with the Austrian Government, the Commissioner responsible, Louis Michel, pressed for swift action to ensure that the current programme under the ninth EDF flows seamlessly into the 10th EDF at the start of 2008."
"As Mr Michel explained to us in very dramatic terms, this time there is only half as much time available as the last time, so we need to act very quickly."
"In order to make sure that happens, in parallel with the negotiations on the 10th EDF that I have already described, the country programming process has also already started."
"Following the adoption of the European Development Consensus and building on the Paris Declaration efforts are being made to achieve joint country development programmes, which are to include not only the European Commission’s country programmes but also those of the Member States."
"We welcome this development and will continue to support it."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I believe that what is at stake here is not so much the distribution of funds, legal issues, programmes and so on, but, unfortunately, the fact that funding has been cut."
"All of us in this House are watching with concern how the revision of the Cotonou Agreement and the negotiations on the tenth European Development Fund are progressing."
"The Council has made a firm commitment to make more money available for development aid."
"This was announced amidst much backslapping at the summits held in July and December 2005."
"The Commission calculated that the tenth EDF covering the period 2008-2013 would have a budget of just under EUR 25 billion."
"I very much regret that contrary to these undertakings the Council has now only been able to agree on an amount of less than EUR 23 billion."
"Apart from less money being made available, this would mean that with increasing public development aid and a fixed EDF budget, EU development aid would effectively be renationalised."
"This would represent a backward step in all our efforts to improve coordination of EU development aid."
"That surely cannot be in our interest."
"I do, however, welcome the fact that here in this House we have come up with a cross-party motion for a resolution aimed at resolving this deplorable situation."
"I call on the Council to stand by its promises and to make available the urgently needed appropriations for EU development aid."
"A difference of EUR 2 billion is not chicken-feed."
"We are talking about eliminating poverty, about sustainable development and about gradual integration of the ACP countries into the world economy."
"Mr President-in-Office, EUR 2 billion less would be a false economy."
"Mr President, Mr Winkler, with regard to the cooperation between the Union and the ACP countries, several sums have been put on the table: firstly by the Commission, then, in December 2005, by the Council and, in the space of a few weeks, nearly EUR 2.5 billion have disappeared."
"I want to believe that we are concerned here only with a gross miscalculation."
"Fortunately, the Commission has recently made some new proposals, on 17 March, which are marked by two significant advances: firstly, an additional package of almost EUR 1 billion for the tenth EDF, which is designed to take care of the administrative costs and, secondly, an additional package of almost EUR 300 million for the OCTs, which would thus be re-integrated into the EDF as, I might add, they are requesting."
"I believe that these Commission proposals are along the right lines and represent a first step on the road indicated by Parliament."
"The fact remains that these proposals are in the hands of the Council from now on and that it is its responsibility to try and come up with something better."
"It is in fact the word of the European Union and its commitment in the fight against poverty that are at stake."
"The word of the Union means the one that is included in Annex 1 to the revised Cotonou Agreement."
"Admittedly, the wording was deliberately ambiguous since it was a matter of gaining the agreement of our ACP partners on some political points that were disputed and, I might add, disputable."
"It was not ambiguous, however, to the point of explaining the fanciful calculations of the Council."
"Let us not make our African partners believe that Europe’s new motto is: ‘promises only bind those who believe in them’."
"Promises were in fact made in 2005."
"Thus, at the European Council in June, the Union and the Member States committed themselves to increasing their official development aid on a regular basis until 2015."
"At the G8 Summit in July, the European Union also committed itself, together with the other donors, to doubling official aid for Africa by 2010."
"Will we be able to keep those promises given the shrinking budget proposed by the Council for the tenth EDF?"
"The answer is ‘no’, and the Council cannot claim otherwise."
"As for the management and payment procedures for this tenth EDF, I also have cause for concern, but explanations are needed as much from the Council as from the Commission."
"It is a question, firstly, of the funding of the ‘development’ dimension in the economic partnership agreements currently under negotiation and, secondly, of the new performance criteria set by the Commission in the working document of 13 January for the allocation of EDF funds, criteria that would be added to the traditional ‘needs’ criterion."
"I should like to conclude by saying a few words about the budgetisation of the EDF."
"This Parliament has expressed its support for the budgetisation on several occasions, since it is a question of the democratic control of the budget allocation."
"I believe that we could include the EDF in the budget while respecting our ACP partners because we need to get away from the intergovernmental practices that give rise to bargaining, with the kind of outcome for the EDF that we saw at the Council in December."
"Admittedly, this is not the issue that we are concerned with today – everything in its own time – but it should not, for all that, be forgotten about."
". Mr President, it has not escaped Mr Winkler that this resolution is not only a joint resolution, but also a unanimous one."
"All the parties, irrespective of our political divisions, remind you of your duties."
"This is a question of honour for our European Union and a question of respect."
"It is not a question of making a promise, but rather of making commitments, and it is a question of credibility with regard to our external action."
"It is as a result not only of the volume, but also of the effectiveness, of aid that credibility is gained."
"With your permission, I will make two remarks on this subject."
"As regards volume, one might think that we are holding a virtual debate here because, between EUR 22 billion and EUR 24 billion, and allowing for the remaining balances and the under-spend, there is little point, when all is said and done, in fighting for EUR 2 billion that might not be spent."
"It is here that you have a responsibility: one of ensuring that this money is actually spent and, furthermore, one of allocating the largest share possible to large-scale regional projects, in particular."
"In saying that, I mean ‘region’ in the sense of NEPAD."
"The subject of my second remark deeply perplexes me."
"In actual fact, if we honour our commitments and go from 0.31% to 0.56% of GDP in 2010, that will mean that we will have an extra EUR 50 billion available to spend on official development aid, EUR 25 billion of which – or one annual EDF – will go to Africa alone, in accordance with the commitment we have just made."
"I am totally perplexed when I come to realise that, where 80% of the funding is concerned, this promise of money will have to be kept by the Member States and not by the Union."
"When I can already see how the Member States react to having to fund the EDF at a sum of EUR 24 billion over five years, I doubt that they can demonstrate to us their ability to provide funding of EUR 25 billion on an annual, or near annual, basis."
"We are therefore in the realms of virtual reality here."
"I believe that we are in danger of two things happening: that we will make fools of ourselves by announcing very high figures for very little in terms of achievement and, above all, that there will be a boomerang effect on our tax-paying constituents, who are going to wonder how on earth we can put the sums announced to good use."
"Mr President, the world faces huge challenges: poverty, climate change, serious diseases and armed conflicts."
"If the Council wishes to demonstrate global responsibility, it must not be stingier and more tight-fisted than the Commission is and make cut-backs of more than EUR 2 billion."
"We must substantially increase the EU’s overall aid to the world's poorest people so that we can honour our pledges."
"It is important to remember that the Member States promised to achieve the UN target of increasing aid to 0.7% of EU GDP by 2015 and that it has a medium-term target of increasing it to 0.56% by 2010."
"Development aid is all well and good, but other things, such as fair trade, are still more important."
"If, at the same time, the EU maintains its exorbitant agricultural subsidies, continues to protect its own markets and, to top it all, cuts back on development aid, the result will be a deadly cocktail that hits the poorest first and then all of us."
"It is, then, for the sake of our common future that we must honour the pledges we have given."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 2005 was the year of rhetoric about development and the fight against poverty."
"Under the UK Presidency, in various institutional and multilateral forums – the European Council, the G8 Summit, the Millennium Summit, 5 September 2005 – the European Union undertook to increase financial support to achieve the millennium development goals, including through an increase in development aid."
"Not to carry out these undertakings would mean taking a backwards step with regard to all the international undertakings made in recent years for combating poverty – a confirmation that it was all just empty rhetoric."
"It was a mistake to reduce the 10th EDF, even though the full amount provided under the ninth was not spent."
"Instead, we ought to have made financial provision for the major structural reforms required of the ACP countries within the framework of the EPA negotiations."
"How can anyone believe that these countries – and let us remember that we are talking about countries where most of the poorest peoples in the world live – can succeed in making national and regional macroeconomic reforms without European financial aid?"
"How will they mitigate the social impacts and further reforms that will add to the restrictions already imposed by the reforms required by the international financial institutions?"
"Why should further reductions in tariffs be made, leading to a further reduction in the public funds available, as requested within the framework of the EPA negotiations, if on the European side the Member States are not ready to make any effort to increase support for the state budgets of ACP countries?"
"What sort of partnership is this?"
"I also believe that there is not much clarity about the EU’s specific undertaking in the +5 development funding process or about the precise extent of development funding within the framework of the EPA negotiations."
"How can we keep faith with the commitments we have made if we reduce the European development budget?"
"Thinking about the international geopolitical situation as well, I believe that it would be strategically more far-sighted on our part – as the European Union – to now enter into a relationship of mutual political support with the poorest countries, and thus reinforce the EU-ACP partnership."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union, which is the biggest donor worldwide, has a duty to honour the commitments it made on several occasions in 2000 when the millennium goals were defined, and recently in the Council and in the G8 meetings held in 2005."
"Mr Winkler, reducing the proposed allocation for the EDF is not a positive signal for our global partners, particularly the ACP countries, at the very moment when it is clear that the millennium goals are very far from being achieved."
"Each day, globalisation gives rise to new, difficult challenges for developing countries."
"As well as the size of the allocation, in order for our funds to be truly effective in the fight against poverty we must focus fully on transparency, consistency with the other policies of the EU, the criterion of performance by beneficiaries and, above all, the full participation of the governments involved and the coordination of various instruments, both at European level and with regard to the development policies put in place individually by the various Member States with a view to slimming down the bureaucracy which still accounts for too large a part of overall expenditure."
"It is vital for the Council to agree to allocate the funds needed to comply with the commitments made and for the Commission, partly on the basis of the recommendations received from the Court of Auditors in September 2005, to undertake to put in place a transparent, efficient and effective system for careful management of the funds."
"– Mr President, the question we are debating tonight is very important to the external action of the European Union and to efforts to respond to our political commitment to achieve the Millennium Goals."
"It is reasonable for us to question if the amount proposed for the 10th Regional Fund is lower than that calculated by the European Commission and to which we committed or is satisfactory in order for us to respond to both goals and needs."
"However, it is not just the amount of financing which need concern us."
"We have often observed problems which need to be addressed directly and which touch on the speed of disbursements and the accumulation of unused appropriations amounting to 11 billion, as you mentioned Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"Moreover, the budgetisation of the European Development Fund will resolve many of the complications and difficulties in the application of successive European regional funds, will help speed up their liquidity flow and will wipe out the existing democratic deficit, which is something the European Parliament has expressed repeatedly."
"Similarly Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the financial resources managed by the European Investment Fund are not verified by the Court of Auditors or the European Parliament."
"Transparency must be improved if information on these financial resources is transmitted; we need a breakdown by type of use and an overall picture of results, of cooperation on applications outstanding and of added value."
"We undertook, together with the ACP countries, to implement the Millennium Development Goals and, further to Mr Cornillet's reference to respect for taxpayers, I want to say that we need to value the implementation and control mechanisms both in our institutions and in the beneficiary states."
"We shall be both more democratic and more consistent in our commitments to European taxpayers and more efficient in the Millennium Goals."
"Mr President, finance is at the heart of many debates on development policy."
"This is all the more so at present, because the negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council on the budgetisation for the next seven years have been very intense."
"We know that the Commission proposal makes many objectives that have repeatedly been stated and restated unachievable."
"That applies to totally different areas: exchange programmes for students, maintaining biological diversity, and also of course it applies in particular to development programmes, to programmes for eradicating poverty and to sustainable development programmes."
"In this debate on the revision of the Cotonou Agreement we are not looking at the financial perspective, which is currently the subject of such intense debate, because the European Development Fund is not part of the general budget. However, the problems involved are the same."
"People talk big – and we are no exception – but far too little money is made available."
"The European Parliament regrets that the Council is setting the agreed total for the tenth EDF below the level calculated by the Commission."
"The exact figures have already been mentioned several times."
"The reduction of EUR 2 billion runs counter to the commitments that the Union has entered into in the context of the revision of the Cotonou Agreement, and it ignores all the promises made to substantially increase development aid."
"We call on the Member States to significantly increase their contributions to the tenth EDF, so that the commitments entered into and the promises made can be honoured."
"I am also very happy that it will be a unanimous resolution, because of course that would give a great deal of support for the positions that various Members of this House have expressed here today."
"I would, however, like once more to declare my support for the amendments before us, which are very much concerned with ensuring how the development aspects of the economic partnership agreements will be financed."
"Should you finance a ‘development dimension’ by taking money intended for achieving the Millennium Development Goals, or – as we are demanding and as I would also like to see demanded in the resolution – should it be additional money?"
"I would like once again to support the call already made by my colleague Mrs Kinnock that at the time of Romania and Bulgaria’s accession – which is due to take place in the very near future – there should be additional funding for the EDF."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened very carefully and I recognise that this House is unanimous in its view."
"I would like to say, however, that the Council will of course be adhering to the commitments it has made."
"I have already said, and this remains my view, that we believe we are very much honouring those commitments to the ACP countries."
"The issue of the distribution and allocation of appropriations is also very important, because structural problems also have to be addressed in this context – for example, the issue of residual appropriations has been mentioned."
"Of course it is in our interest for residual appropriations to remain as low as possible."
"That requires very careful examination."
"We will put such an examination in place and we will also revisit it."
"The issue of increasing ODA appropriations has also been mentioned."
"I would like to point out that the Internal Financing Agreement makes provision for the possibility of cofinancing by the Member States to or through the EDF."
"A number of references have been made to the issue of economic partnerships."
"In the context of such partnerships, which we very much see as instruments of development aid, one of our aspirations is to support the ACP countries in fulfilling their potential for economic integration and in increasing competition by building up trade capacity."
"The ACP regions will also be strengthened by means of their regional political and economic integration and their integration into the global economy."
"We therefore believe that it is particularly important for the economic partnership agreements to provide support by means of development aid from the tenth EDF."
"Lastly, I would like to refer once again to the increase in appropriations associated with Bulgaria and Romania."
"The Council has fully adhered to the practice adopted up to now and has included Romania and Bulgaria, which will have acceded by then, in its calculations for the appropriations for the tenth EDF in 2008."
"I regard that procedure as being totally proper and I do not believe that the Council has behaved unfairly."
"A great deal of what has been discussed and requested here today is still subject to negotiation."
"All this is also of course linked with the financial perspective."
"I would like to stress once again that the Austrian Presidency is willing to exchange views with you on development issues at any time."
"That is the context in which we have proposed briefing Parliament’s Committee on Development following the forthcoming General Affairs and External Relations Council on 11 April, which will be devoted exclusively to development issues."
"The date of 24 April has already been informally earmarked for that purpose."
"Six motions for resolutions(1) have been submitted pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"I rise today to speak about a great humanitarian tragedy that is currently taking place."
"Since 1 January of this year, more than a thousand African immigrants have reached the waters of the Canary Islands, but many more have drowned during the crossing from Mauritania to the Canary Islands."
"It is an enormous waste of human life."
"The Spanish Government and the Mauritanian Government have begun to cooperate, but I hope that the European Union, and specifically the Commission and the Council, will adopt measures to help resolve this great human tragedy very soon."
"The expansion and realisation of the Trans-European Network is almost a mainstay as we strive for the goals presented in the European Commission's 2001 White Paper, and as we translate the Lisbon Strategy into reality."
"However, Trans-European Network projects have only been evaluated, if they were appropriately planned, funded and implemented."
"Bearing in mind the proposal on the financial perspective for the period 2007-2013 made by the European Council in December, it becomes clear that there will obviously be financial difficulties when evaluating projects."
"Therefore, I believe that the European Union ought to contribute more to realisation by encouraging the following measures: a more flexible approach to the use of Structural and Cohesion Funds when funding Trans-European Networks and the funding of the ‘Galileo’ programmes from the scientific research budget line."
"Projects must also be prioritised, with priority given to such projects as for instance, the rail sector that has made most progress to date with its so-called cross-border rail corridors."
"– The problems faced by Portuguese farmers on account of the poor agricultural year, caused by the extreme drought of the past year, have been exacerbated by the unilateral termination by the government of agrifood measures agreed in 2005 with farmers and 85% cofinanced by the EU."
"This situation is also an example of the consequences of implementing the irrational criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact, which leads to swingeing budget cuts to tackle deficits, regardless of the economic and social problems caused, and which prevents the use of Community funds missing in the Portuguese budget for the 15% national contribution, as the government has pointed out."
"This raises two questions: firstly, when the irrational criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact will be thrown out; and secondly, whether the Commission has a strategy for mitigating the problems experienced by Portuguese farmers."
"Mr President, Britain currently enjoys a tax derogation on red diesel that applies to leisure boating."
"That derogation expires in December 2006."
"If the derogation is not extended, the price of fuel for motorboats could treble."
"If this happens there will be an inevitable decline in leisure boating."
"The Exchequer will receive less tax revenue, not more, and economic damage will be done to local communities."
"The continuation of the derogation is a matter between the Council and the Commission, but tax policy should be the sole prerogative of sovereign national governments."
"All British MEPs should lobby the Minister responsible to ensure that the derogation continues."
"They should also join the campaign to save the derogation started by magazine."
"I will be pleased to supply them with details of how to do so."
"– Mr President, this is the third time in this parliamentary term that I have taken the floor at a plenary session to protest at discrimination against Catholics."
"This time I wish to speak about the blocking of Radio Maryja’s interactive Internet broadcasting, which is the only reliable source of information for Members of a Christian persuasion."
"Our activities, like those of our electorate, are linked to these media, and the fact that reception of this station has been blocked therefore means that we have been deprived of any contact with our electorate for two months."
"Requests and reminders to the information and telecommunications services have not yielded any results, which is why I feel obliged to speak in this Parliament with reference to Article 10 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"The current situation is a glaring contravention of the principles enshrined in the Convention."
"We hope that we will be guaranteed our freedoms in the European Parliament, along with other minorities."
"Mr President, I would like to express my concern about the conditions in which the Russian authorities keep their prisoners."
"Contrary to law, Mikhail Khodorkovsky of the Yukos Company has been sent 7000 kilometres away from his family."
"His lawyer travelled to the Siberian detention camp – it took six hours by plane, thirteen hours by train and a couple of hours by car – to prepare an appeal to the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg."
"She was allowed to meet her client only after 6.00 p.m."
"After several evening meetings, Mr Khodorkovsky was suddenly transferred to a special isolation cell."
"He is still there today."
"The apparent reason was to prevent him from completing his appeal to the Court in Strasbourg."
"I invite my colleagues to react to these arbitrary actions by the Russian authorities, who blatantly defy their own laws."
"On Sunday two young Estonians, unofficial election observers, were arrested in Minsk."
"‘Don’t come to Minsk with your orange revolution,’ they were told."
"The Belarusian elections were still not free this time round."
"I am convinced that the elections that will be held this weekend in Ukraine will be democratic, fair and free."
"Having just visited Kiev, I can confirm that."
"Moldova, Ukraine and Belarus – Estonia sympathises with these countries, because we have not forgotten our history."
"This week, Estonia mourns a person without whom our return to Europe would have been considerably more difficult."
"Obituaries refer to President Lennart Meri as a great Estonian."
"He was chosen European of the Year five years before Estonia joined the European Union."
"Lennart Meri devoted all of his energy to the struggle against ‘petty-European’ thinking."
"The European Union should not behave in a narrow-minded or short-sighted manner."
"It must support all those countries attempting to free themselves from the shackles of the past and join a democratic Europe."
"We must unequivocally state that fulfilment of the three Copenhagen criteria also offers the vassal states of the Soviet Union the opportunity to become Member States of the European Union."
"– With the decision on the expansion of the Euro zone fast approaching, the criteria for the introduction of the Euro are becoming increasingly politicised."
"The head of the European Central Bank has stated that the criteria must be met in the long term, not only during the assessment period."
"Recently, the high price of energy supplies – an external factor, independent from the management of a country's economy – has been having an influence on one of the Maastricht criteria – increases in inflation."
"It is very complex to maintain high rates of economic growth and low inflation."
"Furthermore, when determining inflation criteria, we must also take into account the accidental reduction in the price of certain goods in Finland and the Netherlands who have the lowest inflation, and improve the means of determining criteria."
"In Lithuania inflation may slightly exceed the amount expected in the criteria."
"For six years it has been considerably lower than Maastricht's requirements, but in an economy which is emerging so rapidly, keeping prices low is something truly complex."
"After the unsuccessful referendum on the Constitutional Treaty, and without a common foreign and energy policy, let us at least expand the Euro zone and give the European Union renewed impetus for growth."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the exclusion by the Independence and Democracy Group of the Polish delegation and the Northern League is a scandal, which has taken place by means of an illegal procedure from start to finish that bears a Soviet stamp."
"There is a letter addressed to the President of the European Parliament by the then chairman of the IND-DEM Bureau, Mr Piotrowski."
"We would like to know from the President when an official response will be given to this complaint."
"We are ready to appeal to the European Court of Justice, and meanwhile those who have used Soviet methods to exclude us from this group, by dismissing us in a way fully reminiscent of Communism, are being investigated by the Court of Auditors for bungling the use of funds, bungling which we and our friends and colleagues in the Polish delegation have always opposed in the name of the principle of transparency."
"Please clarify this issue, which is bringing shame upon the European Parliament."
"– Last Sunday, the European Parliament awaited the Belarusian presidential elections which were due to take place."
"True, the election campaign left little room for hope that the elections would be democratic, free and honest, as the campaign was conducted in an atmosphere of threats, opposition leader arrests and the suppression of the independent press."
"Lukashenko's regime is responsible for all this, but some still hoped that at least the elections would be honest."
"Unfortunately, instead of an election all we saw was a farce of an election – a rigged election, like those organised in the 1930s or 1950s in Eastern Europe, and in Lithuania during the Soviet occupation."
"This is confirmed by the conclusions of the OSCE observer mission, but the ‘jeans revolution’ is not over."
"Around 600 young people spent yet another night in tents on ‘October’ Square in Minsk, braving a temperature of minus 10 degrees."
"Yesterday, 11 EU ambassadors visited them to demonstrate the European Union's solidarity."
"Mr President, we must demand the organisation of fresh presidential elections in Belarus."
"– Mr President, we welcome the clear progress in negotiations with the Council on the new financial perspective."
"The outcome of yesterday’s trialogue, however, was merely the first step on the road to an agreement, and this step was taken halfway through the Austrian Presidency."
"It took three whole months for the Council to enter into negotiations."
"Meanwhile, in nine months the interinstitutional agreement will expire, a new programming period will start and the European Union will be joined by two more members, yet we still do not know what our budget will be and what kind of European Union we are striving towards."
"We do not have time for negotiations that drag on for months, particularly as the EU’s citizens cannot comprehend why it is so difficult to reach an agreement if we are all working towards the same goal, namely balanced development in the interest of all Member States."
"Time works against progress, however, and delays in implementing new programmes are in effect lost investment opportunities and lost chances."
"This is something we will be accountable for to the citizens of the united Europe."
"In any case, we cannot afford to waste the next few weeks."
"A compromise must be reached as soon as possible."
"Mr President, next week in Cyprus is the commemoration day for those who lost their lives in the 1955 popular uprising against British colonial rule."
"Hundreds of civilians, including women and children, were killed or executed by the British Army during the four-year freedom struggle which ended in 1959, after Britain was forced to grant Cyprus a form of independence."
"Today, Cyprus and Britain, in a spirit of forgiveness and reconciliation, are friends and partners though membership of the EU, and they cooperate closely in trying to achieve peace and prosperity."
"Unfortunately, however, this relationship is at risk of being poisoned because of the continued presence of British troops in Cyprus."
"About ten thousand British soldiers are stationed in an area amounting to approximately four per cent of the territory of the island, known as sovereign British bases."
"Many thousands of Cypriot civilians live in these areas in which the , strangely, does not apply."
"Their human rights are being profoundly violated by Britain."
"I appeal to my British colleagues to understand the feelings and respect the rights of the Cypriot people and to exert pressure on their Government to return this territory of the British bases back to its rightful owners: the people of Cyprus."
"I know this is a sore point, but I hope you will agree with me that it is totally unacceptable for Britain, an EU Member State, to occupy part of another EU Member State, Cyprus."
"– Mr President, the European Union has sided with the bank UniCredito Italiano in its dispute with the Polish Government."
"In so doing, it has ignored the old Roman principle of – agreements are made to be kept – since UniCredito has not kept its side of the agreement."
"The Union has ignored the fact that as a result of the bank’s actions, banking services on the Polish market have become monopolised."
"Essentially, EU officials are protecting the interests and profits of UniCredito Italiano."
"Do EU officials wish to prove by means of this attitude that the idea that the European institutions exist to protect consumers, entrepreneurs and competition is a mere platitude, and that all that really counts are the interests of big business?"
"That is a that we Polish Members oppose."
"Mr President, I would like to speak about the latest discrimination affecting new Member States."
"The Strasbourg session of the European Parliament is always a serious ordeal for the Members of the European Parliament."
"Many MEPs can only access Strasbourg via Frankfurt."
"This means an exhausting two and a half hour coach trip."
"We now have a further inconvenience added to those experienced so far."
"Passengers travelling with airlines of new Member States now have to pass through security checks twice at Frankfurt airport, while other passengers go through them only once."
"It is quite interesting that passengers travelling to Afghanistan must only go through security checks once, while those travelling to the capitals of new Member States, such as Tallinn, Riga, Vilnius, Warsaw, Prague, Bratislava, Budapest and Ljubljana must go through two security checks."
"This is an example of further open discrimination against the airlines of new Member States and passengers travelling to these countries, because it increases the costs incurred by airlines."
"I would like to ask the German MEPs to help put a stop to the discrimination against new Member States."
"Mr President, I would like to address two issues very briefly."
"Democracy and human rights are very important to Europeans: we like to cherish and preserve them."
"Tunne Kelam has already raised the matter of the human rights situation in Russia and, in particular, the treatment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky."
"If we in the European Union really stand for human rights, we cannot accept this."
"We have to intervene in the Khodorkovsky case, as well as the human rights situation in Russia generally."
"Another matter relating to democracy is the notion that we in the European Union should know exactly what the European taxpayers’ euros are being spent on."
"We cannot support terrorist organisations such as Hamas, which has now come to power in the Palestinian autonomous zone."
"Instead, we should be promoting democracy, and we should cease cooperation with terrorist organisations and stop financing them."
"Mr President, pursuant to the implementation of the Nitrates Directive, the agricultural sector in my constituency, as elsewhere, is being subjected to extensive capital expenditure for the purpose of radically increasing slurry storage capacity."
"To assist, a UK Government scheme of grant aid was announced, with applications possible until the end of this month."
"Then, unilaterally, the same department announced earlier this month that the scheme was closing, because the amount designated – a mere GBP 45 million – was already over-subscribed."
"Farmers who in good faith were working to the stipulated deadline are quite clearly disadvantaged."
"The justification for the aid, namely the necessity to undertake excessively expensive work, still exists."
"The assistance, however, has now been withdrawn."
"This is as unfair as the GBP 45 million was patently inadequate."
"I therefore use this forum tonight to call on the UK Government to release sufficient funds to enable this essential work to be done, otherwise the implementation of the Nitrates Directive will be impossible."
"Mr President, on 19 February 2006, a small group of young Maltese members of Moviment Graffitti organised a peaceful protest in favour of peace and against war."
"They wanted to show their disapproval of the presence in Maltese ports of five NATO warships by simply displaying banners saying ‘Peace not War’ and ‘Warships Kill’."
"The police authorities stopped these activists from showing these banners – a small and legitimate peaceful protest – on Pinto Wharf and on the Grand Harbour bastions."
"Furthermore, the activists were allegedly told that such demonstrations would not be allowed in the future."
"This attitude is unacceptable and breaches the fundamental right of freedom of expression."
"This is why I have asked the Commission to come up with an opinion on this case."
"We should show full solidarity with these young people and urge them to continue exercising their right to express their opinions in a peaceful manner."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Morgantini, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the development impact of Economic Partnership Agreements (2005/2162(INI)) (A6-0053/2006)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ‘You will eat when you are competitive’ is a slogan on a poster: in the background, a starving African child."
"The phrase is very emphatic, but it actually seems that the European Union, and this is a euphemism, is placing too much emphasis on the effectiveness of trade in the fight against poverty."
"The report under debate today is incomplete, and in the draft, in fact, there were some points where the effects of liberalisation on the economies of developing countries were called into question."
"Various econometric studies, a report by Christian Aid and the study entitled ‘Winners and losers’ by Sandra Polanski, published last week, have shown that many developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, would be experiencing better conditions today if we had not introduced unbridled liberalisation measures."
"The Polanski study, which analyses the winners and losers in the liberalisations launched under the Doha Round, confirms data previously published by UNCTAD and the UNDP and reaches certain conclusions: developing countries will probably be the losers in the game, since they do not have the agricultural or industrial capacity to compete with the rich countries; the winners will in fact be the rich countries: the United States, Europe and Japan, and also China."
"Free trade will produce modest gains at the global level, partly because the adjustment costs which countries have to deal with when they undertake the liberalisation process promoted by the industrialised countries can be greater than the benefits."
"It is not a question of being against trade, since the opening up of the markets can also be an effective instrument in the fight against poverty, but like any instrument it must be used with great caution."
"First of all, it is necessary to put the countries in a position to meet their own internal requirements, by boosting productive capacity in line, above all, with internal goals of self-sufficiency in food, and then it is necessary to allow them to tackle competition and limitations on supply, by providing adequate resources which are currently not present in the financial perspectives."
"Secondly, it is then necessary to work on the basis of realistic timetables, which take into account the time that structural adjustments require and, thirdly, it is necessary to restrict the opening up of the market, and to lay down, in addition, mechanisms for suspending the liberalisation process, if necessary, and to give the ACP countries the opportunity to protect their own incipient and strategic industries; in any case, we used this criterion ourselves throughout the last century and some in fact are still trying to put it forward again today."
"These principles are almost present in the report, partly because these are the requests of the ACP countries, and it is those countries that are putting them forward."
"Because an effective principle of partnership requires that we take into account the requests of our partners, above all if they are justified, and above all if they are backed by civil society in Europe and in the ACP countries."
"Also and above all because the economic partnership agreements arise from the legal and institutional framework of the Cotonou agreement, signed by the European Union – and I underline this – and they have development and combating poverty as their ultimate goals."
"On the basis of this same principle of partnership, we do not have the right to impose agreements."
"I believe that it is those countries that have to do it, and one of the main points in the report is the call for the Commission to carry out an immediate study of the alternatives so that the ACP countries can evaluate the options and decide whether to sign the agreements or not."
"The reciprocity that is being called for in the implementation of liberalisations, then, means applying equal laws to those who are not equal in economic or development terms; this is no way to produce equality or democracy."
"Thinking about development solely in terms of increasing a country’s gross domestic product is very reductionist."
"Development is hard to define, but when in my report the Commission is called upon to protect the sectors of water, health and education from liberalisation, what we are fundamentally talking about is rights that must be guaranteed, as when the Cape Town Declaration is quoted."
"The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly also has the power to set development indicators in order to assess the achievement of results and trade agreements, requesting that social and environmental indicators be included such as the creation of dignified work, health, education and gender equality."
"We are talking about rights – the same rights for which we have struggled in Europe, the same rights on which the European Union is founded."
"The European Parliament cannot wish to remove these values."
"We are at a crucial point in the struggle against poverty and we must meet the objectives that we have set ourselves."
"Mr President, Mrs Morgantini, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission, I should like to congratulate the Committee on Development, and in particular its Chairman, Mrs Morgantini, for this report which makes development central to the negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements, the EPAs."
"Development, we all agree, is indeed the starting point, the vital issue and the priority for our action."
"We shall, of course, continue to insist on that throughout the negotiations and during the implementation of the EPAs, when the time comes."
"Firstly, I am delighted that we share the same opinions on very many points, such as the importance of the dialogue with civil society and the national parliaments of the ACP countries, the objective of regional integration and economic governance, the role of investment and the diversification of exports."
"I find, in this report, opinions that I myself have often put forward to our partners, who have a vital role to play in this respect."
"The prime objective is development, and that also involves a flexible approach that makes it possible to take into account the economic weaknesses of the countries concerned, which we are trying to strengthen."
"This approach manifests itself, for example, in the way in which trade liberalisation is biased in favour of the ACP countries, in flexibility in relation to the opening of their markets, in the extent to which we cover their products and in the necessary safeguard mechanisms."
"These are all principles that were clearly stated in our negotiating positions from the first day and that the Commissioner, Mr Mandelson, has himself confirmed on several occasions."
"Nonetheless, I have also observed that, on certain sensitive issues, the report raises doubts that I feel are not justified."
"For example, the report questions how coherent our position concerning the EPAs is with the commitments made in the Cotonou Agreement or in the recent declaration on the European Union’s development policy."
"Perhaps there is a communication problem, which I shall try to resolve this very day."
"There should be no misunderstandings between us, because Parliament’s support is obviously more necessary to the Commission than ever in the delicate phase of negotiations that we are in and that should come to an end in a little more than a year."
"First of all, I think that we need to put the compatibility of EPAs with the rules of the WTO back into the right perspective."
"Of course, this compatibility is imperative if we wish to ensure the stability of the EPAs, as of all our trade agreements, and the Commission must attend to this."
"We are also willing to improve on the WTO rules, if possible."
"Some proposals have been made along these lines, but I think we should have no illusions and that we must be aware of the objective limitations and difficulties of this approach."
"Above all, however, one must not forget that the real reason for the EPAs’ existence is not the WTO but the urgent need, amply demonstrated and confirmed in the Cotonou Agreement, to make better use of trade as a driving force for economic growth in the ACP countries, as it has been for so many other countries, including developing countries."
"In my opinion the success of the Economic Partnership Agreements will depend on three key factors, all of equal importance."
"Firstly, negotiations genuinely targeting the development of our partners, which is, as I have said, our only strategic objective."
"Secondly, the commitment of our ACP partners to establishing a statutory framework that favours investment."
"Thirdly, the support that the European Union, but also its Member States and other sponsors, will be able to offer to the countries concerned in order to prepare for, and bring about, the implementation of the EPAs."
"I understand the attention that our partners and Parliament are giving to this last point."
"From my very first day at the Commission, I promised to ensure that the necessary answers would be found."
"We have succeeded – in obtaining the commitment of Member States to progressively doubling their aid for development, and I thank Parliament for its support without which this would not have been possible."
"May I remind you that that will represent an increase of more than EUR 20 billion per year from 2010?"
"We have succeeded in reaching an agreement on strengthening the cooperation between the Commission and the Member States within the framework of the European consensus adopted in December and confirming the priority to be given to the effectiveness of aid."
"We decided to focus first on Africa and we developed a coherent strategy for Africa."
"A trust fund for infrastructures, including those that facilitate trade, is already in place."
"In the context of the programme for the tenth European Development Fund (EDF), we are deciding with our partners on the best means of supporting regional economic integration, for which our partners have themselves drawn up agendas."
"The Economic Partnership Agreements are part of this action and represent an important part of it."
"From this point of view, the timescale is essential."
"For example, loss of tax revenues resulting from the dismantling of customs tariffs will arise once the EPAs have come into force."
"This will be offset partly by the expected economic growth and partly by the rationalisation of taxation systems, which has already been initiated in several countries, often with our support."
"Furthermore, in order to make the transition easier, macroeconomic support measures are already envisaged for certain regions."
"I can tell you that I am actively working on devising measures to support the Economic Partnership Agreements, particularly in terms of the consequences there could be, initially, in terms of the resources necessary for the operation of the sovereign State."
"I know that there are some who would be in favour of a debate on the possible alternatives to the EPAs."
"Personally, I do not think that an academic debate of this kind would be useful."
"Firstly, an in-depth debate already took place when it was agreed, at Cotonou, that EPAs would offer the greatest benefits in terms of development, of market access compatible with the WTO and of support for good governance and regional integration."
"Secondly, all the ACP countries are continuing to negotiate EPAs."
"Finally, countries benefit from the effects of having access to markets forming part of the system of generalised preferences and of the ‘everything but arms’ initiative."
"We know, in the meantime, after virtually half a century of unilateral preference under the Lomé Convention and the Cotonou Agreement, that this preferential access to our market is not in itself enough to meet the needs of our partners."
"In conclusion, the report conveys our common position on a wide range of subjects."
"In order to set so many countries on the road to development and growth, I am ready to continue working with you on the objectives and challenges that we and our partners face in this complex, ambitious and vital project constituted by the EPAs."
"Tomorrow, I have a seminar on East Africa."
"You know that I am doing the rounds of all the regional organisations and that, on each visit, I hear anxieties expressed by all those involved in development."
"You have conveyed these anxieties perfectly and, believe me, I am acutely aware of them."
"I am acutely aware of the very real questions that you are raising and I can tell you openly that investigations and discussions are making good progress, and creative thinking too, in order to develop a range of ways to give better support to the partner countries and to respond more directly to their concerns."
"In conclusion, then, I thank you."
"I completely agree with the essential features of this excellent report and I remain more than ever open to the idea of a debate with you, particularly about the best ways to give support to this process."
". Mr President, Commissioner, the Economic Partnership Agreements are about trade relations with the ACP countries, which in turn are governed by the Cotonou Agreement."
"The present arrangements are, however, no longer consonant with the rules agreed within the WTO, in that the special treatment enjoyed by the ACP countries in comparison with other developing countries contravenes WTO rules and must therefore be brought into line with them."
"The present system may continue to apply until 2008, and must have been adapted by then at the latest."
"There are those in the House who reject EPA’s from the outset; they do not believe that a certain measure of trade liberalisation, in whatever form, can make any contribution to the development of poor countries."
"My group, though, is convinced that trade can indeed play a part, certainly that the liberalisation of trade among the ACP countries can do so."
"We have no objection in principle to EPAs, provided that they are arrived at on the basis of sound agreements, providing for such things as adequate time for the countries in question to adapt to the new circumstances, and support for them in doing so."
"It is important that EPAs should make provision for that."
"So, as far as we are concerned, let there be EPAs, if they stand a chance of helping to fight poverty."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wants them to retain the development goal as a top priority, which means that liberalisation must only be gradual, for the benefit of the ACP countries and adapted to their specific and varied circumstances, with important basic services such as water, education, transport and energy remaining available to all."
"The PPE wants a realistic timetable, in other words enough time for necessary changes to be made."
"The PPE-DE Group wants sufficient support measures (for example technical assistance, capacity-building and reforms in such areas as customs and taxation) and it wants to see cooperation on a regional basis promoted between the ACP countries."
"There are four areas about which the PPE-DE Group has concerns, and they are as follows."
"The first is the limited supply of information from the Commission on the course of the negotiations."
"Then there is the pressure of time under which these are now being conducted and under which they will also have to be implemented."
"The negotiations have been in progress since 2002 and still no draft texts have been made available to us."
"Finally, there are the financial aspects."
"The EPAs’ success will depend on a decent sum of money being made available."
"In the first place, this will have to come from the European Development Fund and then from other sources as well."
"It is not yet sufficiently clear where the money will come from then."
"There are emergency rules that make provision for this, and they are necessary."
"If the system appears not to be working in some places, the process must be capable of being slowed down or stopped for a period of time."
"Scope for that already exists under current WTO rules."
"We have as yet no specific proposals to make about this."
"The Commissioner has already gone some way deeper into this issue, and I look forward with pleasure to closer cooperation and more detailed information."
". Mr President, I should to like to thank the Commissioner."
"I wish to begin by referring to his remark that talking about alternatives to economic partnership agreements is ‘academic’ – that was the word he used."
"It is very clearly stated in the Cotonou Agreement that alternatives are part of what the ACP countries have an option on deciding to follow."
"Therefore, Commissioner, it is not an academic issue, but something that is very definitely an option for the ACP."
"The economic partnership agreements are very complex and complicated for the ACP and are the most complex and complicated negotiations they have ever engaged in."
"I suspect that they also present the Commission with certain difficulties, if not only because of the tensions which naturally exist between DG Development’s concerns and priorities and DG Trade’s concerns and priorities, which are very different."
"We know from our own experience in this Parliament that there is not always that necessary coherence between our objectives."
"My impression is that there are concerns that are common to all the regional negotiations and I am following them very closely."
"There are examples of the Commission wanting a framework that facilitates trade as a first priority."
"The ACP regions are far more interested in addressing supply side constraints and the link between EPAs and development support."
"Market access remains absolutely central as an issue."
"The proposed opening of the economies of the ACP countries – most of which are least-developed countries – is a major concern."
"The benefits of regional integration, market access and integrated trade and development, as my colleague Mrs Martens said, are absolutely clear."
"However, what we understand in the Committee on Development is that any potential benefits could be outweighed by the potential costs which they might be expected to pay."
"Therefore, the agreements they might have to make on market access – market opening – may not be exactly what they need and perhaps they could get more from other kinds of arrangements."
"To be competitive and to market their goods, there needs to be substantial investment in their ability to do so."
"ACP countries need training and their workforce needs to be improved; they need improved infrastructure, transport and institutional capacity-building."
"All these are major priorities for the ACP."
"It must be said that it is not for the Commission to tell the ACP what a good EPA is."
"It is up to the ACP – in consultation with their parliaments, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and civil society – to make that kind of decision. Any criteria we make on economic partnership agreements must be based on their relationship with the Millennium Development Goals."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner one question."
"The central Africa negotiations are portrayed as a model of these regional negotiations."
"My sources tell me that DG Development at its highest level – that probably means you, Commissioner – is very worried about the capacity of the secretariat of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community in their negotiations."
"Is it the case that you, Commissioner, have publicly called for the executive secretary and chief EPA negotiator in CAEMC to be dismissed?"
"If that is the case, then how does this sit with DG Trade’s description of this as being the absolute role model?"
"Finally, I should like to draw attention to the Cape Town Declaration of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2002."
"Benchmarks were put in place there to assess the conduct and outcome of the negotiations on the basis of key social and environmental indicators, including decent work, health, education and gender."
"The potential for this was confirmed last year by the ACP Council."
"Will the Commissioner act upon these proposals?"
". Mr President, Mrs Morgantini’s report was very much welcomed by the Committee on Development because it is clear about the fundamental principles on which economic partnership should be based."
"As Commissioner Michel and Commissioner Mandelson have stated, economic partnership agreements must be development-friendly."
"That means that liberalisation must, of necessity, be asymmetrical."
"There can be no question of forcing ACP countries to open up their markets to European goods until their own domestic markets are much more firmly established."
"From the European side, we can offer aid for trade measures to help with this market-building and with supply-side constraints."
"Of the amendments tabled for Plenary, the ALDE Group will be supporting those which underline that the pace of market opening should be driven by the ACP and that there is scope for the EU to work much more closely with ACP partners in world trade negotiations."
"Together, the ACP countries and the EU form a substantial block."
"The ALDE Group will also be supporting those amendments from the PPE-DE Group which offer improved wording and avoid overly restrictive definitions of, for instance, decent working benchmarks."
"Some NGOs have campaigned on a simple platform of ‘no’ to EPAs, but that could be throwing the baby out with the bathwater."
"The regional integration which is part of the EPA process will help ACP countries to prosper, to increase South-South trade and the removal of tariff barriers between neighbouring ACP countries."
"The essential point at every stage of the EPA negotiating process is to ensure that the outcome works in favour of development."
"I hope the Commission will at all times be genuinely and consistently guided by that principle and by this report."
"Mr President, the purpose of the Cotonou Agreement and the Economic Partnership Agreements is to eradicate poverty and promote sustainable development."
"That objective must under no circumstances go by the board."
"The mentality or idea of reciprocity, based on a principle of equality, is therefore quite wrong."
"The fact is, we are concerned here with two quite unequal partners, the EU and the ACP countries, so it is not the ACP countries that should be helping the EU countries, but the other way around."
"That is something I am absolutely certain Mrs Morgantini agrees with me about."
"Poor countries’ only export opportunities are in the fields of agriculture and raw materials and in relation to very labour-intensive products, such as textiles, which they should be allowed to export to ourselves in the EU without restriction."
"The ACP countries also have extremely weak economies."
"We cannot therefore demand that these countries just go ahead and open up 90% of their markets in return for the EU opening up its own markets as a kind of payment."
"That is a view also expressed in Mrs Morgantini’s report."
"I hope, then, that I am right in interpreting paragraph 17 of the report as saying that it is of course only the ACP countries that are entitled to introduce temporary import restrictions in relation to industries threatened by surges in imports."
"It would be very unfortunate if we were entitled to prevent the ACP countries from selling us textiles and agricultural products just because we had not been skilful enough to adapt to the changed conditions of competition in a globalised world."
"The fact is that we too were allowed to protect our own markets when our economies were still developing."
"That being said, protecting markets is a very uncertain way of achieving growth and a healthy economy, and it should therefore be a limited, including time-limited, measure for developing countries too."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in this House have already, on a number of occasions and with a large degree of unanimity, reached agreement on the Millennium Development Goals and have flagged up the elimination of poverty from our planet as our most important task over the coming decades."
"Mrs Morgantini’s excellent report has now provided us with an assessment of the contribution economic partnership agreements can make to actually achieving this task."
"We expect the Commission to give clear priority to development and the elimination of poverty in the ACP countries in the negotiations."
"The criticism that I am about to make is clearly aimed at the appearance of a representative of DG Trade at a hearing of the Committee on Development."
"Let me be quite clear about this: we do not want negotiations that reflect the style and behaviour of a colonial power; we believe that the decision-making sovereignty of our partners in the ACP countries must be preserved."
"This sovereignty should be encouraged by investment in trade infrastructure, and, of course, by means of support for national strategies to combat poverty, which is fully in line with the principle of subsidiarity so prized in the EU."
"If governments exercise their sovereignty by deciding to view the economic partnership agreements with scepticism, then there have to be alternatives such as those offered by the Cotonou Agreement."
"That is why I wonder why the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wishes to delete that reference."
"Why does the PPE-DE Group suddenly no longer feel bound by agreements?"
"The PPE-DE Group is also seeking to delete virtually every sentence from the report that gives the ACP governments negotiating sovereignty and their own political room for manoeuvre as to whether liberalisation should be implemented in a given sector, to what extent and in what time frame."
"Why, I would like to know?"
"The Morgantini report calls for basic provision with drinking water, education and other key public services to be excluded from liberalisation from the outset."
"The PPE-DE Group wishes this to be deleted, and instead calls for the liberalisation of the water sector to be based on affordable prices."
"I regard that as pure cynicism."
"Given the widespread poverty in many parts of the ACP countries, that is simply not acceptable."
"I urge you to reject these amendments tomorrow."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Morgantini, the rapporteur, for the excellent job she has done."
"In a society that is now dominated by a globalised economic market, the Community institutions have a duty to encourage development cooperation, in a world in which three billion human beings live on less than two dollars a day and over a billion survive on one dollar."
"For this shared aim, we must search for suitable means which can lead both to an improvement in the economic situation of developing countries and to gradual and increasing integration into the world market."
"The European Union’s cooperation policies must contain priorities designed to change the internal processes in those countries, promoting a stable, open and democratic political climate as well as an increase in prosperityWithin this context it can be said that the economic partnership agreements represent a suitable tool to boost and implement trade relations between the ACP and the European Union."
"We should also emphasise another point: development investment in the so-called ‘sensitive’ sectors such as education, health and energy should be constantly monitored, and where necessary restrictions should be imposed on economic liberalisation."
"We ought always to remember that in order to be successful and have a positive impact on the social fabric of developing countries, effective integration and economic growth must necessarily be accompanied by an improvement in people’s general living conditions."
"On this issue a precise, specific and consistent commitment is needed."
"Mr President, first of all I wish to thank my colleague, Mrs Martens, for her excellent speech and the amendments that she has proposed."
"This approach strengthens the report before us and supports its objectives to make Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) a workable means of implementing the EU’s targets for development cooperation."
"WTO rules force us into separate Economic Partnership Agreements, because the trade relationship based on the Lomé Conventions and Cotonou Agreement is non-reciprocal and therefore inconsistent with the WTO’s enabling clause."
"Under this clause, industrial countries are permitted to give unilateral and non-reciprocal preferential treatment to just two categories of countries: either all Least Developed Countries or all developing countries."
"Since the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) regions include countries from both groups, the original preferences granted to the ACP countries are incompatible with current WTO rules, and our transition period giving entitlement to waivers expires in 2008."
"In order to make the EU-ACP trade relationship WTO-compliant in the long term, a solution has been sought in the EPAs."
"Under the proposed EPAs, the trade relationship between the EU and the different ACP regional groups will be reciprocal."
"Under Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), countries at different levels of development can enter into a reciprocal free trade agreement provided that the liberalisation of essentially all trade occurs within a reasonable length of time."
"In the context of the EPAs, this has come to be understood as roughly 90% of trade within 10-12 years."
"It is clear that implementing a reciprocal free trade agreement will be a major challenge for the ACP countries, whose level of development varies a good deal."
"Reciprocity represents a major shift in the EU’s approach to development and trade policies with ACP partners."
"On the other hand, we know that the support allowed by Lomé and Cotonou did not halt the decline in ACP market share."
"Since we are worried about premature liberalisation, we need to ask whether in this context there is such a thing as timely liberalisation."
"Sometimes bold steps have to be taken, which means we must at the same time make sure that the eventual outcome of negotiations on agreements leaves sufficient time for ACP domestic and regional markets to adapt."
"I myself also think that it is important to allow everyone unobstructed access to nature’s own ‘free’ services."
"Therefore, on World Water Day, I feel it is necessary to mention how essential it is, for example, that water resources are managed fairly."
"The opening up of markets in some cases has also led to the spread of poverty in developing countries, and for that reason the progress of talks should be monitored carefully."
"The negotiations must be impartial, and no pressure should be put on any party while they are taking place."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank my fellow Member, Mrs Morgantini, for the excellent report that she has submitted to us today concerning the impact of Economic Partnership Agreements on development."
"The general philosophy of this text is right."
"It advocates the necessity for Community solidarity in the face of regulation that carries the risk of uncontrolled liberalisation."
"This work was welcomed unanimously within the Committee on Development."
"It is my wish and hope that it will receive the same support in tomorrow’s vote."
"One essential principle must guide our thinking: development in accordance with, and closely linked to, the Cotonou Agreement."
"It is a prime objective in all the negotiations and within the framework of the implementation of EPAs with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries."
"I understand the need to bring trade relations between the European Union and the ACP countries into line with the WTO rules;"
"I am talking about unilateral preferential access between Community markets."
"Nonetheless, compatibility with the WTO rules must not take precedence over our international commitments to promoting sustainable development and eradicating poverty."
"I share the fears of our ACP partners and of many NGOs with regard to the way in which negotiations are now conducted by the Commission and with regard to the logic underlying these negotiations."
"There is, indeed, a glaring asymmetry between the two parties."
"If we do not attend to this, the swift and harmonious reciprocal opening of markets that is being sold to us will be fatally unbalanced and, I fear, will lead only to disillusionment."
"This liberalisation of trade between unequal partners, far from promoting development as intended, runs the risk of having devastating effects on the fragile economies of the countries concerned and on their vulnerable populations."
"And this at the very moment when, in our speeches, we are claiming to want to help these countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals which, as we already know, are out of reach."
"I believe that if these agreements are conceived gradually and in a concerted manner, within a rational and predictable framework, in order to promote trade and investment in this area, they will represent a real opportunity for the ACP countries, an opportunity both in terms of economic diversification and harmonious regional integration and in terms of real and successful integration within the world economy."
"A few priorities must be stated."
"The first of these is the exclusion of the Singapore issues and of essential public services, without neglecting the principle of the right of these countries to use safeguards to defend their sensitive strategic sectors."
"The second priority is to respect our commitment to seek out alternative trade systems to EPAs for those countries that request it, as is stipulated in Article 37.6 of the Cotonou Agreement."
"These alternatives must be based on the principle of non-reciprocity established in the generalised system of preferences (GSP) as well as on the introduction of a clause establishing special, differentiated treatment at the WTO."
"These priorities depend very much on the willingness of the European Union to give its full weight within the WTO to facilitating improvement in the rules in terms of development priorities."
"Finally, stating a wish is no use without the means to achieve it."
"I should like to conclude by saying that, beyond the concern about the European Union’s financial perspectives, we must, on the one hand, keep the promises made by the President of the Commission at Gleneagles concerning aid for trade."
"On the other hand, we must envisage new financial commitments to compensate for the cost, to the ACP countries, of the removal of preferences and customs tariffs, strengthen technical support to ACP countries and, finally, ladies and gentlemen, reject the unacceptable reduction in the European Development Fund."
"Since, however, I am not convinced that these aims will be achieved quickly, I suggest that, where the reciprocal opening of markets is concerned, the Commission consider, as a token of its goodwill, prolonging the period of transition according to the specific needs of the ACP countries, as defined at the time of the negotiations."
"Mr President, I hope that Economic Partnership Agreements will be a workable means of eliminating poverty, and that they will allow us to go from making declarations to something concrete."
"I warmly welcomed the speeches on this subject this evening, and that of Eija-Riitta Korhola in particular was excellent."
"In terms of quality, I cannot add anything, but nevertheless I would like to say a few words about Luisa Morgantini’s report."
"The importance of development cooperation must not be underestimated."
"As welfare societies and European communities, we want to help fellow human beings who are worse off than ourselves, both in our own countries and elsewhere."
"In a way, this is a measure of how civilised we are."
"It is true that today, in many Member States of the European Union, there is some debate about what proportion of financing should be channelled into development cooperation."
"For example, in Finland, where I come from, this issue has just been discussed, and I know that the 0.7% target recommended by the UN has not been achieved: we have kept at around the 0.4% mark."
"It is also to be hoped that the other European countries, Finland included, will make progress in this matter."
"Hopefully, we in the European Union will establish a common will, as well as the funding, to attend to the needs of our brothers and of nations worse off than us."
"In my opinion, however, we should ensure that the aid we give is in harmony with the principles of sustainable development."
"Economic, social and environmental factors must always be taken into account in EU development cooperation."
"It is not merely money that is important, but, above all, partnership, aiding development and helping countries to get off to a good start."
"We must also be careful to promote European values such as democracy and human rights through development cooperation."
"It is important to take these into account in development cooperation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Morgantini report is an important attempt to restrict the damage caused by the EPAs."
"Do you really believe that a free trade agreement is what is needed to reduce and eliminate hunger and poverty?"
"Consider Burundi: the theoretical abolition of tariffs, as envisaged by the EPAs, would result in a gain for the European Union of a trade share equal to USD 12.4 million, which Burundi would lose, and that is after having calculated the gain to local consumers."
"This fact emerges from a study by the Economic Commission for Africa, a UN organisation, which also showed how that continent already has a rather high proportion of wealth owned by foreign residents, higher than any other region in the world: 39%."
"The idea that a further expansion of free-market ideas can produce wealth in these areas is also refuted by the data on subsidies."
"In Nigeria the cheapest meat is German and English and in Senegal 52 000 tonnes of onions exported in 2005 alone from the Netherlands placed farmers in very serious difficulties."
"The EPAs were originally conceived within the framework of the Cotonou agreement, which enshrines the fight against poverty and the struggle for social development, but they have instead become something which promotes not social development but rather greater poverty."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I agree with some of the points that have been made."
"As regards the apparent lack of information coming from the Commission, the Commission is, of course, willing to provide all the information it has available."
"Perhaps you feel that there is too little information."
"I shall see to it, for my own part in any case, that I give you all the information that I have."
"With regard to the need to have large sums of money available, if extra money is needed, the Member States will have to provide it."
"You know very well the amounts available from the European Development Fund: I have only the money that is allocated to me."
"With regard to Mrs Kinnock’s speech, I should like there to be no misunderstanding."
"When I spoke about an ‘academic’ debate on the alternatives, this was not intended to be impertinent."
"In fact, it is possible to make alternative proposals to those who do not wish to negotiate, but, as matters stand at present, they are, as you well know, Mrs Kinnock, all negotiating."
"The word was perhaps ill chosen, but starting a debate on the alternatives when they are all already negotiating does not seem very useful to me."
"I should like to say to you that I am fairly broadly in agreement with the other comments you have made."
"Thus, I agree with your comments concerning access to the market, but you have to admit too that access to the market is not everything."
"Our experience of 50 years of liberalisation clearly shows that it is not enough and that there is a whole list of other factors to consider."
"You will find none more convinced than I of the fact that we must focus on the benefits of development."
"I am, therefore, completely in agreement with this principle."
"Regarding production problems, it is clear that production is one of the areas in which we can most usefully provide support to the countries in question."
"It is at this level that one can provide the necessary funding for technical or technological upgrading, for technology transfer, for product quality, in short to finance the added value so necessary for access to the market."
"I agree with you in recognising that the European Union must not impose diktats."
"That would not correspond at all either with my convictions or with the idea I have of development."
"There is a negotiation and, in a negotiation, each partner puts forward his arguments."
"There is no diktat in that."
"I am also in agreement with Mrs Martens when she says that the timescale must be realistic."
"I completely agree that it is necessary to safeguard access to water, to energy and to a whole range of essential goods."
"I share your views on this matter completely and I am extremely doubtful about the idea of liberalising these sectors."
"Mrs Kinnock, on the question of the dismissal of the secretary that I am said to have called for, firstly, I do not have the power to dismiss the secretary concerned and, secondly, I have not called for anyone to be dismissed."
"What is true – because I am anxious to take full responsibility for what I have done – is that, in answer to an appeal from the secretary of CAEMC, the Central African Economic and Monetary Community, I simply said that I did not agree with granting a request for extra money for someone who has done nothing, and I can vouch for the fact that he has done nothing."
"I am, moreover, not the only person to complain about the fact."
"To justify himself, he said that he had no right of injunction in relation to Member States."
"The work that should have been done was not done."
"We do not receive the documents in proof that we ask for."
"There is a problem about transparency in his management."
"In these circumstances, I feel that it is part of my job to point out some of the basic principles of governance, especially when we are concerned with a request concerning funding from the Commission."
"I acknowledge, therefore, what I did, but I never called for the dismissal of anybody and, in any case, I do not have the power to do so."
"To sum up, I shall say that the package, in the negotiation, must be comprehensive and coherent."
"Peter Mandelson negotiates the EPAs, and I have a supporting role."
"We work in tandem, therefore."
"My starting point is, of course, development and, more specifically, economic development as the driving force for growth."
"I would point out, moreover, that countries have agendas for the fight against poverty, which include this aspect."
"The regions covered by economic integration agendas are asking us to support them, which we are doing."
"This integration involves an aspect of commercial liberalisation between them; we support this, and the EPAs support this demand for regional integration."
"I can see that some of your fears are justified, but I can assure you, as far as I am concerned at least, that the development aspect will be a priority."
"It is on this aspect that the negotiations will focus, and the support measures will have to make possible, according to the pace that these countries are capable of maintaining, an upgrading that should give them, in the long run, much easier access not only to regional integrated markets but also to the world market."
"In conclusion, I understand all your misgivings and anxieties."
"I am prepared – and I think that this is really very important – to have an exchange of views with you, including about all the supporting measures."
"I am looking for all the creativity of which you are capable and I am completely open on these questions, without any preconceptions."
"In any case, I assure you that I am more than ready to continue to look for the best possible solutions for supporting developing countries within the context of the EPAs."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"The next item is the report by Jo Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on European political parties (2005/2224(INI)) (A6-0042/2006)."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the regulation on the financing of the European political parties that we adopted in 2004, has been a resounding success."
"The separation between Parliament and its political groups on the one hand and the political parties on the other has been a success."
"This was something that the Court of Auditors had been demanding for many years, a demand that this regulation responded to."
"In the meantime, 10 party families have registered; they also receive support from the relevant budget line."
"This demonstrates that political culture at European level is still diverse and thriving."
"To have 10 party families is quite an achievement – before there were only four, so their number has more than doubled."
"Our experience with the financing of the political parties has been good."
"Nevertheless, there is a short wish list enumerated in the new report, wishes for planning certainty and wishes for flexibility in the way the European parties function."
"There is also the desire that the Committee on Budgets and the Bureau should, at the beginning of the parliamentary term, create planning certainty for that entire parliamentary term."
"This does not make the annual budget that we adopt superfluous, but I believe that it would be advisable to ensure that this budget line is preserved and can develop in line with enlargement or an increase in the number of political parties."
"The parties do have their own resources: donations and membership subscriptions."
"It cannot of course be the intention of the EU funding regulations that these own resources should be forfeited if they are not spent within the same year."
"That is why I am grateful that in Strasbourg we have already complied with one requirement found in the report, that is to say that the parties should be able to use up to 25% of their own resources to build up reserves."
"It is after all their own money and the EU funding regulations should not place disproportionate restrictions on the parties."
"Another wish, however, is that it should also be possible to carry forward up to 25% of contributions into the first quarter of the following year."
"Politics is an unpredictable business and in the case of unforeseeable events it must be possible to spend a certain amount in the next quarter, so that the parties do not have to embark on an end-of-year spending spree in December."
"The report also includes some other proposals."
"I would, however, now like to move on to the second stage that we are introducing with this report."
"We need a genuine European party statute."
"It is not acceptable for the European parties to have to register themselves in accordance with and be governed by the law prevailing in a Member State."
"All the parties are in favour of identical rights and obligations applying in all the Member States, and that is only possible if there is a single statute."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs is willing to lead the way here."
"Madam Vice-President, I would be delighted if the Commission took our proposal on board and used its right of initiative to bring forward a new legislative proposal."
"The second idea that we should give expression to is the importance of cross-border political communication."
"In many countries political foundations exist for that purpose."
"We believe that political foundations should also be created at European level."
"In this area too we are calling on the Commission to bring forward either a legislative proposal or a budgetary proposal."
"We should consider whether in future European elections there should not also be European lists, so that our citizens would virtually have two votes: one for the national or regional list and one for a common European list for the parties, because only with a list of that kind would a common electoral campaign be possible."
"At present we have 25 different election campaigns during the European elections, and European lists would bring them together."
"In conclusion, I would like to mention the youth wings of the parties."
"Our young people represent our future."
"We need to pay special attention to promoting political youth organisations and movements, which represent the future of the parties, and the parties are part of the democratic process."
"The report take us a significant step further forward."
"I would like to thank the secretaries-general of the parties and also Parliament's administration for their effective management of resources. I would also like to thank the secretaries-general for the excellent proposals which have been incorporated into this report."
". Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Leinen for this important report, which provides a good opportunity to both look back at what has been accomplished in the area of European political parties and what could be done in the future."
"It was only three years ago, in 2003, that the regulation governing the political parties at European level was adopted by this House and the Council, on the basis of a proposal put forward by the Commission."
"The institutions were thus translating into practice the objective set by the Treaty of Amsterdam and the new legal basis offered by the Treaty of Nice."
"As the European Community Treaty acknowledges, political parties at European level are an important factor for integration within the Union."
"They contribute to forming a European awareness, to expressing the political will of the citizens and to promoting political debate at European level."
"It is a fact that since the entry into force of the regulation, ten European political parties at European level have been established."
"We could take this as an indication that the European public sphere is being gradually built, where citizens can expect their voices to be increasingly heard by the institutions."
"I have great sympathy for this, as it is also one of the thoughts in our White Paper on communication."
"We need a European political culture and we need help to promote that."
"However, there is still a long way to go to connect the European project and the European institutions to the citizens."
"Again, this is one of the key issues that the Commission addresses in the White Paper on European communication policy."
"I am convinced that not only governments and parliaments, but also political parties and public bodies have to place the issue of Europe at the forefront of public consciousness."
"We should also reflect on the low turnout for European elections and jointly look into ways of increasing voter participation, as the Commission has already proposed in Plan D. It is not always easy to see exactly how we could play that role, but I think the institutions would have a common interest in ensuring that there is also a high voter turnout and high participation in the discussion on these elections."
"Mr Leinen’s report emphasises that political parties have to work for citizens’ involvement, not only through European elections but in all other aspects of European political life."
"We fully share this view."
"There are a number of important issues that are raised in paragraph 12 of the report."
"They concern the role of the European Foundation."
"As Mr Leinen mentioned, this concerns the role that European parties can play in European referenda and the enhancement of youth organisations."
"The Commission would welcome a broad and in-depth discussion of these issues."
"They are all part of our gradual move towards the real European public sphere."
"Again, we have a great deal of sympathy for these proposals."
"Political parties are an essential part of the democratic structure of the Union and it is therefore appropriate that they receive some support from the Community budget."
"We take note of the suggestions advanced in the report as regards injecting more flexibility into the public funding system."
"Many of the ideas outlined in the report could be made concrete by an adjustment of the internal rules supplied by Parliament."
"As regards other suggestions, which would imply amendments of the regulation covering European political parties or of the Financial Regulation, we have to look at those in a broader context."
"You will notice the careful language that I am using on this point."
"As you know, we are currently revising the Financial Regulation and its implementing rules."
"We should assess the situation in the light of this exercise, as, again, one has to balance the need to look at other financing, or at NGOs for example, with a view to finding the best tools to improve the current situation."
"Finally, we take note with interest of the idea underlined in paragraph 4 of the report, namely that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs should consider the question of a European statute for European political parties, which could go further than the existing regulation."
"Among the ideas that the committee should consider is the possibility of better defining rights and obligations for the European parties."
"The Commission will certainly follow with interest and attention the work which will be carried out by the parliamentary committee in this area."
"I would like to express here my personal commitment to this important reflection."
"I repeat that this is fully in line with our ideas in the White Paper."
"This has to do with creating a European political public sphere where we can have debate and where the political parties will play a very important role."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I represent my honourable colleague Mr López-Istúriz White, who drafted the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, and I shall make a few comments on that opinion on his behalf and on behalf of my group."
"I agree with the view of the main rapporteur, Mr Leinen, that the existing statute must certainly be regarded in principle as a total success and that it was entirely right and proper for us to make a clear distinction between party funding and the financing of parliamentary groups."
"We also owed it to the public to make that amendment."
"Political parties help to form the will of the people – in the European context, we should say ‘of the peoples’ – and that is why it is essential that the European institutions should establish the prerequisites and create the conditions for the proper functioning of these European parties."
"In this context, there are four things to which I attach particular importance."
"Firstly, it is essential to create a sustainable permanent financial framework that enables parties to obtain long-term funding."
"The grants that are currently paid to the European parties do not provide an adequate basis for truly sustainable long-term planning of activities."
"Plans are tied at the present time to calendar years within the electoral term."
"Changes in party funding can also occur if new parties are created and the volume of funding then has to be adjusted."
"I am simply saying that the existing provisions do not let parties plan ahead with a sufficient degree of financial security and that, in these circumstances, changes are eminently desirable."
"Secondly, we must allow European parties to create financial reserves that are not lost from one year to the next."
"Mr Leinen likewise addressed this subject, which also featured in our deliberations in the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"His reference to the notorious December rush hit the nail on the head."
"We want sustainable long-term planning of party funding; we do not want a situation in which, in the run-up to Christmas, so to speak, money is splashed about because of the pressure to ‘use it or lose it’."
"In this context, it is also worth considering whether the 20% limit for transfers from one budgetary item to another should be rethought with a view to making it more flexible."
"European parties must have the freedom to respond to changing requirements that might stem, for example, from a crisis in the political arena by restructuring their resources more radically than the present statute permits."
"Fourthly, against this background I believe that the statute for European political parties should be amended to enable the European parties to act more effectively for the benefit of the entire population and to perform their role as driving forces in the process of political decision-making."
"At the same time, however, I cannot deny that the parties could do more by their own efforts to achieve this aim of bringing Europe closer to the people and involving its citizens in what is happening here in Europe."
"I personally do not believe that a European list of candidates, parallel to the national lists, would be a means of solving this problem."
"Party lists are an abstract concept, and seats are allocated to particular parties, and many people cannot identify with that."
"What we need is a far more personalised European electoral process, and there is a very simple way of doing that: if at least the two mass parties in Europe could each decide to campaign in the European elections with a chosen leader who would subsequently be their candidate for election as President of the Commission, the elections would become strongly personalised within a fairly short time, and people would identify far more closely with individual candidates and with political statements of intent, which alone could probably lead to a considerable increase in turnout at European elections."
"I hope that the political parties will have the courage to take this step."
". Mr President, I, too, rejoice in the way in which this report makes it possible for us to take a significant step further towards the consolidation of the European political party."
"The fact is that I do believe that, if we really do want to develop a real European parliamentary democracy, truly European political parties will play an important part in it."
"The resolution adopted several years ago in favour of funding parties quite separately from the groups strikes me as a very important step in this direction."
"It will not necessarily, however, play well with the public, who do not believe that it is necessary."
"I believe, though, that we are obliged to describe political parties as being, in a sound parliamentary democracy, an important link between the public and the decision-making process and that this is not to be had for free."
"To put it another way, we must have the courage to tell the outside world that there is a price to be paid for democracy, that there is nothing abnormal about this, and that it is better that funding should be transparent and from public sources rather than through all manner of dark channels."
"As I have already said, an important step in this area was taken a number of years ago."
"I believe that the time has come to make a few improvements, the most structurally important aspect of which will be, without a doubt, that the political parties can plan ahead over greater periods of time instead of having to work with one-year budgets and without any certainty as to what is going to happen the year after that."
"There are also two significant technical amendments, which have to do with the flexibility of managing the budget."
"I now want, in a sense, to misuse this platform to point out that the problem of the carrying-over to a subsequent year of anything on the credit side accumulated in a given year is not one faced by political parties alone."
"This rule appears to have crept into the set of rules generally imposed by the Commission."
"I have the same problem to contend with as chairman of the management council of the College of Europe, which is also required to spend money in a given year, or else a problem results and the upshot is poor management."
"It is better that there should be more flexibility in this respect, just as we are here proposing for political parties."
"I would like to bring to the Commissioner’s attention the fact that this problem does not exist only in political parties."
"This appears to be a general rule that the Commission applies even though it is an obstacle to good management and has been thought up by accountants, whose thinking I do not follow very well."
"I also want to stress, by way of conclusion, that we can now, together with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, do a considerable amount of important work towards a proper statute for political parties, which will include – disadvantageous though it may be to the state coffers of my own country – a fiscal statute that ties in better with the fiscal statute for the European institutions, so that it is made perfectly clear that the political parties are part of that specific management level and that they are integral parts of Europe’s institutional framework."
". Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor in what seems, at this stage in the evening, more like an open meeting of the Constitutional Affairs Committee, with some other Members very welcome to join us."
"My group supports the report that has been put forward by our rapporteur, the Chairman of the Constitutional Affairs Committee."
"As we have heard, it concerns adjustments to the system that we adopted over a year ago now."
"These adjustments are necessary because of the teething problems that we have discovered in operating the system."
"They are sensible and pragmatic and I would urge the Commission – for that parts of the report which are addressed to the Commission, such as those pertaining to the Financial Regulation – to take them up."
"Political parties are not NGOs, they are fulfilling a different role and they are vital for the functioning of our democratic system."
"What we have set up and what we are hoping to improve is a system where we have – and the public can see that we have – a clear, transparent and fair system for funding the European level of work of political parties."
"This is something that recent events have shown is not always the case at national level."
"We should be proud that we are putting in place a sound structure at European level to finance the work of European political parties."
"It is important that we do so, because what political parties offer is choice to the voter, different visions, different programmes, different ideas, different proposals."
"It is that choice which gives life to political debate at European level."
"It does one more thing: it shows that the choices we face at European level are really choices of policy, not choices between national viewpoints and national visions."
"All too often, the press, in focusing on European Council meetings, gives the impression of some gladiatorial combat between national interests."
"But the real choices we face are policy choices."
"Do you want higher environmental standards but at a greater cost or not?"
"Do you want our markets to be a totally liberal free-for-all or to be regulated with protection for vulnerable people?"
"These are all political decisions, political choices that are highlighted by political parties; they are often hidden away in the Council."
"That is essential for our Union to work effectively."
"We already have ten parties registering."
"That shows that this system is working."
"There were some who claimed that this would only be financing the big parties."
"Well, some would say that ten parties is a very wide range of parties being financed."
"There were those who are not here tonight – including Mr Hannan from the PPE-DE Group – who said that this was going to finance only pro-European parties, as if there were a rule that we could bias the funding towards a particular political viewpoint."
"This of course is not the case."
"What we have seen and achieved and what we hope to improve is a sound system, one that is necessary and one that will enhance the quality of democratic debate at European level."
". Mr President, at this stage of European development – which some would describe as a ‘lack of European development’ – the significance of this report cannot be over-emphasised."
"The fact is that it is not just about political parties, and I think that is the good thing about it and about what the rapporteur is trying to do."
"He could indeed have said that, yes, there are ten political parties: he could have a look at how they work and what we do with them."
"But no: he opted for a much broader philosophical approach, and I think he was right to do so, for it has everything to do with the European political area that the Commissioner himself highlighted."
"After all, what is it that we constantly hear, not only during election campaigns but also in the interim?"
"We hear people asking, ‘What is this European parliament thing for, when there is no European political area?’"
"They are right: there is not one."
"There is no such thing as European public opinion."
"It does not exist; it is not even possible."
"Nor will it be if people do their utmost to ensure that no such European political area ever comes into being, of the kind that we need if there is to be European political debate without regard to frontiers."
"Let us take a look at the situation as it stands now."
"There are twenty-five commissioners, chosen primarily on the basis of their nationality."
"The Council is, of course, composed on the basis of nationalities."
"Not even this Parliament is elected through a European election, but through 25 national ones, which approximately coincide in time, but are not precisely one."
"You will not, of course, end up with a European political area that way."
"It is that European political area that we will indeed be in need of if we are ever to see an elected President of the Commission, whether he is to be elected by this House or, as I would prefer, by the European electorate."
"It is that that will usher in a cross-border, European political debate."
"Or, if there is to be a European referendum, then let there be, instead of 25 national referenda, one single European referendum, for example on whether to have a new constitution or stick with the old one."
"What I am in favour of is, in one way or another, giving European elections a European element, at least to some extent."
"Then you will have a European political debate, for which a European political area which be needed – as, too, will political parties, if you want a representative democracy, which we do, because we want politicians such as ourselves to be monitored, and the only way they will be is if you have strong political parties, certainly stronger than they are at present."
"They will then have to be well run, and that means that their specific financial needs will have to be met."
"I am glad that this report gives consideration to this, for example by creating the flexibility to carry over funds from one year to the next."
"At the European level, political parties operate to a five-year cycle, rather than from one year to the next."
"It is of course worthy of note that other NGOs are now very tightly regulated, in ways that some of them find highly inconvenient, and perhaps we ought to take a look at them too."
"With that in mind, Mr Dehaene put it very well when he said that there is nothing crazy about giving to others too the flexibility that we want our political parties to enjoy."
"Let me turn, finally, to the call for a single statute."
"This is something of which I am very much in favour, and on that point too, I am at one with the rapporteur."
"We need to give serious consideration to European foundations, and I would prefer to opt for party political ones;"
"I think the German system is the most civilised in the world in this regard and if we were to be able to have the same thing at European level, we would be able to count ourselves rich."
"I also – and, yes, I really am finishing now – ask you to bear in mind the amendments tabled in the name of my group by Mr Guardans, on participation by women in political parties."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Mr Leinen, ladies and gentlemen, I think that, as Parliament, we have amply contributed to creating this baby that is the European political parties."
"Now, however, perhaps we need to feed it in order to help it to grow stronger."
"The Leinen report is, in this respect, very important, as it highlights all the imperfections still present in this offspring that we are bringing to be baptised."
"A European political party is, first of all, a political party."
"Is it conceivable, ladies and gentlemen, for a party to exist without taking part in elections?"
"That is why Mr Leinen’s comment is so important: the European political parties should be able to take part as such in European elections."
"The only way that they can take part in elections is by having, one day, at last, a part of our Parliament elected transnationally."
"Only then would the parties be understood in practical terms by our citizens."
"They would also be understood by our citizens if it were possible for individuals to be members."
"I know that some parties allow it, but not all, and I think that it would be a good way of giving our citizens more involvement."
"I am a little more sceptical about the proposal from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that the statute go so far as to include provisions on the organisation of party congresses and the nomination of candidates."
"Regarding individual membership, however, I think that is something that we ought to pursue, just as we should pursue the fact that these parties have to be subject to Community law."
"It is somewhat absurd to see that these parties are sometimes non-profit making associations, although I have every respect for non-profit making organisations."
"I believe that Community law must support the emergence of these new legal bodies."
"Where the budget is concerned, the proposed distribution over three months at the end of the year is also very important."
"I believe that some political parties have already found themselves in a tight corner in December with money unused, and it was up to whoever had the best idea to spend this money in a rush, to make a few pens, a few tee-shirts; in short, things that were not at all in the immediate interest of the political party in question."
"Hence, a ruling that makes it possible to spread the surplus over several months is a rule of good stewardship that we should support."
"The last point is that the European parties are young parties, but not yet parties for young people."
"I think that we shall have to make an effort at this level to find a proper legal framework and the funding necessary to enable European political organisations for young people to join in this great debate."
"I have made a few amendments to that effect."
"Nevertheless, in general terms, this is an excellent report."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, as a member of the Party of the European Left, which was founded in May 2004, I firmly believe that, as the integration process advances, European political parties can play an important part in ensuring that our continent continues to converge and, above all, that a sense of European identity is able to develop more and more across all our countries."
"Political parties are certainly not the only players in our democracy, and they are far from being the best players, but they are a key element, and so the inclusion of a clause on the role of political parties in the ‘democratic life of the Union’ title of the Constitutional Treaty."
"Unlike the other European political parties, the Party of the European Left is a young European party."
"To a certain extent, therefore, it is still engaged in the process of its own development as a party."
"But if I reflect on the heated debates of recent times, and particularly the debate on the crucial issue of the Services Directive, I must conclude that it has demonstrated its readiness and ability to act and has established a profile of its own."
"Paragraph 12 of the report calls on all political parties to discuss specific ways in which they can play a more active role in public debates on the future of the European Union, and that is something I wholeheartedly endorse."
"The current pause for reflection on the European constitution must not degenerate into a break from reflection."
"I personally believe it is high time to venture into new territory, for example in the domain of European elections."
"It is several years now since Parliament proposed amendments to electoral legislation, and why indeed should the people of Europe not have the long-overdue opportunity to choose between various European lists of candidates put forward by European parties at the next elections?"
"If I may return to Mr Lehne’s remarks, I do not regard that as an ‘abstract concept’ but as a new political departure."
"There is nothing, of course, to prevent anyone from combining European lists with more personalised campaigning."
"Allow me finally to thank Mr Leinen for his report."
"His proposals on financial arrangements are balanced, and the Party of the European Left supports them."
"More financial security for long-term planning and more flexible administration of allocated resources will make it easier for every party to go on developing its political activities."
"Mr President, I have voted against the report and, together with 22 other Members of the last Parliament, I tried in vain to take legal proceedings against the notion of taxpayers contributing to European political parties. The parties are never anything other than artificial."
"There is nothing that can be voted on, there is nothing of which to become a member and there is nothing over which to obtain influence. The exception, curiously enough, is the EU Democrats, the new alliance for European parties and movements founded by critics of the EU."
"It is possible to log onto our home page, EUDemocrats.org and, in that way, join right off the street, free of charge, and be informed, as well as take part in the various events."
"The rules applicable to the political parties discriminate against smaller movements, smaller parties and, for example, national minorities."
"These will never be able to achieve the status of European parties and obtain funding for activities that may be identical in every respect to the activities for which the larger political parties - in many cases the smaller groups’ competitors - obtain funding from EU coffers."
"The regulation on European political parties is discriminatory and thus unlawful in the ordinary course of things. Moreover, it is something that we cannot even have tested in the EU's supreme court."
"The regulation was adopted by majority decision in the Council of Ministers by people who all have financial interests in the outcome of the vote."
"What is more, the decision-makers are themselves members of the political parties that now take money from voters who vote for their political competitors in connection with decisions from which those competitors are excluded."
"The regulation is supported by a majority of the European Parliament, the majority of whose Members also, of course, have a financial interest in discriminating against troublesome minorities."
"None of the decision-makers perceives any problem in relation to competence. Nor do the decision-makers appreciate that they are offending against EU law’s principle of equality and the ban on discrimination."
"My group wants to see the regulation abolished or at least modified so that everyone is placed on an equal footing when they, for example, carry out a cross-border activity for the purpose of disseminating information."
"Why should international conferences arranged by Social Democrats and Christian Democrats or, for that matter, EU Democrats be funded by EU taxpayers while 21 national minorities cannot obtain grants for debating perhaps exactly the same subjects at their own equivalent conferences."
"That is indefensible."
"It is clearly unlawful discrimination, and there should be equality for Loki as well as for Thor, as we say in Denmark."
"Mr President, this resolution speaks of the gulf between the public and the European institutions."
"Those who think that more Europe with Europe-wide political parties is the answer are, I believe, missing the point."
"It is the institutions, not the people, which are at fault."
"Their expressions of disdain are clear enough: witness the lamentable turnout in European elections."
"Indeed, most MEPs in this House come to this House with an embarrassingly low mandate."
"I do not see the citizens of Europe out on the streets demanding the right to vote for European political parties, but I do find them demonstrably rejecting an ever-increasingly centralised Europe such as in France and Holland last year."
"European political parties, that it is hoped might eclipse national parties, may fit the template of European integration, but the rock upon which they will perish is that of democratic rejection when they have to face the harsh reality of seeking a popular mandate from real people on real issues."
"It is one thing to play at superstatehood in this rarefied House; it is quite another to face the real issues of our electorate."
"The narrow political vision of this venture is evident from recitals A and B. It is seen as the next step towards European integration and as building a European political area."
"Clearly these parties are seen as part of the machinery of a federal Europe."
"Federalist parties for federalist politicians might make some intellectual sense, but I would welcome a fight with them any day in my constituency."
"I should also say that it is not right to try and buy success by throwing endless supplies of taxpayers’ money at European parties."
"Do not kid yourselves!"
"Our electorate does not think that much of us that it wants the privilege of paying to have us as European political parties."
"I thought that maybe Mr Corbett, drawing on the experience of his own party back in the United Kingdom, was going to suggest that we could fund this endeavour by creating an upper House and then selling the membership to the highest bidder, it would not be totally out of place with some of the things that go on in this place."
"Mr President, I am a real person who is going to talk about real issues!"
"I address this to Mr Allister and Mr Bonde."
"The difference between the last speakers and the majority of this House is that what we – the majority of this House – want is to build, we want to do things together, we want Europe to move forward, because we believe that Europe provides a good solution to the people’s problems."
"In other words, we are not entrenched in defensive positions, we are not being critical and saying that everything is discriminatory."
"No: we simply want to bring together the enthusiasm of the different parties in this House, of the different political families in this House, in order to seek solutions to the people’s problems."
"That is the fundamental difference between us, Mr President; let us not deceive ourselves."
"In this regard, the political parties play a fundamental role: political parties that, in reality, have emerged from the parliamentary groups in this House, just as they originally did in the different national States as well."
"The origin of the political parties lies in the parliamentary groups in this House."
"I believe that, if the European political parties have one problem, it is that, in reality, they are still federations, associations, of national political parties."
"That is the reality."
"It is true that we have made progress over recent years, but not enough."
"We have to do much more."
"Why?"
"Because I believe that the political parties at European level may be able to encourage the European debate and prevent any debate on European issues at national level being turned into a debate on domestic issues, which is what we see happening time and time again."
"I believe, for example, that if the European Council had heeded Parliament’s request that any referendums on the European Constitution be held on the same day, we would have been able to ensure that European issues were discussed rather than domestic issues."
"Looking towards the future, however, Mr President, I believe that, at a time when more and more of us are feeling the need for the provisions of the European Constitution, the European political parties, during this reflection phase — and I am delighted that Vice-President Wallström, who is responsible for these initiatives within the Commission, is here — have to play a very important role."
"On 8 and 9 May, we are going to hold the first Interparliamentary Forum here."
"I believe that the role of the European political parties is going to be key to uniting the synergies of the Members of the European Parliament and the members of national parliaments and to moving in the direction that the majority of us who believe that the European Constitution is necessary in order to move Europe forward want to see."
"We therefore have some great challenges here, and it is clear that these great challenges — Mr Onesta was right — at the end of the day require not just fine words, but they also need proper funding."
"I believe that this report by Mr Leinen, whom I would like expressly to congratulate, highlights the difficulties of the Regulation and the formulae we must use in order to overcome them more effectively."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, therefore, Mr President, is going to back Mr Leinen’s report and is also going to vote in favour of the amendments presented by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, by Mr Onesta on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance — which relates to young people’s associations — and by Mr Maaten and Mrs De Sarnez."
"I believe that this would demonstrate that what we want is to build, Mr President, in the face of those who merely want to destroy."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur on his report, which I support fully, and on all the work he has been doing in relation to the European political parties."
"Mr Leinen is a tireless defender of the European political parties and of their development and is also one of the fathers of the current Regulation."
"In my capacity as Deputy Secretary-General of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I fought hard together with him and some of the Members here today to have it approved."
"This Regulation cut the financial and administrative umbilical cord that joined these parties to the political groups in the European Parliament."
"Its objective was to make these parties financially and administratively transparent and achieve clear and transparent rules that would regulate their activities and funding."
"This Regulation is just a first step, however, a temporary solution until the adoption of a genuine statute for the European parties and their funding, as laid down in Article 191 of the Union Treaty."
"We would therefore call upon the Commission to present a proposal so that this statute can enter into force before the next European elections, in order to guarantee a competitive electoral process at European level."
"It is also necessary to give these parties a legal personality, on the basis of Community law, which ensures that they operate transparently and efficiently in all of the member countries."
"The role of the political parties is essential to bringing the Union closer to the citizens and to providing them with the incentive to participate politically, so that they may feel that they are participants and protagonists in a common political project and destiny."
"These parties also provide a basis for the trans-national dimension of the Union’s political process of integration."
"Furthermore, we must open up and explore ways to create European political foundations funded from the Union's budget and under this Parliament’s democratic control."
"These foundations will be an essential instrument for extending the action of the European political parties and to reinforce the link with the citizens and will play an important role in terms of information and political training."
"Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, carry on with your work and you can count on my total support."
"Mr President, I greatly support the reforms which will provide for a fair, buoyant and transparent system of public funding of political parties, something which, regrettably, does not exist in Great Britain at present."
"The growth of truly European political parties is the vital key to solving the crisis of European democracy."
"Why?"
"Because national political parties are clearly failing to respond to the challenge of European integration."
"They are failing to develop a fluent discourse about European affairs, or to act as a conduit between the European national, regional and local levels."
"I trust that European political parties, including the representatives of Mr Bonde’s party, will be galvanised during the period of reflection to contribute to a resolution of the crisis, and especially to publish European papers about those fundamental questions concerning the future of Europe."
"Mr President, despite the success of ten European parties that has been described, the democratic legitimacy of, for example, this Parliament has declined in election after election."
"The report states that there is a gulf between members of the public and the European institutions, which is true, but the solution to this problem is not financial support for European parties."
"Instead, there should, for example, be an increase in democracy through the return of power to the national parliaments."
"The report also states that an EU that is close to its citizens is a precondition for public support for the next steps towards European integration."
"In order to convince people to accept the rejected Constitution, grants must, in other words, be awarded to European parties."
"Any democratic forces may, of course, form parties, but to act on the belief that, through the award of large grants, the public would be induced to accept the draft Constitution would not only be an attempt to obtain acceptance of the Constitution in return for money, but would also be very dubious in democratic terms."
"Mr President, since the only natural place for political and democratic debate is at national level, coherent parties with a global programme have a place only within Member States."
"The democratic deficit of the European Union will only be made good through the representation of national parties having their own particular identity, parties that are accountable to the citizens who know them and understand them."
"The European political parties, virtually funded by the European Union, must be able to preserve their independence and not become yet another means of addressing European propaganda and communication to the electors."
"Thus, the European political parties must remain simply a means of cooperation between national political parties, an open forum in which each member is respected."
"On no account should they reflect, or become the means of conveying, some supposed European public opinion which does not exist and will not exist, because language differences are a fact and the European Union is a means and not an end in itself."
"Mr President, while cross-border cooperation between political parties in Europe is nothing new, even parties from the same ideological stable often represent different political cultures."
"Regardless of the planned injection of millions of euros to support them, they will never be able to agree politically on any more than the lowest common denominator, which has hitherto been confined to the content of election manifestos and electoral appeals."
"Not even European parties, to be sure, will be able to extricate us from this dilemma."
"Although it is agreed that the European Union is in crisis, its institutions have chosen once again to pump in vast sums of money – the recipients this time being the European political parties – instead of finally tackling the causes of this crisis."
"The reasons for the all-too-familiar lack of trust in the EU leaders are manifold: unrealistic promises made at the time of accession of various Member States, over-hasty eastward enlargement of the EU against the will of most of its citizens, a European constitution dictated from above, increased contributions and now the idea of European taxes."
"It is always fascinating to observe just how credulous the political establishment of the European Union actually believes its citizens to be."
"Plummeting turnout figures, ‘no’ votes in referendums and growing exasperation with the EU are not interpreted for a moment as criticism of the Union but are dismissed as sharp reminders to national governments."
"We shall not be able to change this mindset, however, through new European political parties; whether it suits us or not, the only way to build trust is through a good record of achievement."
"The EU has somehow managed not only to squander goodwill but also to sleepwalk through decisive developments or even to guide them in the wrong direction, and the public impact of these blunders can be seen not least in the form of rising unemployment figures and huge increases in euro prices."
"Even if we invest the planned annual amount of EUR 8.4 million in the party project, there is little chance that this will do anything to create a sense of European identity."
"We can only achieve that sense of identity if we give our critical citizenry the opportunity at long last to play a genuine direct part in major decisions such as enlargement and the constitution."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, while none of us has ever claimed to have all the answers, it is indeed depressing to see how the opponents of the EU who have seats in the European Parliament try to crush every measure with which we seek to advance the development of the European Union, with which we try to give our citizens a stake in this project, how they trample underfoot every little seedling we plant instead of nurturing it."
"Nobody here believes that political parties are an end in themselves."
"Every one of us believes that they are a potential means – a necessary means in a parliamentary democracy – of involving our citizens in the legislative process and adequately representing their views."
"None of us has said here that a party statute alone would make political parties adopt the right course of action."
"He who pays the piper calls the tune or, as we say in my part of the world, ‘No money, no music’."
"Music, however, is not the product of money but results from the work of an orchestra of critical, trained and qualified musicians."
"They need instruments, they need scores, they need people who choose their repertoire, and they need a conductor."
"I therefore appeal to all political parties to use this money and this party statute to create something worthwhile, to become involved and help ensure that the integration of national parties into European structures actually takes place."
"There is too little progress for my liking in the development of a European dimension to the political debate, even among the European parties."
"These are not mere adjuncts but parties with an internal as well as an external impact."
"One thing is certainly clear in our view, namely that the EU must become more political, more democratic, more transparent and closer to the people."
"Most of us contribute constructively on an everyday basis to the attainment of that goal."
"We welcome the Commission’s initiative to support information and communication throughout Europe by means of Plan D. We lament the fact that the European debate is not being stimulated and that, sad to say, particularism, populism, nationalism and self-seeking are being practised shamelessly – I need only say ‘energy policy’, ‘Financial Perspective’ and ‘European foreign policy’."
"We want to strengthen the European Parliament, to support the independence of its Members and to loosen the bonds committing them to the pursuit of purely national interests."
"We lament the lack of a European public opinion."
"Many of us advocate Europe-wide referenda and a mechanism whereby public petitions can secure a European referendum."
"We therefore see a party statute as the means whereby political parties can help to change the unhealthy situation I have described and to ensure that the opportunities created by such a change are grasped."
"A European party statute will help to make the political debate transparent, independent and European in its perspective."
"It will reinforce our efforts to give domestic policies a European dimension instead of renationalising European policies."
"Let me say in conclusion that I am fully in favour of European electoral lists to supplement national lists, because a European list will serve to encourage European parties to campaign under a high-profile European leader."
"Yes, I favour the candidature of European parties rather than national parties as the basis for the allocation of top-up seats."
"Yes, we want European political parties to step up their training activities, to promote their own political foundations and to engage in youth work."
"It is for these reasons that we are backing the report."
"Mr President, I believe that the rapporteur, Mr Leinen, has done an excellent job."
"I congratulate him."
"We must be honest with ourselves: the national parties that make up the European political parties are often the first not to believe in them."
"How often have we heard our colleagues in our countries saying, ‘Yes, the party we belong to at European level is very important, it does many very good things, but the essential thing is what happens here’?"
"We hear that everywhere."
"One simple phrase must be applied here: the function creates the body."
"When we have European laws in force ― beginning with the Constitution ― which make it obligatory for these political parties to exist, with specific roles, we will have won this battle in favour of European construction."
"For example, the European Constitution says that, when the Council makes its proposal on the election by this House of the President of the Commission, it must take account of the results of the European elections."
"And if that is the case, the European parties will have to think hard about who heads their lists and also what their programmes are; and then European lists will make full sense, rather than transnational lists – a term that we must forget – and that is the most correct definition: European lists."
"We are now naturally facing a period of reflection and debate."
"We must provide the backbone for this debate: this House and the European political parties."
"The European Convention was a success because it worked on the basis of European political families, and the interparliamentary meetings and the period of reflection will also be a success if we are able to work as political families, to understand each other and to reach agreements."
"To this end, the role of the European political parties is essential, and it will also be essential when we have European referendums and when we put an end to the spectacle of national referendums hijacked by the problems of each individual country."
"In this case, this report represents a further step, and it is good step."
"Mr President, the careers of the rapporteur, Jo Leinen, and of the political parties in Europe have followed a very similar pattern over these past decades: having started in a fairly lofty position, they are now plumbing the depths."
"Only two per cent of the population of Germany still trust political parties."
"These funding programmes, in the way they are actually being established now, surely cannot reverse this extreme loss of credibility."
"What is the cause of this erosion?"
"It is the fact that democracy has always been equated with political parties rather than people."
"In short, sovereignty in our system does not lie with the people but with political parties, whose supremacy is to be consolidated, bolstered and inflated by these prehistoric plans that you are presenting to us."
"They are doomed to failure; they will not bring Europe any further forward."
"The future truly belongs to verifiable personalised elections with candidates whose real convictions are immediately discernible: candidates, in other words, who, unlike the rapporteur, do not engage in electoral campaigning within the SPD and, once they have secured a firm place on their party’s list, abandon the electoral campaign and start canvassing support for fanciful European political parties."
"– When Parliament gave the go-ahead, in the January resolution on the period of reflection, for a second debate on the European Constitution, it became clear that Europe was in need of political parties."
"The challenge is clear for all to see."
"Europe needs to be increasingly political and should not shy away from having a strong, proactive and responsible party structure."
"The parties have a central role to play in achieving European ambitions and in improving the quality of European democracy."
"They act as a bridge between the citizens and the authorities, as a catalyst for European public opinion and as support for civil society to take action and for broader participation."
"The function of political parties is – and should be – a long way from being merely parliamentary and representative."
"The European political parties have, inexplicably, failed to become stronger in proportion to, and at the same pace as, the European Parliament."
"This is due either to sheer ignorance of the system or to a lack of self-awareness on the part of European parties."
"Yet Europe has never, throughout the course of its development, asked the parties to be dynamic."
"The parties have been accused of glaring absence from the debate on the European Constitution, for example, a debate that has hitherto been strictly institutional."
"Because Europe is waiting for its political parties to fulfil their role, a single European statute for Europe's political parties must be created to strengthen party structures, as a matter of urgency."
"A statute of this nature would strengthen democratic control, foster political competition within Parliament, and free European parties from strictly parliamentary duties, in order to bring them up to speed with the various dynamics of the European public arena."
"Furthermore, it is clear that, if the parties are to be strengthened, then what is required is a single statute, a legal personality based on European law, capacity for independent responsibility, stronger party reflection structures and adequate financing for real power to define political priorities."
"The Leinen report therefore suggests much more than an accounting reform of the life of Europe's political parties."
"It points the way forward for strategic understanding between parties, alongside recognition of their significance for structural solutions to persistent European democratic deficit."
"In order to achieve structural solutions, the political market must be speeded up, there must be stronger links between Europe’s political parties and the national parties, and European politics – and the European electoral system – must be made more attractive."
"The report also contributes towards a certain European-level party awareness, whereby we – who become organised in an attempt to take responsibility for the world – can understand that these organisations have also acquired a new scale."
"This responsibility is growing, as Europe undergoes further landmark changes, for example the Constitution and the enlargement. As such, what is needed is new political practice and a fresh look at the roles of the institutions, the citizens and the parties."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his work."
"The European political parties are essential to the formation and expression of a genuine European public opinion."
"Indeed, it is mainly to them that the difficult task of working for effective participation for citizens falls, and that is not only every five years at the time of the European elections, but daily and in every aspect of European political life."
"Mr Leinen’s report puts forward suggestions that would make it possible to give the European parties the means necessary to achieve this objective."
"I particularly welcome the following points: the improvement in the rules on funding through the introduction of greater clarity, flexibility, independence and financial security in the medium term; vital support for organisations and movements for young Europeans; finally, better representation of women on the electoral lists, and especially among the elected members."
"– Mr President, Article 191 of the Treaty establishing the European Community states that political parties at European level are an important factor for integration within the framework of the European Union."
"They help to establish a European consciousness and to express the political will of the EU’s citizens."
"This is of enormous importance today because we are engaged in far-reaching reflections on the future of Europe, which call for broad dialogue with its citizens."
"Political parties at European level should play a key role here by promoting further integration and defending the Constitutional Treaty."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has achieved much in this respect, and has a great deal of experience in the field."
"European political parties undoubtedly have an important role to play in referenda on European issues, in elections to the European Parliament and in the election of the President of the Commission."
"Furthermore, the results of European elections must be reflected in the choice of candidate for the President of the Commission."
"In order to achieve these goals, regulations governing political parties are essential at European level."
"A statute for political parties is needed to define their rights and obligations, and to allow them to become legal entities."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate Mr Leinen on his superb report and on the exceptional level of competence he has demonstrated."
"Firstly, I would like to thank Mr Leinen for his very responsibly prepared report."
"I would like to stress that support for the work of European political parties at EU institution level is particularly relevant now."
"And this is why: some political scientists, in Lithuania at least, maintain that political parties have lost their ideological foundations and are becoming similar."
"If this really were to happen, then party decisions, without an ideological base, would be unpredictable."
"This would mean that it would no longer be clear to the voter what one party or another will do once they are in power."
"And this would mean that it will no longer be important to voters which party they vote for and some will wonder whether it is worth participating in elections at all."
"This is a particularly dangerous tendency; therefore, it is essential to strengthen Europe's local parties that each would have either left or right-wing ideology, which would become a landmark for parties of the left and right in different states, in every way possible, in a financial sense too."
"I therefore propose that we endorse the report."
"– Mr President, political parties are rooted in the industrial revolution, the creation of nation states and the period following World War II."
"Globalisation, with the new challenges to civilisation it entails, and the democratisation of the EU's political system mean that European political parties must play a part in European public life."
"They must become true institutions of representative democracy, acting as intermediaries between citizens and the decision-making centres of the EU."
"To this end, a statute for European political parties is needed to set out their rights and obligations and to allow them to become legal entities on the basis of European law."
"Such a statute should function effectively in the Member States."
"We in the European Union are currently faced with a crisis of the European systems of liberal democracy."
"The constitutional crisis in the EU is accompanied by racism and intolerance, prejudice against immigrants and the erection of barriers between the nation states."
"The EU must support European political foundations, and promote and strengthen European political organisations and youth movements."
"The European Union must respond to the present crisis with a real European policy, as proposed by the Leinen report tabled before Parliament."
"Mr President, political parties are a vital element in building and reinforcing a European political sphere."
"They play an important and crucial role in promoting democratic values such as freedom, tolerance, solidarity and gender equality."
"In parallel with this, we require a dialogue with citizens on the future of Europe and, in this context, political parties must play a key role."
"Mr Leinen’s report is commendable in its support of European political parties and its recommendation to improve the current situation."
"However, Mr Leinen and our political family have been stopped by the PPE-DE Group from mentioning the vital role of European political parties in furthering the priority of gender equality."
"I should like to ask my colleagues to reconsider this, especially those in the PPE-DE Group, who voted against an amendment in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"That amendment stated that European political parties should take into account the principle of equal opportunities when filling posts in party offices and on party lists for election."
"We should not forget that women form the majority of our population."
"As President of the PSE’s women’s group, I am aware of the tremendous work that our political family does in this field throughout the European Parliament."
"Other political parties should be doing the same."
"I urge my colleagues from the PPE-DE Group to rethink their position and to uphold the values of the EU."
". Mr President, this has very much been a debate about democracy: its strengths, its shortcomings and the challenges that come from a rapidly changing reality."
"Until now, the system we have for exercising and organising democracy goes through political parties."
"That is the way we do it in Europe, at national, local and regional level, and at European level."
"It is not perfect and it requires a constant effort to mobilise people, because we know that the biggest enemy is always ignorance and total apathy."
"That goes for the European level as well."
"We can state that it is no longer enough to leave the decision-making and the democracy to a small political elite; at least, that is my analysis of the situation."
"We also have to mobilise people at European level to allow for a democratic development also at European level."
"It is through political parties that we can make people accountable, that we can create openness and transparency, and that we can have effective decision-making."
"It is still only embryonic: even if we have succeeded in creating ten European parties, we cannot say that we have succeeded totally."
"However, it has helped and it does not contradict that we also have to invest in making sure that the national parties integrate European affairs into their political agenda, discussions and decisions."
"We have to do both and we have to move on both fronts."
"In addition it is necessary to make sure that there is European media that can cover what goes on."
"This also requires some efforts and promotion from our side, to make sure that the reporting is there as well – for citizens, for democracy, to be able to follow what goes on and to take a position on that."
"I would add that it is also necessary to create meeting places, citizen-to-citizen opportunities to discuss."
"Those three building blocks are necessary to develop democracy at European level."
"It can be virtual or geographical or real, but all three elements are necessary."
"European political parties are a very important element."
"You can discuss the criteria; we have to discuss the things that have been mentioned here."
"I am very prudent in not promising what could come out of the review of the Financial Regulation now."
"I think it would be very unwise of me to promise that the Commission will come forward at such-and-such a time with a new proposal for this or that."
"It has to come in connection with and after the discussion we are having now on reviewing the Financial Regulation and the implementing rules."
"This can come as a result of that and after that."
"However, I think you have created and presented the elements and building blocks necessary to discuss what to do with European political parties."
"As many have pointed out, however, there is a link to other organisations as well, and we have to take that into account so that it can be a balanced proposal one day."
"It is wise to also have a vision as to when this could be ready, but I cannot make a promise on that on behalf of the Commission today."
"This is a very important debate."
"I welcome the amendments underlining the importance of promoting equality between men and women, and I would point out – as I see Mrs Gurmai there – I think this is absolutely evident."
"Had Mr Allister still been here I would have asked him who he would vote for."
"Would he vote for somebody and be willing to pay for somebody who says ‘I enter this room or this institution with ambitions and hopes and dreams and I promise to do my best and work for a future for the European Union’?"
"Or would you vote for someone who says ‘I do not believe in this institution, I do not think it should exist, I think it deals with nonsense issues and I am not going to pay too much attention to what goes on here’?"
"Who would you be willing to pay for as a normal taxpayer?"
"I think it speaks for itself, but in the end this is really also a matter of the choice that you have to give to people, as Mr Corbett and others have pointed out."
"It is a choice to give to the European citizens and that is, in the end a matter of democracy."
"Mr President, may I apologise to Commissioner Wallström for those Members who deliver their speeches but are not present for the debate."
"That is certainly not the custom in this House."
"I wish to apologise on behalf of my fellow Members."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"The next item is the report by Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on European contract law and the revision of the acquis: the way forward (2005/2022(INI)) (A6-0055/2006)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin with a somewhat heretical remark."
"The important reports are discussed in this House shortly before midnight, and the esoteric drivel in the form of resolutions is discussed during the day at prime transmission time."
"If we are to talk about the question of parliamentary reform – and there is, of course, a proposal to this effect from the President of the House – I would say that, before we deliberate seriously on the curtailment of Members’ rights, we should talk about giving the plenary agenda a more logical structure in which important subjects are given their rightful place."
"This report is about European civil law."
"In simple terms, its aim is to have the Commission try to shape broad areas of European civil law by creating a common frame of reference in a particular field of activity in the first instance in such a way that it will affect the legislation of the Member States and of the European Union in the field of civil law for many generations to come."
"There is even something of a debate on whether the work we are considering here could ultimately lead to a uniform European code of civil law."
"Although I say that with all due caution, what we have here is nevertheless a truly significant and decisive project."
"This House has, for many years, been monitoring the efforts of the European Commission with regard to a code of European civil law and has expressed its approval and lent its support in numerous resolutions since 1989."
"That is also our intention in this proposal for a resolution."
"We have come to a very critical stage."
"At the present time, work is under way on the frame of reference and on the revision of the established body of Community law and practice in the realm of consumer protection."
"The reason why this stage is critical is that the present efforts will determine whether this work is ultimately crowned with success or whether it falls short of the desired outcome, and this depends very much on the quality of the substance that emerges from these present efforts."
"Parliament therefore takes the view that, although what the Commission has launched is right in principle, it requires improvement in several respects."
"For example, we have the impression that the cooperation between the research groups that drafting the common frame of reference on contract law and the practitioners on the network side is not functioning properly."
"We want to ensure that the practical experience brought into this project by the network specialists is considered by the research groups in an appropriate framework. This is something for which we in the Committee on Legal Affairs are pressing vigorously."
"Another important point is that a distinction must be made between business-to-business and business-to-consumer transactions."
"We want to protect consumers, but traders must also have broad scope to conclude contracts with each other, and this scope must not be restricted by excessive red tape."
"There is also a need to ensure that what is currently being developed within this frame of reference and will subsequently form a very considerable body of soft law, at least at the European level, and have an impact on all legislation in the field of civil law is not simply created without any involvement on the part of the legislative institutions, namely Parliament and the Council."
"It is not enough for Parliament and the Council to deliver their opinions on the drafting procedure; they must also be involved in the development of the substance of this frame of reference, because it will be they who adopt laws enshrining elements of the frame of reference and who must publicly justify the adoption of those laws."
"Against this background it is important that Parliament is also involved on the substantive side."
"From our perspective, this should involve two processes."
"Firstly, the Commission should keep Parliament constantly and comprehensively informed of progress in the formulation of the frame of reference and the improvement of the body of Community law and practice relating to consumer protection, and we should have the opportunity to pronounce ourselves at any time within a continuous process."
"The second process, for which we have already taken the first organisational steps in this House, is the establishment of a project group comprising the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs of both participating committees, a working party whose purpose would be to keep a close eye on the work of the Commission, the research groups and the network as well as providing political guidance on particular issues of legal policy, such as the issue of the demarcation line between business-to-business and business-to-consumer transactions."
"From our point of view, these are crucial matters which still require regulation and in which greater parliamentary involvement is both welcome and necessary."
"These are the key elements of the resolution on the table."
"Let me finish by saying that I believe this is the most significant project being undertaken by the European Commission and the other institutions in the course of the present legislative term."
"It is the most significant by far, which is why I would certainly expect us to try and bring it to a successful conclusion. It will also play an important part in determining whether the single European market continues to converge for the benefit of everyone – consumers and traders alike."
". Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Mr Lehne for his report."
"The Commission wholeheartedly welcomes Parliament’s interest in the common frame of reference – CFR – on contract law and in the review of the consumer ."
"The Commission is happy to see that Parliament shares very similar views regarding the need to deliver a high level of consumer protection in the revision of the consumer ."
"Parliament considers that the development of the CFR is unpredictable and that the ultimate long-term outcome might be a European code of obligations, or even a full-blown European civil code."
"I would stress that the Commission, and Commissioner Kyprianou personally, has clearly and repeatedly stated that it has no intention of producing a European civil code."
"The Commission’s view is that the CFR will be a better law-making toolbox for achieving coherence when revising existing legislation and adopting new instruments in the area of contract law, particularly consumer contract law, on which the currency of our work has been refocused."
"The legal form of this instrument, and if and to what extent it could be binding, has yet to be decided."
"If the Commission considers that this toolbox will be of more than internal use for the Commission, such a decision would clearly be a political decision and would need to be taken by the Commission, Parliament and the Council."
"The Commission understands fully that Parliament wants to be kept informed of and involved in the ongoing work on the CFR."
"We therefore welcome Parliament’s involvement in the CFR process, in particular the creation of the working party."
"The Commission will continue to keep Parliament informed of developments in the most appropriate way."
"Commissioner Kyprianou will discuss regularly with Parliament’s relevant committees the progress of CFR work and, in particular the intermediate politically relevant steps."
"I would like to conclude by thanking Parliament for its encouragement and support for our work on this important dossier."
". Mr President, I welcome very much Mr Leinen’s report, so much so that my own political group will vote against any amendments to it."
"Despite all this agreement and it being so late in the evening, we are all of the opinion that it is essential to have a debate on this important report."
"In the opinion for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, we highlighted the fact that this is an exercise in better law-making."
"The CFR and the review of the can make a huge contribution to the better functioning of the internal market."
"However – and this was our central preoccupation – the compilation of the CFR is a political exercise: it involves political choices."
"Therefore, the European Parliament must be fully involved as a co-legislator."
"We all welcome the setting-up of the project group, which augurs well for good future cooperation with the Commission."
"However, we still have a concern that the Commission should present a coherent approach."
"That means that not only DG Sanco, but also DG Justice and DG Internal Market should be fully involved in the process."
"Above all, this project is of practical importance for the internal market, both consumers and businesses alike."
"In my own country – which is not known for its support of anything that might even start to resemble a European contract code – an independent survey by a big law firm highlighted the transactional costs of an incoherent contract law in the internal market."
"I believe this demonstrates what many of us have always felt: practical advances in EU civil law like this can assist to make Europe more popular we get it right."
"However, in order to do that we must have discussion and debate."
"This is not just a technical legal exercise, it is a political one."
"If we ever get to the stage of a European contract code, then we cannot risk that it suffers the same fate as the proposed Constitution last year."
"It has to have political support, and I hope that we, together, have put in place the appropriate mechanism to ensure that we achieve that result."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the Commissioner said just now, in September 2005 the Commission submitted a first annual report on the state of progress of European contractual law and the review of the Community ."
"One of the measures envisaged, as the rapporteur pointed out, is the creation of a common frame of reference for Community contractual law."
"The Commission believes that the scope of the common frame of reference can include the possibility for national legislatures to use it even in sectors not governed by Community law."
"The in force, which mainly relates to consumer protection, should be improved and a set of common principles should be added to it representing a certain but flexible reference point for citizens and legal practitioners."
"Mr Lehne, the rapporteur, who performed valuable and important work in committee, and who this evening has given us his comments on a provision of historical importance, has tried in his report to delineate a strategic perspective for future activity by the Commission, naturally involving the European Parliament, and strongly calling for its involvement."
"I would like to say, in order to underline the work that the rapporteur has done, as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, that a major process of harmonisation and in fact of codification has been begun for sectors of European contractual law."
"This is an historic event, even over and above the results that may be obtained, because until now Community harmonisation had been done with a scope either more restricted or more extensive than the relevant directives: the consumer contract, to which the directives on the application of electronic and computer technologies were added."
"From now on, the tasks are no longer restricted to the coordination of the law in force, but will be projected into the future, towards uniform definitions of terms set out in the directives, the identification of common principles relating to contracts which will be able to reduce the marked differences."
"This is a process of regulation and knowledge which will be able to go beyond the law in force in order to form a modern code: there was even an idea that we might achieve a uniform code of contractual law, formulated through principles."
"We would start by examining directives that contradict the implementing provisions of the Member States and would define a sort of common base of Community contractual law."
"I will finish by saying that the process of convergence of private law and in particular European contract law is a reality, driven both by Community law and by the development of comparative analysis studies."
"I support the primary role of civil law: civil law and contractual law are there to strengthen European citizenship and economic and civil exchanges in Europe."
". Mr President, I believe that this is the right time of day to be discussing this issue, because in reality it is an issue that requires reflection; we have very little to play with."
"This is not a red-hot debate on something that is going to be done now: it is something that the Commission is beginning to do and that we in this Parliament are supporting."
"Those of us who are here are probably amongst the few who believe in this objective or in this possibility, but I do not believe that a unified market, a European Union internal market, is possible without a contract law."
"When I talk about contract law, that is precisely what I mean: law."
"I am concerned about the Commissioner’s statements to the effect that we do not know what kind of legal instrument we are going to have."
"There is no soft law in the European Union; the European Union’s great advantage is that it has developed a solid law, a positive law, which is applied by courts of justice, and we need precision."
"The most important thing in law is legal precision: precision with regard to the nature of the obligations and precision with regard to the content."
"I therefore believe that it is important that we begin to think about defined legal instruments of an obligatory nature that are not merely recommendations."
"Self-regulation, co-regulation or soft law will not be able to resolve the legal problems in this area."
"In this regard, the Commission’s report does not just refer to the possibilities of a contract law, but also to a revision of the acquis in the field of consumer protection."
"I believe that we must bear in mind that nobody can take the view at this point that, with regard to contracts, the consumer can be treated in the same way as a company."
"Relations between consumers and companies are of a different legal nature and the current legislations must recognise it."
"That is the intention of the amendments by Mrs Berger and Mrs Patrie: to maintain a degree of protection for consumers."
"In any event, I would like to thank Mr Lehne and Mrs Wallis for the work they have done and also to thank the Commission for persisting in this direction, because I believe that the future of the European Union will have to be shaped by means of a private law, as Mr Gargani has said, and, in particular, in the most immediate future, by means of an obligatory law in the field of contracts and not by means of mere recommendations."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Belarus – the political situation after the elections."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to be present here for this important debate today, because Parliament, in particular, needs to send out a strong signal regarding the depth of the concern the EU feels about the situation and developments in Belarus."
"Of course, the Council has been devoting attention to Belarus not just since last Sunday, when the elections were held, but for a long time now."
"For some time, the Council has viewed with concern the situation in Belarus, in terms of human rights and their suppression, of the opposition, and of civil society."
"Indeed, that is why the Council took a large number of measures in the run-up to the elections, including, in particular, issuing a very clear reaction to the announcement by the Belarusian Government and President of their intention to take harsh measures against any demonstrators."
"The word ‘terrorists’ was even used, alongside talk of the death penalty, and the Council spoke out very clearly."
"The conduct of the elections themselves unfortunately confirmed the negative expectations we had had as a result of past events, namely the curbing of the opposition and the suppression of freedom of expression, and meant that these were not free elections: this was confirmed, in particular, by the OSCE/ODIHR election observation mission, which said that the elections were not fair or free, nor did they meet OSCE standards."
"The Presidency immediately took a stance on the events in Belarus, and issued a statement on the subject as early as Monday, 20 March, at the General Affairs Council."
"The Council discussed the matter and expressed its opinion very clearly along the same lines as the OSCE/ODIHR statement subsequently issued that afternoon."
"What is important now, of course, is the consequence of these events – how the EU should react."
"The Council believed that it was important first and foremost to react quickly and send out a signal."
"Once again, I am delighted at the speed with which Parliament, too, has set to work on this situation, to send out a political signal."
"In the days and weeks to come, the Council will carefully consider what specific measures can and should be taken to express our discontent with this situation, and also to influence future developments in the country."
"In my opinion, this is why the situation is so difficult and why measures have to be considered carefully, because we do not want any steps we take to affect the people, or civil society."
"On the contrary, we must now seek to strengthen free society, or free civil society."
"We must look for ways to cooperate, ways to encourage the courageous people who are assembling, who are holding out there, and we must consider our further course of action."
"That is why the Council decided on Monday to join with the Commission for detailed deliberations on the form these measures could take."
"It is very important that the present and future measures taken by the EU also have the support of the EU’s partners."
"A total of 40 countries endorsed the statement issued by the Presidency yesterday afternoon: that sends out a strong signal."
"This statement was endorsed by the candidate countries, and also the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process – Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro – the EFTA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, and also Ukraine and Moldova."
"It is important to arrive at a broad consensus so that we can send out a clear signal on this."
"We shall also have to engage in dialogue with Russia, of course – herein lies another key to the events."
"We must make it clear that Russia, too, has to endorse the common values of the European Union, that the four areas we are always talking of in connection with the partnership with Russia presuppose that Russia, too, adheres to the rules of democracy."
"Naturally, we shall also express this in our contact with Russia."
"By way of conclusion, I should like to assure you that the Council takes this situation very seriously, that we are concerned about Belarus, which is the last country in Europe where human rights are not respected, and where there is no freedom of assembly or expression."
"We shall continue our active endeavours to improve this situation."
"As the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs commented after the elections ‘It will not always be winter in Minsk’."
"Madam President, you must forgive my infringing the basic rules."
"I merely wish to take the liberty of protesting against our having this debate."
"At best, it can be characterised as a complete waste of time."
"Suddenly to agree at a few hours’ or minutes’ notice to debate a very important subject is clearly in breach of the Rules of Procedure."
"It is an important subject, but what we are now seeing is unusual complacency in a democratic context, reflected in reactions to the election in Belarus and to the oppression that has taken place."
"This is not a subject that can be debated at short notice."
"To do so is in breach of the Rules of Procedure, and I insist that we stop debating this subject and move on to the proper agenda."
"Many thanks, Mr Krarup."
"The request to amend the agenda was announced yesterday; I assume that this was discussed in the groups."
"I announced the amendment of the agenda this morning, together with details of who had proposed the amendment, which groups were involved and the number of signatures received."
"No protests were forthcoming from the House."
"I am sure that the honourable Member will raise the matter in his group."
". Madam President, the recent elections in Belarus and the events on Sunday in the capital, Minsk, have clearly confirmed that President Lukashenko is determined to maintain his rule through whatever means."
"This is no surprise as it is a repressive regime which shows no tolerance for political competition."
"The bad news is that the President and the regime still enjoy some support among a significant proportion of the population."
"The peaceful demonstrations, however, have given evidence of the consolidation of pluralistic forces in the country; this is a positive development."
"The initial report from the OSCE and the Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights concludes that the elections of 19 March clearly fail to meet OSCE criteria for democratic elections as a result of the disregard for the basic rights of freedom of assembly, association and expression; and owing to the arbitrary use of state power and widespread detentions, and problems with early vote-counting and tabulation processes."
"In the light of these serious problems, the Commission considers that the presidential elections in Belarus were fundamentally flawed."
"This raises serious doubts as to whether the results of the elections truly reflect the will of the people of Belarus."
"The Commission also deplores the non-admittance of the announced and registered OSCE and EU observers, including Members of the European Parliament."
"We deplore the instigation of criminal cases against opposition members and the arrests of opposition activists and peaceful demonstrators."
"We urge the Belarusian authorities to release them immediately."
"The Commission is now considering the issue of sanctions."
"It is important that we precisely target sanction measures against those individuals who are responsible for the fraudulent elections."
"We have to avoid hitting the population and we should make this clearly understood."
"The Commission will be fully involved in preparing such measures."
"Looking now to the future, we must continue our efforts to support democratisation and civil society."
"We are finalising a proposal for our assistance strategy for 2007 onwards."
"In line with the Council conclusions, we will continue supporting democratisation through our different ways and means."
"We will also continue to support the needs of the population by targeting social and economic developments in Belarusian society."
"This can be done through our future European Neighbourhood Policy instruments."
"This type of support will allow us to combine contacts with middle-ranking officials to reduce the self-isolation of Belarus; cooperation with NGOs; and support directly benefiting the population, for example in the health sector, the environment or in the Chernobyl-affected area."
"The current TV and radio programmes being broadcast to Belarus and supported by the European Community are an important contribution to democratisation and to the visibility of the European Union in Belarus."
"It is important that we get across to the Belarusian population both the considerable financial effort made by the EU and the potential benefits of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"Through our assistance we will be keen to foster people-to-people contacts and we will seek maximum flexibility within the limits of our financial rules."
". Madam President, today’s debate is important."
"The decision to include this item on the agenda reflects very positively on the European Parliament."
"The speech made by the Commissioner today also reflects well on the European Commission."
"It seems that, for the first time in a long while, Parliament and the Commission are speaking the same language."
"This is a very good sign."
"The Belarusians are expecting an expression of political solidarity from us."
"This is something for which Aleksander Milinkevich appealed when he made an appearance before Parliament a few months ago."
"He met Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and Mr Solana and was acknowledged as a democratic partner by the political leaders of the European Union."
"Political solidarity is not just about making political declarations but also involves the need to revise the policies of our Union."
"This far-reaching revision process should aim to isolate the authorities in power without isolating Belarusian society."
"It should aim to support Belarusian society without supporting the authorities."
"This House has long called for the actions taken by the Union to be intelligent and to introduce only those sanctions which will affect the regime’s officials, those responsible for the infringement of civil rights and democratic freedoms."
"We call for the list of those who are banned from entering the EU to be significantly extended."
"As the European Parliament delegation to Belarus, we have submitted the relevant document to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and Mr Solana."
"It is also very important to open the gates of the European Union to those Belarusians who cannot find a place in their own country, and it is vital to include the youth of Belarus who are currently excluded from universities for taking part in peace demonstrations in a special grant programme in the EU Member States."
"We owe this to our Belarusian partners."
". Madam President, if we look back to last Sunday, I think it is quite clear that the only fitting response to the elections that day in Belarus is one of emphatic condemnation."
"Those elections were not free, they were not fair and the situation was, if anything, worse than it was during the presidential elections four years ago."
"I think it is also right and proper that the European Union should spell this out quite clearly and let our public know that we do not accept that a dictatorship should continue its grip on that country through elections of that kind."
"That, of course, begs the question what we should do next."
"I share Mr Klich’s view that we need to look into how we can go on extending what we call smart sanctions."
"We believe it makes no sense to develop sanctions that affect the people of that country; the most important thing we should do for them is to see if we can help raise awareness or make more room for pluralism in that country."
"I think that the Council and Commission need to make it clear how that regime, after these elections, is to be characterised, and that we should use the same harsh words to describe it as the US."
"At least, there is then no doubt as to what we think of it."
"I think that we should also look into the option of extending the role of the High Representative."
"Why not, indeed, appoint a special EU representative for Belarus?"
"As Mr Winkler said a moment ago, one core issue is, of course, the relationship with Russia."
"It is all well and good to have 40 signatures under an EU declaration – very good indeed – but one signature is missing."
"That signature is at the bottom of a telegram which Mr Putin sent Mr Lukashenko as early as Sunday, I believe, to congratulate him once again on the fantastic outcome, in which Mr Putin expresses the hope that he, together with Mr Lukashenko, can work on both countries’ further democratic development."
"That is the situation we are facing."
"I hope that these issues will be raised at the G8 summit, but also maybe, and mainly, in the framework of the regular consultation between the European Union and Russia."
"I think it is of crucial importance for the EU to join forces with neighbouring countries such as Ukraine, but also with the United States, in order to further develop policy with a view to bringing about change in the country in question."
"I also think that a more visible policy on our part would pay off at the moment."
"There has been so much media attention in all our countries about these elections that we should make use of the momentum it has created."
"Finally, we will be holding a more extensive debate on this issue in Strasbourg in two weeks’ time, where we may be able to discuss in greater detail the action that the European Union could take, and so I would like to ask the Council one thing, and that is to present a sound programme and sound proposals to support the opposition and civil society in that country."
"I think that is really important: to look for more ways of giving the opposition the support that it needs and deserves, and it is probably the only way of securing change in that country."
"I take Mr Winkler’s view: winter cannot last forever in Minsk."
". Madam President, the Council and Commission have indicated their intention to enter into consultation about those sanctions and measures, and rightly so."
"I am quite frankly astonished that a plan of attack has not been prepared beforehand."
"After all, Belarus’ present plight does not come as a surprise to anyone."
"Many examples of possible sanctions and measures have already been put forward, and I give my wholehearted support to such schemes as extending the visa ban for government representatives, flexible policy with low-cost visa for ordinary Belarusian citizens, freezing foreign assets, a better harmonisation of the European financial programmes to fit in with Belarus’ specific situation, and the list goes on."
"Something that still, I think, remains underexposed, is Russia’s role in this whole affair, to which Mr Wiersma referred briefly just now."
"What is even more important is the role which the EU can, and indeed should, play in this connection."
"Just to remind you, Mr Putin congratulated Mr Lukashenko on his victory without as much as batting an eyelid."
"By doing so, he simply showed his disdain for the interim OSCE conclusions, and it is he who continues to oil the wheels of Belarus’ economy with cheap supplies of raw materials."
"Is it not about time the Council and Commission entered into constructive dialogue with Putin?"
"The President-in-Office of the Council said a moment ago that he takes it as read that a number of issues will be thrashed out in contacts with Russia."
"This may be a noble attempt, but not quite good enough yet."
"Surely it cannot be considered acceptable that Putin should continue his policy straight-faced and congratulate Lukashenko, while human rights are still blatantly being violated."
"Or are we at risk, by adopting a stance that is totally clear, of creating a conflict with different priorities, such as securing the European energy supplies?"
"It would be worth a lot to me if our own interests did not hijack the ideals on which the EU is based."
". – Madam President, the matter of primary importance as far as I am concerned is that the message is clear, that is, the message from all the European institutions that these elections were a farce."
"There is no credible proof of Mr Lukashenko’s claim to have won the election."
"He has held on to power by means of fraud."
"That is the truth of the matter."
"The people are being taken in less and less by this deception; otherwise, tens of thousands of them would not have assembled in October Square on the evening of Sunday’s elections in spite of threats by President Lukashenko and the secret services."
"These people in October Square are our great hope in Belarus, and so I should like to extend a very special greeting to them from this House, as they are our future partners."
"For this reason, our top priority is to recognise these people as partners, support their democratic activities and ensure that, if they are arrested, a visa ban is imposed on those who arrest them."
"After all, these people are doing nothing more than exercising their democratic right to freedom of expression and manifesting their desire to live in a democracy."
"I should also like to raise the subject of Russia once more."
"It is imperative to put the issue of how to proceed as regards Belarus on the agenda of the forthcoming G8 Summit as a special item."
"Anyone who continues to blindly support Belarus and President Lukashenko cannot be a serious partner for the EU."
"Belarus is standing in the way of a good relationship between Russia and the EU, which means that this has to be discussed."
"I expect the Presidency to report to us on how these talks have gone."
"This is the only way to take a step forward and to support those holding out in October Square."
". Madam President, there is something amazingly optimistic in the fact that today, in this House, representatives of diverse political groups are all speaking with the same voice."
"It is a good example of what European solidarity is all about and it shows that all those present here, or at least the overwhelming majority, award the same importance to basic standards in relation to human rights and civil rights, which are currently being so brutally abused in Belarus."
"I would like to add my voice to those here today who have so strongly emphasised that President Lukashenko’s regime and all events currently occurring in Belarus would be impossible if the dictator himself did not feel that he had the support of influential patrons and powerful friends in the Kremlin."
"We have to realise that the key to solving the situation in Belarus is not to be found only in Belarus itself, but also lies in persuading the Russian authorities that we, as citizens of the European Union, regard the situation just beyond the Eastern border of the European Union as not acceptable under any circumstances."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to mention an issue which has so far not come up in this debate as we have, of course, been discussing the crimes related to the elections which took place a few days ago in Belarus."
"However, we should remember that there is an aspect of continuity to the problem of human rights abuses in Belarus and that the problem is not only related to the electoral process."
"I would like to call for more action on the part of the European Union, not only in the field of human rights in the sense of electoral rights, but also in the promotion of freedom of information and of the media in Belarus."
"This is because President Lukashenko’s regime also remains in power due to the fact that it simply deceives the citizens."
"Madam President, Belarus unexpectedly woke up to statehood in 1991."
"It has had a terrible history, suffering particularly badly from the fallout from Chernobyl."
"Indeed, I was one of the authors of an amendment in the last Parliament to increase the funding to help the children who are still suffering the consequences of the radioactivity to date."
"Belarus is now saddled with a paranoid, self-isolating dictator, Mr Lukashenko."
"I described the country as the ‘Cuba of Europe’."
"Mr Lukashenko has no time for fair and free elections."
"He goes through the charade only."
"He believes in the Stalinist saying that it does not matter how the voting is conducted, but who controls the count."
"Bizarrely, Mr Lukashenko may even have had sufficient popular support – 55 to 60% – to have won the vote in a free election."
"However, that was not enough for a man like him: he wanted a much larger margin of a majority as a dictator, because he would fear that, if he were to become more unpopular, next time round there would be no comfort zone in which to retreat back to 55% or 60%."
"Regrettably, Russia, under Mr Putin, supplies gas to Belarus at USD 50 per thousand cubic metres and the Belarus economy is rosy enough for Mr Lukashenko to be able to buy the votes of pensioners, the military, the police and all the apparatus of the state."
"Fortunately, the young are more cynical and I salute the courage of all those who have taken to the streets in protest and faced the brutality and the wrath of the militia and the KGB under Mr Lukashenko."
"At the end of the day, Mr Lukashenko should be considered a pariah in the West and travel bans and financial assets must be tightened up on all the members of the regime: they must be frozen."
"We must support their civil society and their NGOs and we need a very special and generously funded visitors’ programme in the European Union to bring students, journalists and members of civil society – the movers and shakers and the opinion formers – over to our Parliament to see how democracy really works in action."
"– Thank you Madam President."
"The brave people in October Square are writing their country’s history."
"They are doing this because they are breaking down the wall of fear and apathy which was reigning in Belarus."
"This is a huge slap in the face for those who do not believe in democracy."
"And they are risking everything: their job, their studies, their family, their lives."
"In spite of the threats, since last Sunday the courageous youths of October Square were able to hold a daily vigil of courage, a vigil which will go on until next Saturday at the least."
"We insist that no violence is used against these people."
"For us this will be unacceptable."
"A number of these young people have been expelled from university because they are demonstrating."
"Now we must show in practice the solidarity which we have been talking about for so long."
"If things do not improve, we have to give these young people a place to study in European universities here among us."
"The words we have been uttering for so long have to become facts."
"The signal has been given and the writing is on the wall for those who want to read it."
"Nobody is deluding himself by anything."
"However, from now on, the question will be who is going to be able to resist longer."
"We cannot come up with excuses."
"We cannot hide behind bureaucratic or diplomatic obstacles in order to come to the help of these democratic forces."
"The initiative of broadcasting to this country is a good step in the right direction, but frankly, I do not know what has become of it."
"Apart from that, we must not shirk our responsibility simply because we took this initiative."
"What is happening in Belarus is our business because it is happening at home."
"Thank you."
"I would also like to talk about the need for real action."
"We have already mentioned extending the list of people banned from entering European Union territory, but I should like to add that this list must be extended drastically and not simply by seven or eight names."
"It must be a list that includes hundreds of people and it should be made public in Belarus as well."
"The list should be signed not only by the Member States of the European Union but also by countries aspiring to European Union membership."
"The aim is to make sure that those who are currently persecuting the demonstrators will not be able to go on holiday to Turkey, Romania or Bulgaria."
"Then there is also the possibility of freezing accounts belonging to those people so that, at the very least, they could not purchase anything from us."
"I apologise for trivialising this issue a little, but I wanted to be very specific."
"There is also a third matter which is often discussed in the European Parliament and which has also featured in Parliament resolutions, namely changing the way in which Parliament acts with respect to measures taken to support civil society in Belarus and in other countries, as well as support for action in the name of democracy."
"It is somewhat embarrassing that so few resources have been used for this action."
"I am not talking about the resources earmarked for the purpose, of which there have been many, but those actually used."
"These have been few in number due to various lengthy procedures."
"This is why I would like to register a further appeal for the creation of some sort of fund similar to either the Westminster Foundation, one of the German foundations or those in the Netherlands, so that the process of transferring funds can be greatly improved."
"The final thing I would like to mention is that it would be worthwhile to consider showing the Belarusians that while Mr Lukashenko has closed off Belarus, while he does not allow educational trips or even travel for health treatment, burdening all those who travel abroad with certain border duties, the European Union could decide that for those who are eligible for an entry visa, this visa could be free of charge."
"I think this would be an excellent approach and an excellent gesture."
"We have known for years what this dictator has been doing beyond our Eastern borders."
"What we have had trouble with, however, is answering the question of what we should do about it."
"The period of political helplessness passed when this Parliament seized the initiative, particularly during the present term."
"I am certain that the House has performed a historic service in this respect."
"Today, however, we have to fight the helplessness shown by Europe and by the free world with respect to practical actions."
"In the short term, we have to extend significantly the list of people not welcome on European Union soil."
"In the medium term, we have to find effective methods of supporting civic forces, first and foremost the media."
"Breaking the information blockade is a matter of considerable significance when it comes to rebuilding faith in an alternative path for development in Belarus."
"We have to enhance our actions in this field."
"The first steps have already been taken, but they must be considered only as initial steps."
"Most importantly, in the long term Belarusians also have to feel that these steps will lead somewhere."
"We have to open the way for them to the West and offer them real European prospects."
"Without this, the Belarusians will never believe that they can break free from the grip of one dictator or another."
"Without this prospect, Lukashenko’s regime will pass but his place will be taken by someone else who will enforce Russia’s policy of rebuilding its sphere of influence in the region."
"There is no third way for this part of Europe."
"I, as a Pole, know this only too well."
"The results of the presidential elections in Belarus were anticipated."
"The outcome reflects the use of violence, fraud and mass arrest, in other words, gross violations of the basic rules that govern free and democratic elections."
"How will the situation evolve now, after the elections?"
"It looks as if one chapter in the struggle for democracy in Belarus has come to a close, but we must not remain inactive."
"People have been protesting on the streets of Minsk for five days now."
"What can we in the European Parliament and the European Union do under the circumstances?"
"Firstly, we must not accept the election results."
"This means we must reject, ignore and isolate the Belarus president from the rest of the world."
"Secondly, the European Union and the European Parliament must henceforth unambiguously support only the democratic opposition forces and citizens' associations, or civil society, as has already been suggested here."
"This support should be expressed not only in moral terms but should be specific and include financial assistance."
"Integrating Belarus opposition parties into European party structures might also be an effective step."
"The SMK [Hungarian Coalition Party] in Slovakia set a good example in signing an agreement with the Belarus National Front and the United Civic Party last year, and at the same time, the SMK is advancing this issue within the PPE-DE."
"As a result, the two parties will be given the status of PPE-DE observer members at the Congress to be held in Rome next week."
"Thirdly, the European Union, particularly the Commission, should draw up a new strategy that is clear, more effective and more consistent."
"We must not allow EU financial support to be channelled through the Lukashenko administration where we have no control over how it is used."
"The Slovak Republic is in favour of stricter and tougher procedures."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union must not leave Lukashenko alone and revert to a ‘business as usual’ policy – as the most important trading partner of Belarus, the EU has in fact been contributing in no small measure to the preservation of this regime."
"– The recent events in Belarus have made two things clear: firstly, that it is necessary to fundamentally review and concretise the European Union's strategy on Belarus as quickly as possible, and the positive sprouting of an awakening civil society should appease neither the European Union's leaders, nor the parliaments and governments of its Member States."
"The wave of repressions will not abate, but increase; therefore, the first object is to protect the forces opposed to the regime and their leaders from repression."
"Such a concrete, binding strategy should be upheld by the parliaments and governments of all European Union Member States, not just those which share borders with Belarus."
"Secondly, having isolated the regime's leadership, we must use all means possible to strengthen informational support for the Belarusian people, develop existing contacts and establish new ones with all levels of civil society: the business community, academics, people involved in the arts and culture and journalists."
"I believe that a successful, concrete example has already been shown by Lithuania, which has given refuge to what used to be the only free university in Belarus, but which was later sent into exile."
"Offering young people in Belarus such study opportunities in higher education establishments and European Union universities is without doubt the priority of a common European Union strategy like this."
"Madam President, I was a member of the European Parliament delegation which never went to Belarus."
"I took on the challenge. I was stopped at the border and witnessed the whole ridiculous scene; the absurdness of the train waiting for an hour at the Polish-Belarusian border, the people looking on in horror then crossing the border, terrified."
"Looking at the officials inspecting passports, I was reminded of the Communist era."
"It was as if I was watching a film from those times."
"I saw petty smugglers."
"The border on the River Bug is a ridiculous Berlin Wall and we are quite right in saying that the authorities should be isolated."
"However, so that we can build bridges, I would appeal for us not to isolate Belarusian society, the young people, the students, the journalists, the academics and the people working for NGOs who are already discriminated against in Belarus."
"We need bridges that will allow Belarusians to feel that they are Europeans, and to understand that they could and should take part in upholding values such as democracy and freedom."
"– Madam President, I am really very much obliged to the House for its unanimous, strong and impressive support for our endeavours and those of the Commission."
"We are all thinking along the same lines, and we must now find efficient ways of both holding the regime responsible for the situation, for the conduct of the elections, and supporting those who want to bring about change."
"We all agree on this."
"Naturally, we intend to follow many of the recommendations made here."
"Since I cannot go into detail on all the points raised, I should like to discuss those that I find particularly interesting in this context."
"Mr Klich reminded the House that Alexander Milinkevich visited Parliament;"
"I should like to point out that Mr Milinkevich has also visited the Council – at all events, 14 Foreign Ministers were present for that discussion, which was held within the framework of a Council meeting, and there, too, we made very clear the depth of our admiration for the courage of the opposition and the strength of our support."
"Several speakers here have mentioned restrictive measures, or sanctions."
"That is exactly what we need now."
"Visa restrictions are already in place, and these restrictive measures must now be extended."
"Mrs Schroedter said that a visa ban should be imposed on everyone responsible, and that is exactly what we need."
"That is also the reason why – even though, naturally, scenarios have already been considered in the past – we are only now able to take specific measures: because we now know exactly who is responsible for the situation in Belarus and which names should appear on the list of visa restrictions – although a detailed analysis is still required."
"As many speakers have said, at the same time, we must find ways of offering assistance to people who wish to travel abroad, to visit our countries, to broaden their minds, to see how democracy works."
"I am also much obliged to Commissioner Kovács for taking a specific stance on the measures planned by the Commission, as it will also be important that the Commission, with our full support, develop credible, coherent programmes."
"Smart sanctions have been mentioned."
"Indeed, that is exactly what we need, although, to be quite honest, I must say that it is often easier said than done to find exactly the kind of measures that do not hit the wrong people."
"Attention has also been drawn to the EU observers who were denied access."
"That is a most regrettable state of affairs."
"I should like to point out that the Presidency declaration on the situation in Belarus that was issued yesterday expressly deplored the non-admittance of EU observers, including Members of the European Parliament."
"That only goes to prove the depth of the fear of allowing free parliamentarians into the county."
"It is indeed our duty to support the young people, civil society, those people who are still holding out despite sub-zero temperatures, and we shall join with the Commission in seeking ways of doing so."
"Mr Kamiński mentioned the free media, which play a most important role."
"That is indeed important."
"We all know from past experience – and, as an Austrian, I am in a particularly good position to judge – the importance of the role played by independent radio and television in our neighbours Hungary and Czechoslovakia at one time. In the present day, too, we must ensure that those interested in doing so have the opportunity to receive news free from censorship and control."
"We shall endeavour to do that."
". Madam President, the European Union is certainly a community of shared values, a community of democratic countries."
"Consequently, we have to make it explicitly clear that we do not accept the repressive regime of President Lukashenko; the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms; the violation of the election campaign rights of the registered opposition candidates and the arrest of members of the opposition and peaceful demonstrators."
"Policy declarations are important, but they are certainly not enough."
"We therefore have to introduce and maintain sanctions that clearly reflect our position."
"We should avoid economic sanctions at large that would hit the population."
"Our sanctions should be precisely targeted against those responsible for the fraudulent elections and for the survival of the repressive regime in Belarus."
"Such sanctions could include, for example, the extension of the visa ban or the freezing of assets in the Member States."
"Parallel to the sanctions and the increase of support to civil society and the democratic forces in the country, we have to encourage and facilitate people-to-people contacts by, for instance, waiving visa fees on an ad hoc basis."
"We also have to support NGOs."
"We are aware of the problem that, according to our rules, support can only be granted to officially registered NGOs, but the Commission has found a solution to this."
"We now agree to fund NGOs which are registered outside Belarus, but which work for the benefit of the country and its people."
"The debate here was quite encouraging."
"It shows that Members of the European Parliament, the Presidency – i.e. the Member States – and the Commission are following the same line."
"By following the same line and working in close cooperation, we will finally promote democratic changes in Belarus."
"The debate is closed."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party, I should like to express my support for the protests against the vote rigging in the Belarusian elections, in which President Lukashenko was re-elected under questionable circumstances."
"I confirm my full support for the demonstrators in Minsk: thousands of young people have been peacefully demonstrating in the squares for days and, amid numerous difficulties, they are pressing ahead with a democratic battle to build a different and better future for their country."
"The aspirations of the new Belarus are a far cry from the aims of Europe’s last remaining tyrant, Alexander Lukashenko, who has cheated at the polls, threatened the opposition in the squares and made use of prisons just as Stalin did in his day."
"We support the Belorussian dissidents, isolated, cold, battered and humiliated as they are, in their struggle to claim back a future characterised by freedom and justice in this corner of the USSR, too."
"The hands of time must begin moving again in Minsk, as they have elsewhere."
"It is laudable that the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament are speaking with one voice on the issue of Belarus and that they are doing this so forcefully for the first time."
"The situation in Belarus is serious enough for the Council and the Commission, as well as the Members of the European Parliament, to condemn the Russian acceptance of and support for the undemocratic regime of Aleksander Lukashenko."
"We cannot be lenient with respect to Russia's position at any cost."
"We have to be honest and admit that the institutions of the European Union waited too long and reacted too slowly to events in Belarus."
"The actions taken were slow and were not effective, not only because we did not want to annoy President Putin or because of the limited scope and resources for action, but also because of what Mr Onyszkiewicz mentioned, namely the lengthy procedures and inappropriate channelling of the funds spent."
"It is the Commission's job to spend the funds earmarked for aid to Belarus appropriately and the Commission must do this job more efficiently and effectively."
"As Members of the European Parliament, we shall regularly ask the Commission to update us on how it is carrying out its work and whether the procedure for transferring and spending the aid has been improved."
"We shall also insist on the Council and the Commission taking a stronger position in future in condemning the support shown by Russia for the last undemocratic tyrant in Europe."
"The next item is the report (A6-0041/2006) by Mr Bushill-Matthews on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on demographic challenges and solidarity between the generations (2005/2147(INI))."
". Madam President, I welcome the priority given to this issue by the Commissioner."
"This priority is recognised and supported by all political groups in Parliament."
"The fact that there were over 200 amendments at the committee stage for what was and is an own-initiative report, is hopefully seen as a reflection of their priority and not entirely down to the inadequacy of the rapporteur in the first place."
"I wish to begin by thanking colleagues in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, especially the shadow rapporteurs for their important input."
"I should like to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and in particular the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality – with whom we had enhanced cooperation, both officially and in practice – for their valuable opinions and for the many ideas they have also contributed to this report."
"However, one direct consequence of all this is that the report is too long: a tribute perhaps to our collective enthusiasm."
"I hope, with the support of colleagues in the vote today, that we can make it a little shorter."
"However, the thrust of the report should remain clear: the challenges of an ageing population, with more people living much longer, with more older people who are inactive and need the support of others, and more older people who are active and need to support themselves, are not just problems for the elderly, but for society as a whole."
"The challenges of a declining birth rate, with fewer people of working age, who are mathematically unable to fund the larger number of pensioners; with many parents who want to have more children grappling with the pressures of combining work and family life, but who are mathematically unable to make ends meet. These are not just problems for young people, these too are problems for society as a whole."
"They are challenges for governments; they are challenges for businesses."
"There are no one-size-fits-all solutions, but, as they say in the X-Files: the truth is out there!"
"There are many different ideas around and different experiences to draw upon, not just in the European Union."
"A number of thoughts and pointers are in this report."
"We now need minds to open, but, above all, we need action to follow these ideas through."
"I hope the Commissioner feels that this report reflects not only his own priority but also his own personal sense of urgency, and that all will agree that the real work starts now."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Bushill-Matthews, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for their report, which is truly inspiring."
"I am delighted at the support that Parliament has expressed for our Green Paper."
"Parliament’s report has come at the right time to provide a boost to the work of the Commission in respect of the new communication on demographics, since we will be finalising this communication over the next few weeks, and the timing therefore allows us to make use of your report in a very practical way."
"The report includes a number of highly important points that merit a place in the new communication, which draws conclusions from the responses we received to our Green Paper and from impact studies financed through the pilot action which the European Parliament organised."
"It sets out the possibilities for continuing cooperation at a European level over demographic issues."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in recent times Europe has achieved some extraordinary successes."
"I would like to state this unequivocally, so that we may bear it in mind."
"The demographic ageing of our society is an outcome of this success in respect of two of the corners of the population pyramid and two locations on the pyramid."
"Average life expectancy has increased through the enormous advances in medicine, which have, for example, largely overcome cardiovascular diseases, thereby making a significant contribution to average life expectancy for middle-aged persons."
"Thanks to major medical advances in the area of child care and peri-natal care, the figures for child and infant mortality have fallen to levels never before seen in history and probably unexpected up to even a few decades ago."
"This is an unquestionable success."
"In a manner of speaking, we now enjoy twice as much life as our forbears."
"And I was delighted to discover, during the course of discussions with the insurance companies, that they are now working from mortality tables that go up not to 80, but to 120 years."
"This success has its consequences, of course, since demographic ageing alters our entire society across all areas."
"It is important to realise that a holistic response is required, an integrated and all-inclusive response."
"Demographic ageing goes beyond the issues of pension systems, health, education, urban planning and so on. In fact, I doubt whether we could find any area of human activity that is not affected by demographic ageing, including the armed forces."
"We must therefore strive to ensure that active ageing becomes a reality."
"We must develop our care services for children and the elderly."
"We must develop new products and services in order to respond better to the needs of ageing individuals, and of course the needs of a society that will be ageing overall, as its age profile alters."
"We must finally invest more in developing and retaining our human capital in such a way that we achieve high levels of employment and enable the elderly to remain active in the workforce for longer."
"In the responses to the Green Paper consultations, especially in the responses of the Member States, great emphasis was placed on the need for better harmonisation of our private, family and professional lives."
"It is already the case that migrants are reversing patterns of demographic decline in some Member States."
"In order to have a truly beneficial effect, migration must go hand in hand with greater efforts at integration and overcoming differences."
"Despite all of this, ladies and gentlemen, it remains clear that the migrants on whom we are counting as a permanent feature of our societies in the future do not represent the answer to the problems of demographic ageing."
"They are one of the components, but they should never be regarded as the solution."
"I would like to mention some of the issues that should be included in our programme of work over the coming years."
"We would like to renew our focus on harmonising family and professional life, as it is clear that European citizens want to have more children than they currently have."
"And in order for their natural longings and wishes to be fulfilled, we must in my view take a profound look at our society as a whole, our habits, our ways of doing things and the practices we employ."
"We would like to set up a European forum on population and demographics, enabling us to understand better the various aspects involved in incorporating a demographic dimension into individual policies, and supported by recognised experts in the field as well as voluntary organisations."
"In 2007 the Commission will be presenting a report on the measures taken by Member States to incorporate into their national legislation the provisions of Directive 2007/78/EC relating to age discrimination."
"Every two years, coinciding with the plenary sittings of the forum, the Commission will publish a report on population and demographics in Europe, which will describe demographic trends in Europe in the context of developments worldwide."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the added value of Europe consists largely in organising the exchange of information, comparing proven approaches and presenting and disseminating the resulting data."
"We are already doing this in many areas, especially those areas relating to the Lisbon Strategy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, demographic developments are changing our society."
"They have changed it throughout history and will continue to do so in the future."
"Our society is becoming technically older in demographic terms, but we can also say with certainty that it is becoming wiser, as wisdom is related to experience and is in all societies a characteristic of those who have enjoyed good fortune, living long enough to have the opportunity to draw on their experiences."
"In our debates I feel that we shall find ways to respond to the challenges arising from the enormous success of our society in prolonging life and raising the quality of life, and we shall do it in such a way that future generations will follow the course that we plot, a course that will involve a more profound sense of the quality of life, the human dimension and the social values that we all cherish."
". Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by giving my sincere thanks to Mr Bushill-Matthews for his excellent report."
"I would say to Commissioner Špidla that, personally, I would gladly live for 120 years."
"I need to reach 116 to break even on my pension scheme."
"I am surprised that the Green Paper on demographic change does not take greater account of health aspects."
"The problems of an ageing society are not limited to economic aspects."
"New syndromes are coming to the fore, as can already be seen: dementia – be it Alzheimer’s disease or subcortical dementia – vascular disease, from coronary heart disease to renal insufficiency, metabolic diseases – diabetes, first and foremost – arthritis of the spine and the large joints, and osteoporosis, to name but a few."
"This makes it all the more a question of prevention, of ensuring good living conditions for all before treatment and, if treatment should be necessary, of ensuring that this is as good as possible for all Europeans."
"It is a case of maintaining both quality of life and mobility."
"We need social reorientation in order to meet these challenges."
"Retirement now comprises one third of the human lifespan."
"We need meaningful employment, social tasks, fulfilling tasks for older people, barrier-free living, new forms of housing, and, if necessary, excellent nursing care and medical care."
"However, I would take issue with the implicit and unreflective assumption in the Green Paper that a decline in population would have exclusively negative consequences for the established social system."
"I should therefore like to see the following issues addressed: the extent to which the negative consequences of a population decline may be addressed by innovation, higher rates of employment and modernisation of social protection; whether there may also be positive aspects to the decline in population, for example on issues relating to the environment, traffic congestion and land development; and whether a ‘Pareto optimum’ for Europe’s population size may ultimately be established."
"– I should like to congratulate Mr Bushill-Matthews on his excellent report and on the cooperation that we established in the process of drafting our respective reports."
"In 2003, the natural growth of Europe’s population was 0.04%."
"Between 2005 and 2030 it is forecast that some 20 million people will be lost."
"By 2025, the population of the EU is expected to grow slightly, due to immigration, but then to fall again."
"Immigration is only a partial solution."
"Europeans do not have the number of children they want."
"Studies show that they would like to have 2.3 children on average, but they only have 1.5."
"This figure is too low for the population to be reinstated."
"Among the reasons for the low birth rate are: belated or unstable access to employment; difficulty of access to housing; the late age at which parents are having their first child; a lack of tax incentives and family benefits; inadequate parental leave; lack of day-care facilities for children and other dependent persons; the salary gap between men and women; and the difficulty of reconciling family and working life."
"According to demographics expert Phillip Longman, in Europe it is conservative Christians and Muslims who are having more children, and this will lead to changes in the make-up of society."
"What can be done to redress the situation?"
"Phillip Longman makes some suggestions: Sweden has succeeded in increasing its birth rates by raising social benefits and by building day-care centres and crèches."
"In Italy, it would be helpful if securing a loan to buy one’s own house were made easier, as it is currently very difficult to do so."
"One thing is certain: in most Member States there is a strong correlation between high rates of female employment and high birth rates, and vice versa."
". Mr President, in the words of Commissioner Špidla, demographic change is not only a topical issue, but also one of the biggest challenges facing Europe today."
"That is why the report from Philip Bushill-Matthews is both timely and highly relevant."
"The problem with politicians nowadays is that we only think in five-year time frames."
"It is not seen as politically expedient to deal with matters that will have a dramatic impact on our lives ten or twenty years down the line."
"Indeed, in the past few months I have been chairing a PPE-DE working group dealing with specific aspects of demographic change."
"We have come up with some fairly useful conclusions on the issue."
"First of all, in the field of demography and the family, Europe should not resign itself to a decline in its population."
"Improving the overall situation for children and for young people and enhancing the compatibility of work and family life for men and women, combined with tax incentives, could have a significant impact on birth rates."
"Secondly, it is clear that more choice and flexibility in the labour market is needed in Europe. In this respect we should enhance the participation in the workforce of women, young people and older people, by providing new opportunities through, for instance, flexibility of working hours, the promotion of part-time jobs and autonomous work."
"The education systems need to be reformed in order to increase the efficiency and pace of higher education, thus enabling an earlier entry into working life."
"Thirdly, skilled workers from third countries should be attracted, but according to our working group, we should not consider immigration as a single solution to Europe’s future demographic and labour market problems."
"Immigrants have to possess talents and skills that Europe is short of and must be prepared to integrate themselves into our societies and accept our common values."
"In order to be able to face the challenge of demographic change and sustain an ever-changing society, we need to ensure the determined implementation of the Lisbon Agenda."
"The status quo is not an option."
"To develop and thrive, Europe needs – to use one of Mr Barroso’s buzz words – ‘flexicurity’ and innovation."
"Security and flexibility of the labour market will enable us to respond to the challenges of globalisation."
"To achieve this we need to reform our pension systems and concentrate on growth and jobs by introducing innovative measures to support the birth rate and by a judicious use of immigration."
"Only through innovation, through re-inventing ourselves, can we be sure that the challenge of demographic change will become tomorrow’s opportunity for growth."
". – There is no doubt about the importance of the issue before us."
"A large proportion of Europe is getting older."
"With rare exceptions, birth rates are low."
"Various social protection, solidarity and social security mechanisms have seen their sustainability come under threat."
"Immigration from countries outside Europe has apparently made it possible to balance activity rates in some Member States, but there are social consequences in terms of social integration and family support that must be taken into account."
"The debate on demographic challenges has gained fresh urgency, with the advent of the recent Scandinavian implementation of the European Social model."
"It is very important to combine increased productivity and competitiveness benefits with strong female participation in the labour market."
"At the same time, birth rates have gone up and there is now more understanding when it comes to paternity leave and greater support for motherhood."
"Accordingly, from a European perspective, all efforts must be channelled into reconciling working life and family life in each Member State, by negotiating more flexible working hours, and by means of more appropriate and more widespread child support infrastructure."
"In addition, mutual knowledge of different social security systems must be increased and people must be given the opportunity to move freely from one national system to another, be it public, private or any other kind, for example, mutual benefit systems."
"This is very important for workers who pay social security in a particular Member State, whose lives will improve on their return to their country of origin and when they move to another Member State to work."
"Moreover, active ageing should be encouraged. This is all discussed in the reports by Mr Bushill-Matthews, Mrs Estrela and all the members of committees working with such dedication in this area."
"I should like to conclude by saying that the demographic challenges currently facing Europe are serious, but that there are ways of addressing these challenges."
"Let us therefore rise to the challenge of helping to ensure greater solidarity between the generations."
". Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very comprehensive report on this issue of major importance throughout the EU-25, namely the challenge of demographic change and the importance of solidarity between the generations."
"In essence, what the report proposes is improved quality of life for all, at all stages of life, and a recognition that policy decisions and legislation enacted should contribute to that core objective."
"Because of time constraints I will briefly make just two points."
"I am happy to see included in this report a recommendation to Member States to improve the provision of services of general interest in rural areas, thereby promoting an equitable balance between rural and urban living, in particular for older people."
"I am also asking for support on Amendment 20, which seeks to recognise the potential of assisted-living housing."
"I use as a template for this the St Brendan’s Village project in County Mayo in the west of Ireland, and the SLE Habitat Extra Care scheme in Lille in France."
"In a report produced by the European Liaison Committee for Social Housing to mark the United Nations Year of Older Persons, one of the main recommendations is that governments and service providers should help people to stay in their own communities as they get older."
"According to the report, the two projects I have just named provide good examples of projects built to meet local needs."
"They help keep older people in the communities where they have spent most of their lives, with the support of family, friends and services, and in familiar surroundings."
"That is surely solidarity between the generations."
"All of us in this House – if we are lucky enough to live long enough – will grow old."
"For some of us, that is closer than for others."
"However, personally, I would prefer to live independently in my community with the level of social and medical assistance that I need."
"The two projects I referred to are European models of best practice in this area and could be replicated throughout the EU-25."
". – Mr President, alongside climate change, demographic change is probably the greatest challenge of the present day."
"There are very many reasons why our birth rate is falling, with a consequent decline in future prospects for our society."
"I should like to select just one aspect of this extremely complex issue: pension provision for mothers."
"The work done by mothers, especially those with several children, receives far too little recognition."
"One of the main problems is that most mothers from the days when mothers could not have or did not want careers because of bringing up and caring for their children are at a clear disadvantage, first in their careers and subsequently in old age."
"In our affluent society, bringing up and caring for children should be given at least the same recognition as activities in the production and services sectors and should thus count fully towards pension entitlement."
"The simplest, most comprehensive solution would be an unconditional basic income for all."
". – The demographic changes taking place in the EU, are, on the whole, beneficial rather than detrimental to society."
"Because of improved living standards and healthcare, life expectancy has increased. This of course creates fresh challenges, which must be addressed."
"Among these challenges, which the Commission has not properly addressed in the Green Paper, are the importance of sexual and reproductive health, gender mainstreaming in all studies and policies, improving people’s living standards and greater economic and social inclusion and cohesion."
"Consequently, in the proposals tabled by our group, the accent is placed on the need for job stability, safety in the workplace and reduced working hours, in order to ensure that younger and older workers alike can gain access to suitably paid work. This will enable workers to have more time to devote to the family, to support their children and to pursue their own lifelong learning."
"The main priorities as regards managing demographic change are jobs with rights, fairer income distribution, strong public social security based on solidarity between generations, and high-quality public services, in particular in areas such as health, education, housing and social protection."
"In other words, what we are proposing is to reverse the current trend of prioritising competition and liberalism, increasingly precarious and poorly paid work, unemployment, privatisation of public services and the trampling of labour rights."
"We therefore stress the need for a sea change in these policies."
". Mr President, in 1981 in Ireland I heard a lecture by Dr Herbert Ratner, a professor of public health and medical ethics."
"In it he described the demography of continental western Europe."
"He accurately predicted the pattern we now see of birth-rate freefall by the year 2000 and the terminal decline of population by 2020, which is now inevitable."
"In this lecture Dr Ratner warned his Irish listeners to continue to choose life and, among the many benefits this brings, avoid the demographic suicide of our European neighbours."
"We chose life two years later in a referendum to protect the life of the human person from conception to natural death."
"Ireland’s birth rate is now falling, but we delayed the trend by 20 years and, although today we are just below replacement, we still have the healthiest birth rate, the youngest workforce and the strongest economy in the EU."
"As the Commission’s Green Paper on demography states, there is no economic growth without population growth."
"I can think of many good reasons for the EU to embrace the culture of life, the dignity of the human person and God."
"But, if for no other reason than economic growth and a viable future for Europe, we should rethink our attitude to the sanctity of life, to the position of the family and to support for mothers and other carers."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent work."
"For my part, the issues that I wish to highlight are the two major challenges facing us: firstly, an ageing population for whom we want to ensure the best possible, dignified old age and, secondly, a low birth rate."
"We want the right balance to be restored in our continent between the expectations of women and those of our countries."
"In order to tackle the first challenge, two policies need to be followed."
"The first is to do away with any disincentive to extend a person’s working life, and therefore to endorse all policies designed to enable elderly people to remain directly involved in the job market for as long as possible."
"The second policy is to give the elderly the opportunity to remain within their communities for as long as possible."
"All social policies should be geared towards this objective: to remain in the family environment and in the surroundings of one’s own home, with residential care used only as a last resort."
"As regards birth-rate policy, I believe that, as always in life, it helps to have concrete evidence."
"It must be pointed out that, over the last few years, it was those very countries that took an intelligent approach to drafting new tax policies that went on to obtain good results; one interesting example is France."
"New tax policies, extensive employment opportunities for women, the opportunity to enter the job market and undoubtedly a new and different quality of services are therefore needed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that demographic change represents one of the greatest challenges of the present day for all the Member States of the EU."
"However, demographic change should also be seen as an opportunity to achieve a new solidarity across the generations, which guarantees young people a good education, creates jobs for all and enables people to grow old with dignity."
"A very important step towards this would be to introduce impact on demographic change into the mainstream of all policy fields at both national and European level."
"That should also hold true for the work of the Commission."
"Furthermore, this is another field in which we should learn more from one another, and intensify the exchange of experiences not only among governments but also among the social partners."
"These make a vital contribution to the distinguishing feature of the European social model, namely social solidarity."
"That is why I welcome the call for Member States to enter into new partnerships with the social partners, and also the call for the social partners to be consulted without delay on the balance between family and working life."
"Mr President, there can be no serious discussion on demographic change if people are regarded as economic factors rather than individuals; yet, in my opinion, both the Commission Green Paper and the present report by Mr Bushill-Matthews make that very error."
"I also feel that the discussion should consider demographic change as a global issue."
"It is evident that neither the Millennium Development Goals nor the fight against world poverty feature even remotely in our debate on demographic change."
"After all, the main problem is not that the European population is declining, but that, firstly, this is disproportional from region to region; secondly, coexistence in society is at risk; and, thirdly, we are not relating demographic change in Europe to the exploding world population."
"We are looking at the ageing of European society almost exclusively from the point of view of the dwindling workforce and, in the process, completely disregarding the development of productivity."
"At the same time, we are exploiting productivity as a means to cut social, sickness, health and pension benefits and to consider prolonging working life greatly."
"I am referring here only to the study prepared and published by the Commission, which envisages 71 years."
"I call for a change in priorities."
"We need a child-friendly society, which actually welcomes living with children."
"We need a different kind of debate, as we cannot just see children as an investment to safeguard labour and pension provision."
"Furthermore, we cannot continue simply seeking a better reconciliation of working life and family life, of working time and leisure time."
"We need to concern ourselves with something more: with the children, for it is they who are important here."
"Children must really be central, and must be regarded as individuals."
"Naturally, society also needs to meet the challenges of ageing, for example by means of expanding social services or, of course, by means of urban development: for example, old people’s housing, and transport designed with children and the elderly in mind."
"This issue is much more multifaceted than we think."
"Mr President, you do not need to be an economist or political scientist to figure out that the trend to want to cash in on things and the disappearance of green in our society brings with it a large number of consequences."
"Politicians such as ourselves know – but most of the public do not – that globalisation and demographic change cause a great number of problems."
"The Bushill-Matthews report tries to offer hope, and for that I offer him warm thanks."
"What we should do, though, is not just to look at what the Commission says."
"Whilst we must ensure that the birth rate goes up, it is not up to us politicians, but parents, to ensure children get born."
"What politicians have to do is to create a child-friendly society, a society in which children are not a burden, but an additional benefit."
"That also means that we must ensure that people can look after children properly."
"That has implications for flexibility on the labour market, flexibility all through life and flexibility in working hours."
"That is where we politicians come in again."
"If we want to create a good and fair society in which both young and old people can function, which is what we need, we must also ensure that legislation is child-friendly at European, but certain also national, level."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, rapporteur. Mr Bushill-Matthews has prepared a much-needed report."
"If we continue to occupy ourselves merely with everyday politics, Europe will be hit by a demographic and social catastrophe on the scale of the Asian tsunami."
"The sustainability of the European way of life is under threat."
"The younger generation works long days for a pittance, causing physical and mental weariness."
"What is presented as their free choice is actually forced upon them by the ‘winner takes all’ society."
"Wage slavery or unemployment, climbing the career ladder or having the door slammed in your face – these are the choices faced by our highly qualified young people."
"When, in spite of the law, a person works 12 hours a day and more, neither flexible working hours nor longer opening hours in the sales and services sector can help."
"There is simply no time for private life or having children."
"From the macroeconomic point of view, this arises from the need to finance the older generation’s anticipated pensions and medical treatment, which is becoming increasingly expensive."
"This report should just be a starting point."
"Maintaining the high standard of living in Europe requires politicians to do a lot of extra work, and to act quickly."
"Thank you for your attention."
"–Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Bushill-Matthews, who is known for his attention to detail and heightened sensitivity and who has patiently prepared this report, has quite rightly highlighted possible solutions to the demographic problem, starting with the means of decisively addressing low economic growth and high rates of unemployment."
"A varied approach is advocated, depending on the circumstances, which – as is rightly emphasised – must respect freedom of choice and facilitate the exercise of the fundamental human right of European families to have as many children as they wish, without the obstacles raised by the difficulty of combining a professional and family life."
"Identifying these obstacles and those which exist both inside and outside the workplace (such as taxation, housing and the cost of education, health and insurance) is the responsibility of the Member States, given that the Member States alone shape both development and family policy."
"Historically, of course, immigration has often resolved the problem of renewing the population and today it fills the gap created by our choice to have no children or just one child at an advanced age."
"What has brought us to these life choices in times of peace and opulence?"
"Seeking the causes of demographic change is not the concern either of the European Commission or of the governments."
"It does not fall within the competences of the European Union; it falls within the competence of each European citizen who wants to go beyond his human capabilities, both in planning the beginning of life and in imposing its end."
"Certainly education, training and finding work in an environment of sustainable development are necessary preconditions to a high standard of living."
"However, if there is to be no demographic problem, if new Europeans are to be born and grow old under dignified conditions, future parents need of their own accord to have a demand for reliability in their personal relations and, in general, a vision of life for the present and the future."
"– As a Member of the European Parliament elected in Lithuania, I find the demographic problem particularly relevant. Namely because the number of inhabitants in Lithuania is constantly declining, not so much as a result of emigration, but rather as a result of rapid birth rate reduction, which has already led to the closure of a number of schools."
"The steps taken by the Lithuanian Government to solve this problem are clearly insufficient and so the appearance of documents at European level is welcomed."
"But the birth rate reduction is not just a problem for Lithuania, but for the whole of Europe, and while statistically our families have less than 1.5 children each, in Asian countries, including the European Union candidate Turkey, children are born like mushrooms after the rain."
"What this could mean in the not too distant future is a theme worth contemplating."
"We can and must overcome this demographic crisis through real actions and programmes."
"These should make it worthwhile for every family to have at least three children."
"This is the precise spirit of the document presented, and once it is adopted, practical solutions should follow."
"– (Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Mr Bushill-Matthews for his outstanding report."
"In order to face up to the impact of demographic shock, it is usual to resort to three levers: a carefully chosen and regulated immigration policy, mobilisation of the workforce and policies aimed at families and at increasing the birth rate."
"This latter kind of approach is usually left to the Member States."
"It would be wrong, nonetheless, for the European Union to deny itself these resources."
"Their effectiveness is well known, and the French example testifies to that: tax incentives for families, parental leave, financial assistance and, above all, the provision of child-care – out of school child care, a range of facilities for the care of very young children and care for children with disabilities."
"What is more, it is important to remember that it will not be possible to massively recruit women into the labour market without proper provision for the care of their children."
"Europe does not lack the means, provided that it has the political will and the financial resources."
"It is therefore essential for the policy regulations for territorial cohesion to underline more strongly the need for funding for child care facilities."
"At a time when the debate is raging over the nature of the European social model, children and families, with all their diversity, must be fundamental to this model."
". Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for a debate which has shown that demography is one of the most important issues facing Europe today, and which has shed light on the issue in many ways."
"I feel that we have had clear confirmation of the basic view that this is a matter of fundamental change, requiring a holistic or mainstream approach, as has been stated."
"At the same time, consideration has been given to various aspects of the wider problem."
"For example, it was stated that the Green Paper does not pay equal attention to two sets of problems, which is to say the problems in respect of the health sector and the problems in an international context."
"You may have noted from my report that the international context is to be covered in the regular reports, since from this standpoint a specific preliminary response already exists."
"The question of health is one of the most fundamental of all and I feel that the debate has inspired us to develop our thinking in this area further in the future."
"This problem raises not only technical and organisational issues, but also a whole raft of ethical issues, since an ageing population will increasingly create situations where people are living in extreme circumstances through a combination of fate and their personal state of health."
"This means that an appropriate ethical response will be very difficult to find, requiring a great deal of profound reflection."
"I think it was also clear that one issue on which attention was focused, in my view justifiably, was the question of children and the very low birth rate and how we might change or at least influence this."
"It also emerged clearly from the debate that that this was a general European question, since despite the fact that Ireland, for example, has at present the highest number of live childbirths per woman of childbearing age, it has also recorded a decline over the past 20 years sharper than just about any other country, and the current level is not sufficient to maintain demographic stability."
"There are, of course, other states which are in a far worse position and where the situation might become extremely difficult within a few generations."
"It is also clear that we must give very serious consideration to the fact that not every society is people friendly."
"There is an old Roman saying ‘Inter arma silent Musae’, in other words when society is under any kind of stress or in an extreme situation, creativity suffers."
"In my view, having children is a matter of profound need and profound desire."
"Educating children and caring for them is also, in its way, an activity that requires very high levels of creativity, and it is clear that European citizens, if they are to decide in favour of having children, need greater security in a world that is undergoing enormous change."
"The debate also touched on questions of gender balance, in my view justifiably."
"Allow me to mention one single item of information taken from a Spanish study: ‘in Spain men devote 52 million hours a year to taking care of dependent persons, that is to say children or elderly family members."
"So the burden, which is a common one, falls very unequally, with women taking a fourfold share."
"I think that these too are questions that we must examine."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the discussion and for a very concise report which shows that there is a striking tendency towards convergence in our approaches within the context of social and political thinking on Europe."
"In my opinion this gives hope for a coordinated position capable of overcoming the frequently troublesome changes following elections, as five years is a very short time for many issues."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11 a.m."
"Demographic challenges and solidarity between generations represent a complex issue having an extensive impact on our European societies."
"These two are comprehensive challenges which Member States have the responsibility to address in a long-lasting, future-oriented way."
"The solution should be a comprehensive, global, consistent and fair strategy encouraging understanding and lasting solidarity between the growing number of generations living side by side."
"Policy solutions to the demographic challenge, like ageing, gender, labour market, pensions, migration, should give rise to a new and coherent vision of a European society."
"Although there are considerable differences in the local circumstances of Member States, the challenges and targets are similar – to tackle the increasing challenge of Europe’s ageing society, bearing in mind the Lisbon targets of making Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, with greater social cohesion and sustainable economic growth capacity, and more and better jobs."
"Coping with demographic challenges must be a long-lasting solution which reaches even far beyond the Lisbon deadlines."
"To meet these goals, complex political, economic, and social strategies are needed."
"The Member States face significant demographic challenges."
"The problems and basic conditions differ, however, between one Member State and another."
"Both for this reason and for democratic reasons, solutions rooted in the individual nations are required."
"It makes no sense for the European Parliament to put forward detailed political recommendations expected to suit all the Member States."
"The current report contains a long list of exhortations regarding the type of measures the Member States should take within important areas such as social insurances, taxes, working times and immigration."
"Which routes individual Member States choose within significant specialist areas of politics must be determined through national democratic processes and not imposed from above."
"Political and social progress takes place through countries experimenting and trying different solutions that can be compared."
"Countries then learn from each other."
"It is through such processes that European culture has developed and, in practice, conquered the world."
"European solutions and ways of thinking have become successful precisely because they have come about through institutional competition between different countries rather than having been decided on centrally."
"The report that is the subject of our debate constitutes a further example of the way in which, slowly but surely, the European Parliament tries to obtain ever more influence over national political issues."
"I regret this process and would criticise the European Parliament’s all but non-existent opposition to this undemocratic development."
"It is clear that if Europe is to meet its demographic challenges it must address more effectively in the future than it does today the issue of work-life balance."
"If we are to attract parents of young children, the elderly or other groups who find standard ‘nine-to-five’ work impossible, we must achieve more flexible working hours, have better and more accessible childcare provisions, more family-friendly tax policies and greater equality in the workplace."
"However, it is clear even if we attract more of Europe’s existing residents into the workforce we will still face skill shortages."
"That is why we also need to have a balanced immigration policy."
"The next item is the report (A6-0040/2006) by Mr Parish, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the promotion of crops for non-food purposes (2004/2259(INI))."
". Mr President, I am delighted to be able to present my report on biofuels."
"It is an own-initiative report from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"It is great to see the Commissioner here and I would like to thank her and her staff for the help they have given me while compiling this report."
"The exciting thing about biofuels, biomass and biogas is that there is a great future for it."
"When you hear the President of the United States say during the State of the Union Address that the American economy can no longer be an oil-based mineral economy, then it shows that things are changing, and here in Europe we have great possibilities."
"Historically, farmers have always provided fuel for transport back in the days of horses, so what is the problem now with supplying fuel?"
"With the new payments for agriculture, the new reforms of the CAP, the decoupled payment and the single farm payment breaking the link between production and subsidy, we also need to find new markets for our products and that is where, as I said, cereals and oil seed rape for bio-diesel and wheat for bioethanol come into play."
"We can also be sure that we can create more biomass."
"In many countries of Europe you actually see that there are forests being used effectively."
"Where there are no forests, then we can grow willows and miscanthus to make sure that we can produce energy supply."
"Some of these can be big projects used for power stations, others can be small projects for local heating plants and for schools and hospitals."
"There can be a lot of flexibility."
"When it comes to not only fuel but energy as a whole, biofuel and bioenergy may not be the total answer, but it is one of the answers."
"Where, for instance, Russia could possibly turn off our gas supply at any time, I think we have to look to alternatives."
"The one thing we must always emphasise with all this is that these types of fuels and biomass are very environmentally friendly."
"That is the great thing: not only is it good for farmers, but it is good for the environment."
"We have the present generation of fuels and biomass available, but we are also seeing new generations coming on and we will see bioplastics coming into place."
"I think there is a big future for that."
"We have seen a new process of making paper from straw, again using much more environmentally friendly chemicals."
"Out of a ton of straw you can create half a ton of paper pulp and a quarter of a ton of bioethanol."
"So it shows, as I said, that we are moving forward with all these projects."
"To mention the common agricultural policy, we have set-aside land on which we are growing nothing."
"Some set-aside land is very effective for environmental enhancement, but I think we should look very positively at using other set-aside land for fuel."
"On biofuel, Volkswagen in Germany has been very sympathetic to mixing fuels and creating engines that will support biofuels, but we need to put pressure on the car companies to be much more sympathetic to this."
"I also think we need to mix fuels much more in order to get a quality of fuel that is good for motor engines."
"Another point about putting land into production for biofuels and biomass, is that it keeps that land in production, so that in the future if we were to need it for food supply, then that it is in production and we could switch it back to food."
"This is a very great bonus."
"Finally, I would like to thank all the Members of the Committee on Agriculture and of Parliament for their support."
"I have visited many countries to see what is going on."
"We have an exciting time in front of us."
"Commissioner, I think now is the time for Parliament and the Commission, along with Member States, to really pull together to establish the tax incentives and get everything in place so that we can deliver a very good biofuel/biomass policy for Europe."
". Mr President, over the past six months, energy has very much become the topic of the moment."
"This was confirmed by the Heads of State at Hampton Court, and this is a window of opportunity that we simply must seize and that is what the Commission is doing."
"I have been very encouraged to see that the European Parliament is having the same positive approach and doing exactly the same."
"As Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, the use of non-food crops is an area of particular interest."
"I see here a very interesting new outlet for our agricultural sector and an interesting source of income, not only for farmers but for the whole rural economy."
"I therefore heartily welcome the report that we will be discussing today."
"Its timing is excellent and it makes a valuable contribution to the debate about the non-food use of agricultural crops."
"I would specifically like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Parish, and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for all the work they have been doing."
"The Commission has recently issued two communications with the aim of encouraging the use of biomass: the biomass action plan and the European strategy for biofuels."
"The Commission’s framework programmes for research have for many years supported pioneering work into renewable bio-resources, including plastics, agri-chemicals and pharmaceuticals."
"The seventh framework programme for research will place a particular emphasis on the development of sustainable non-food applications."
"As well as offering new opportunities to farmers, the development of non-food applications for agricultural raw materials is very much in line with the whole Lisbon Strategy."
"The approach is innovative and represents a high level of European added value."
"On the use of biomass for energy, Eurostat and the Joint Research Centre estimate that the potential for biomass production to meet our targets for 2010 is there."
"The CAP reform gives farmers incentives to respond to the growing demand."
"As well as our specific support for energy crops of EUR 45 per hectare, farmers can use set-aside land to grow non-food crops."
"Last year about 900 000 hectares of set-aside land were used for growing biomass for energy purposes."
"The sugar reform has now made sugar beet eligible for all bio-energy support schemes."
"On the processing side, however, major progress and investments are still needed."
"In our new rural development programming period we have the opportunity to support investments and other actions in favour of biomass for energy and other non-food purposes."
"Cohesion policy can also play an important role."
"As far as the environment is concerned, I agree that we must keep a careful eye on any unwanted impact from the development of the non-food sector."
"This must be carefully monitored."
"The use of biomass is on the increase in all regions of the world, in particular for biofuels."
"This can clearly have economic, social and environmental benefits, but we must also be sure to maintain a proper balance between the production of food and non-food."
"We do not wish to develop the non-food sector in such a way as to have a negative impact on our agrifood industry or on food prices for consumers, either in the European Union or in the developing countries."
"This is again something that we must monitor carefully."
"I am looking forward to a discussion here in the European Parliament on the ways of using renewable energies in a more active way."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for his own-initiative report, which shows great commitment, and also for taking the trouble to travel to various Member States and see for himself the kind of possibilities already existing in the renewable raw materials sector."
"As the Commissioner mentioned, over the last six months, energy has become the most important issue of the day."
"An environmentally friendly, economical mix of all energy sources is indispensable for Europe."
"Renewable raw materials and renewable energy could also form the mainstays of this mix."
"Alongside wind, water, photovoltaic cells and biogas, this particular sector of renewable energy provides for basic needs in the fields of building and insulating materials, and raw materials for the pharmaceutical industry."
"Producing food and crops for the generation of energy was common practice for centuries."
"The use of fossil fuels on a massive scale took over from the energy for our draught animals, which was derived from plants."
"The production of renewable raw materials for energy purposes is of fundamental importance to European agriculture and forestry, and to rural areas."
"It has opened up new sources of income and also made an essential contribution to not only maintaining existing employment but also creating new jobs in rural areas."
"The EU would do well to regard renewable sources of energy as an important factor in energy use, in order to reduce its own dependence on international energy producers and, particularly, on politically unstable regions."
"Many thanks and sincere congratulations to the rapporteur."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, first of all, to join with all the others who have just spoken in congratulating Mr Parish on the work he has done and to say to you that I am completely in agreement with the objectives set out in this report."
"Firstly, that of taking an overall view of the environmental question: bioenergy, biomass and biodegradable matter."
"Secondly, that of diversifying our sources of energy given that we know that we have to anticipate that fossil fuel will run out in 40 or 50 years’ time and that we must fight with all our might against the greenhouse effect."
"Thirdly, and this above all since it concerns agriculture, that of offering new market outlets for our European agriculture."
"Having said that, I would like to add that this can be done only on two conditions, Commissioner."
"Firstly, biofuels do not, on their own, constitute the whole of the agriculture policy and, in the context of this agriculture policy, we have to maintain two pillars: one linked to production and one linked to territorial and social cohesion."
"Secondly, the new policy aimed at bioenergy cannot specifically have any meaning unless it is fully part of a political process and willingness to make the agricultural model a model for sustainable development."
"I believe, therefore, that we have to commit ourselves to considering the new models that allow for diversification of agricultural production while at the same time guaranteeing a sound ecological balance for all of our territories."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by offering my sincere congratulations to Mr Parish on this balanced report, which my group expressly supports."
"The development of non-food crops offers EU farmers the opportunity of developing new markets, and therefore support and research are vital in this field."
"The use of renewable raw materials and renewable energy production both represent an enormous potential for European rural areas."
"I hail from the rural German of Lower Saxony."
"For us in Lower Saxony, in particular, bioenergy is vital as an alternative source of income for farmers and foresters."
"In some fields, especially biogas, for which we have around 430 plants, we are already leading the field in Europe."
"At this point, I should like to say that I also expressly welcome the Commission’s latest initiatives in this field: the Biomass Action Plan and the Commission Communication on Biofuels."
"Parliament will renew its efforts with regard to the EU Strategy for Biofuels within the framework of an own-initiative report."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, too, will draw up an opinion on this."
"As draftsman of this opinion, I shall be glad to be able to build upon the good work accomplished by my colleague Mr Parish."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, it is remarkable that, when we talk of a supply crisis, everyone thinks of President Putin turning off our gas tap."
"No one mentions the fact that Europe as a region is among the world’s largest importers of food and that, if we maintain this standard of living, we shall barely be able to subsist."
"When we discuss alternative sources of income, it is also interesting to hear that the cultivation of sugar for consumption, that is, as a foodstuff, generates little or no income; so why does the cultivation of sugar for bioethanol generate income?"
"There are some inconsistencies here."
"I should now like to discuss the issue of ecology: what is the situation as regards the use of genetic engineering in the cultivation of renewable raw materials?"
"Do we not have the problem of contamination, that is, the problem of coexistence, here?"
"Yes, we do."
"The cultivation of renewable raw materials also involves methods that are not ecologically sound; it is not necessarily environmentally friendly."
"On the subject of greenhouse gases, it has to be said that these are also kept in check by food production, so we could do with a little more moderation and a little less of the enthusiasm shown by the rapporteur, and also a little more concentration on the renewable raw materials deriving from waste products."
"It is also interesting to hear that grass is put to better use when recovered as biogas than as milk."
"If we wish to use recovery, therefore, it is important to recover straw, wood or hedges, but tying up land for renewable raw materials that we need for food is a major problem that calls for less enthusiasm and more precision."
"I would like to welcome the report’s call for fuel tax exemptions to promote the production of biofuels."
"Such a policy would move us closer to the EU’s target of 5.75% for the consumption of biofuels."
"The active development of renewable energy will go some way towards addressing the fossil fuel crisis."
"It can lead to environmental improvements, although I agree with both the rapporteur and the Commissioner here this morning that we need to monitor this environmental impact."
"It can, and will, also bring economic benefits through developing new technologies, job creation and retooling in the agricultural sector, in particular where sugar factories are earmarked for closure."
". Mr President, I am a supporter of the development of biofuels as one of the many answers national governments need to the impending energy crisis."
"Since the European Union has so profoundly failed to protect my country from price-fixing by European energy companies, the need becomes even greater."
"However, I do not believe in pan-European actions on these matters, particularly in relation to setting obligatory targets."
"The EU’s obsession with one-size-fits-all policy-making leads to the encouragement of quick-fix solutions from national governments."
"We are going down that route in Britain with wind turbine technology."
"Our countryside is in the process of being turned into a monstrous Meccano set for the sake of meeting renewable energy targets dreamed up by the European Commission."
"The other problem is the propensity for the EU to bring in legislative regimes well ahead of the ability of national governments to create the necessary infrastructure to support them."
"Again my country has suffered, not least with the growing mountains of refrigerators awaiting disposal."
"Interest groups in favour of bio-diesel development should lobby the national government, not Brussels."
"Our own government is much better placed to come up with suitable proposals for encouraging the sensible development of biofuels in Britain than the EU, which is likely to introduce a regime that will not suit us all."
"Each nation’s needs are different and it is about time the EU took that on board."
"Mr President, the excellent report by Mr Parish on the promotion of crops for non-food purposes puts the problem well: at a time when the price of oil is constantly rising and when gas and oil reserves are diminishing owing to the growing needs of developing countries, it is useful to make provision for alternative energy sources."
"Biofuels, the development of which we have long supported, meets, although only partially, the needs of the agricultural economy: an improvement in the environment through the reduction in greenhouse gases, we are told, the production of renewable energy sources that foster energy independence, job creation in rural areas, the balancing of territories against rural desertification and the preparing of set-aside land for crops for non-food purposes."
"Nonetheless, there remain some questions."
"How are we to achieve the ambitious goal of 5.75% of the market in 2010 for biofuels when France has as yet achieved only 1%?"
"Moreover, if the price per barrel continues to rise, biofuels will become competitive and the problem of tax exemptions will become pointless, and if not, will the Member States accept a loss of revenue amounting to several hundreds of millions of euros?"
"Finally, with the abolition of export refunds in 2013, decided on at the WTO, and the lowering of domestic support, cereal growers will turn more towards non-food production, which is not their main business."
"– Mr President, there is no doubt that biomass belongs to the future of European energy supply."
"In supporting it, however, we must not repeat the mistakes of the past, by which I mean, primarily, that we have to give the market more of a chance."
"For this reason, I ask that an EU internal market for biomass or long-term subsidies not be introduced immediately."
"We must not go back down the route of farm subsidies, only to realise a few years later that our well-meaning policy is incompatible with WTO requirements."
"Instead, we must recognise that rising oil prices make the cultivation of biomass interesting even without state support."
"Only where the critical mass for market integration is lacking should political support be introduced, and then, support programmes must be for a limited period and on a decreasing basis, and progress must be permitted."
"Genetic engineering springs to mind: particularly in the case of energy crops, this has the potential to bring vital economic benefits in global competition."
"Therefore, there are good free-market prospects for renewable raw materials in Europe."
"Politicians must supply the framework to enable this delicate plant to become a strong energy source."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Parish, on the work he has done in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"The resolution that the European Parliament is going to issue today praises the Commission’s initiatives to promote non-food crops and, given their crucial importance, calls upon it to implement them as soon as possible."
"Initiatives such as the biomass plan or the new legislation on biofuels are awaited with particular interest in depressed rural areas and those experiencing specific difficulties."
"For example, in my country, Spain, non-food crops are in fact seen as a genuine socio-economic solution for those areas which have already been affected by the reduction or disappearance of indigenous crops, as in the case of the recent COMs in cotton and beet."
"In order for these crops to be a genuine alternative, however, we must guarantee their viability by means of a policy on prices and fiscal incentives."
"The Commissioner is well aware that it is not just a question of offering solutions to farmers in difficulties."
"Through this new initiative, our environment will be improved as a result of the contribution of clean fuels."
"Business will be done, but at the same time we will be combating depopulation."
"In other words, we will all be winners."
"I would therefore like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission whether it intends to listen to this Parliament and, as our resolution states, draw up a recommendation to the Member States on fiscal incentives and reductions of duties and taxes."
"As we are all very well aware, an action of this type, which would not be legislative, would be of great assistance in terms of promoting the use of renewable energy and stimulate the cultivation of the raw materials that make it possible."
"I believe that we must not miss this opportunity."
"The extremely important energy debate is opening up at a time when we are in the midst of discussions in this Parliament."
"Mr President, the momentum building behind green energy, combined with the pressure on traditional agriculture, unite to offer agricultural production for non-food purposes as an alternative for some, as they consider necessary diversification."
"EU-wide experiences of the use of biomass for producing energy, involving both renewable raw materials and organic farm waste, should be pooled so that the most viable initiatives can be replicated across Europe."
"My government recently announced its intention to develop Northern Ireland as a centre of excellence in alternative energy."
"The EU should financially support that endeavour."
"Tax incentives, increased aid in respect of land use to grow energy crops, and the focused use of Structural Funds: all have a part to play."
"Likewise, planning policies must help, not impede, progress."
"In my constituency, an anaerobic digestion plant was recently forced to close because of rigid and unnecessary planning restrictions."
"We clearly need a joined-up approach by various departments."
"– I also wish to congratulate Mr Parish on his report, which I welcome."
"This extremely important initiative highlights a problem that all of us must endeavour to combat."
"Firstly, I feel that crops for non-food purposes can make a significant contribution to Europe's energy sector, which is the subject of ongoing analysis."
"It is increasingly important to ensure energy security in the EU and greater autonomy in relation to the world outside the EU."
"I feel, in this regard, that the use of biofuels could make a positive contribution."
"Furthermore, I also believe that the promotion of crops for non-food purposes will be of great benefit from an agricultural point of view, especially with regard to energy crops, which could bring fresh hope for the future of European farming, and to the much-misunderstood CAP."
"The search for alternatives to keep agriculture alive is of urgent importance, given the bleak future forecast for Europe’s food production, which faces competition from countries with fewer social and environmental concerns and where low cost production is permissible."
"Mr President, on behalf of the new Member States, including Hungary, I would like to thank Mr Parish, who noticed that new Member States cannot receive financial assistance from EU sources for the cultivation of plants for energy purposes."
"Therefore, the request expressed in the report, that the European Commission eliminate the obstacles to plant cultivation for energy purposes in new Member States and facilitate assistance from the European Union, has particular importance."
"Another very positive element is that according to the report, assistance must be granted outside of the SAPS system, independently of the ‘phasing in’ related to direct payments."
"The report of the European Parliament supports the interests of new Member States unequivocally, and therefore I ask Mrs Fischer Boel and the Commission to consider these proposals, because assistance for energy purposes is extremely important in the new Member States, too, in order to ensure jobs."
"Mr President, the idea of promoting crops for non-food purposes is excellent and very timely."
"It is timely because, since joining the European Union, Polish farmers have experienced first-hand what limiting milk production or liquidating sugar production means, and that subsidy levels are not equal across the Union."
"The production of biomass and bio fuels in particular will not only improve the state of the environment and increase employment in rural areas, but will also preserve human dignity by increasing the income of whole families."
"Rather than worrying about the falling price of porkers, farmers will be able to celebrate the rising fuel prices."
"Until now, farmers have protected us from the threat of hunger."
"Now they can save us from an energy crisis and breathe new life into the common agricultural policy."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by offering my sincere thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Parish, who has done a very good job in producing this own-initiative report."
"In view of current events, mixtures of all energy sources and the share of total energy demand accounted for by renewable energy are the most topical issues of the day."
"We must seize this opportunity in the interests of the widespread use of non-food crops."
"Following the agricultural reforms, farmers can cultivate energy crops on set-aside land, but alongside food production, which remains a priority."
"This initial step must be followed up, however, which means that we need to strengthen research and development, extending to modern economic biotechnology."
"What are important are market-integration aids and concentration on competitiveness, which means that it is important to give the promotion of bioenergy from non-food crops, which makes sense from an ecological point of view, a basis that is economically viable in the long term."
"We still need more jobs in rural areas."
". Mr President, I would like to thank you once again for the valuable contribution that the European Parliament has been making to this very important area."
"I am very impressed with the overwhelming support that I have seen here in Parliament today."
"We have a lot of work ahead of us."
"The year 2006 will be particularly challenging, with a number of key issues to be addressed: firstly, the biofuel targets in the context of the review of the Biofuels Directive; secondly, the possibility of increasing the blend of biofuels into conventional fuels – work is already under way to review the Fuel Quality Directive; and thirdly, the energy crop regime, which we will also review this year."
"All the different actions are set out in the biomass action plan and the biofuels strategy, which must be put on track this year."
"There is plenty to do and we are very dedicated."
"This is why we have set up a new unit in my department with special responsibility for biomass and biofuels."
"We will also continue to find ways of encouraging the enormous economic, social and environmental potential of non-food applications, particularly those highlighted in the report."
"I firmly believe that the whole economy stands to gain from the contribution which renewable bio-resources can make to ensuring a sustainable future for Europe."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11 a.m."
"The promotion of crop production for non-food purposes is a unique opportunity that can potentially bring considerable social, economic and environmental benefits for European farmers and rural economies."
"As a matter of fact, the report clearly highlights the potential offered by the developments and the investments in the non-food crops sector for farmers."
"Developing the non-food crops sector is very likely to have a positive impact on farmers that undergo the consequences of the sugar CMO reform."
"We should therefore support the development of this sector as it brings alternative productions for European farmers under competition pressure."
"Moreover, it is clear that supporting crop production for non-food purposes is in line with the targets set by the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies for the development and use of renewable energies, as crop production for energy purposes brings a large potential in order to meet Union’s energy needs."
"The next item is the vote."
"Mr President, I should appreciate it if the President could speak a little more slowly, as the interpretation is not heard immediately."
"I do, in fact, read the titles of reports more quickly when they are long and complicated."
"I hope that the interpreters, who have the same text in front of them, are able to follow."
"Mr President, you may have an appointment somewhere else later on, I do not know, but we are here to do a job and to vote."
"You are going at such a furious pace that we cannot put our hands up in time in order to vote."
"Could you please slow down?"
"As regards my timetable, I can reassure you."
"I shall not be leaving Parliament before tomorrow morning so I have plenty of time."
"I am not sure that is the case for all Members."
"Mr President, I should like to request a clarification, an addition."
"After"
"‘management expenditure for’"
"the following phrase:"
"‘any executive agency created or extended to administer this programme’"
"Are there any objections to this oral amendment?"
"Mr President, I wish to table an oral amendment with the intention of changing recital C. It is a matter of substituting the terms, which I will read out in English as that is the only version I have:"
"… ‘environmental protection’ by ‘environmental sustainability’ …"
"I believe these are the recognised terms."
"The text would then read as follows:"
"… ‘whereas there are three main objectives for EU energy policy: security of supply, competitiveness and environmental sustainability’."
"Are there any objections to this oral amendment?"
"Mr President, I rise on a point of order under Rule 151 on inadmissibility of amendments."
"I would like you to rule that none of these amendments are admissible because at 10.45 a.m. this morning when we last checked, there was no voting list on the electronic system."
"We therefore do not have a voting list and we will be voting on something we cannot see."
"I would therefore respectfully ask you to move on to the next item of business and defer this until we have a proper voting list."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the services say that the voting lists have been available since yesterday evening."
"Having said that, they were not necessarily in the place where you looked on Parliament’s web site, as they were moved because of the reorganisation of the site."
"Nonetheless, given what the services tell me, I do not see why I should act on your comment, as the voting lists were indeed available yesterday evening on the Internet."
"Mr President, this is a minor amendment, aimed at making the text more precise: to change the word 'historically' to 'frequently'."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would much prefer to keep the original text because the word ‘frequently’ clearly changes the meaning."
"I thank Mr Martínez Martínez for the amendment and I accept it."
"Are there any objections to this oral amendment?"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this House has provided a major impetus to the development of European political parties."
"We now have 10 party families, which shows the variety of our political culture."
"This report marks the start of a new stage that is to simplify the work of these parties."
"European parties are a necessary part of European democracy, and we hope, above all, that the parties nominate top candidates for the office of Commission President before the next European elections, so that the public has the choice between personalities and programmes and is able to participate in deciding what kind of Europe it wants."
"I should like to thank the party Chairman and Secretary-General for their important suggestions."
"This budget heading is one of the few for which Parliament itself is responsible, and so I would also thank the Bureau and the administration of this House for their truly good management of this delicate budget heading for the European parties."
"I would ask the House to adopt the report."
"Mr President, could you tell us whether any Members of this House declared a financial interest before voting on the previous report?"
"To my knowledge, no Member has made a declaration."
"I will remind you of the rule: we have a special register with which to declare once and for all any financial interests, thus obviating the need to declare any possible financial interests at every debate."
"Therefore, if you want to avoid any disagreement, complete the register properly."
"Mr President, this is an oral amendment to replace the words ‘improving compatibility of school hours with working hours’ with ‘improving the compatibility of working hours with school hours’."
". Mr President, I would like to say that, as rapporteur, I initially did not think this made any difference to the text."
"Having looked at it, however, I think it does improve the text so, personally, I am in favour."
"Are there any objections to this oral amendment?"
"That concludes the vote."
". Mr President, this report by Mr Brok is formally technical, but nevertheless very important."
"I voted in favour of adopting the report, and I believe that by adopting this agreement we in the European Parliament are showing our desire to strengthen our relations with the independent state of Israel, the only democratic country in the Middle East."
"It is important that we in the European Parliament support countries where European values, such as democracy, human rights and the principles of the rule of law are in effect."
"Accordingly, Israel needs our undivided support."
"I hope that this vote will send the signal that we in the European Parliament respect basic European values, and that we cannot permit cooperation or negotiations with the terrorist organisation Hamas, which has come to power in the Palestinian Autonomous Area."
"Before we can even talk about negotiations, Hamas must unambiguously 1) acknowledge Israel’s right to be a Jewish state, 2) cease all acts of terror, 3) give up its weapons, 4) refuse to support other violent groups, and 5) respect existing international agreements between Israel and the PA (Oslo Accords, the Roadmap, etc.)."
"I hope that the European Union will stand by its basic values."
"It is important to support independent, democratic Israel and its right to exist."
"Mr President, people are starting to leave, so I shall be brief."
"Since I was unable to take the floor at the vote last week in Strasbourg, I should like to reiterate that it is important to separate the programmes for consumer protection and health from each other, even if the Commission did not give this a particularly positive assessment, because, ultimately, the two programmes have different legal bases, and hence consumer protection needs to be afforded in a different way."
"Secondly, I should like to use this explanation of vote to reiterate that, generally speaking, attempting to create further EU agencies and thus spread the competences of the various authorities wider, hence decreasing transparency, is not an effective way to proceed."
"For this reason, I welcome the Thyssen report of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, which takes full account of this concern."
"Adopting the report today with the oral amendment on financing was a good solution."
". We voted in favour of this report, as it gives autonomy to the Consumer Protection Programme, in contrast with the Commission’s attempt to create one single programme also encompassing health."
"Quite apart from this key difference, which we support, the report introduces significant improvements, in terms of the areas to be addressed, the overall amounts of money involved, and increased expenditure for the functioning of European consumer organisations representing consumer interests."
"Although in some areas we would like to have gone further, we now hope that the Commission and the Council take on board Parliament’s position."
". I welcome the Community's Action Programme to set up a joint health and consumer protection programme."
"The Action Programme aims to deliver an opinion on the consumer protection aspect for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection - the committee responsible."
"It will do this by harmonising consumer protection throughout the single market, enabling citizens to move freely within the EU and buy goods with the same confidence as in their countries of origin."
"By providing a better understanding of consumers and markets, this Action Programme protects citizens from risks and threats beyond the control of individuals."
"I am also particularly in favour of this Action Programme as it will put health and consumer issues at the centre of policy-making in the EU."
".I should like to congratulate Mrs Thyssen, who has done an excellent piece of work."
"I thank her all the more because she has been willing to incorporate the amendments that I had tabled concerning relations between consumers and craft enterprises."
"Craft workers play a vital role everyday in terms of giving information and advice to consumers, with whom they are in direct contact."
"I am also satisfied that the two programmes have been kept separate: health and consumer protection."
"These policies are of equal importance to people, and each of the programmes can only be reinforced by this."
"Nevertheless, I am still extremely worried about the Council’s proposals concerning the Community’s budget for 2007 to 2013, which would lead in a few years time to a drastic reduction in the current policy for consumer protection at European level."
"It is unthinkable that this budget should be reduced to EUR 5 million a year in 2009, that is to say one cent a year for each European consumer."
"This is by no means enough to finance a consumer protection policy worthy of the name and, moreover, of fundamental importance to people’s daily lives."
"Nonetheless, I am voting in favour of this report."
"Mr President, I am including the Parish report when I say that there are three things that Europe needs to secure its future: firstly, a healthy environment, particularly in terms of air, water and soil; secondly, healthy food and enough of it; and, thirdly, energy."
"Rural areas are capable of offering us all these three things in sufficient measure and independently of external sources, on which we would only become reliant."
"In this respect, it was disastrous when, a few months ago, in this Chamber, Tony Blair defamed farmers in Europe, in particular, as backward-looking."
"Every cent that we invest in agriculture and in rural areas is an investment in the future of Europe."
"These are three vital fields, which are full of innovation and future prospects."
"The key to securing Europe’s future – and this is a revolutionary development of which we have yet to take nearly enough account – lies to an ever-increasing extent in our rural areas and rural, decentralised structures."
"Mr President, I would like to propose a calculation justifying why I voted in favour of nuclear power."
"If emissions in the EU are cut by approximately 100 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in the first phase of emissions trading, the market price in terms of emissions permits will be 2.5 billion a year at current prices."
"A cautious estimate is that the price of electricity in the European wholesale electricity market could rise on average by EUR 10 per megawatt-hour as a result of emissions trading."
"Since electricity consumption in the EU stands at approximately 3 000 terawatt-hours a year, the costs of emissions trading in the wholesale electricity market will be around EUR 30 billion a year."
"One option which goes against the principle of the market would be to tax electricity."
"I am not suggesting that, but I do propose a thought experiment."
"If emissions trading were replaced with a tax on electricity and the revenue were used for genuine investment in emissions reduction, the 30 billion or so a year could be used as investment aid to build up a huge amount of capacity, which would remove the need for fossil fuels."
"Nuclear power is an example of a form of emission-free energy which the electricity market does not support, and which in fact is not really needed either, unlike many other forms of energy."
"If you imagine, however, that an investment of 3 billion would result in cuts of approximately 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide through the use of nuclear power, the 30 billion would in fact result in that annual cut in emissions through the construction of nuclear power plants, with the difference that the electricity produced could still be sold."
".I voted in favour of the joint resolution submitted by four political groups on the security of energy supply in the European Union."
"The issue of energy is going to become crucial in a post-oil age as far as guaranteeing environmentally-friendly economic development and social progress is concerned."
"The fact that nuclear power is no longer a taboo subject is a positive development, and I am delighted that sustainable energy sources have been highlighted, together with the urgent need for research and development programmes to gather pace in this area."
"I regret that the idea of introducing a Community tool to control oil prices has not been taken up."
"In this motion for a resolution, it is not a question of opposing the increase in oil prices, which is unavoidable, but rather of softening the brutal effects of such an increase by making it an annual one."
"Finally, it is very important that the European Council draft a clear policy in this sector which, it must be pointed out, is not the responsibility of Europe, and this so as not to give false hope to our fellow citizens who, if they were not satisfied, would once again turn against the European ideal."
". The PPE-DE Group has decided to abstain on paragraphs 10, 22, 27 and 29 not because we have objections to the content, but because these paragraphs were clearly defined as originated by the Verts/ALE Group."
"That group regularly abuses the process of negotiating joint motions."
"Until the last moment they skilfully obtain the insertion of several paragraphs coming from their own resolution and the deletion of text they dislike, but at the end they refuse to sign the joint resolution, for some spurious reason such as one word in the text being unacceptable for the Greens."
"Compromise means giving and taking on both sides and at the end accepting something that is not exactly what you originally wanted."
"The PPE-DE Group believes that if the Verts/ALE Group wants to play its role in a democratic and fair way it has to play the game."
". As the resolution says, the import dependency for energy of the 25 EU Member States is extremely high – 48% in 2002, potentially rising to 71% in 2030 if no additional measures are taken."
"Some of the figures paint a very clear picture:"
"- 76.6% of EU demand for oil, 53% of demand for gas, 35.4% for coal and almost 100% for uranium and uranium products is met from imports;"
"- EU-25 gross electricity generation is as follows: 31% nuclear, 25% solid fuel (predominantly coal), 18% gas, 14% renewable energy sources and 5% oil;"
"- final energy use in the EU-25 was 28% in the industrial sector, 31% for transport and 41% in buildings."
"It is therefore clear that measures must be taken to strengthen cooperation, research, public policies and appropriate investments, if we are to reduce the Member States’ dependency and to increase energy efficiency."
"There are a number of proposals in the resolution to which we object, namely the prominence given to the liberalisation of the sector, to competition, and to the internal energy market. This path can only serve to strengthen the economic and financial groups, and will not lead to any improvement for the economically weakest countries and the people who live there."
".We are partly in agreement with the statements made in this resolution: concern about our countries’ dependency on energy, and its possible economic and social consequences; and the need to promote local renewable energy sources that are more environmentally friendly, to invest in energy efficiency or to research new ways of saving energy."
"There is, however, a lack of attention paid to the predicted exhaustion of world fossil fuel resources."
"On the other hand, we do not agree with the role that the Commission has bestowed upon itself in the energy sector, a role that is not in the Treaties, that even your European Constitution reduced to a reaffirmation of the existing situation, but which this Parliament wishes to develop."
"The liberalisation of the market for gas and electricity only results in an increase in the price of energy for the consumer, disruptions in supply and a general move towards the merging of businesses."
"Even my country, in which almost 90% of the electricity production comes from nuclear power or from sustainable energy sources, and which traditionally produces a surplus, is now encountering these problems."
"Thanks to Brussels!"
"The market principle alone is not compatible with the pursuit of national strategic objectives or the safeguarding of a country’s vital interests."
"The Member States must remain the only masters of their own energy policy."
". I voted for this resolution because as a London MEP I believe that recently published energy sector inquiries found that some continental firms have been guilty of price fixing."
"It is this kind of price fixing and long-term contracts which have led to disparities between London and continental gas prices."
"I want the European Commission to respond to this robustly."
"I am also concerned about key issues of fuel poverty in my constituency not covered in this resolution."
". The Commission’s Green Paper on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy makes an accurate analysis of the energy supply problems that have recently come to light."
"What we can refer to as the ‘energy question’ is the expected result of economic progress, coupled with the restricted production and processing capacity of traditional energy sources."
"The most serious problem is that these elements of the equation are very difficult to change."
"The economic growth of giants such as Brazil, Russia, India and China is a predictable and, fortunately, incontrovertible fact."
"Furthermore, even if there is some increase in the production and processing capacity – assuming that the capacity of refineries is resolved in time – the finite nature of these resources is also irreversible."
"I should also like to say that I have major doubts as to the immediate effectiveness of reducing consumption, unless this process can be extended to the production of goods, equipment, transport and buildings."
"I also feel that this debate can only be realistic if nuclear energy can be included in the debate alongside renewable energy."
"Lastly, I endorse the Green Paper, and the resolution, especially as it introduces the issue of security into the debate."
"Mr President, anyone who has ever flown over Africa in daylight knows how much the Democratic Republic of Congo is its geostrategic heart."
"For this reason, we have to attempt to secure democracy and stability there."
"However, the present critical discussion of this issue should be seen as a last warning sign that the necessary structures should be created at long last, including to safeguard Europe’s own interests in a neighbouring continent of such great strategic importance."
"We are rightly making policy in other continents, we are taking responsibility for peace and freedom, but we are not managing to provide the instruments that are needed."
"We need a European army at long last, a professional army, to supplement our conscript and other armies."
"The national armies must continue to undertake domestic defence, but, largely, we are still lacking the instruments to intervene in other continents."
"We are risking taking on too much, and so I say ‘yes’ to this deployment."
"However, we must take this as a serious warning to make sure our common foreign and security policy also has the necessary instruments for peacekeeping at its disposal at long last."
"The current situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo is very worrying."
"For a long time, the country has suffered great instability, which has led to famine, brutality towards civilians and a very serious situation in the whole of the Great Lake region."
"We are, however, encouraged by the fact that elections are now being organised."
"We in the June List are strongly opposed to the mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo being used further to strengthen the EU’s common foreign and security policy."
"The situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo must be resolved, but not through the deployment of a joint EU force."
"It is up to each Member State to decide, at the request of the UN, whether or not troops are to be deployed."
"We have thus voted against the resolution."
". Africa is a most appetising fruit."
"The main capitalist powers seek to dominate it and exploit its immense resources. This is evidenced by the increase in the presence on the continent, and the number of operations and military bases, of the USA, France, the UK and Germany."
"Military action in the Democratic Republic of Congo is steeped in this approach and paves the way for further military operations in the future."
"Let us not forget that this is the second intervention under the ‘EU' umbrella in the country, following 'Artemis’, with French troops, in 2003."
"The major powers in the EU, namely France and Germany, with the support of the Portuguese Government have failed to promote the end of the illegal exploitation of natural resources – in which companies from EU countries have been involved – and the end of external meddling in the country; have failed to respond to requests for humanitarian aid from the United Nations; and have failed to promote and provide financial support for the disarmament and socio-economic development process, thereby ensuring that it is the local population that uses and benefits from the natural resources in the country. Instead, they have sent more troops to a country in which more than 15 000 troops are already stationed as part of the Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC)."
"Hence our vote against."
"– The EU decision to send the military forces of the Euro-army to the Democratic Republic of Congo relates to competition between the imperialist forces to control the markets and the wealth-producing resources of the Congo and Africa in general, which has paid for this policy with millions of lives."
"The mantle of safeguarding peace and the electoral process is being used by the ΕU to cover the real objectives and create a situation of fait accompli for future interventions."
"Moreover, this Euro-army mission constitutes the first application of the reactionary UN reform, the aim of which is to integrate regional organisations (ΝΑΤΟ, Euro-army) into UN mechanisms, in order to 'legalise' imperialist interventions."
"It is no coincidence that the resolution refers to the need to reconstruct the Democratic Republic of Congo in accordance with the Iraqi standard for which provision is made in the 60th anniversary UN declaration."
"The second organised military mission of the Euro-army after Bosnia also demonstrates its aggressive, interventionist character."
"The peoples of the Congo and of Africa do not need 'international protectors' who are in any case responsible for the wars and the desperate situation they are in."

"British Conservatives are opposed to EU involvement in military activities, which are an aspect of EU political integration, produce no additional military capabilities and undermine established military alliances."
"There is a tragedy brewing in the Congo, but the proposed international deployments do not address this."
"The EU is neither designed nor equipped to handle such matters from a military standpoint."
"Nor should it be. The EU has not even been able to fulfil its meagre security obligations to Sudan, where it insisted on a role when NATO was already committed."
"There have been two EU civil missions in the Congo and it is not clear what the mandate of any EU military mission would now be."
"The Congolese Government has not requested it."
"Clearly this exercise is cosmetic, designed more to publicise the EU label than to overcome the Congo's problems."
"The EU should respond to UN requests through use of its political, humanitarian, electoral observation and development assistance tools."
"Depending on the context, these matters should be the responsibility of nations, NATO or the UN."
"British Conservatives are supportive of the UN in its many difficult tasks but not of EU military adventures."
"We therefore voted against the resolution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to explain why I voted in favour of Mr Leinen’s report on the regulation of European political parties and on their funding."
"When, in Italy, I cry out ‘Pensioners, take a stand!’ all the pensioners fall in behind me, and young people do so together with the pensioners, because they believe in the Pensioners’ Party, of which I am the leader."
"I am sure that, if I cried out ‘Pensioners, take a stand!’ in the 25 languages of the European Union, pensioners from the other 24 EU Member States would also support me because the European political party goes right to the heart of the population."
"I am absolutely certain that we will create Europe when we have created the European parties, just as the Pensioners’ Party is creating the European Pensioners’ Party."
"Pensioners, take a stand!"
"Mr President, running through the Leinen report is the belief that fully-fledged European political parties are necessary, because they truly benefit democracy at European level."
"I think that it would be no exaggeration to say that the opposite is the case."
"The unbridled increase in scale of the decision-making process in a Europe which should, mark well, consist of very different and very definitely sovereign Member States, is the surest way of reducing democracy and making decision-making even less transparent by introducing bureaucracy that is virtually impossible to monitor, something of which there are many examples these days, by the way."
"Just think of the totalitarian way in which this Parliament is dealing with the rejection of the European Constitution in democratic referendums in France and the Netherlands."
"The intention is, then, that the European political parties should serve the purpose of siphoning off yet more piles of money from the taxpayer and give even more of it to political parties, but only, that is, to the politically correct ones."
"It follows that when Europe talks about democracy, we do well to watch our step."
"Mr President, whilst I would disagree with the previous speaker and say that also at European level we need political parties to offer choice to citizens, I should like to place on record that I disagree with one of the suggestions that has been floated in the context of the Leinen report, namely that we should have European-level lists for elections to the European Parliament."
"Such a proposal would, for a start, need an amendment to the Treaties to be made now, while we are still in a period of reflection about what to do as regards Treaty amendment."
"I also think it is not necessary."
"There is a risk that such lists might place the Members elected through them further away from citizens than those who are elected in the regions, as most of us are."
"Where we could explore a useful way of linking the European elections to the idea of choice for citizens, is by taking up the idea that our rapporteur made just a few minutes ago, namely that each European political party should name its candidate for President of the Commission."
"That would make a link between the vote for a parliament and the resultant composition of the executive that people are indeed used to when they vote in national elections in European countries."
"It is important for us to have political parties at European level."
"They play an important role in disseminating political information and knowledge of European policy, as well as in promoting democratic values and creating a European consciousness."
"We do not, however, believe that the EU should decide on how membership, lists and nominations are to be dealt with."
"It must be up to each party to lay down rules concerning the ways in which they wish to handle issues such as these."
". Our vote against is consistent with our position on Europe’s political parties."
"Given the enormous chasm between the citizens and the European institutions, the solution is not to set up more European parties or to increase the funding of those already in existence."
"Each national party must retain the ability to organise itself autonomously, not least with regard to its relations with the Union and Parliament."
"In order to encourage the citizens to become more involved in politics at Community level, what is needed is a complete sea change away from neoliberal policies, the end of the Stability and Growth Pact, the withdrawal of the so-called Bolkestein Directive, and the replacement of the Lisbon Strategy with a strategy characterised by solidarity, sustainable development and social cohesion."
"What is needed is more high-quality jobs with rights, better public services, more employment-generating investment and greater social inclusion, along with fairer distribution of wealth."
".The European political parties are merely extremely lucrative organisations."
"The basic points in this report amount to a demand for them to have more money and more freedom in how they use it, as well as more status and a tax exemption system."
"For what purpose though?"
"Just to exist and to meet, for the moment."
"Since the aim is to give these parties a monopoly to spread the good word of Europeism."
"Their creation depends, moreover, on some unacceptable certificate of European ‘right-thinking’ bestowed by this institution, based on the programmes that they are required to submit to its authorities."
"We know too that you would like at least some of the seats in this Parliament to be reserved for those elected from lists drawn up at European level, lists that could only be presented by European parties."
"The ultimate outcome for you would be if they were authorised to participate as such in national and local ballots, thereby allowing unacceptable political meddling at all levels of decision making in the Member States."
"Democracy consists of allowing nations to govern themselves or to choose representatives to defend their interests within decision-making authorities, parliaments or governments."
"Imposing artificial entities that are representative only of themselves and subject to the ideology of Brussels is anything but democracy."
"We oppose the subsidised system now being developed for European political parties."
"Parties must be constructed from the bottom up by the parties in the Member States."
"If these parties find no justification for increasing their appropriations to their European parties, it may be questioned whether there really is a need for European political parties to exist."
"We object to setting up parties at EU level that are heavily subsidised by EU taxpayers."
"We are therefore voting against this report."
". Today, nearly 85% of the members of this Parliament have agreed to an increase in subsidies that benefit their own political parties and to soften up the rules on how this money can be spent."
"Moreover, the current budget of EUR 8.4 million that was spent last year on subsidies for European parties will be further increased, and those parties will be allowed to put these subsidies aside if they fail to spend them within the space of one year."
"In many cases, politicians develop a logic all of their own, quite independently of their electorate."
"That was the case in the failed proposal for a European Constitution and this is even more the case in subsidies of this kind."
"Initially, funds voted by Parliament were used, illegally for cooperation at European level between political parties."
"On 18 June 2003, I voted against legalisation of this abuse, and today, I am voting against a further expansion."
"Whether national parties want to unite in European parties is up to them, but I cannot see why they should not fund some things themselves."
"The fact that they are now demanding an increase in subsidies and more flexible rules that apply to those subsidies, creates the impression that politicians are more concerned about the interests of their own groups than those of their electorate."
"– The Kommounistiko Komma Elladas opposes the EU decision to create European political parties which it wants to control and use to defend or promote a one-way street in Europe."
"The report promotes the upgrading of their role and makes the funding system more flexible, so that they can be used as part of the brain-washing mechanism in preparation for the Euro-Constitution and its policy, in order to break grass-roots opposition."
"Within the framework of the so-called 'European communications policy', in other words of the ideological attack by capital, and making use of the 'phase of reflection’, it mobilises initiatives, regional authorities, NGOs, the media, journalists and political parties in favour of a one-way street in Europe for the purposes of propaganda and in order to resurrect the Euro-Constitution and raise the 'low stock' of the ΕU in the eyes of the workers of Europe."
"Particular importance is attached to young people, by strengthening the 'European parties' in order to create European youth organisations."
"At the same time, it safeguards absolute control and the lack of independence of these parties, up to the point of defining their internal rules of procedure."
"We are voting against the report, refusing any declaration of loyalty to the imperialist alliance of capital, the ΕU, and we call for opposition, insubordination and disobedience."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before boarding my flight yesterday to come to Brussels today, I shouted out ‘Pensioners, take a stand!’, as I always do."
"I turned around and saw that elderly people and young people were following me because, in the Pensioners’ Party, everyone works together, whether old or young."
"The report by Mr Bushill-Matthews – whom I thank for his customary diligence – rightly talks about solidarity between the generations."
"Mr President, everyone – young people and pensioners alike – has asked me the following question, which is one that I also ask myself: should it be the elderly who provide for the young or, on the contrary, should it be the young who provide for the elderly?"
"Undoubtedly it is the elderly that, after having given their entire lives to society and to everyone in it, are supposed, even as senior citizens, to hand over their pensions to young people."
"I believe that the governments of the 25 EU Member States would like this to happen, but are we really sure that it would be the best solution?"
"Might not a better solution be for young people to finally give elderly people the recognition that they deserve?"
"Long live pensioners!"
"Mr President, I have abstained from the vote on the present Bushill-Matthews report because I disagree with some of its recommendations."
"Recital 70 on immigration policy springs to mind, although I have to confess, incidentally, that even this recital contains a phrase that is remarkably nuanced for this House."
"Admittedly, this report is actually relatively even-handed and, if nothing else, has the merit of once again placing the demographic problem of Europe on the agenda."
"What I do not find in this report, though, is the conclusion that very many parents today still opt voluntarily in favour of staying at home and decide in favour of the family, and that probably many more people would take that option should this be made financially viable by the government."
"In this connection, my group has for a long time argued in favour of fully-fledged parent wages, including social security and accrual of pension rights for the parent staying at home and looking after under-age children."
"I am convinced that this measure could also go a long way towards providing an answer to the enormous demographic challenge which we are currently facing."
"Mr President, singles are praised in the contemporary media as the measure of all things."
"Families with several children are virtually seen as antisocial."
"Yet the higher the proportion of childless people today, the more young people will, in turn, want to remain childless."
"In my opinion, the parents of tomorrow need to grow up with children to be able to appreciate them."
"Therefore, we have to step up action to put the contemporary image of the family straight."
"If we want to avoid a scenario where, in cities, the traditional family only exists among immigrants, I believe that we need to increasingly orient the promotion of the family towards the indigenous population of Europe, too."
"Another important starting point, of course, is the reconciliation of family and career."
"It is no coincidence that those countries that have succeeded in this have higher birth rates."
"We voted in favour of the report on demographic challenges and solidarity between the generations."
"However, we voted against the wording to the effect that increased taxes designed to fund social security offer a less sustainable solution in the long term."
"Moreover, we interpret an increase in the retirement age as an increase in the actual, rather than the statutory, retirement age."
"Because the wording was insufficiently clear on this point, we were unable to support it."
"Nor do we support the European Parliament’s calling on the Member States and private companies to break the link between higher ages and higher wage levels."
"The Swedish Conservatives have today chosen to abstain from voting in the vote on demographic challenges and solidarity between the generations."
"Even though the report puts forward many relevant proposals, we cannot support it."
"The reason is that it concerns issues that fall within the Member States’ areas of competence."
".I voted in favour of Mr Bushill-Matthews’ report on demographic challenges and solidarity between the generations."
"The facts are there and are irrefutable: Europe is growing older."
"In my country, the equation is a simple one: since we live under a system of redistribution for the payment of statutory pensions, whereby each generation of working people pays for the pensions of the generation that has gone before it, that means, in very practical terms, that fewer working people will have to fund the retirement and health care of a greater number of pensioners, who will be living longer and longer."
"If nothing is done, either future generations will have to bear much heavier costs to the detriment of their own standard of living, or, if they were to refuse to do so, tomorrow’s pensioners would find themselves reduced progressively to a subsistence standard of living and to the rationing of health care."
"On the face of it, neither of these possibilities is acceptable."
"Neither will be accepted in any case."
"We have to find other ways, and urgently; all the countries of the European Union are faced with this challenge."
"It is the duty of a democracy to look ahead for an answer to challenges that it knows are unavoidable."
"We owe it to the future generations of Europeans."
". I welcome this report which is a response to the trends resulting in demographic changes."
"According to the Commission, in order to face up to demographic change, Europe should pursue three essential priorities: a return to demographic growth, ensuring a balance between the generations, and 'finding new bridges between the stages of life'."
"In our society, it is more important than ever that we confront our demographic challenges and harness the knowledge of our older citizens to the best of our ability."
". From China to Europe, passing through Russia, not to mention Africa, a huge demographic problem is emerging."
"The world is growing older."
"What is worse, in some countries of Europe, the population is declining or is going to decline, as in Germany or Russia."
"The demographic consequences are well-known: increases in expenditure on health and pensions, the need for millions of jobs providing personal care and a shortage of staff resulting in a migration influx, which has the psychological effect of pushing societies towards cautious, do nothing attitudes and Malthusian ‘no future’ policies, of which the ‘austerity budget pact’ has been the expression since Maastricht."
"In other words, who is going to pay the taxes to finance this situation?"
"The Gods of the stadium or old people on their last legs?"
"Of course, family policies will endeavour to create contributors and contributions."
"While we wait, however, for the increase in the birth rate and, hence, new workers, in the vacuum of the next 20 years unfolding before us, the Belgian, Dutch or Swiss laws on euthanasia, dressed up as the right to choose one’s own death, demonstrate the ‘Journey to the End of the Night’ that the policies, especially in Europe, have begun."
". Europe is facing an unprecedented demographic problem."
"In 2030, the EU will have 18 million fewer young people than at the moment, and in 2050, it will have 60 million fewer inhabitants."
"Between 2005 and 2030, there will be a 52.3% increase in the number of people over 65 (40 million more), whereas there will be a 6.8% drop in the 15 to 64 age group (21 million fewer)."
"The proportion of inactive people (the young, the elderly and other dependent persons) in relation to people of working age will rise from 49% in 2005 to 66% in 2030."
"These developments can be put down to two factors: firstly, people are living longer and, secondly, the birth rate has dropped."
"Average life expectancy for 60 year olds has risen by five years since 1960 for women, and almost four years for men, meaning that the number of over 80 year olds will grow by 180% by 2050, whereas the birth rate has been falling."
"The number of children per woman in 2003 was 1.48, whilst at least 2.1 children per woman would be required to maintain the population level."
"Mindful of the consequences of these factors on prosperity, standards of living and relations between the generations, I voted for this report."
"Mr President, I strongly support the maximal development of bioenergy, but when we talk about promoting the cultivation of non-food crops in connection with self-sufficiency in energy, we need to point out that liquid biofuels are by no means cost-effective."
"Also, the EU cannot even produce enough biofuels to meet the targets set out in the biofuel directive."
"I think it is important to call things by their right name in order to prevent a situation where, unnoticed by us, the Directorate-General for Agriculture starts managing EU energy policy."
"This will therefore be about subsidies for agriculture, not carbon dioxide efficiency or self-sufficiency in energy, as long as the costs of liquid biofuels are clearly greater than those for the conventional fuels they are expected to replace, or while the fossil energy used to manufacture them is greater than what is obtained from them."
"That is how things stand, especially with Nordic field-based energy."
"Consequently, an increase in the use of biofuels would raise both EU energy costs and the price of food."
"That would inevitably impact on the EU’s competitiveness."
"With liquid biofuels, we need an honest life cycle analysis, which would be undertaken by an independent, impartial agency."
". Mr President, I support the Parish report."
"Remember, colleagues, that using sugar as raw material, Brazil is the world’s ethanol superpower, with an interesting ownership of the sector – not all Brazilian."
"I am deeply disappointed and saddened by the decision to close the last sugar factory in Ireland."
"Hundreds of jobs will be lost."
"This is a cruel blow for all those who faithfully served the industry for generations."
"The Commission’s decision to reform the sugar industry and to cut the supports it paid to growers never favoured the Irish sugar industry."
"We must now ensure that those who served the sugar industry loyally for many years receive equitable compensation."
"The whole area of growing alternative crops which may be used among other things for the production of bioethanol must now be given serious consideration and support at both EU and national level, particularly for the sugar beet sector."
"Biofuels offer excellent new opportunities and can utilise the expertise notably of Irish tillage farmers."
"Biofuels will contribute to Europe’s energy self-sufficiency, at a time of rising oil prices and in light of the recent controversy over gas supplies from Russia."
"We have voted in favour of the report on the promotion of crops for non-food purposes because we think it is a good idea for farmers to plant crops other than the traditional ones when the latter no longer pay their way."
"Technological development is important where alternative forms of energy are concerned, and we are also aware of the opportunities provided by the restructuring of agricultural policy."
"We do not, however, believe that a transition to energy crops should be allowed to slow down the phasing-out of the common agricultural policy."
"It is important for these new products to be developed and to thrive in a free market without subsidies."
"To the extent that it is provided at all, temporary aid should be targeted not at subsidised production but at infrastructural measures designed to get activities up and running."
".On the occasion of the adoption of this report, which I supported, I would like to mention the recent developments in the field of bioenergy in Belgium."
"In addition to microeconomic projects relating to the use of biofuels in farming, large-scale industrial projects are finally emerging in my country, and I am delighted."
"As regards production, six major projects are currently under way, the two most important ones being situated in Ghent (biodiesel sector) and in Wanze (bioethanol sector)."
"What is more, the programme for tax exemption for biofuels, adopted by Belgium and approved by the European Commission, fixes, in the case of biodiesel, the ratio of the mixture with traditional diesel at 3.37% for 2006 and at 4.29% for 2007."
"For bioethanol, the mixture has been fixed at 7%."
"At this rate, we might even achieve the objective recommended in Directive 2003/30, namely that 5.75% of all fuel sold should be ‘green’ by 2010."
"To this end, the Parish report calls for these targets to be made compulsory."
"The utilisation for energy purposes of agricultural products, which is both a real opportunity for the future for our farmers and environmentally friendly, indeed deserves restrictive targets to be set, especially if they are reasonable."
". The rapporteur says, and we agree, that ‘the production of renewable raw materials and the use of organic waste can contribute to the improvement of the environment, the sustainable production of energy, employment and regional balance, while playing a role in rendering multifunctional agriculture more diverse and self-sufficient’."
"Nevertheless, we feel that attention should be drawn to existing capacities as regards alternative energy, and the existing relationship between energy, the environment and farming within the framework of sustainable development."
"This will ultimately benefit the citizens and their quality of life, as well as the economic sectors involved."
"We feel, however, that an appropriate balance must be struck between food crops and energy crops, so as to ensure that food sovereignty and safety are not put in jeopardy."
"The production of crops for non-food purposes is not protected by the CAP, given that aid is less than EUR 80 per hectare per year, and the rapporteur calls for steps to be taken to put an end to public aid."
"This measure would render such production dependent on the energy industry and the rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO)."
"Hence my abstention."
". I welcome in principle this report by my colleague Neil Parish on the promotion of crops for non-food purposes."
"While these techniques will not solve our energy problems, they can make a small but significant contribution."
"Fast-growing willows and poplars can be used, as I saw some years ago in Austria, to provide small-scale heat and electricity supply in remote, isolated areas."
"Oil-seed rape and wheat can be used in the production of biofuels whether diesel or petrol and save on CO2 release."
"Yet one warning: the schemes must be part of the solution, not the problem."
"Where they make economic, environmental and energy sense, I will support them, when they merely maintain agricultural expenditure at the expense of common sense, I will not."
"The report is just the European Parliament’s own take on the matter concerned and involves no legislative procedure."
"It looks towards further extending the existing common agricultural policy within the field of energy crops."
"There is a lot more to be said in the debate about energy crops."
"We have chosen to vote against the report."
". The report on the promotion of crops for non-food purposes is extremely timely given the rapidly declining reserve of fossil fuels."
"The cultivation of biomass, for example, can contribute efficiently in decreasing the greenhouse effect, which is primarily caused by CO2, by buffering the CO2 emission."
"I am in favour of the promotion of renewable energy through the production of crops."
"Several current technologies, such as energy derived from biomass, are economically viable and competitive and will, in turn, open up new markets for farmers in the European Union, thus stimulating economic, social and environmental growth."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 23 March 2006."
"The Conference of Presidents has asked me to inform the House that the ex-President of Liberia, Mr Charles Taylor, was captured on 29 March and extradited to Sierra Leone to face the Special Court for Sierra Leone."
"As you know, Taylor has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity."
"The accusations against him include responsibility for murder, rape, recruiting child soldiers and mutilation during the civil war in Sierra Leone."
"The European Parliament dealt with this case and, in its Resolution on the case of Charles Taylor, of 24 February 2005, and in its Resolution on Human Rights in the World, of 28 March 2005, called for Taylor to be brought before the Special Court."
"Having adopted these Resolutions, I believe that Parliament can now applaud this important victory in the fight against the impunity of war criminals."
"I would remind you that the new President of Liberia has been invited to speak to the House, and I hope that she can do so soon."
"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 30 March 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament proposes that the vote on the report by Mr Őry, scheduled for tomorrow, be moved to Wednesday."
"– Mr President, according to the original version of the order of business, the Őry report was put down for Wednesday, with the vote on it scheduled, accordingly, for the same day."
"The Conference of Presidents has now decided – as recently as last Thursday – to bring the report forward to Tuesday, with the consequence that our group has not had the chance to have a final debate on it today, since we assumed, when sending out invitations to our members, that the vote would be on Wednesday and so we could have our final debate on Tuesday."
"I would therefore be grateful if the House could agree on us debating it tomorrow, but waiting until Wednesday to vote on it."
". I see no objection to that, and I personally agree with it."
"Thank you very much."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament proposes that the vote on the reports by Monica Frassoni (A6-0089/2006), Bert Doorn (A6-0082/2006), Arlene McCarthy (A6-0083/2006) and Giuseppe Gargani (A6-0080/2006) be postponed until a later part-session."
"– Mr President, without, admittedly, having given you prior notice, I should like to say something more on the subject of ‘Better Lawmaking’."
"This is an important debate, and we agreed that it should be held this week, but it has turned out over the last couple of hours that there are still a few issues to be resolved as regards the vote."
"It has been agreed with the authors, at any rate, that the vote on all four reports on better lawmaking should be held during the next part-session rather than this week."
"I do not know whether we can go straight ahead and vote now if there is a consensus, but I did, in any case, want to say today that there is a strong movement in favour of debating the reports on better lawmaking this week, while not yet voting on them."
"If I have understood correctly, your request is that the debate be held as scheduled, but that there be no vote on it."
"– Mr President, I would like to confirm that that is the general opinion and say, on behalf of my group, that we are in favour."
"At the moment we are talking about tendencies."
"Can we vote on tendencies?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not a trend of the major coalition, but we too agree that the vote should be postponed, for a very simple reason: we believe that the mutual relationship, so to speak, between these reports has not yet fully developed."
"Therefore, we most certainly need to debate them and we will vote in May, if that is what the House decides."
"I shall take the view that this tendency can be interpreted as a concrete proposal that the vote not take place during this part-session."
"The Council has added to the title of the last of the statements that it will make during the afternoon as follows: ‘Measures to enhance road safety (SAFETY) and security measures in the transport sector, including the financing thereof (SECURITY)’."
"– Mr President, I would ask the services to point out to the President-in-Office of the Council that he should focus on the original definition of security, namely that of fighting terrorism, rather than only addressing the security of transport, since it is to be feared that only the second issue is going to be dealt with."
"The Commission takes good note of what Mr Swoboda has just said, of course."
"Security against terrorism and road safety are two very different matters, but the Council is not here to take note of your observation."
"I shall pass it on."
"It would be good not just to talk about road safety, if the intention of the request was also to deal with the issue of security against terrorism."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left proposes that a Commission statement on the situation in South-East Turkey be added as the first item on Thursday's agenda, ending with a vote on a resolution."
"Mr President, my group has called for a statement from the Commission followed by a debate."
"We were, I might add, also in favour of submitting a resolution, but I believe that several groups do not want one."
"Why are we insisting, however, that there be at the very least a statement from the Commission followed by a debate?"
"We are insisting because, for some days now, tanks have been sent to this region, Turkish Kurdistan."
"There are a great many victims, including children."
"The repression is extremely violent."
"This is a country that is in the process of negotiating its accession to the European Union."
"I therefore believe that this extremely serious breach of commitments made by the country in question is of direct concern to the Commission."
"That is why we want a statement and a debate to be included on Thursday’s agenda, and, if possible, as the first agenda item in the morning."
"– Mr President, although we can agree to the motion for a debate following a statement by the Commission, we do not want to frame a resolution right now; instead, we would like this issue, if at all possible, to be one of those addressed in the forthcoming report by Mr Eurlings."
"I would just like to move that we should either slot it in at 3 p.m. on Thursday or begin earlier on Thursday, or else we will have even more problems with the voting on the two reports scheduled for that day, in that we will again be in the same situation of having to defer the vote, and all the rest of it, so we can either begin earlier on Thursday, or deal with this at 3 p.m. in order to have a proper vote on both reports."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, I fear that there is one aspect of the decision we have taken that has not been made clear."
"We have decided to begin the sitting at three and to deal with the issue of South-East Turkey, but it is not clear – in my view – whether or not this debate will end with a vote on a resolution."
"– Mr President, after consulting the various groups, and in order to keep in line with them, we have decided that it is better to withdraw the request to submit a resolution."
"We were initially in favour of submitting a resolution, but we have decided not to put it to the vote following the consultations we have had."
"I am delighted that that has been cleared up."
"There will therefore be a debate, but it will not be followed by a vote on a resolution."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats also proposes that the title of the debate ‘The situation of prisons in Iraq’ be changed to ‘The Assyrian community in Iraq and the situation of prisons in Iraq’."
"– Mr President, according to the original title, we were to have been debating the Assyrian community in Iraq, but then the Conference of Presidents changed the title to ‘the prisoners in Iraq’."
"We have nothing against discussing the situation of the prisoners in Iraq, but we do think it a matter of urgency that something be said about the Assyrian community, and so I would ask that we agree that this debate is to be about the Assyrian community and the prisoners in Iraq."
"If my memory serves me right, this was the wording that was agreed by the Conference of Presidents."
"It does not appear on the agenda like that and we will have to decide whether we are keeping it or changing it, as requested by Mr Poettering."
"Mr President, as Mr Poettering said a moment ago, there was some confusion as to the precise title and the way it was fleshed out."
"We go along with Mr Poettering’s suggestion to give equal weight to both issues, namely the role of the Assyrian minority and the situation in Iraq’s prisons."
"The title should be totally unambiguous."
"If, therefore, we discuss a change, or a proposal for a change, along the lines of ‘The situation in Iraq: the prisons and the situation of the Assyrian minority’, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe can certainly lend its support to it."
"Mr Poettering’s proposal is specifically ‘The Assyrian community in Iraq and the situation of prisons in Iraq’, the two things."
"(1)"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Many speakers are listed and, once again, I must warn you that, unless you all conform strictly to the speaking time of one minute, it will not be possible for everybody who has asked to speak to do so, particularly if there are further requests for the floor during the sitting, as is always the case."
"Mr President, I wished to draw the European Parliament’s attention to the serious project undertaken by the French Government, which consists of introducing a ‘first job contract’."
"This is undoubtedly a serious threat to France’s social model, but I understood – and some of my fellow Members will speak on this subject – that threats of this kind exist in many countries in which casual work offering little security is the only solution offered to people, particularly young people, when they enter the world of work."
"From the perspective of the commitments made via the Lisbon Strategy, whereby our European Union seeks to be the most competitive area in the world at the same time as developing an original social model, it would seem highly appropriate to me that the European institutions call on France not to bring into question a point that was specifically upheld by the International Labour Office, namely that no redundancies should be made without a legitimate reason."
"Be that as it may, we can observe a great sense of anxiety among our young Europeans about their future, and it would seem important to me that we reaffirm our desire to fight against what is referred to as atypical work and job insecurity."
"As we all know, there has unfortunately been no change for the better in that country. On the contrary, the political situation continues to deteriorate and half of the rural population is surviving solely on international food aid."
"Parliament has consistently taken the position that no assistance from the EU should go to Zimbabwe other than through NGOs; it should not be in any way in the hands of government. I am therefore a little alarmed to hear that apparently the Commission is intending to release EUR 1 million in aid to Zimbabwe for so-called ‘parliamentary reform’, administered, admittedly, through the United Nations Development Programme."
"The United Nations Development Programme itself states that it is an ‘impartial and trusted partner with the Zimbabwean Government’."
"I hope the Commission can give us an explanation before it releases any aid and that it can also give us assurances on this matter."
"– Mr President, the disturbances in France cannot fail to move my generation, to which the famous First Employment Contract or, to put it differently, the 'disposable worker' model is addressed."
"Young Europeans, under the pressure of unemployment, may decide to participate in this experiment. In addition, the risk of a clash between the generations is inevitable."
"They will be squeezed out by young 'disposable workers', by shifting cheap and disciplined manpower. These coercive solutions being proposed by advocates of economic liberalism clearly undervalue the subject of history: the citizen, the worker, the person."
"The social movement is strengthening, rejecting and making claims. Unemployment can and must be combated, but not in an unruly manner, not by ignoring the needs of society and certainly not at the expense of a generation which is not to blame for the world it has inherited."
"(Mr President, some Western European printed media have recently taken to describing the Polish Government and its power base as nationalist. This type of content is scandalous and offensive to millions of Poles."
"It is this Government and its supporters that are grounded in the proud history of such events as World War II, when tens of thousands of Poles risked their lives to hide Jews and people of other nationalities, and when thousands of them paid for it with their lives."
"This so-called political correctness, which ruins freedom of speech in the European Union, defines all those who talk about patriotism, national traditions and the importance of Christianity for Europe as chauvinism, nationalism and perhaps before long as fascism."
"They regard as normal all behaviours contrary to nature and to the traditional values of Christian Europe, as well as those condoning insults to the feelings of Catholics and members of other faiths."
"Irrespective of what is promulgated by Western European press, Poland will remain faithful to its traditions and democratic values."
"The question of human rights is an integral part of the fabric of the foundations of the European Union."
"The latest Report of the US State Department on Human Rights Practices of 8 March 2006 also mentions a failure to comply with the decision of the Austrian Constitutional Court, which has been demanding for years that bilingual regional signs be posted in German and Slovene in the southern part of the Austrian province of Carinthia, which is home to a Slovene minority."
"On the very same day, however, Jörg Haider, Governor of Carinthia, instigated proceedings against District Governor August Muri for ‘abusing his public office’ by finally issuing an order for bilingual signs to be posted in Bleiburg/Pliberk."
"Two bilingual signs have also been placed on view in our Parliament building in Brussels."
"As you are well aware, Russia has issued an official proposal for breaches of the rights of the Slovene minority in Austria to be placed on the agenda of the EU–Russia Summit. I would be interested to know how the Commission will act to resolve this glaring example of a breach of the rights of the Slovene minority, at the very time when Austria holds the presidency of the European Union."
"– Mr President, we are shocked by the pictures and the news that have been reaching us since Monday of last week from many Kurdish towns, but mainly from Diyarbakir."
"The resemblance to the sort of pictures we get from Gaza or from West Jordan is astonishing."
"So far, 11 people have been killed by the Turkish security forces, the youngest of them being a three-year-old child."
"Hundreds of people have been injured, some of them severely, while hundreds have been imprisoned. This situation must be prevented from escalating further."
"Prime Minister Erdogan’s statements, to the effect, for example, that ‘Our security forces will take whatever action is necessary against all those who make themselves the instruments of terrorism, even if they are women or children’ do nothing to help achieve a peaceful resolution of the Kurdish problem."
"I ask the Commission, and you, Mr Borrell, to contact Mr Beydemir, the mayor of Diyarbakir, and I demand that an delegation be assembled and despatched to examine in detail what has happened in the affected areas."
"Mr President, I want to draw Members’ attention to a set of pan-European scams which target small businesses. The best known of these is the ‘European City Guide’ from Spain, but there are others: ‘Construct Data’ in Austria, ‘Novachannel’ and ‘Intercable Verlag’ in Switzerland, ‘Deutsche Addressdienst’ and ‘TVV Verlag’ in Germany."
"Recently a Swiss newspaper revealed that there is just one man – Meinolf Lüdenbach – behind most of these organisations."
"He also controls the debt companies that pursue victims once they have been duped into signing. His network amounts to a conspiracy to defraud small businesses in Europe."
"These scams hop from country to country, taking advantage of our divergent legal systems to escape justice."
"I am therefore delighted that Commissioner Kyprianou has agreed to look into this matter and I would urge all colleagues who have examples of these in their constituencies – and there are many of you, I know – to write to him with information so that he can complete his dossier."
"Mr Mavrommatis, your complaint is extremely reasonable."
"The only reason I can imagine for them taking so long to reply to you, just to tell you in the end that the Council has not dealt with the issue, is that they were waiting for the Council to deal with it, but even under those circumstances the time taken does not seem reasonable."
"I shall inform the Council and the Commission of the need to ensure that Members’ questions are answered in good time, as in your case, and properly, that is to say, not just that they are received within a reasonable time limit, but that they are proper replies with real content."
"I am sure that the appropriate authorities within the Council and the Commission will take good note of this request."
"Mr President, as you said just a moment ago, Charles Taylor, who is accused of war crimes, has been brought before the UN War Tribunal in Sierra Leone. As Chief Observer of the European Union's election observation mission in Liberia, I have urged the newly elected President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf to insist on extradition."
"Mr van den Berg, as I pointed out before, the President of Liberia will be invited and let us hope that she can come soon."
"Mr President, I wrote to you on 16 and 23 March of this year in my capacity as Chairman of the IND/DEM Group office, concerning the so-called reconstruction of the Independence and Democracy Group of which the Parliament authorities were informed by the Group’s leadership during the last plenary session."
"In the view of the Polish delegation, the procedure leading to the exclusion of two national delegations, the Italian and the Polish, from the IND/DEM Group was unlawful."
"May I ask when we can expect an answer to the above letters?"
"Mr President, it was exactly 1 500 days ago that Ingrid Betancourt and her colleague, Clara Rojas, were kidnapped by the FARC in Colombia, thus joining the excessively large group of 3 000 hostages, to say nothing of the thousands of missing persons in that country."
"I am speaking today on behalf of the International Federation of the Ingrid Betancourt Committees which, in collaboration with her family, has three requests. Firstly, actively to support the mediation efforts of the three countries consisting of France, Switzerland and Spain."
"Secondly, to put strong pressure on the FARC, via the organisations that support it overseas and especially in countries that have not included it on their list of terrorist organisations, so that it responds positively to the proposal submitted by the group of the three countries, thereby demonstrating its genuine desire to reach a humanitarian agreement."
"Thirdly and finally, to put strong pressure on the Colombian Government to comply with the Geneva Convention, which Colombia ratified."
"This Convention does indeed stipulate that, in the event of an internal conflict, the government is obliged – in line with the commitment it made previously - to conclude humanitarian agreements in order to save as many human lives as possible."
"Mr President, I should like to express my displeasure with the final declaration of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly that was held on 27 March. Whilst I can of course appreciate the importance of a dialogue between the north and south of the Mediterranean, I am not convinced that a dialogue of that kind serves any purpose if it results in a unilateral admission of guilt, in this case by Europe."
"First of all, the Danish cartoons are condemned with an obligatory brief sentence, or clause, about violence against those cartoons. Although people are quite specific about those Danish cartoons, anything else is deliberately kept very vague and very general."
"There is talk of promoting democracy, but there is no reference anywhere to the discrimination systematically meted out to Christians or other minority groups in the Muslim world. We certainly do not have to go as far as Afghanistan to find examples of this."
"All suggestions must be treated with respect. Are you suggesting that the European Parliament should investigate whether Italian politicians are agents of the KGB?"
"Is that your proposal?"
"I am suggesting it would be appropriate for Parliament to conduct such an investigation in view of Mr Prodi’s former position as President of the European Commission. It seems that the much-vaunted democratic credentials of this Parliament could be enhanced by such an investigation."
"I fear that we will not have time to carry out that investigation before the next Italian elections, but we can always do so afterwards, if Parliament considers it appropriate, of course."
"– Mr President, last week, in Diyarbakir in Turkey, four people lost their lives and approximately 500 more were injured when incidents broke out at the end of a funeral."
"All the victims were Kurds, while the perpetrators were the special forces of the Turkish police."
"A fortnight ago, the Turkish army started an operation to suppress the Kurdish workers' movement, during which another 14 people were killed."
"Turkey is obviously demonstrating with these actions that it intends to resolve this problem not through democratic process but through violence, with the survival of the fittest. We are therefore aiding and abetting the extermination of a people, while at the same time bringing Turkey into the European family."
"Such a policy is paradoxical and we should remind Turkey, as a candidate country, of what European democratic tradition means."
"Mr President, freedom of expression and peaceful demonstration is a fundamental part of the ."
"Unfortunately, in a large area bordering my home town of Limassol, this freedom of expression is not permitted, because the is not applicable there."
"That area has been under British military occupation since colonial times, and although it is part of Cyprus and is inhabited by Cypriot civilians, Britain made sure that it was left outside the EU. Therefore the European does not apply there."
"Within minutes he was attacked by British soldiers pointing submachine guns at him and threatening to shoot him. He was detained on a public road against his will at gunpoint until military police and the local press arrived."
"He was released when it was realised that he was a Member of Parliament – this Parliament! How long will this House tolerate having British troops occupying part of another Member State and subjecting its citizens to such harassment?"
"Mr President, I agree with my two fellow Members, who complained about the fact that Members’ questions are not answered in time."
"I believe that you are the guardian of our Rules of Procedure and I would ask that you make sure that the Commission responds to our questions in a timely fashion."
"The matter to which I am referring is that of Luxembourg’s cable distributors, who applied to the Commission in March 2005 and were sent from one Commissioner to another Commissioner who, in September 2005, gave them an answer that contradicted the one given in response to my parliamentary question three months too late."
"Mr President, if we want to legislate more effectively, then the Commission’s legal services need to function accordingly, and you need to ensure that our Rules of Procedure are applied in full."
"(A fortnight ago we saw the end of the bizarre Belarus elections, naturally won by Alexander Lukashenko."
"These elections were rigged by the use of force, of the Belarusian KGB, the police and the army."
"Mr President, what was the European Union’s and Parliament’s response to this situation? Many observers were arrested, as well as journalists and a Polish Member of Parliament."
"Whereas we have been concerning ourselves with elections in Liberia and various elections in exotic states, we did not even send an effective delegation of observers to Belarus."
"The European Parliament and the European Union must take up a very firm and decisive position on Belarus, so that we can finally overthrow the last bloody dictatorship in Europe."
"We have reached the end of the speeches. As you can see, the Presidency is trying hard to ensure that all of you can speak and nobody is left unable to do so."
"– What the Member who spoke before me, Mr Catania, omitted to say was that the complaint expressed most loudly and forcefully by the immigrants in the detention centres we visited related not to the conditions in the centres but to the fact that they had never intended coming to Malta."
"They ended up in Malta against their wishes, and they want to move on to continental Europe."
"This, moreover, is the tragedy. ‘Allow us to go to other countries in Europe,’ they told us one after the other."
"I therefore say that it is good that, through this debate and by means of this resolution, this Parliament is showing its solidarity with the immigrants as well as with the people of Malta, the Maltese authorities and the Maltese forces of order, which are doing a very difficult job."
"It is good that the political groups of this Parliament are showing that they are able to come together to demonstrate this solidarity and to ask both the Commission and the Council to take practical and urgent action."
"What is this practical and urgent action? Firstly, that Member States should accept persons in Malta requesting asylum."
"Secondly, that the Dublin II regulation be revised in such a way that the responsibilities of Member States are shared more fairly than they are at present when Malta, and other countries too, carry disproportionate burdens quite beyond their capabilities."
"Thirdly, that the financial resources of the European Union be used also in urgent cases, as the Commissioner himself rightly said they should be."
"There should, however, be an emergency clause in each of the four European funds that we shall have in the immigration sector as from next year, and not only in the fund for refugees."
"Finally, Mr President, I should like to ask the Commission what has become of the initiative, promised last year, of joint patrols in the Mediterranean. Mr President, Parliament is speaking."
"We shall expect the Council and the Commission to take action. Thank you."
"Mr President, I believe that the visits undertaken by the European Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs have the great merit of highlighting the fact that the imprisonment of foreigners has become, as it were, the standard way of managing migration issues and that this logic of imprisoning foreigners throughout Europe clearly demonstrates the limits of this development and its entirely unacceptable consequences - particularly in Malta - for the reasons that have already been pointed out in the debate."
"Unfortunately, we need to move on from this de facto observation, since it was already made by large international human rights organisation in 2004 and 2005. We are aware of the situation, and I believe that we must now simply acknowledge the absurdity of the Dublin Agreement being applied to Malta."
"Firstly, people arriving in Malta must be able to submit and formulate their asylum applications in the countries in which they wish to settle. Equally, people who obtain refugee status in Malta must be able to move freely in Europe, whether, I might add, that be in Malta or in any other country in which they first set foot."
"I believe that these reforms are entirely necessary if we want to emerge from these situations that are totally catastrophic from the point of view of human rights."
"Equally, the European Union must be able to establish a lawful policy on migration and stop giving absolute priority to repression and to the closure of borders, with a style of management that we now see to be inhuman and totally lacking in substance."
"This observation is borne out by the hundreds, indeed thousands, of people who each week drown not only in the Mediterranean Sea, but also in the waters surrounding the Canary Islands, since we know that the flows of migrants have now moved on to Mauritania."
"– The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs having sent a delegation to Malta to see for itself the situation facing illegal immigrants, I today note with satisfaction that Parliament is attaching due importance to the particular situation we have in Malta."
"Everyone present saw the difficult situation faced by all those who have come to our shores and who are staying in our centres. They also saw, however, the enormous efforts made by the Maltese Government to enable all those who arrive in Malta in an irregular manner to be treated well, despite very limited resources."
"It is clear that this situation has to change soon. We have all heard that the influx is expected to double this year, and so the problem will continue to get worse."
"Malta cannot perform miracles on its own. We have been trying for years to attract Europe’s attention to this problem so that the necessary solutions to it might be found."
"I am speaking not only about financial aid (of which, I must say, we have seen precious little) but about more practical solutions whereby the European Union, of which we are Members, might help us absorb the huge influx of immigrants to our country. We must duly respect the dignity of the detainees, but we can no longer go on stretching our resources and making efforts beyond our means."
"The situation before us is a critical one, and we have to find solutions whereby we no longer place Malta under undue pressure to take action and do not allow the situation to get out of control."
"We therefore need now to translate fine words and promises into action. The Commission, the Council of Ministers and Parliament should take action to put into effect, as soon as possible, the solutions already mentioned by the Members who have spoken before me in this debate."
"The Government and the people of Malta will continue to do their utmost, but we are right to expect everyone to make real and practical efforts because I think that, ultimately, this is not only Malta’s problem, but a problem for all the Member States of the European Union."
"– Commissioner, what you have said today has genuinely made me put away the speech I had prepared and address you directly as a representative of the Commission."
"I do not think you can expect us, the representatives of the Maltese people, to say thank you in this House because you are going to give us money or because you have given us as much money as we collect in one day for charity at Christmas."
"Your responses do not reflect what is really happening in our country."
"Secondly, you have evaded the most crucial question of all."
"We are presenting you with a practical proposal: that Dublin II be revised so that responsibility for processing the applications of people coming to Malta no longer lies with that country but is shared among other countries."
"What do you think about this proposal?"
"I ask this because, ultimately, it is not just any amount of money that we want (and, I repeat, ‘money’ not peanuts) but money to the tune of millions, substantial enough for providing a proper welcome to these fellow human beings of ours."
"Apart from money, however, what, in terms of real administrative and long-term help, do you think would solve this problem?"
"That is what we should like to know today."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Commissioner Kroes, who is responsible for these matters, for being present with us today, for it is she who is in charge of the sector inquiry which will show us where there are bottlenecks in the energy market and whether these occur naturally or by human volition."
"The second thing I want to say is that Commissioner Piebalgs is currently engaged in the review, the result of which will show us where action is needed. Recent legislation, particularly that applicable to unbundling, has brought the market entirely new opportunities."
"In view of the fact that 280 projects are being presented today – 19 of them in Austria – it will be necessary to appoint coordinators who will be able to deal with the various problems that can arise in such contexts in an interdisciplinary way."
"The coordinators might then form a body of their own, consulting among themselves and using best practice methods and benchmarking to achieve progress."
"Perhaps it might also be advisable to devise precise timetables – that is to say, determining not only costs but also dates – and, as we indeed do in other areas, changing priorities as appropriate when going over one deadline or another."
"The transfer stations, too, are relevant not only in terms of liberalisation, for there is also an ownership issue involved."
"Does ownership of them reside in the European Union or elsewhere, and are special agreements required?"
"That is an important situation in terms of foreign policy."
"Something else that needs to be considered is emergency systems: What happens in the event of emergencies or acts of terrorism or other events that cause major problems with energy?"
"This is where action will be urgently needed in the future. I would ask the Commissioner to have a Green Paper produced on this subject, so that, when disaster strikes, the necessary action can be taken throughout Europe and also by our neighbours."
"Mr President, that did not happen in Europe, but it could have done."
"Not only have we failed to learn any lessons from the power cuts in California in 2000, but you are creating conditions that will result in Europe also experiencing a large-scale energy disaster."
"Separating the transport network from electrical energy production units is an economic, ecological and industrial aberration. Once again, the European institutions are taking the side of financial interests to the detriment of the general interest."
"Satisfying shareholders’ interests means sacrificing research, sustainable development and security. The decision to artificially create a large internal energy market will also lead to a large number of jobs being axed and many others being put in jeopardy."
"Our Union needs a strong European public arm, funded by the public in order to fulfil the needs of Europeans."
"Mr President, when we debate competition policy, there is something that there is good reason for emphasising, namely the fact that European prosperity, European businesses and European jobs have been boosted by competition. The ability to launch new companies and to mount a challenge to old, existing companies is what has created European well-being and prosperity."
"It is therefore perfectly legitimate and extremely important to defend competition policy against all those forces that, in various ways, wish to introduce protectionism. As is also apparent from the report we are debating, there are a couple of tasks in this connection in which the Commission has an especially important role."
"The first is to debate competition issues from the perspective of the internal market as a whole. That is a step we must take because, if we are to obtain global champions, we must also ensure that we are able to obtain large and energetic European companies that operate across borders and that can also be players on the global stage."
"This requires a new competition policy that is in various ways an advance on the old one."
"I think, then, that the Commission must act vigorously and be unswervingly loyal in implementing the Treaty."
"By that, I mean that it must take vigorous action in respect of those sections of the internal market in which Member States do not comply with what is required of them."
"This applies to issues in relation to telecommunications, in which we have seen how the industry has prospered as a result of the deregulation of competition, and it is important that all sectors of the economy benefit in the same way."
"Energy issues are another case in point, and I welcome the fact that, from what I have understood from the media, the Commission will act vigorously to bring about an internal market and to combat the protectionism we see today when it comes to various company mergers."
"The last task is the one also discussed by Mr Evans, namely that of ensuring that we obtain a transatlantic competition policy that is reciprocal and that invigorates the whole of the transatlantic economy."
"In saying that, I also wish to emphasise that it is competition and competition policy that are the strongest forces behind European integration today, weaving our economies together and giving us new jobs."
"Things are moving in the right direction and I should like to congratulate the whole team of DG Competition and the Commissioner, who is continuing Mr Monti’s work very well. We are living in a mood of economic nationalism right now, and being the Competition Commissioner is not necessarily the easiest job in town."
"My second point – and one that Mr Hökmark made as well – is that it is very important to take a broad approach."
"To my mind, competition and the internal market are married; they go hand in hand."
"Commissioner Kroes takes care of the competition part and Commissioner McCreevy takes care of the internal market side."
"If today we were to define the four freedoms, I do not think, unfortunately, in the mood we are in, that we would get them. Therefore, keep the four freedoms in mind; they are under attack, much like competition policy in general."
"That brings me to my final point about the four key areas dealt with in the report itself. The first is mergers: keep on fighting against the type of protectionist behaviour that you see, for example, from the Spanish Government in the Endesa case or from the Polish Government in the banking sector."
"Secondly, on state aid: continue your vigorous control, kill all the national champions you can – they are bad for consumers and taxpayers."
"Finally, on Article 82 on dominant positions: there is a sufficiently high profile case."
"One can perhaps see both sides, but it is important to keep at it and, much like Mr Evans said, if we want a transatlantic market, let us keep it and let us watch out for American protectionism in the meantime."
"Mr President, I warmly congratulate Mr Hammerstein and the Commissioner on their efforts finally to democratise the meetings of the Council, to open up the doors of meetings in which legislation is passed without the citizens being provided with all the necessary information."
"I must point out that, in my country, Spain, which voted in favour of the European Constitution, that was one of the arguments most accepted by the citizens: the possibility of democratising the meetings of the Council and assessing all of that information."
"I therefore support the rapporteur’s proposals, particularly with regard to the publication of all of this information, including everything relating to successive presidencies, on the Internet and in all of the official languages of the Community, preventing any restriction of communication."
"There is little point in publishing all of the information, in opening up those doors, but just in two or three languages, as it appears certain institutions are currently suggesting."
"Transparency also requires that what is communicated is understood, that it is understood by all of the citizens. We must therefore urge all of the institutions that are in favour of the democratic transparency of the Council to do everything within their capacity to guarantee that transparency in all languages."
"Mr President, a lively, public, political debate on concrete issues is the basis for creating a European political space."
"By having one of our law-making institutions meeting and deciding issues in private, behind closed doors, we are denying the creation and the birth of that political space."
"I do not underestimate the problems of communicating such a debate to a population of 450 million with over two dozen languages, but we do have the technology today: we have satellite TV, radio, webcasting, a vast range of communication tools which we can use, and I do not believe that cost should be used as an excuse, because the cost of not doing it, the cost of not having an open, public, lively debate in Europe is the failure to create a future for Europe."
"On 22 April the Competition Council will be meeting behind closed doors to decide on the future of the Services Directive, a directive in which millions of European citizens have taken an active role and active interest."
"That debate should be in public."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ultimately the debate on the openness of meetings of the Council is a debate on democracy. I cannot but agree wholeheartedly with the recommendations by the Ombudsman and the proposals by Mr Hammerstein Mintz or my friend Michael Cashman."
"The lack of information for voters on the positions defended by the representatives of their governments at European Union level is creating a grey area as to who is responsible for the decisions relating to their daily lives."
"Governments find it convenient to blame the Union for decisions which are not in their interests and to claim the merit for decisions which benefit their country."
"Democracy, however, requires knowledge, judgment and reaction."
"The lack of knowledge about the positions of governments in the Council also deprives national parliaments of the facility to control the governments of their states on European issues."
"Ultimately, the question of the transparency of the Council brings us to the fundamental question of whether or not we want a European public opinion, a public opinion capable of expressing its satisfaction and its displeasure, capable of sending a message to the European institutions and capable of forcing the Council, as the rapporteur rightly notes, into the collective responsibility of its ministers."
"This can indeed be the course of European unification."
"We have already come a long way in opening the Council to the light of day, but we must go still further and I therefore welcome the thrust of this report."
"The Council used to deliberate all the time behind closed doors, with no right of public access to documents, and did not even publish the results of its votes, thereby making it impossible for national parliaments to see how the ministers representing their country voted."
"Over the last few years, that has changed significantly, thanks to pressure from the European Parliament."
"Now, the Council at least publishes the results of votes, grants access to most documents and, thanks to the initiative of the UK Presidency last year, deliberates on codecision legislation in public."
"It is now time to go further and to establish the principle that all the legislative activity of the Council should be in public, as it already is for the other chamber of the EU’s legislature, the Parliament."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by extending the warmest of thanks to my colleague Mr Papastamkos for his report and for the clear and explicit views on what sort of result we would like to see emerge from the WTO."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, too, would like to see a successful conclusion to the Doha Round – but not at any price. It is not acceptable that the few should get all the benefit while many others are left behind."
"I welcome the report’s insistence on the necessity of a fundamental reform of the WTO. It is not enough for the WTO to be given the main objective of extending trade."
"Environmental standards, consumer protection standards, animal welfare standards and social minimum standards must also be laid down as goals for the WTO. It is not acceptable that the ultimate winners from the WTO negotiations should be those who plunder nature and exploit people."
"It is unfair that European farmers engaged in food production should be required to comply with one requirement after another, while such requirements do not apply to imports."
"Helmut Kohl, the former German Federal Chancellor, once said that he would like to see apply to food imports what already applied in the case of the motor industry, with cars from Japan, the USA, and Korea being allowed to be imported into Germany, but allowed to be driven on the roads only if they comply with the high technical standards that are imposed here. If foodstuffs meet the same high standards as we European farmers do, then we need have no fear of global competition."
"We are perfectly happy to face up to this competition once we have an outcome with many, rather than the few, sharing in growing prosperity."
". Mr President, when all else was gone and Jack sold the last cow from what had once been his family’s thriving farm, he at least got a handful of beans."
"In the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference Commissioner Mandelson made significant concessions on European agriculture in exchange for, I suppose, the hope of concessions in non-agricultural market access from the other big economic powers but, as we know, they did not concede much."
"In the exchange of agriculture for services, Irish sugar beet farmers have lost their crop, and we have now lost the last of our sugar factories, in Mallow, in my own constituency, which closed just two weeks ago."
"Irish farmers are worried that beef and dairy will be sacrificed next, in an effort to get trade concessions in services."
"Commissioner, when Mr Mandelson trades off the last Irish cow, what do you expect we will get?"
"So far I cannot see that we have obtained very much."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are a number of points I would like to make. Firstly, of course, I have to thank Mr Papastamkos, but I would like to include in that expression of gratitude Mr Moreno Sánchez, a member of my own group and its shadow rapporteur."
"Both of them, along with all the other Members who have acted as shadow coordinators, have done excellent work in achieving – to some extent jointly – a good compromise and a credible report."
"I have a couple of important points to make, which relate to the aspects that you, Commissioner, addressed."
"We find ourselves in a very tricky situation. London was not a success, Rio was not a success, and next comes Geneva."
"Are you ready and able to say something about the prospects for these negotiations?"
"Will Geneva happen?"
"How will it work out?"
"A second point that we have raised with the Commissioner several times already is whether the Commission will, this time, be willing to acknowledge, in the final statement, the role of parliaments."
"There is recognition already for civil society, but the role of parliaments is still passed over in silence."
"Only if it is mentioned will it be possible to give better guarantees, in future, of the parliaments’ involvement and of their ability to exercise a monitoring function."
"Yesterday during the one-minute speeches, certain Members referred to the situation of a political group and I said that I would be able to respond to your concern today."
"I can inform you that I have received a letter from Mr Bonde and Mr Farage, co-chairmen of the Independence and Democracy Group, in which they ask me to withdraw the Presidency’s announcement of 15 March on the restructuring of that political group."
"Accordingly, in response to the request of the co-chairmen of that Group, that statement from the Presidency is withdrawn and declared null and void and the composition of the Independence and Democracy Group remains exactly as it was before 15 March 2006."
"On the basis of this composition, which remains the same as before the Presidency’s statement, the leadership of the group will schedule the meetings it considers appropriate in order to continue working within that group."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am actually speaking here on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, of which I am the chairman, to inform you that, yesterday evening, a large majority, 14 votes to 9, of the committee voted against the Council request for urgent procedure on the proposal tabled by our colleague Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna on the regulation on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco."
"This is because, were we to agree to this request, it would amount to signing a blank document regarding this agreement, at a time when the discussions within our committee are far from complete, as shown by the liveliness of yesterday's debates, and at a time when the Committee on Development, which has a particular interest in this type of agreement, has not yet issued its opinion."
"We are, of course, aware of the importance of this agreement both for the Moroccan Government and for European fishermen themselves."
"That is why we propose to deal with this matter under an accelerated procedure that will allow us, following further discussions at the next meeting of the committee on 18 and 19 April, to vote on the report in committee on 2 May, and thus to submit it to Parliament during the following plenary session in May."
"As far as we are aware, the initial payments should not be made until the end of June."
"We therefore do not think that this final period of reflection, which we consider to be necessary within Parliament, will cause any major difficulties."
"– Mr President, I am in favour of this being treated as an urgent matter."
"It really is necessary for the Spanish fishermen, and in their interests, that they should be able to fish with effect from the beginning of the season on 1 May."
"They have for years now had no opportunity to go about their fishing business, and a delay would not essentially change anything whatever about the current ratification process or the content of the treaties."
"Mr President, my political group is opposed to the Council’s request to apply the urgent procedure until Parliament is provided with the information that is essential in order to guarantee that this fisheries agreement is the appropriate legal framework for the Community fleet to be able to carry out its fishing activities normally."
". Mr President, I am speaking pursuant to Rule 134(3), as rapporteur for this report, to inform the House that the rapporteur is against the urgent procedure."
"I am against because, this being such a delicate issue, which has not been entirely concluded, involving an agreement which is still subject to substantial alterations by both sides, we cannot deny the competent committee, the Committee on Fisheries, its rightful report, debate and vote."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we do not want any shocks in the application of this agreement in the future, as has happened in the past."
"We want to provide the fisheries sector with guarantees of legal certainty, that what has been agreed will be fully implemented and that this agreement is viable."
"The Committee on Development has already given its opinion and we shall take its report into account."
"The Committee on Fisheries has not done so yet."
"With the compromise that I proposed yesterday to the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, which that committee has approved, my intention is not to delay the report but to speed it up so that it may be available in this House in May and so that we can conclude this issue under ideal conditions, since the first deadline for the first financial compensation ends on 30 June."
"We shall be on time and, in light of what Mr Kindermann has said, I would point out that for many of the species that are included in the agreement a biological rest period begins this month and next month, and they will not therefore be affected."
"For these reasons, we are asking that our committee work during the remaining time so that we can bring a report from the competent committee to the House."
"This is why we are rejecting the urgent procedure today."
"(1)"
". Mr President, yesterday the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development unanimously agreed to support the Commission request for urgent procedure on exceptional market support measures for eggs and poultry."
"In view of the major crisis currently facing the avian sector in a number of Member States, we think it is vital to reach a decision quickly, and, by adopting urgent procedure, the European Parliament will be in a position to express an opinion on the Commission's proposal."
"It will thus demonstrate that it is able to react quickly to respond to the expectations of the citizens."
"The Commission submitted the request for urgent procedure at the end of last week, and we will respond on Thursday."
"I think that this is a good example for our citizens in terms of our response to a major crisis."
"(2)"
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"- the report by Magda Kósáné Kovács, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on guidelines for the Employment Policies of the Member States [COM(2006)0032 C6-0047/2006 2006/0010(CNS)] (A6-0086/2006), and"
"- the report by José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the situation of the European economy: preparatory report on the broad economic policy guidelines for 2006 [2006/2047(INI)] (A6-0077/2006)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the heart of the new growth and employment policy with which we seek to move the Lisbon agenda forward, are the integrated economic guidelines; they are integrated because they reflect the recognition that we cannot satisfactorily perform the task of bringing Europe more growth and more jobs if we fail to make the close connection between macro-economic, micro-economic and employment goals."
"The economic guidelines form the framework within which the Member States and the Community institutions put together their respective plans for the implementation of the strategy for growth and jobs."
"It was during the past year that the Commission first presented them, and I am grateful to your House for giving them such close attention, for they will be a guide – not only during this year but also thereafter – to what we are considering doing and to the basis on which we will be doing it."
"The fact is that the growth and employment strategy, which we have been trying to implement for something like a year, is a completely new kind of process."
"It is not yet altogether straightforward to pass final judgment on the elements of this new process, but one thing can be said today, albeit with a great deal of caution, and that is that the Member States have in their national reform programmes, basically allowed themselves to be guided by the priorities set out in the integrated economic guidelines, as has the Commission with its proposal for a Community action programme."
"It is important that I should point out that the growth and employment strategy is based on a three-year cycle."
"What that means is that there is no intention that the guidelines should be amended from one year to another."
"They may well, though, be adapted to take account of changed realities and the insights that we gain from experience, and that will, of course be necessary, but we do not, at present, see any reason why these guidelines should be amended for 2006; they are still a sound basis for the dialogues in which the Commission is currently engaged with the Member States, the object of which is to get the national reform programmes actually up and running."
"As for the individual pillars of this strategy, my fellow-Commissioners Mr Almunia and Mr Špidla will have something more to say about its macro-economic and employment aspects."
"I would like, briefly, to discuss its micro-economic dimension and highlight the significant advances that have been made in this respect in some areas, particularly as regards the key issue for Europe’s economic future, namely the transition to a knowledge-based society and its becoming an economy founded on innovation, research and development."
"It was for that reason that we were so insistent on imposing quantitative targets for research and development."
"You will be aware that this was an area in which the national reform programmes produced rather disappointing results, for they would, on average, have brought us up to 2.2% by 2010 instead of the desired 3%."
"In the few weeks this year in which we have been able to address this issue, we have, however, been able to get the Member States to commit significantly more."
"If they stick to them, we will be able to achieve 2.6% by 2010, which is an improvement, but – and I have to make this clear – it is not enough, and so the Commission will continue to bring pressure to bear on them."
"The European Council, held the week before last and which you will be discussing tomorrow, also discussed, and came to conclusions on, important aspects of the strategy’s implementation;"
"I would refer you in particular to the Council resolutions on the promotion of small and medium-sized businesses, on improving the lawmaking process and on energy policy."
"From time to time, the question is discussed – in connection with the guidelines – of whether the Commission, when assessing the national reform plans in future, should or should not hand down recommendations specific to the countries in question."
"We refrained from doing so in the first round for a reason that we regarded as important, namely the fact that we did not know what the national reform programmes would look like, but I would like to point out that the Commission does, self-evidently, retain the option of including country-specific recommendations in future progress reports and that this is an option of which we will avail ourselves as and when necessary."
"At present, though, it strikes me that the most important thing is that we should all work together on making the broader European public aware of the fact that we do actually have a common strategy for growth and job creation, of the priorities that we share, and of the fact that we are working together to deliver on them."
". Mr President, I agree with the assessment that Vice-President Verheugen has just made on the way in which we are implementing the revised Lisbon Strategy that we implemented last year."
"On reading Mr García-Margallo’s report on the European economy and the broad economic policy guidelines, I note a considerable degree of agreement, and we also noted this agreement within the Commission, with the same objectives and the same process towards achieving them, at the last European Council."
"I believe that this fundamental agreement amongst the three European institutions is crucial to the credibility of the process, the acceptance of the objectives of this strategy by all economic and social actors, and not just the European and national institutions, and is one of the conditions – which I believe to be essential – for achieving greater growth and employment in the European Union."
"With regard to macroeconomic issues, I would like to refer to three points."
"Firstly, it is clear that, as we have said on many occasions, and I believe that we agree with Parliament’s opinion, it was important to achieve greater synchronisation amongst the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, in order to achieve more growth and more employment, and the application of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Over the last year, this has been achieved."
"There is more coordination and a better relationship between them and I believe that we are achieving very positive results in practice."
"The European economy is making better progress today towards fiscal consolidation than it was a year ago, as one of the necessary conditions for more solid growth and growth that is capable of generating employment."
"The confidence of the economic actors is improving, the results of activity suggest that 2006 is going to offer better results than in 2005 and the perspectives opening up for the future are also positive."
"Secondly, I entirely agree with what Mr García-Margallo’s report says with regard to the importance of paying more attention to the sustainability of public finances and, in particular, with regard to how to deal with the consequences of the ageing of the population."
"A few weeks ago, the Commission and the Economic Policy Committee, which is made up of all of the Member States, published a report on the economic and budgetary consequences of the ageing of the population."
"These consequences are significant, but that report also notes that, by acting on time and carrying out reforms, such as those included in many national Lisbon Strategy programmes and those which the different Member States are promoting by means of their initiatives, in particular Commissioner Špidla’s initiatives in the demographic field, results can be seen, and there are now European countries that are in a better position today than five years ago to deal with the consequences of the ageing of the population."
"In October, the Commission is going to publish a report on this issue, which I hope will also be debated and monitored in Parliament."
"A final point. I am very pleased that, as well as a general analysis of the European economy and of the role of the Lisbon Strategy and of the different instruments included in the broad economic policy guidelines for the economy of twenty-five, Mr García-Margallo’s report makes a particular reference to the challenges and needs of the eurozone, in which the twelve countries that share the single currency, the euro, need mechanisms for coordination and special attention in order to obtain the best possible results from the economic and monetary union."
"We would like to thank Mr García-Margallo for pointing this out in this report."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Kósáné Kovács, on behalf of the Commission for the excellent report that has been presented by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"This report is constructive in two ways: it adds to the underlying body of knowledge and it ought to speed up adoption by the Council, in comparison with previous years."
"At the spring session of the European Council it was stated that the Union would be capable of creating 2 million jobs per year."
"Yet job creation and cuts in unemployment will not happen unless we take advantage of the current economic growth to continue with the necessary reforms."
"The session provided confirmation that the integrated guidelines remain valid, at the same time setting out which priorities would be attracting greater emphasis."
"I am delighted that the parliamentary committee is advocating a similar approach and that it has not agreed to any excessive changes to the underlying principles of employment policy."
"We are amenable to changes in the points of justification, but by the same token we want to stick with the original wording of the text itself."
"Last year the Lisbon Strategy was redefined in respect of the integrated set of basic principles behind employment policy and the guidelines for economic policy."
"The Strategy has a tri-annual nature, in the interests of creating a clear and stable political framework for the bodies entrusted with its implementation."
"A study carried out by the Commission into the first of the national reform programmes has uncovered specific shortcomings in respect of Member State implementation, although these do not undermine the validity of the basic principles."
"It would therefore be inappropriate to give the impression that we wish to change the direction or content of the policies at this point."
"The text proposed by the Commission deliberately left open the possibility of supplementing the points of justification with specific political priorities."
"It therefore clearly goes along with Parliament’s desire to include in the points of justification some elements of an economic and social nature which require particular attention, especially where they accord with the conclusions of the latest spring session of the European Council."
"The session placed an emphasis on the need to increase employment especially among young people, women, older people and people with health problems, legitimate migrants and minorities."
"In the case of young people there was confirmation of the goal of reducing by 10% the numbers of those not finishing school, and offering every young person employment, work experience or further education within six months of leaving school by 2007 and within four months by 2010, as set out in the current main principles."
"In the case of older workers the emphasis was on the need to introduce an integrated strategy based on quality jobs and specialist training."
"Concerning equal opportunities for men and women, the spring session of the European Council adopted the European Pact for Gender Equality, and the Council also adopted the Commission proposal to launch a wide-ranging debate which should lead to the adoption of common principles in the area of flexibility and security (‘flexsecurity’) by the end of 2007."
"The aim of this discussion with the Member States and social partners is to reduce the segmentation of the labour market and to strike the right balance between flexibility and security."
"I would also like to say how delighted I am that the Commission proposal to set up a European globalisation adjustment fund was favourably received at the spring summit."
"This bears witness to the desire to make more effective use of Community funds in support of European employment strategy, and in accordance with the wishes of the European Parliament."
". – European citizens do not like the political code words used by the experts."
"Unfortunately, the ‘Lisbon process’ is starting to become a code phrase too, even though it represents our common future."
"If the Member States of the Union are competitive, we will have more and better jobs."
"If more people find jobs, poverty will be reduced."
"Also, this would provide more resources for the reform of social systems, and to enable us to preserve our environment for our grandchildren."
"I would like to strongly emphasise that work that is not accompanied by and founded on social security cannot produce significant economic results."
"And if this is true, which it is, then we can welcome the decision of the Council and Commission, that Member States should assess the implementation of the Directives on employment and economic development in integrated Directives, evaluating the two issues in connection with one another."
"We can see that the picture has become richer, especially through the fact that the European Commission has now assessed the action plans of 25 Member States."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has acknowledged and accepted that on the basis of the Interinstitutional Agreements, Parliament will not change the guidelines annually – and I believe that this will also serve the interests of the Member States – and it will only change them in the event of any problems arising on the employment market of the European Union."
"At the same time, in the specifications of political aims – contained in the preamble – we considered it important to include in the parliamentary document the lessons learned from the first report prepared after the ten new Member States joined the European Union."
"The committee agreed, almost unanimously, that Parliament should participate more actively in the verification of the implementation of the guidelines."
"In this respect, we will contact the competent Commission official."
"In my report I wished to complement the presentation of the Commission in respect of three important matters of principle; my colleagues, the members of the committee, have made a significant contribution to insure that these are presented clearly and comprehensively."
"Primarily, we emphatically call attention to the improvement of the labour market opportunities of social groups with various disadvantages."
"And, as mentioned by the Commissioners, this is also a precondition of further economic growth."
"A huge reserve for increasing labour resources is firstly to increase the activity of women, secondly, to maintain the ageing or aged workforce on the labour market or to encourage their return, and thirdly, to help young people find jobs and enter the labour market."
"However, we believe that the elimination of the disadvantages that keep away a part of the people from the labour market today is at least as important."
"We also call attention to the anomaly that workers coming from third countries may have a more favourable position on the European labour market than citizens of new Member States."
"We will have the opportunity to discuss this problem in connection with the ry report, but I would already like to say, on the basis of the news we have recently heard, that we welcome the Netherlands to the ‘club of the 6’ (as the seventh country, from 2007)."
"And finally, thirdly, we believe that without a long-term financial perspective it is not possible to provide adequate resources to Member States for the tasks that are specified as fundamental goals in the integrated guidelines either."
"Polite words are fashionable here, but this is not politeness or force of habit: I would like to say a sincere thank you to my colleagues – irrespective of their party affiliation – and to the representatives of the various political groups for their help and contribution, and separately to Ana Mato Adrover, the co-rapporteur of the report."
"There is hope that the phrase ‘unity through diversity’ will not be a slogan only, but also an opportunity."
". Mr President, Commissioners, the discussion of the broad economic policy guidelines has given us many headaches in previous years."
"In order to make sure the headache is not so severe this year, I shall restrict myself to three questions: why has Parliament decided to produce a report despite the fact that the Commission has chosen to ratify the previous reports?"
"What can we do to ensure that our reports are heard?"
"And thirdly, what is it that we want the Commission to hear?"
"Firstly, why a report?"
"Because previous reports contained masses of recommendations that the Commission has not taken into account."
"Secondly, because, since we discussed the previous report, new factors have arisen: the relative failure of the European Constitution, a new financial perspective, some first interest rate rises, three candidates seeking to join the eurozone, and the Doha Round, which continues the Hong Kong trade talks."
"Secondly, because there are certain factors that we have taken up in other reports, but which have become more important over time."
"Commissioner Almunia referred to the ageing of the population and we should also talk about the consequences of immigration, the consequences of Chinese imports, once the quantitative restrictions have come to an end, about world imbalances, essentially in relation to the United States, and finally the energy crisis."
"What can we do in order to be heard?"
"This report has been drawn up in a spirit of consensus, which has obliged many of us to give way on our particular points of view, and I would like in particular to thank all of the representatives of the other parliamentary groups for doing so."
"If we want to be heard, the first thing I must point out here is that previously we have not been heard."
"This report begins with a kind of catalogue of grievances, a list of recommendations that we have made and that the Commission has not taken up."
"We asked for a transposition of directives, which has not happened, a reduction of deficits — Commissioner Almunia has pointed out that 12 of the 25 Member States are currently in a situation of excessive deficit — a communication on globalisation in order to make clear to the public the opportunities and challenges it presents — and if this communication had been produced, it would have spared us a few headaches — and we also called for the application of the charters on small and medium-sized businesses, something which has not been done."
"Secondly, this report deals with what we might call institutional issues, whether of a constitutional nature or not."
"During this period of active reflection — which is neither a reflection nor active — we are dealing with those questions which were left over from the Convention and which have not been answered: what are the Union’s objectives and competences?"
"What are the responsibilities of the European Central Bank, while respecting its independence at all times?"
"What should we do in order to reinforce the Stability and Growth Pact?"
"What are the legal bases for modifying taxation in the Union and in the Member States?"
"There is one explicit recommendation that I would ask the Commission to take particular note of: this Parliament will not approve any directive by means of the Lamfalussy procedure if the problem of call-back is not resolved by 2008, ultimately the international representation of the eurozone."
"The Vice-President of the Commission has referred to coordinating the broad economic policy guidelines and the employment guidelines within a single document: it is true, but they are still subject to different information and consultation procedures which make them difficult to understand."
"Furthermore, it is necessary to incorporate other documents in order to ensure that it is not fragmentary."
"With regard to taxation in an institutional sense, we call upon the Commission to respond to what the High Court of Justice has said: a uniform definition of tax residence, as an extension of citizenship, the principle of non-discrimination and a convention on double taxation."
"With regard to coordination, I was pleased with Commissioner Almunia’s kind words: it is true that we have to coordinate more, we must make a precise diagnosis, draw up a correct cure, an analysis of what has happened and define the role of the Eurogroup."
"In the field of macroeconomic policy, we do not go into the issue of interest rates, we do not express our opinion."
"We do say that we have to do everything possible to ensure that prices do not rise and interest stays low."
"We refer to public debt, in terms used by the Commissioner: less interest, less repayments, means more spending on ageing, more Lisbon."
"With regard to the business climate, we call for serious reflection."
"The United States are ahead of us."
"144 of the world’s top companies are from the European Union, while in the case of the United States, that figure stands at 206."
"Small and medium-sized businesses double their employment in the first two years, something that does not happen in Europe."
"We are calling for positive discrimination to be applied in favour of small and medium-sized businesses, with particular reference to the funding of risk capital."
"In the field of taxation, to put it in simple terms, we ask that Home State Taxation be used for companies in application of the principle of place of origin with regard to VAT."
"I have nothing to say with regard to human capital."
"My colleague has expressed this very well."
"In the field of investment: trans-European networks."
"It would take twenty years to finish them."
"Energy, R+D+I, more market, more competition, more competitiveness."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by stressing the good work and wonderful cooperation of the rapporteur, Mrs Kósáné Kovács, and I would like to congratulate her on her efforts and the report she has presented."
"As we know, scarcely a year ago, the employment guidelines were approved, and it was my honour to be rapporteur on that occasion."
"Those guidelines established the general approach to employment and the priorities for the next three years, and their purpose was to make an effective contribution to employment growth, the productivity of the economy and, of course, strengthening social inclusion and cohesion."
"These guidelines, which were debated jointly with the economic policy guidelines, which this year have been presented brilliantly by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, have been taken up and translated into concrete objectives in the national reform plans, approved scarcely six months ago by the Member States."
"Both through common sense – they were approved scarcely a year ago and they are for three years – and as a result of the content of the guidelines themselves, we have simply updated them."
"Of what has this updating consisted?"
"Three broad areas."
"Firstly, we have taken up the priority issues that have been highlighted at the big European summits held this year: firstly, investment in research, development and innovation and the spread of information technologies, an aspect which is furthest from achieving the Lisbon objectives; secondly, genuine and effective equality of opportunities, which our group has always advocated, and which includes the incorporation of women, permanent positions for them and their promotion in the workplace and, of course, equal pay; and, thirdly, we strongly advocate stable employment, and I say this because the majority of work that is being created is precarious."
"In my country, for example, 52% of all work created over the last two years has been temporary work, and that is unacceptable."
"Secondly, we have repeated certain fundamental issues which have not been adequately dealt with by the Commission."
"In the fight against accidents in the workplace we advocated a broad agreement at European level, which we believe to be essential, since in Spain, for example, 990 people lost their lives in 2005, and also help for the victims of domestic violence in finding work."
"Finally, since we are now updating them, we want this Parliament to be able to monitor the employment guidelines and compliance with them by the Member States."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, Commissioner Almunia, Commissioner Špidla, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree that the European single market presents us with our great opportunity, a great opportunity for us, with our 450 million people or thereabouts, to find our own way through globalisation, a way that must be marked by economic prosperity and sound finances, while also producing results that are real to ordinary people."
"What we have to discuss – and this debate is fundamental to our doing so – is whether we have equipped ourselves with all the instruments we will need on this voyage, and whether we are making the right use of the instruments we have in order to give this internal market the right framework and influence the processes of economic development in the long term."
"Let me make two observations which go beyond today’s debate and these reports."
"We will not succeed in this objective if we do not succeed – and soon – in putting the European Union on an independent and accountable financial footing, nor will we succeed in it if we do not succeed in talking about taboo subjects, including the need for a common fiscal policy in this European Union of ours."
"The reason I say this is that, in the economic situation in which we find ourselves, there is no longer any justification for taboos of any kind."
"Anyone who brings fresh air into this debate has my backing, for, if we consider the economic situation, we simply cannot afford to carry on letting debates be ritualistic and keeping fresh air out of this House and out of our debates."
"In 2005, our economic development lagged behind what it had been in 2004; our unemployment rate is still alarmingly high at around nine per cent, and long-term unemployment in particular is again on the rise."
"I am very glad to hear Commissioner Almunia say – and he has my backing for saying it – that there are indications of the economy developing in the right direction, but I have to tell him that there is no guarantee that the European Union will be able to fuel its own recovery."
"That is why we have to talk about what needs to be put on the agenda."
"When will we in the European Union at last introduce a common investment policy?"
"That is the most urgent thing we have to do."
"When will we start investing, as a Community, in research and development?"
"In the last ten years, we have managed to increase that investment from 1.8% to 1.9%."
"When will we start on better and longer-term investment in education, with a coordinated strategy in the Member States?"
"When will we start making use of the great potential of energy efficiency?"
"That is where the key to the next technological revolution is to be found, so let us set to work!"
"Where, in this field, are the Member States investing money?"
"Where is Europe-wide discussion of it being guided?"
"Looking at the transport sector, we sometimes feel that we actually ought to rewrite Delors’ White Paper in view of the many transposition deficits in this area, and if we were to face up to them and invest more, we could make progress."
"Childcare is one of the core issues."
"If we invest more in childcare, we get higher birthrates and more people – women in particular – into the workplace; that much is demonstrated by statistics."
"We support all those who want to make advances in this area."
"I urge you, once and for all, to put cooperation with this House on a proper institutional footing, and then we will no longer need – and I thank Mr García-Margallo for pointing this out – to spend our time merely writing own-initiative reports, but discussions in this House will be on a different and stable basis."
". Some time ago scientists established that there is no miracle drug which can help create jobs, solve all employment problems and encourage competitiveness, but rather there is a multitude of factors and we must simply find a good combination of these."
"The problem is that this combination of factors differs from country to country and must take into account peculiarities of the national economy."
"On the evidence of the unsuccessful experience of the International Monetary Fund in attempting to create a single universal model, it is doubtful whether we should try to create an economic strategy model on a European scale."
"I believe that we must stress three basic points."
"First of all, we ought to agree with Mr Garcia-Margallo's view that we must consolidate all economic policy documents; there are too many of them and they are repetitive."
"Secondly, we must outline a mechanism of interaction between national and European level economic strategies."
"And thirdly, this can be achieved by determining clear and concrete priorities which complement each other."
"– Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Verheugen said that the right place for the employment policy guidelines is at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy, and in that he was right."
"The employment policy guidelines now not only serve as the formal basis for the national employment plans, but also make their influence felt on the shape and development of national labour markets, and so it is not a matter of indifference that the Council should simply walk off with the fourth pillar of the European employment policy, equality of opportunity for women in the labour market."
"Women are hit much harder by unemployment than are men; it is they, still, who do most of the part-time jobs."
"They still earn 15% less than men for comparable work, and they have fewer opportunities for promotion."
"They still find it much harder to get back into the labour market, especially where there is no universal, freely accessible and all-day childcare."
"Gender mainstreaming still needs to be backed up by pro-active measures to promote the interests of women, and so I really am very grateful to Mrs Kósáné Kovács for making it possible for us to agree on a compromise, at any rate in the recitals, in order to incorporate into the guidelines measurable indicators for the promotion of equality of opportunity."
"I would also like to draw your attention to a second amendment."
"We want Guideline No 22 to be deleted."
"We believe that wages should be determined by the parties to a collective agreement, and must be kept out of political resolutions."
"I cannot but note, to my considerable disquiet, that there seems to be in this House a tacit agreement between the two main groups to the effect that, in future, governmental policy decisions, in the shape of national employment plans, should ensure that overall wages trends be brought into line with the rise of productivity in the economic cycle."
"I had thought that the planned economy with which we were familiar in the former East Germany had been banished from Europe once and for all, until I realised that the guidelines determine the support to be given by the European Social Fund."
"It would be inconsistent for the ESF to determine wages; that is something that the two sides of industry are quite capable of doing, and should be left to them."
". – The bulk of the integrated guidelines for employment growth contain the main barriers to an effective employment policy that prioritises the creation of high-quality jobs with rights, social and territorial cohesion, and people’s well-being."
"This is, first of all, because priority is attached to ensuring economic stability, to enlarging and deepening the internal market, to opening up the markets and promoting competition, and to creating a more business-friendly environment. All of which is music to the ears of the large economic and financial groups, and to the overlords of international trade who, enjoying the fruits of exploiting cheap labour from third countries, prefer the enormous returns from relocating production to maintaining and developing jobs with rights in EU Member States."
"What is more, the guidelines for employment are much too vague, as they omit key areas, such as the need to increase female involvement in the labour market, and to ensure high-quality jobs with rights. This would help to combat the kind of salary- and career-related discrimination that women continue to fall victim to, and would not lead to the precarious, poorly-paid work that we see today."
"It is also crucial to boost regional economies, to promote micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and to create jobs in regions where there are high levels of unemployment."
"Families must also be supported, both in terms of rearranging and reducing working hours, without any loss of rights, and in terms of investing in public services to support the family, as this would help to create jobs better suited to local and regional needs."
"Greater public investment is therefore urgently required in health, housing and guaranteed access to free, high-quality education and training."
"We have therefore tabled a proposal to attach these guidelines to the proposals submitted, as we believe it is vital to include them in the guidelines for employment."
". Mr President, the broad economic policy guidelines are vital in providing a coherent framework for guiding Member States towards achieving the Lisbon Goals."
"The challenge for Ireland and Europe will be to implement the agreed guidelines via the national reform programmes."
"It is of utmost importance that Europe gains economic stability."
"However, I absolutely reject all sections of this report that call for support for the Commission’s common consolidated corporate tax base."
"The setting of a common base is intrinsically linked to a harmonised rate."
"Member States need to be realistic in recognising that the introduction of a common tax base is simply the thin edge of the wedge towards tax harmonisation."
"It is not the right of Ireland or any other Member State to play a role in setting the tax rate of another Member State."
"The unity of Europe is not compromised by diversity in tax policies, rather the EU’s competitiveness is undermined by the wrong tax policies."
"Competition can actually have a harmonising effect."
"I believe that tax competition harmonises opportunities within the EU and it enables small countries on the periphery of the Union to compete."
"Finally, overall I welcome the role of state aid in supporting the Lisbon objectives."
"However, I would like to stress that state aid rules should not be used to block Ireland or any other Member State from competing against non-EU countries for important foreign direct investment."
"Europe needs flexibility to move forward and meet the challenges of globalisation."
"Europe needs to reform its economies, and all countries should do that."
". Mr President, the report on employment policies is over-laden with key phrases, the tone for which is set very early on: legislation, EC monitors and enforcement."
"Then we have got the special importance of younger and older workers; then the EU without barriers – remove them, it says – with clear and measurable priorities; review the guidelines every three years, but Parliament must be more active between times; examine Member States’ national reform programmes."
"Well, let us do that."
"The French took a 35-hour working week, not a 48-hour week."
"But when the Working Time Directive was given flesh last year, many of their workers protested at EU interference."
"Port workers protested earlier this year at more EU interference."
"French cities are now under siege due to new youth employment policies."
"Who is going to tell Mr Chirac or Mr de Villepin that they are wrong, they are not conforming to guidelines?"
"Of course you will not."
"The French will govern themselves, as all of us should do, as grown-up democracies."
"But most sinister of all in this report is Guideline 19: continual review of incentives and disincentives resulting from the tax and benefits systems."
"Already a colleague has spoken this morning of a single fiscal policy."
"Is this the start of EU harmonisation of tax policy across the Union – something they said would never happen?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, your tax systems are under threat."
"You have been warned!"
"The reports under discussion today finally provide a clear picture of the gloomy state of the EU economy and correctly identify the causes thereof: poor regulation, a lack of structural and social reforms and a lack of flexibility within the economy."
"We also have insufficient entrepreneurial dynamism, weak labour markets, sluggish productivity growth, lack of investment, lack of innovation and bad systems of education."
"Here we are calling for the entrepreneurial spirit to be encouraged, for a reduction in labour costs and for improved standards of teaching in mathematics and natural sciences."
"The description is very succinct, but very hypocritical."
"This Parliament could take concrete steps towards productivity, flexibility and encouraging the entrepreneurial spirit, and really – not just formally – liberalising the services market, instead of surrendering in a cowardly manner to the demonstrators in the nearby area."
"I am afraid that today’s reports will come to nothing, as long as national governments behave in the same sort of populistic and hypocritical way as this Parliament, rather than confronting difficult truths and taking uncomfortable measures for survival."
"– Mr President, at a time when the phenomenon of globalisation has ultimately determined many of the aspects of the economic and social systems of all our countries, we must be aware that every obstacle to the freedom of movement of persons, goods, capital and services is a major obstacle to competitiveness, growth and job creation."
"The notion that the interests of a particular country can be protected by restricting freedom of movement within the EU is pie in the sky."
"This kind of attitude may work as a short term panacea but will never properly solve the challenges facing the EU."
"In order for Europe to gain a firmer foothold in an increasingly globalised world, it needs, first and foremost, to press ahead with liberalising the markets."
"As we know, the demographic situation on the European continent and the phenomenon of globalisation make it imperative that we carry out a range of reforms to the social and economic models of many EU Member States."
"The higher the economic growth in Europe, the easier it will be to carry out these reforms, but in order for that growth to emerge, the internal market must be functioning completely."
"While Europe grows at rates of 1, 2 or even 3%, it is very difficult to implement these reforms, which are so vital for peace and social stability in the EU."
"I therefore wish to highlight the fact that the completion of the internal market of course contains an economic component, but there is a further crucial element, and that is social policy."
"This is yet another reason why I support the Commission’s efforts thus far in this area."
"I should like to make one final remark about the free movement of workers."
"By putting up certain types of barrier to the free movement of workers, some Member States are actually in the preposterous situation of helping workers from third countries to gain access to jobs ahead of those from new EU Member States."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Kovács, for a very constructive piece of work."
"We in Parliament have, of course, come out in favour of the Guidelines being long-term three-year cycles and of their being integrated."
"Once suitably long-term, integrated Guidelines are in place, it is incredibly important for us to examine the National Reform Programmes."
"It is important for the Commission to do this, but it is also important for Parliament to be involved in examining and following up the National Reform Programmes."
"Commissioner Almunia said that the economic prospects are better now."
"That is true, but the employment situation in Europe is anything but encouraging."
"It is entirely possible that it can be improved, but allow me to discuss three areas that are extremely worrying."
"Firstly, there is the question of youth unemployment."
"This is of very great concern because, if young people leave education only to be immediately unemployed – and in the long term, at that – it is incredibly difficult to get them back into the labour market subsequently."
"I do not believe in the French model or believe, as a number of other parties expressly do, that employment is boosted by making one particular group or another less secure."
"Employment is stimulated through proactive industrial and labour market policies."
"Where the older labour force is concerned, we have the dilemma that people are leaving the EU labour market far too early nowadays."
"Older workers need to be able to develop their skills to a higher degree, but we also need to increase health and safety in workplaces."
"I turn, finally, to gender equality, which must permeate everything."
"I welcome the Gender Equality Pact which is now, or will in time be, part of the Lisbon process."
"It is especially important that child care and other areas be developed so that it is possible for men and women alike both to work and to have an up-and-running family life."
"These are aspects that I should like you to include."
"– Mr President, the European Union’s main problem is high unemployment."
"If we are to get our 20 million unemployed back to earning their own living, a change of policy is needed, and in practice rather than in theory."
"The guidelines constitute the main instrument for coordinating the economic policies of the Member States in the effective manner that is required, but, in practice, progress so far has been regrettably unsatisfactory."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe therefore calls for renewed efforts; what we expect to see from the Member States is sounder budget policies, real structural reforms on the labour market and in health and pensions, and markedly more investment in education and research."
"At the European level, we call for the creation of a single tax base for the taxation of businesses, improvements in the VAT systems, for the adoption of the 14th companies directive, which will make it easier for companies to put themselves on an international footing; for further reductions in subsidies, the introduction of a Community patent and the consistent opening-up of the markets."
"Only when we have put our houses in order in this way will we be able think about introducing EU-wide taxes, which is what Mr Bullmann is calling for."
"Only if there is real change in policy will Europe be able to face the great challenges in an effective way."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to Mrs Kovács for her report."
"The rapporteur has considered some fundamental issues relating to employment, which at the current time – a time of obsession over economic growth – are often overlooked, and these include the issues of equal opportunity for men and women, access to employment for young and old people, health and safety at work and freedom of movement for workers throughout the Union."
"On the basis of experience from the Czech Republic and conversations with colleagues, and also looking at the current situation in France, I know that the issue of first jobs for graduates, for example, is often one of the most challenging."
"Despite the fact that there have been efforts at a solution on the part of the European Commission, the recommendations and instruments of the European Commission have so far had little effect, due in part to patchy implementation by the Member States, as the rapporteur has stated."
"It is precisely this area that should be occupying most of our attention, together with age discrimination on the labour market."
"Equality of opportunity between men and women on the labour market is unquestionably an important issue."
"We know from the statistics that even though women constitute a growing segment of society, this trend is not reflected in their share of employment."
"What is more striking still is the proportion of women in leading positions."
"We must call on all Member States to apply anti-discrimination laws scrupulously and without delay, in order that this pattern may be reversed."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"First of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for having drawn attention in the report to restrictions on the free movement of labour within the European Union internal market."
"Unfortunately, the most recent enlargement of the European Union was perceived within the internal market as a threat, instead of a new opportunity."
"The mythical Polish plumber, who in real life would be welcome, but is difficult to find, clearly illustrates the fears which after enlargement now hold sway in the European Union internal market."
"We see a negative attitude towards all four market freedoms, and not just the free movement of labour."
"It is therefore a pity that the report provides no assessment of the draft Services Directive as watered down by this Parliament, which in the variant put forward by the Commission was supposed in the coming years to become the main stimulus for the labour market in the European Union."
"Similarly, the report did not assess the negative repercussions for employment of restrictions on the free movement of capital."
"These include those restrictions adopted by this Parliament at last month’s part-session in Strasbourg."
"I am referring to the report entitled ‘Restructuring and employment’ and particularly the report entitled ‘Relocation in the context of regional development’."
"The main of both reports is the creation of restrictions preventing businesses from freely relocating within the European Union internal market."
"This is a time of untapped opportunities for boosting the European Union labour market."
"The development and strengthening of the European Union’s internal market is the most effective tool in preparing the Member States’ labour market for increasing global competition."
"Therefore, we ought to look at the basic approach of the Member States’ employment policies in close connection with the goal of developing the potential of the European Union internal market."
"It was in 2003 that Mr García-Margallo y Marfil wrote his previous report on the economic guidelines and now, three years down the line, judging from the place which the environment occupies in economic policy, it seems that cooperation by means of the open-coordination method has failed to make the necessary impact."
"It was decided at the Stockholm Summit that the attempt should be made to incorporate environmental policy and social policy into the economic policy guidelines, with the aim of establishing a sustainable and social market economy in the European Union."
"Since, in my view, the environmental aspects of economic policy get a raw deal, I would call for the inclusion in the economic policy guidelines of clear and specific environmental objectives, in addition to references to the importance of the environment."
"There should also be targets with regard to energy consumption and CO2 emission reductions."
"Economic growth will need to go hand in hand with a responsible use of natural resources, and that is why I will support Mr Lipietz’s amendments."
"– Mr President, the task of those in this House, such as myself, who are both MEPs and authors, must surely be, in an avant-garde and constructive way, to use criticism as a way of waking up the great – who must, being thus awakened – respond to our criticisms in a practical way."
"I see that Mr Karas is next on the list to speak; well, Othmar, here comes an easy ball for you."
"The effect of what is happening now is that the EU mainstream rubs its eyes and says, ‘yes, we really do have a problem’, but I ask you to think forward to the move after this one."
"The Prognos study is an impressive demonstration of the fact that we will not, of course, achieve full employment in the next couple of decades."
"On the contrary, we will be moving towards what one of the journalists on the calls the ‘disposable American’, or, to put it in our terms, the ‘disposable European’."
"It is to that that we will have to find solutions."
"We have an enormous problem with the loss of the services that have provided jobs to replace the industrial jobs that are no longer there."
"This is where we need to move ahead, this is where we need approaches that are good for more than just today."
"Indeed so: one core issue, one potential starting point, is the reallocation of all these millions and billions that are still hidden away in the EU’s budget and being wasted on pointless things."
"I am thinking, for example, of the way in which the most-subsidised sector of agriculture in France is the production of rice."
"We also have a chance, in the current absence of a finalised Financial Perspective, to make more improvements here and of accomplishing even now what you will otherwise do only after another five or ten years, when it will, again, be almost too late."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Almunia, Commissioner Špidla, ladies and gentlemen, why do we need economic policy guidelines?"
"We need them because we do not have a common economic policy, and the reason why we do not have a common economic policy is that the instruments for a pro-active economic policy are in the hands of the Member States – research policy, fiscal policy, education policy, to name but three areas."
"Since our last report, conditions have in many respects become more acute."
"It is becoming more and more apparent to us that the European Union’s potential for growth is not being exploited to the full, that we are insufficiently prepared for demographic change, and that we have not yet made full use of the opportunities that globalisation is presenting to our continent."
"What the energy crisis and high unemployment show is that our problems are not only home-made, but that they also originate from structural and global causes, and that it is these that we must address in a pro-active manner."
"We want codecision for this European Parliament in all matters touching upon the single market, for in all of them we need more Europe in cooperation with the Member States than currently exists in reality."
"This report, therefore, constitutes our demand for the transposition of all the internal market directives, inconsistent implementation of which distorts competition and costs us growth and jobs."
"We demand budget consolidation measures on the part of the states with excessive deficits, for failure to repair our social security and pensions systems will bar us from participation in global competition."
"I would also like to urge that the SMEs’ Charter be implemented in full."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this meeting is obviously important, because the debate on the guidelines provides the means to implement the Lisbon Strategy."
"It is also the occasion for coordination of the economic policies of the Member States."
"Here in Parliament, we have supported integrating the employment policy guidelines into the broad economic policy guidelines."
"I think that, in terms of intellectual consistency, that was the right approach, provided that they do not lose substance, and in particular provided that the powers of this Parliament are also harmonised."
"I support the rapporteur's proposals in this respect."
"Against the background of the broad economic policy guidelines, we find ourselves faced with a paradox: while the Central Bank has just increased interest rates by a percentage point in quick succession, while rising oil prices are seriously compromising the conditions for economic recovery within the European Union, and while the conditions for the recovery of domestic demand are widely underestimated by various representatives at EU level, these broad guidelines are not shifting."
"It seems to us that, from this point of view, we need to do more together with regard to at least one point: I am referring to investment strategy."
"My group has tabled an amendment in this connection, which I hope will be adopted by plenary."
"It emphasises the need, if we are really going to implement the Lisbon Strategy, to draw up, at EU level, the investment plans that we need in order to support the policies that will enable us to confront the challenges facing us in terms of knowledge, training and employment."
"I should like to conclude by emphasising the issue of taxation, which underpins our entire economic system."
"I hope that the whole of the Commission, and the Council too, will echo this and will support Commissioner Kovács' efforts on this subject."
"–Changes in the world economy, globalisation processes and their effects on the competitiveness of economic blocs and companies in branches of state economies – these are new challenges for the European Union, which is increasingly losing its competitiveness, and is not ready for the challenges of globalisation."
"The EU is losing the competition war to the USA, China and India."
"The EU should prepare for the challenges of globalisation by reforming itself from within."
"We failed to adopt the Constitution, the financial perspective is deadlocked and less funds are being allocated to the trans-European Networks."
"Without a common energy policy, the supply of energy resources, which form the basis of an economy's competitiveness, is threatened, as is security."
"With the admission of the new candidates, Slovenia and Lithuania, the enlargement of the Euro zone would be one of the actions and decisions which would stimulate economic growth."
"I would like to mention two important factors for increasing the EU's competitiveness – investment in information and innovations and the accelerated creation of a common energy policy."
"These are inter-dependent factors – innovations allow leaders to emerge, while in this sector – energy, which determines competitiveness, innovations allow the creation of new sources of energy and the rational and economical use of existing ones."
"While negotiations on the financial perspective for the period 2007-2013 are still under way, we ought to reconsider the funding priorities and increase the funding of science, research and the trans-European Networks."
"On the subject of the competitiveness of the EU economy, I would like to mention one of the EU's most successful projects – the introduction of the common currency, the Euro, in 12 Member States."
"With the enlargement of the Euro zone approaching, we can also see certain shortcomings: the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact are not being adhered to, there is considerable state debt and at various stages almost all of the Euro zone members have failed to satisfy the price stability index."
"The experience of five years demonstrates the need to improve the Maastricht criteria themselves."
"However, fundamentally, the Euro zone was and still is a political project, which has shown its use and it must go on to a new stage of enlargement."
"Mr President, if we were asked to identify a key word relating to European employment policy, it would have to be flexibility."
"Employment law of this nature that is flexible regarding both the place of employment and the hours worked encourages women to be active in the labour market."
"For women, motherhood represents an enormous challenge in their working lives."
"Flexibility also makes it possible for the youngest and oldest workers to join the labour force and obtain employment, which is currently a major problem."
"Not everyone in Europe is in favour of such flexibility, as is obvious from events taking place on the streets of Paris."
"The only action we can therefore take at European level is to scale down harmonisation in this area, so as to achieve flexibility in at least some countries and areas of the European Union."
"If we were asked to identify a key word relating to economic policy it would have to be competition along with tax competition."
"Contrary to statements in the report, competition is not detrimental to the financing of public needs."
"The opposite is actually the case, as increased receipts have been recorded by the national budgets of countries that recently radically reformed their tax systems, notably by reducing corporate taxes."
"Tax competition in countries such as Ireland or Slovakia also contributes to increasing the competitiveness of Europe as a whole, thus improving our competitiveness at global level."
"Consequently, tax competition does not threaten Europe in any way. It actually represents a tremendous opportunity."
"I fear, however, that it may be one of the few real opportunities open to us, if not the only one."
"– Mr President, we need 40 million jobs in Europe."
"In Greece alone, we need one million."
"Can we promise them?"
"We cannot promise them."
"Europe cannot safeguard these jobs."
"10% of the active population will live below the poverty line. They will live on unemployment benefits."
"We have no energy of our own."
"Gas from Russia, oil from the Middle East; energy which will constantly increase in price as a result of excess demand from China and India."
"We have a very strong currency which prohibits exports; look at the exports the cheap dollar is giving the United States of America."
"With the very tight Maastricht indicators, the indicators prosper and the people suffer."
"That is the reality."
"Chinese products are constantly flooding the market and will flood it more and more."
"You cannot find as much as a doll which is manufactured in a European factory."
"Even they are Chinese."
"The factories of Europe are going to third countries and wages of course are going with them."
"Farmers are suffering."
"Cotton and tobacco in Greece have been secured in warehouses."
"We need to change the rota; otherwise European citizens will not be able to survive."
"In my statement I would like to take up several ideas from the resolution on the report into the energy sector, and I intend to do so in the context of the broader economic policy goals for 2006."
"These ideas get to the heart of the issue without indulging in vain laments over the economic slowdown in Europe."
"Miracles simply do not happen, and therefore I agree that an in-depth analysis of the structural reform policies of the past decade is necessary."
"This should clarify the causes of persistently slow growth rates and unsatisfactory productivity."
"Also important is the call for what is known as ‘smart growth strategy’."
"This strategy should consolidate the different approaches to EU economic policy into a consistent strategy."
"The goal is to strengthen the European Union’s potential with regard to a new generation of products and production methods by harnessing information and communication technologies."
"I also support the call for EU Member States to promote private investment."
"The shift of public and private capital expenditure towards investments that generally increase economic performance and productivity will also be important."
"However, it will be necessary to pursue and apply this approach also within the context of EU fund disbursements, as the saying applies that the areas most in need of attention are often those closest to home."
"– First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr García-Margallo, for a balanced report that is very much to the point."
"As the report frequently reiterates, one of the serious problems facing the European Union at present is the fact that most Member States underestimate the need for far-reaching structural reform."
"Paradoxically, some Member States have tried to address the loss of competitiveness that is a natural consequence of rejecting such reform by implementing new measures to protect their markets, which only makes the problem worse."
"We must again concede that the internal market is not fully functional and does not enable the free movement of labour or the free provision of services."
"The consequences of this approach are markedly negative."
"Companies have been relocating their operations to areas with cheaper labour or, alternatively, have been outsourcing them, which has also caused job contraction."
"In macroeconomic terms, one major result of such a policy is slow growth and, given the unchanged structure of public finances, a deteriorating general government deficit, frequently exceeding the limits imposed under the Stability and Growth Pact."
"If we take into consideration the low volumes of investment in research, technological development and innovation, and if we add the high energy dependence of most Member States, we can hardly expect a significant increase in the competitiveness of the European economy vis-à-vis major global players such as the USA and China."
"We must respond quickly to these challenges by putting in place a fully functional internal market, operating without any discrimination and unhampered by unnecessary regulation."
"The harmonisation of European legislation must advance rather than hinder the competitive environment."
"Efforts to harmonise corporate income tax provide unfortunate examples of such hindrance."
"In order to increase the internal competitiveness of Member States, and hence of the entire EU, the subsidiarity principle must become a significant component of all Commission initiatives."
"In this respect, I also welcome the action programme on state aid reform that puts conditions in place for more investment into research, technological development and innovation, aiming to benefit small and medium-sized enterprises."
"By the same token, we should praise the Green Paper on a European strategy for a sustainable, competitive and secure energy supply."
"Mr President, the European Employment Strategy, properly and pragmatically carried out by Member States, has the capacity to fulfil the employment goals set up within the framework of the Lisbon employment targets."
"It should indeed reflect a wide anti-discrimination policy, the promotion of gender equality providing a tool for tackling the gender gaps in the labour market."
"The European Employment Strategy must be regarded not only as a tool for attracting more people to the labour market; it should also present a favourable and open opportunity to join the labour market for those who have particularly limited access to employment, such as older women, single parents and ethnic minorities."
"It must be admitted that the challenge of Europe’s ageing society can only be tackled with the increased participation of those special groups in the labour market, as Commissioner Špidla said."
"All kinds of obstacles must be eliminated."
"We are striving for more and better jobs, having declared 2006 the European Year of Workers’ Mobility."
"For Europe’s workforce, mobility provides for new skills, new experiences, flexibility and a capacity to adapt to the different working conditions and constantly changing market needs."
"Mobility is a value contributing to the benefit of the whole European economy."
"That is an urgent need that must be recognised by some Member States which still maintain barriers to the new EU countries’ workforce."
"Finally, I think that the EES has the potential to become the strategy to move towards full employment, making work a real option for all, increasing the quality and productivity of work, and anticipating and managing change, highlighting a more cohesive society of equal opportunities for anyone striving to promote diversity and non-discrimination."
"My Hungarian colleague, Mrs Kósáné Kovács, has prepared an outstanding report of great value and I propose that her recommendations be adopted."
"Mr President, as I take the floor in this debate, I should like to point out that some of the recommendations to Member States contained in the reports will not be beneficial to economic growth and employment in the European Union."
"I shall comment on just a few of them."
"Firstly, countering tax competition and the suggestion of harmonising solutions concerning income tax payable by legal entities in a situation when reducing income tax rates has an obvious impact on the acceleration of economic growth."
"Secondly, countering relocation which is an objective economic process involving an effort to reduce manufacturing costs and thus improve the competitiveness of businesses in the global economy."
"Thirdly, introducing additional regulations concerning economic and social processes when what is actually required is a drastic reduction of such measures."
"Lastly, despite the positive experiences of countries such as Great Britain and Ireland following the opening up of their labour markets, the labour markets in the largest countries of the European Union remain closed to workers from the new Member States."
"This is in fact one of the reasons why the European Union is developing much more slowly than the United States, and why the old Member States of the Union are developing more slowly than the new ones."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work."
"It appears, however, that the report fails to focus appropriately on the most difficult area of the economy, the one that consumes most Union resources, requires protection and is inadequately exploited in economic terms."
"I refer to the agricultural sector in its broadest sense."
"The most substantial payments benefit magnates, whilst small farms are going out of business and the amount of uncultivated land is increasing along with the number of people who have lost their jobs and all hope for the future."
"The enormous potential of the sector remains unexploited, although sound policies could enable it to make a positive contribution to the development of the wider economy."
"The programme of activities aimed at developing industrial crops is not ambitious enough, and the research and implementation programme fails to provide the necessary backing for swift progress."
"We are lagging behind countries whose economies are efficient in this regard."
"The issue merits broad debate and calls for swift and effective action to be taken in the course of 2006."
"Mr President, I should like initially to reflect on two points."
"The first of these is that it is those European economies that are most open to globalisation that now have the best economic development."
"The second is that it is those countries that have the most flexible labour markets that also have the best development in terms of new jobs."
"It is in the light of this that I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, for the work he has done, because it is the changes and policy direction proposed in his report that constitute the approach that can provide more jobs and greater prosperity."
"The crucial question is that of whether all this will lead to changes and of whether policy will be changed at European and Member State level."
"A Swedish politician once said that ‘if things are allowed to go on operating as they have done in the past, things will proceed unchanged’."
"We now have more than 20 million unemployed."
"That is an economic issue, but it is also to the very highest degree a social issue."
"There is no issue more important for social protection than the growth of new jobs."
"In this area, the Commission has a number of tasks with which it must get to grips."
"Firstly, it must implement those directives that open the way to greater competition."
"Secondly, it must take action to open the door to more enterprise, and that brings the whole of competition policy into focus."
"New enterprise does not only mean the growth of small companies."
"It also means the ability to establish new cross-border companies in Europe that can be ‘global champions’."
"The Commission must assume responsibility for doing these things, but the Member States also have a responsibility to implement those reforms that will give rise to new enterprise."
"Finally, we must ensure that we obtain more flexible labour markets in Europe."
"If we do not do so, we shall be excluding millions of people from the labour market and from social protection."
"Those who are in favour of social protection and economic development are also in favour of more flexible labour markets."
"I am happy to say all this to those on the Social Democratic side, for it is reforms that provide security."
"Mr President, today’s debate concerns the future of the European Union."
"Europe’s economies are developing slowly, we have high unemployment and our public finances are in crisis."
"The situation has remained unchanged for a number of years and may result in Europe losing its leading role in the world."
"Major structural reform is needed, together with a change of economic policy."
"The broad economic policy guidelines put forward by the Commission correctly identify the essential action required."
"This includes creating more flexible labour markets and a business-friendly environment, in addition to supporting education, training and research."
"The Commission has been advocating all this for years, however, to no great avail."
"I would remind the House that the reasons for the weakness of European economies are well known."
"So too is the nature of the action required to stimulate economic growth and create new jobs."
"Unfortunately, politicians in the Member States are reluctant to take the necessary measures for fear of losing popularity or because of short-sighted political calculations or even sheer ignorance at times."
"Europe is actually suffering from a crisis of political leadership."
"Today’s debate ought to be directed principally towards the governments of Member States and the political circles supporting them."
"It should aim to send out alarm signals to the effect that if essential reforms are not undertaken, Europe is likely to stagnate and fall behind."
"The economic and social progress it has achieved will also be threatened."
"A politician’s brief is actually to resolve specific problems, not to be subservient to popularity polls and the voters’ whims."
"We are relying on politicians in the Member States to undertake the relevant reforms and persuade their citizens that they are indeed necessary."
"I urge the Commission to take strong and decisive action in this regard."
"– Mr President, I am of course glad to be able to speak for something like the period of time that I was originally allocated to me."
"Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm thanks to the rapporteur for the hard work he has put in on this topic."
"The report spells out once more the fact that the European Union presents the people of Europe, in the face of globalisation, with an opportunity to find a fair compromise between economic conditions on the one hand and social conditions on the other."
"The problem is, though, that this has completely passed the people of Europe by."
"The 20 million unemployed and the hundreds of millions of people who fear for their jobs attribute their circumstances more to the European Union than to globalisation."
"The others, whose jobs are kept safe by the European Union and by the work of the Commission and of this House, are completely unaware of that fact and attribute it to the national governments."
"I want to say how much I am in agreement with Mr Rosati: It would indeed be much to be desired, when considering these important issues, for the Council, which alone is competent to act on many of these issues in the context of the Lisbon Strategy, to apply itself with greater earnestness to this matter and if the debates in this House were not to be in the hands only of its own Members and the Members of the Commission, and, while it is indeed the case that the Commission does have an important function to perform in ensuring that the measures already adopted at Council level are actually implemented by the Member States, we must nevertheless be honest, for – as we shall probably see later on when considering the Őry report – what matters at the end of the day is that the Member States should keep to what they themselves once decided."
"That is why it is very good that the Commission has indicated – indeed, Commissioner Špidla has been saying so to the German media – that bringing greater flexibility to the labour markets is the only way we in Europe can provide our people with more work, and that this, being a means whereby work is created, must not be a source of anxiety."
"That, in fact, is what we all want."
"I therefore strongly encourage you to spell it out to the Member States with greater emphasis that the decisions taken by the Council need, at last, to be put into effect."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I shall begin by saying that I am more optimistic than some previous speakers, because I believe that the reports we have today and this debate are going to be useful and offer a further opportunity to promote the European employment strategy and the Lisbon process."
"At the end of the day, this is our only hope: the only hope for Europe to work in a coordinated fashion in the direction embarked upon last year of enriching the economic and social vision with new guidelines which fall within this framework of integration."
"Commissioner Verheugen said that we need this strategy to be visible."
"This is one of our deficits, as is our credibility deficit as well, as Commissioner Almunia said."
"We need those jobs, as Commissioner Špidla said."
"In the very short space of time available to me, therefore, I would like to ask you to read these two reports by Parliament."
"They are horizontal reports, with which the enormous majority of Members of this Parliament identify, and which I believe reflect great forward-thinking and a great effort to achieve unity."
"Read what these reports say and demonstrate the leadership that Europe needs today."
"The Commission’s people must be active, in order to oblige the governments to apply this European employment strategy."
"Please be consistent, look at our amendments."
"Look at Amendment 2, for example."
"We need the European legislation that we already have to be applied, since it makes work between the Member States much more consistent."
"Read our Amendment 5 as well."
"In this European year of mobility, take steps to remove the obstacles to the mobility of European workers."
"– Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the recommendations drawn up by Mr Garcia-Margallo, whom I wish to congratulate, have come at the right moment to turn around the EU’s economic situation."
"All that remains is for those recommendations to be heeded."
"As things stand, we should be speaking of deepening, rather than reviewing, the Lisbon Strategy, given that what we are now seeing – and have been since the outset – is increased economic growth and more jobs, both of which help to sustain the social models in the long term, and foster adequate social cohesion in the short term."
"In spite of recent progress, the key issues remain untouched."
"Unemployment is at an intolerable level and overall economic growth is insufficient to reverse this trend."
"Consequently, greater integration and better coordination of economic policies is required, and the work of the institutions forming the emerging economic government of the Union must be developed."
"The Council decided to support the Commission in drawing up a common European energy policy."
"Although this was an interesting decision, it still falls short of what is required."
"The Union’s energy dependency is unsustainable."
"Oil imports currently account for 2.3% of Union GDP, which is two and a half times the budget earmarked for all European policies."
"By 2030, that dependency may prove overwhelming, especially in the oil sector (94% of foreign dependency)."
"The simple agreements between Member States promoted by the Council are therefore inadequate."
"Increased competition is a necessary prerequisite to the creation of a common energy policy."
"A common regulation will, above all, require huge investment if existing networks are to be improved and if genuine progress is to be made once again in the area of alternative energy and energy saving."
"All of this is vital to increasing competitiveness and sustainable development."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate has shown just how much distance we have covered together, but it has also shown that the new growth and employment strategy is increasingly understood and that there is increasing pressure to take seriously and to realise the priorities we have set."
"The Commission has listened very carefully, and we will pay very careful attention to what the groups and the speakers have told us, and will, in future debates, endeavour to take on board your House’s wishes and suggestions."
"Let me conclude by reiterating, and very clearly, that the reason why growth and employment are priorities for the years ahead of us is that without more growth and the creation of more jobs, we will be unable to realise our great and far-reaching political goals."
"We will not be able to maintain a high environmental standard, we will not be able to maintain high social standards, and we will not be able to maintain a high standard of living if we do not have strong economic foundations that can bear their weight, and that is why we say that growth and jobs are our number one task."
"The guidelines, which we have been discussing today, are among the essential means whereby we ensure that we in Europe are able, perhaps, to make a virtue of necessity."
"Our inability to have a common economic policy is of course a defect, but it can become a virtue if we can agree on a new kind of cooperation of the kind that we have developed in the shape of the Partnership for Growth and Jobs."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"In recent years the EU has been facing serious economic problems: the Union’s growth is below its potential when compared to the US or to emerging countries such as China or India."
"The European economy suffers from a lower demographic growth, employment rate and productivity."
"Europe must foresee long-term strategies and sufficient resources to invest in its future."
"The strategies were designed in order to address these problems but the situation is getting worse."
"There are various reasons for this situation: a lack of appropriate infrastructure, insufficient private and public investments, delays in the development of innovative technologies and inappropriate vocational training and education."
"Europe needs a clear vision for a more competitive economy."
"To be in line with the employment and growth objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, structural changes are required: support for R[amp]D, encouragement of private and public investments, development of innovative actions for sectors such as biotechnologies, sustainable energies and ICTs."
"Besides the structural changes and the development of innovative sectors, environmental protection and the quality of products must remain, within the framework of global economy, a genuine European specificity."
"Finally, it is paramount to foster related education and vocational training in order to meet the requirements and challenges of economic development."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0069/2006) by Mr Őry, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on transitional arrangements restricting the free movement of workers on EU labour markets [2006/2036(INI)]."
". Ladies and gentlemen, thank you, but I am accustomed to report presentations where the rapporteur speaks first and only then does the Commissioner provide a response."
"If you have decided to change this practice, however, then I am of course ready to begin."
"I would like to begin, ladies and gentlemen, by thanking Mr Őry for an excellent report on a topic that constitutes one of the pillars of European integration."
"The aim of the transitional measures set out in the Accession Treaty is to enable Member States to work gradually towards achieving, as quickly as possible, the one irrevocable aim of providing all migrant workers from Member States that joined the European Union in 2004 with open access to employment in all Member States."
"This is one of the basic freedoms enshrined in the Treaty of Rome."
"As stated in the Accession Treaty, the Commission has assessed the operation of these transitional measures in respect of the initial two-year stage, in order to assist Member States in deciding either to retain the transitional measures or to abandon them."
"On the basis of the statistical data for 2004 and in some cases also for 2005, and also following consultations with the individual participants, the Commission has produced some specific conclusions relating to the first stage of the transitional period."
"The number of workers registered since accession is generally very low, seldom reaching 1% of the active population of the host country."
"In addition, it seems that the influx of workers from the new Member States has had a basically positive effect."
"This is because enlargement has contributed to bringing black economy workers from EU-8 states out of the area of illegality."
"Accession has also led to a reduction in labour shortages and to improved economic results in Europe."
"The countries that did not introduce restrictions after May 2004 have recorded stronger economic growth, lower levels of unemployment and higher levels of employment."
"The workers who have been granted legal access to a labour market have experienced little difficulty in joining the market."
"It is, of course, only the Member States that can decide whether or not to apply the transitional measures, but the Commission may challenge the Member States to evaluate objectively the advantages and disadvantages of the measures."
"In reality, it is the second stage that is the actual transitional stage, which will bring us, wholly or at least in part, to the objective of freedom of movement for workers."
"In this spirit, the Member States implementing restrictions on the basis of the Accession Treaty must not treat nationals from EU-8 states who are already legally residing on their territory in a more restrictive way than nationals from third countries who are long-term residents, as reported in the previous plenary session."
"A letter explaining this has been sent to interior ministers in order to clarify the legal situation."
"Some moments ago the rapporteur mentioned this problem of citizens of third countries, so I hope you will allow me to emphasise once again that in the context of the directives and treaties on accession, it is not permissible to treat citizens of third countries who are long-term residents of an EU Member State in a more favourable way than citizens of EU Member States, that is, if there are restrictions applying to EU citizens, these shall logically apply also to citizens of third countries who are long-term residents of the EU Member State."
"For the same reasons the Commission is also monitoring adherence to the provisions that forbid Member States from restricting access to their labour markets for workers from EU-8 states to a greater extent than was the case prior to the signing of the Accession Treaty, that is, prior to 16 April 2003."
"The Commission is at the same time backing calls for the Member States to apply the Community’s legal regulations scrupulously, especially in the area of posted workers."
"I acknowledge that we must greatly strengthen statistical monitoring of movements of workers within an EU framework, since there are many hypotheses meriting discussion that are impossible to verify using the existing statistical and analytical resources."
"The Commission supports proposals from Parliament for reinforcing social dialogue on both a European and a national level, with the aim of upholding the rights of workers from the new Member States."
"The Commission takes an equally favourable view of raising public awareness of freedom of movement for workers and the associated legislation."
"The declaration of 2006 as European Year of Workers’ Mobility should contribute to this aim."
"Despite the fears expressed over gradual enlargement, freedom of movement for workers has not undermined intrastate labour markets."
"The free movement of persons is a basic principle applying to all citizens, and any limitation on it whatsoever can only be temporary and must be expressed strictly within the spirit of the treaties."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in my speech I have once or twice used the term ‘new Member States’ It must be said that the new states of Central Europe have a history almost as long as the states of other parts of Europe, and with the enlargement of the European Union they are now Member States."
"Therefore I would like to state that I will not be using the term ‘new Member States’ again."
". Further to the 2004 enlargement of the European Union, the issue of opening up the labour markets, and in connection with this, the operation of the transitional restrictions considered necessary by the twelve old Member States, have been followed with particular attention."
"As stipulated in the Accession Treaties, Member States – based on their own experiences with the labour market – will lift these restrictions gradually between 2004 and 2011, and the European Commission and European Parliament will also evaluate the situation, in the light of the experiences of the Member States."
"The position of the European institutions carries a political message, and it is primarily meant to clarify, for the over 450 million citizens of the European Union, the pan-European interest in the extremely important issue of the movement of workers."
"In other words: what is the interest of the European Union as an important player in world politics and world economy?"
"This logic of keeping European interests in mind was decisive in the course of the preparation of the report."
"The only possible starting point for the evaluation of the current situation was the analysis of the global challenges faced by the European Union at the beginning of the 21st century."
"In this respect it is sufficient to refer to the fact that our economic competitors in South-East Asia are speeding up both in the area of industrial production and in that of research, development and innovation."
"If we want to increase our competitiveness to keep up with both America and Asia, we must find a solution to the structural tensions in European economies."
"The solution is unequivocal: we must increase mobility within the European Union, and we must encourage, with all available means, the creation of a single European labour market, which should be as flexible as possible."
"There are, of course, alternative solutions to increasing mobility (we can also talk about speeding up immigration and other similar measures), but the common denominator of such alternatives is that their social cost is immeasurably higher, while their efficiency is much lower."
"The road to economic development – in line with the Lisbon Strategy – leads primarily through the increase of mobility and the utilisation of the occupational reserves represented by the inactive population."
"This is the only way of preserving the social achievements that are so dear to European citizens, and of which we talk so often."
"An important step within the process of increasing mobility is to lift the transitional restrictions affecting new Member States, as soon as possible."
"Several Member States already agreed to do this in May 2006, and we can only hope that in the course of the following years – perhaps even before May 2009 – other Member States will follow them, because it is important to emphasise that the legal possibility for the other Member States to make a similar decision is always available."
"The fears concerning mass migration have proved to be groundless."
"Experiences have unequivocally shown that the presence of workers from new Member States in the old Member States who decided to open their markets fully in 2004 has not caused labour market or economic tensions."
"On the contrary!"
"The assessment of both the European Commission and one of the affected governments – the British Government – has proved that the migration of a restricted extent from new Member States has brought economic advantages to the recipient countries."
"Therefore, the conclusion is clear: the most advantageous course of action for the European Union and its Member States is for the affected governments to lift the system of transitional measures restricting free employment within the Union, as soon as possible."
"We also submitted proposals for compromises with the report."
"These were prepared taking into account the special sensitivities of a few Member States concerning this important issue, because, as our experiences have shown, in some Member States the speedy implementation of the free movement of work force is not only hindered by economic difficulties, but often by political, sociopsychological or communication difficulties, too."
"The compromise proposals are also examining the issue in view of the pan-European interest, trying to take into account the aspirations and sensitivities of both old and new Member States."
"Therefore, we hope that the report, in this form, will receive the widest support during the vote of the Parliament."
"Thank you for your attention, and I would like to thank all my colleagues, the political groups and the European Commission for their cooperation."
"It is not a coincidence that the content of the introduction given by Mr Špidla has significantly relieved me of having to present the report in detail."
"We mostly think along the same lines, and our experiences are similar."
"I trust that this will remain so in the future, too."
"Mr President, allow me to start by extending warm congratulations to Mr Őry who has acquitted himself of his tasks in a very conscientious manner and has produced a sound report."
"We, in Europe, owe the prosperity that we enjoy to the four freedoms that we have entrenched in the European Union."
"The free movement of workers forms an integral part of this."
"It now seems to me that fear has dominated the enlargement process in the old Member States and that fear of being elbowed out from the labour market, which is, or was, already under pressure, has led to restrictions in the free movement."
"I have always taken the view that decisions should not be taken on the basis of fear and that we would have served our own interests much better had we opened up this labour market from the word go."
"This is also evident from the results of the studies carried out in the United Kingdom and Sweden, although it should be noted that, in the United Kingdom, social security is not implemented in the way we would like it to be."
"What is this fear about?"
"People fear being pushed out of the labour market, and in order to prevent this from happening, borders are closed, yet nothing could be further from the truth."
"Many arrive in our Member States and graft many hours for little pay."
"They are badly housed, set up their own one-man bands and compete with our small and medium-size enterprises."
"What should the answer be?"
"Rather than resort to fear, the answer should be to open up the borders and make sure that proper checks are in place to monitor, not whether minimum wages are paid, but rather whether wages and working conditions as they have been laid down in the collective bargaining agreements are adhered to, and the conditions of safety at work as well."
"That is a welcome development in new and old Member States alike."
". Mr President, as has been said, 2006 has been declared the European Year of Workers’ Mobility."
"On the initiative of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, a draft Parliamentary resolution was drawn up, which the Committee approved on 21 March by an overwhelming majority."
"For the preparation of the report thanks are due especially to Mr Őry."
"The central feature of the resolution is the call to scrap the current transitional measures."
"Immediately after approval the amendment proposals began to come in, aimed at removing this prospective message from Parliament."
"It is remarkable how every one of the proposals begins with the words ‘I support the free movement of workers, but …’."
"I therefore take the view that Parliament should approve the same version that has been approved by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"I would like to remind you that both employers’ groups and the European Trade Union Confederation are requesting that the transitional measures be scrapped immediately."
"I am aware that some governments have not done so, and those that have done deserve our thanks."
"In response to the complaints we have heard today in speeches on the poor state of the European Union, I would like to say that neither the American nor the Chinese way should be models for us and that following the major crisis in Asia some years ago many states over there are thinking of developing the sort of structures that some persons here today are seeking to demolish."
"It would therefore be a very good thing for us to realise that the path to prosperity leads neither through Chinese-style wage levels nor through the sort of industrial relations that prevail in the United States."
". Mr President, I believe that four fundamental criteria should be borne in mind when considering Mr Őry’s report on the transitional arrangements restricting the free movement of workers on EU labour markets."
"Firstly, the free movement of persons is one of the four fundamental freedoms of the single market and every European Union citizen’s right."
"Recognition of that right requires transitional periods to be lifted at the earliest opportunity."
"This does not imply promoting mass movements across the European Union."
"A distinction should be made between movements triggered by the need to seek employment and the free movement of persons which is a citizen’s right."
"Secondly, the report rightly points out the benefits gained by countries that did not impose transitional periods and opened up their labour markets immediately."
"This is in line with the European Commission’s view."
"It would, however, also be appropriate to consider how the free movement of people can either threaten or benefit the countries of origin of the citizens involved."
"Thirdly, it is important that Member State citizens should not be discriminated against in favour of third-country nationals on the European Union’s labour markets."
"Of course, this does not imply that we are indifferent to the interests of third-country nationals or that we do not wish to express solidarity with them too."
"Finally, the free movement of persons should be deemed a key feature of the European social model."
"Bearing in mind that Mr Őry’s report and the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs comply with the aforementioned criteria, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will vote in favour of the report."
"We would also like to thank Mr Őry for his work."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the Group of the Greens is in favour of freedom of movement, and endorses Mr Őry’s even-handed report, for transitional periods, popular though they are with our own people, promise no success."
"According to the German newspapers, the government had decided against allowing cheap workers into the country on the grounds that it wanted to protect its own labour market from an influx of cheap migrant labour from the neighbouring countries, but that is a load of nonsense; the transitional periods do not keep the migrant workers out."
"They come all the same and work either on the black market or making themselves out to be self-employed."
"The transitional rules are forcing people to work outside the law and thereby to become even cheaper labour and the object of brutal exploitation without the protection of labour law, without social security and without the certainty of actually being paid."
"Outside the law’s protection, people have no rights."
"There is even greater pressure on wages in vulnerable areas and in the labour markets affected, for wages agreements have no effect on the black market, which operates according to its own rules and cannot be monitored."
"Those governments that still hold to transitional periods are encouraging people to work outside of the law and on its fringes, thereby doing much more damage to social cohesion."
"If workers are to be enabled to avail themselves of their rights, then their employment needs to be put on a legal footing."
"Greater transparency brings with it better monitoring of labour markets."
"We must organise the European market in its existing form on the basis of ‘equal pay for the same work under the same conditions in the same place’, thereby giving national and regional wage negotiations added weight and the same social rights to all."
"What that means, for the German Government for example, is that it must, without further ado, extend the Posting of Workers Directive to all vulnerable areas, for we know that, in Germany and Austria, the transitional periods for the services sector are dependent on those applicable to freedom of movement."
"The only really effective protection against things going wrong on the labour market is pro-active measures to bring it into order."
". – Mr President, the lack of freedom of movement for workers from what I shall still call the ‘new’ Member States results in many people being forced into unregistered work, intolerable working and living conditions, and into a state of lawlessness."
"It also constitutes discrimination, since the free movement of persons is a fundamental right guaranteed under Community law."
"As is well known, this is a freedom that has existed for workers since the foundation of the European Community in 1957."
"That millions of people within the European Union should, in 2006, have ceased to enjoy that right is intolerable."
"In the course of the enlargement process, socially committed people of the Left – such as the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, for example – in the European Parliament insisted over and over again on the conditions being created that would enable, on the accession of new Member States, workers to be allowed freedom of movement without detrimental effects on society."
"People in both the old and new Member States are meant to benefit from enlargement, but instead we keep coming back to the issue of global competition."
"Whilst it was demonstrated, in the Scandinavian countries, that free movement does much to protect existing social standards, the federal government in Germany has extended the transitional periods without giving any indication whatever of what it intends to do with it by way of actually giving workers freedom of movement."
"Fundamentally, my group agrees with Mr Őry that we do not actually need any transitional periods at all, but this report is scarcely likely to promote awareness of the need for greater social responsibility on the European labour market."
"Our group’s amendments to this end have so far been largely ineffective."
"I want to argue in favour of the freedom of movement being given to all workers living in the EU with immediate effect and of the introduction of social standards and minimum wages that keep people out of poverty."
"Combating poverty must become an absolute political priority in the European Union."
". Mr President, very recently we experienced a bitter disappointment with the free market in services, but now we see that only a few of the governments of the older Member States are prepared to open their markets to workers from the new Member States."
"The majority of governments, in continuing to restrict the number of workers from the new Member States, are in fact struggling with more serious problems concerning immigration from non-EU countries."
"The partial opening of the labour market, for example, to construction workers, doormen and waiters, as France has proposed, does not testify to a readiness for the European fundamental freedoms."
"It is, instead, testimony to the low prestige of these professions, since unemployment among French youth is very high."
"This selective opening of the professional market, however, to a labour force with low qualifications means that this will be an incentive for many qualified workers to leave the new Member States, to change profession and immediately earn a higher salary."
"In the long term, however, this will weaken Europe’s competitiveness."
"Finally, I call on those young French people who are protesting, disappointed in their government because of its discriminatory legislation against them, to come to the new Member States and to launch careers there."
"We have very low unemployment among young people, and we do not discriminate against them."
". Mr President, I am astonished that there should be a report on this at all."
"I thought the EU was all about the free movement of goods, services and labour."
"What do we find?"
"When the ten new Member States joined in 2004, they did not get parity."
"Only three Member States of the previous EU of 15 admitted their workers without restriction: Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom."
"This becomes very odd when you consider that these are three of the most reluctant EU Member States."
"Ireland rejected the Nice Treaty the first time and only accepted it later due to impressive gerrymandering in a second referendum."
"Sweden only joined the EU after a bare 1% majority in its referendum."
"As for the United Kingdom, you know all about us."
"None of you exactly welcomed Prime Minister Blair last December, at the end of what you all considered to have been a rotten United Kingdom Presidency."
"You were right."
"You even threw out his seven-year budget – his precious rescue attempt – with an overwhelming vote on the Böge report."
"So I am now in the very happy position of saying to you: do as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden have done."
"Never mind transitional arrangements; obey your own rules; open your borders; take your share of, say, Polish workers – in the United Kingdom we have 250 000 of them, and they are not all plumbers."
"Mr President, the latest OECD report reveals that Sweden, Finland and Great Britain are the fastest developing countries in the European Union."
"Two of these countries have opened up their labour markets, and it should be noted that Ireland has also done so, and that its GDP has benefited as a result."
"The report debunks the myth that an influx of foreign workers would have a destructive impact on the economy of the country in question."
"The opposite is actually the case."
"We should be resorting to an employment policy of this nature in order to save the Lisbon Strategy."
"Each and every one of the Member States must open up its labour market."
"Concerns about an avalanche of cheap labour have proved unfounded."
"Economic migration is restricted."
"I therefore believe that it is essential to lift all barriers that might hinder the free movement of workers across Europe in any way."
"– Mr President, the enlargement of the EU by the addition of 10 new Member States was something that we wanted for cultural, economic and political reasons;"
"I, as a German MEP, spent years arguing in favour of the project and trying to win people over to it."
"Public acceptance was dependent on the Member States having the right to limit the free movement of labour in line with the conditions prevailing on their own labour markets."
"It was asserted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that the failure of massive migratory flows to manifest themselves meant that the transitional arrangements guaranteed by treaty had to be abolished forthwith."
"To that I say that the situation as experienced in such Member States as Germany, Austria or France is quite different."
"Wherever markedly higher rates of pay per hour apply, and wherever social security is guaranteed, there you will find migrants, and they need to be controlled, with illicit working and fictive self-employment being prevented."
"The effect of continued flows of migrants to countries with high unemployment is neither to create new jobs nor to make businesses more competitive."
"Even though this report is only an appeal rather than being legally binding, it could be misused to put certain countries in the dock, to whip up sentiment against them and to mount campaigns calling on consumers to boycott goods from them."
"That has indeed, already happened."
"Those who try to drive a wedge between the old Member States and the new ones imperil the concept of the EU being more than just a free trade area."
"I have helped to put forward some compromise amendments and am grateful to Mr Őry, our rapporteur."
"Let there, then, be consideration of the curtailment of the transitional regulations, but let it be done on the basis of detailed analyses of the national labour markets."
"Regulations should also be drafted to ensure that workers from the new Member States are not put at a disadvantage vis-à-vis those from third countries."
"What we need is for decisions to be properly thought out."
"Global competition demands of all the EU’s Member States that they create the conditions for it, by, for example, reforming their social security systems."
"This sort of posturing does no more than risk leaving our single European project by the roadside."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Őry, whom I would like at this point to congratulate on his work, could turn out to be a real boon for European workers."
"The restrictions on the free movement of workers have some harmful effects, including the expansion of illegal work."
"Just in the last few months, Polish workers have been discovered in France, living in hovels, malnourished, unpaid and with no care – they had been brought to the country by a German sub-contracting company."
"Ironically, these workers were involved in building a law court."
"Where is the justice in that?"
"Such cases are quite unacceptable."
"The free movement of workers must form one of the factors for promoting social progress, one of the tools for creating a barrier to social dumping."
"The end of the transitional arrangements will force employers to provide their employees with decent living conditions in accordance with social legislation in the host country."
"Social protection, decent housing, a decent salary, fair working hours – those are the basic rights that this freedom of movement should provide, and we will ensure that it does so."
"We cannot accept a situation where some employers exploit the different nationalities of their employees to reduce their operating costs, in the same way as others play the stock market."
"Let us remember that the founding European project aims to unite populations, not to divide them."
"If we continue to restrict the free movement of workers, we will only feed the fears of citizens in certain Member States, who are terrified at the idea of being treated as second-class European citizens."
"And you are right, Commissioner, we now need to talk in terms of European citizens."
"These restrictions must be fully lifted."
"It can be done, but the checks need to be strengthened so that the first beneficiaries of this measure do not become its first victims."
"I welcome your comments on the citizens of third countries and this problem in general."
"I congratulate the rapporteur for preparing a very balanced report."
"The free movement of labour is not just one of the fundamental rights of the European Union, but is an expression of the solidarity between the old and new countries."
"Therefore, I am pleased to see that all of my colleagues show unanimous support for the abolition of the restrictions."
"As we react to the challenges of today's global economy, I believe that the abolition of obstacles to the movement of citizens and labour in the European Union's market is one of the main goals of the Lisbon Strategy and one of the factors stimulating economic growth."
"With their accumulated human capital, the active workers from the new European Union Member States have the ability to stimulate long-term economic growth."
"Moreover, the market may become more effective, as foreign workers usually react more actively to the regional differences of economic opportunities."
"Having admitted workers from the new states, Ireland, the United Kingdom and Sweden only benefited."
"The aforementioned Member States are noted for rapid economic growth, reduced unemployment and increased employment compared to other states."
"In addition, it can be concluded that citizens of the new Member States have complemented, but not replaced citizens of the old Member States in the labour markets of the latter."
"Statistical data from European Union Member States indicates that immigration from third countries exceeds the flow of immigration in the heart of the European Union."
"We should congratulate and rejoice in the decision of those countries which have decided to open their labour markets to the new European Union countries from May this year."
"I would say: shame on the governments of Austria, which is holding the EU Presidency, and Germany, for their phobias, for their inability to discuss this matter with their own citizens."
"But of course, the opening of labour markets is the sovereign right of every state."
"Mr President, I too should like to thank the Commissioner and our rapporteur for their work on this issue."
"As many have said, equality of treatment is a key principle for European citizens, which should apply to employment conditions and access to services within our Member States across the Union."
"However, in a debate where we are talking about third-country nationals, it is crucial that we are also very clear – as the rapporteur has been – that we are not talking about rolling back the hard-won rights of those individuals, but extending the rights to which our new Member States are entitled."
"We have heard a number of arguments over the past few months in favour of maintaining transitional periods."
"Many of us here do not find them convincing."
"We believe that what we are seeing is – as has already been mentioned – evidence of irregular employment and false claims about self-employment."
"I am willing to bet that in all our countries we have a number of Member States’ citizens in unclear situations."
"When the UK introduced its worker registration scheme for nationals of the A8 countries, it found that 40% of the Polish people who registered were already in the UK."
"I believe that is evidence that people want to work legally."
"We need to encourage them to do that."
"We need better information in advance, more effort on inspection and supporting whistle-blowers, and greater clarity about people’s rights, so we do not see the exploitation that Mr Cottigny has referred to, which threatens to undercut working conditions and exploits individuals."
"It is much easier to demand equality of treatment when you have clear rights."
"The UK – as has been said – has opened access, with certain shifts on social security."
"We have had a range of workers, of all skill levels."
"We found no discernible statistical evidence of an increase in social benefit claims."
"The economic impact is seen to be modest, and the numbers started slowing towards the end of last year."
"The positive experiences of Ireland should encourage other countries which introduced transitional arrangements to lift these restrictions."
"Sinn Féin and the trade union movement support the decision not to introduce transitional arrangements in Ireland."
"I have signed the written declaration here in Parliament calling for such restrictions to be lifted."
"I reiterate that call here today and I welcome Mr Őry’s report in that context."
"However, we must go further than this: we cannot ignore the issue of employment conditions and the exploitation of workers."
"Even in Ireland, unscrupulous employers have used the lack of free movement of workers in the EU to introduce discrimination as regards salaries and working conditions based on nationality."
"We must combat this strongly."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten mentioned the restrictions placed on social security."
"We must also combat any discrimination in access to social protection for EU citizens who travel to another Member State to work or to seek work."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Őry, the initiator and author of the report on the transitional arrangements restricting the free movement of workers on EU labour markets."
"In its initial version this document already rightly indicated that the impossibility of being legally employed in the majority of the so-called old Member States fosters irregular employment and the exploitation of workers."
"Mr Őry also appropriately highlights the fact that in certain European Union Member States more restrictions are currently imposed on the movement of workers from the new Member States than was the case when the Treaty on Accession was signed."
"He also points out that there are issues concerning preferential treatment for so-called long-term resident third-country nationals to the detriment of Union citizens from the 10 new Member States."
"In addition, the report’s author clearly states that there have been no negative social or economic consequences for the countries that have already opened up their labour markets."
"On the contrary, the reduction of the irregular employment of foreigners has resulted in additional income for national budgets."
"Mr Őry’s initial draft was also presented to Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for discussion and a subsequent vote, and the draft was improved considerably by this process."
"This is particularly true of paragraph 1."
"In the version tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Parliament comes out clearly in support of the citizens and their right to the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Treaties."
"I strongly believe that this is the stance the European Parliament must adopt."
"The House should make a clear and unequivocal statement defending fundamental rights and freedoms."
"It should stand up for the Community’s interests and for the interests of all European Union citizens, over and above specific national concerns."
"That is why I am of the opinion that we should support the text that arose as a result of the debate and vote within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too am opposed to second-class EU membership, and, yes, there must be freedom of movement for all workers in the EU, and as soon as possible, but there are reasons why the option was introduced of using the 2+3+2 rule to limit access to national labour markets, and it strikes me as pretty risky to attempt to draw from the experiences of three Member States conclusions that automatically apply to all the others."
"I greatly respect Mr Őry, and will say to him quite frankly that I well understand why he, and many other Members of this House, endorses the Commission’s line, but perhaps I might also say that it was the Czech minister of labour, among others, who announced, as long ago as the end of last year, that even his own country was giving thought to the possibility of making transitional periods for worker mobility applicable to Romania and Bulgaria."
"In contrast to the United Kingdom, Sweden and Ireland, Germany’s unemployment rate is running at 12% rather than a mere 5%."
"We have a country with 18% unemployment right on our own doorstep."
"I am sure it is understandable that that fact cannot do other than cause many workers to worry about their own jobs, and it is surely only right that a government should try to take that into account, particularly when one bears in mind the fact that Germany has already, in percentage terms, given the most work permits to citizens of the new Member States."
"– Mr President, a few weeks ago, we, in this House, voted on the services directive, with a majority endorsing a compromise intended to help maintain high social standards, under the slogan of ‘no social dumping’."
"It would appear, though, that protection from social dumping is intended to benefit only the select few in Europe, for how else is one to understand the restrictions on the free movement of workers?"
"Those who bar certain people from the market must know that they can expect, as a quite natural response to their action, the coming into being of illegal markets."
"People who live near to a border between states will not be prevented from offering their labour on either side of it, and so, over recent years, whole new categories of workers are putting themselves on the streets, with artisans and building workers offering their services, and this is proving to be a successful game for them; they are much in demand."
"People are working under the pretence of being self-employed or, quite simply, illegally, without social security and for less than the minimum wages laid down by law."
"How mendacious, then, of people such as the representatives of the German building trade, to demand – or so we read – that the transitional periods be extended!"
"Why is it that some employers’ representatives want these discriminatory restrictions imposed on the citizens of other Member States?"
"Is it not, perhaps, that they are thereby enabled to make money from cheap seasonal labour, from the putative self-employed, and from those working in the black market?"
"Why, too, I wonder, do the national employers’ representatives not campaign with more energy against this sort of exploitation?"
"Why do they make social security dependent on nationality?"
"Might it not be that they do so out of the simple desire for mass appeal, since it is only the citizens of their own country who cast votes, so that what matters to them is not the principle itself but their own success on election day?"
"Three countries so far have opened up their labour markets to the EU’s new Member States, and their experiences of it have been positive."
"I call, in this Year of Mobility, on all the others to do likewise by 2007 at the latest."
"Shame on all those who do not do so, particularly on my own country, Austria, if it turns out to be one of them!"
"– The free movement of persons and access to labour markets has undoubtedly become a sensitive political issue."
"The rapporteur, Mr Őry, has handled this topic skilfully, without causing division among the Member States."
"In his report, he focuses on the real effects of citizens from the new Member States entering the labour markets of the fifteen old Member States."
"He supports the premise that it is not the Member States and their interactions that pose the real problem to European competitiveness, but rather external competitors such as India and China."
"The report considers the following facts: firstly, workers from the new Member States nowhere exceed 2% of the host country population; secondly, internal migration within the old Member States is four times greater than internal migration from the new Member States and, thirdly, migration from third countries significantly exceeds total internal migration within the EU."
"There is no doubt that, in addition to the German, Austrian and French attitudes to the transitional period, divergent opinions also exist among the new Member States, as the transitional period has gradually become a sensitive political issue there as well."
"We adopted the transitional measures during the accession talks, as part of the deal."
"As time goes by, however, this has become a sensitive issue in the politics of the old Member States, which are increasingly perceived as discriminatory."
"Discussions over the Services Directive have already revealed absurd situations in connection with transitional periods and now, with regard to Directive 109, it also appears that a legal conflict has arisen with the preferential rules clause."
"The fears generated by job insecurity and prejudice undoubtedly represent political capital that can be readily used."
"Instead of propagating this myth, however, which in fact leads to a political impasse, it should be the responsibility of politicians to tell the truth."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Csaba Őry, for his excellent work, and would like to thank Commissioner Špidla for the summarising report which often provokes a dispute, due to differing interests."
"Colleagues from certain states are criticising the report, but the majority are finding this objective report very helpful indeed."
"When new Member States are fighting for equal rights, this is more than just a simple fight for equal treatment: it protects the interests of the entire European Union."
"It is a paradox that it is the new Member States who are pressing for the liberalisation of the labour market, which, just like the liberalisation of services, should be implemented by the European Union anyway, in the interest of its own competitiveness."
"We would like to be citizens with equal rights of the European Union."
"The opening up of the labour market and the free movement of workers is not a gift or a favour; it is the rational decision of the eight old Member States, which would result in favourable effects for all citizens of the European Union."
"Our thanks go to the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Spain, Portugal and Holland, and we hope that the remaining eight Member States will also consider their position."
"I agree with Commissioner Špidla: it is inadmissible that third-country nationals with five years of legal residence should be in a more favourable position than workers from the ten new Member States in countries that have not opened their labour markets to them."
"Mr President, when Spain and Portugal entered the European Union — the then European Community — there was an irrational fear about the arrival of Spanish and Portuguese workers on the market."
"That was shown to be absurd. But the same fear nevertheless arose once again with the accession of the new Member States and, unfortunately, despite the fact that in that case, at that time, some of us in the Spanish Parliament opposed it, even the Spanish Government of that time — at the time of accession — agreed to those transitional periods, partly due to pressure from other Member States."
"We have now seen that that makes no sense, that that fear is entirely irrational and that we cannot allow one of the fundamental freedoms in the European Union to be pushed to one side for a period of time, for purely populist reasons or through fear of how certain societies may react."
"We cannot have first-class and second-class States within the European Union and we must therefore put an end to these transitional periods and open up the borders of the European labour market entirely, turning it into a genuine internal labour market."
"I therefore entirely support the Öry report, which draws attention to this issue and to the situation being faced by the citizens of those States, who in some cases are in an even worse situation than citizens of third countries who are legally resident in the Member States of the European Union."
"I congratulate the Spanish Government on having finally decided to agree to the lifting of that transitional period and I hope that, as soon as possible, other States will accept this initiative, in order to create equal conditions for all of the citizens of the European Union, and this House must therefore apply pressure in that direction."
"I support Mr Őry’s report and all other efforts aimed at enforcing the operation of an internal market in the European Union."
"Of course, the efficient operation of the internal market is based upon the free movement of capital, goods, services and workers."
"The free movement of capital and goods has been implemented relatively successfully."
"We have, however, encountered great difficulties with regard to the free movement of services and workers."
"We have planned that the European economy should flourish with the Lisbon Strategy."
"We are constantly hearing about the importance of competition and adopting measures against protectionism – but how well is this working in practice?"
"As far as capital and goods are concerned, some countries are particularly consistent in their advocacy of competition and are even opening their markets to cheap goods from Asia."
"But those who constantly lecture us on the importance of competition and the drawbacks of protectionism as regards goods and capital are at the same time closing their service and labour markets."
"Is that not protectionism?"
"2006 has been designated the European Year for Workers’ Mobility and, yet, it is in this very year that some Member States are planning to extend their transitional periods."
"So, I ask you, how are we supposed to explain that to the citizens of the European Union?"
"With a great deal of difficulty."
"On the other hand, it is plain to see that all those who have opened up their markets are making progress and their economic development is noteworthy."
"Any country which decides to further close its labour market must do so, in my view, on a rational basis and acting as an individual, rather than as part of a bloc of countries."
"If we want the European Union to be able to compete successfully with other states, it must fully implement in its internal market the free movement of capital, goods and services as well as the free movement of workers."
"– Mr President, essentially justified though the desire is that the transitional periods for the free movement of workers – which constitute a barrier to mobility within Europe – be done away with, the superficiality and vagueness of the Commission’s study do little if anything to make that easier."
"To be sure, their abolition could make unregistered work within the labour market more difficult, but it certainly will not cause the regulatory pressure on wages and in the social sphere to disappear."
"That would, indeed, become an even bigger problem."
"If, then, it proves impossible to enact accompanying measures to protect workers, such as, for example, a substantially improved Posting of Workers Directive along with the machinery to monitor and implement it, the only result will be even greater pressure on the labour markets in Germany and Austria."
"I can still find no evidence of usable accompanying measures from the Commission, and it is all very well for you to laugh, Commissioner!"
"It may well be that the majority in this House will accept the Commission’s and Mr Őry’s reports, thereby indicating a complete lack of concern about Germany’s and Austria’s positions and interests, so: away with the transitional periods!"
"As a parliamentarian, I have to accept what the majority says – that much is abundantly clear – but, while it may well be all the same to you, the Commissioner for social affairs, that you are thereby further fuelling anti-European sentiment in our countries, it is certainly not a matter of indifference to me!"
"Mr President, of the many subjects we will be voting on this week I believe that this report and this subject are the most important."
"The fact that some 30 speakers from many different parties want to contribute to this debate is confirmation of that."
"Many people have already referred to the basic four freedoms of the EU."
"Amongst those freedoms, the freedom of movement of people is perhaps the most important."
"Half a century ago Jean Monnet said of one of the key missions of the EU: ."
"That was absolutely right then, it is absolutely right now."
"That is what we should be doing: uniting the people."
"Mention has been made of the fears of some Member States."
"I do not think we should criticise Member States for having those fears: it is understandable."
"However, alongside those fears are facts and the facts should put the fears into context."
"The fact is that such immigrants who have come from central and eastern Europe into the UK, Sweden and Ireland have not been a drain on the economy, but a benefit to it."
"The problem has not been the legal immigration into our countries, but the illegal immigration to other countries that has propelled the growth of the black economy."
"The people who are afraid of the problem should be mindful of the fact that this is a much bigger problem than opening up borders at this stage."
"I am glad that there are already three further countries – Spain, Portugal and Finland – which have said that they will be removing the barriers."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner to use his great personal authority as well as that of the Commission to encourage Finland to maintain this issue as a very high point on its agenda in its forthcoming Presidency and to report back at the end of its Presidency on the progress it has made so that it can inspire others to follow its example."
"Meanwhile, I hope that we will all inspire others with a strong vote later this week."
"I hope we can say to new Member States ‘there are no second-class citizens in Europe’ and to old Member States ‘it is time to open your borders and open your minds’."
"– The free movement of workers is one of the cornerstones of European cooperation."
"The temporary transitional arrangements that a number of countries – including my own, Denmark – have chosen to introduce in relation to Eastern European workers must be cancelled as quickly as is reasonably possible."
"The transitional arrangements must not unnecessarily hamper freedom of movement, and we must demonstrate solidarity and openness towards all Europeans."
"The rules must therefore be made flexible so that all unnecessary barriers are removed."
"However, the transitional rules must only be abolished once we have made sure that people travelling here from Eastern Europe are not being exploited."
"The transitional rules in Denmark serve as protection against exploitation and ensure that workers receive the wages provided for by collective agreements."
"Eastern European labour is too often exploited by employers who pay wages significantly below the norm and allow their employees to work under miserable conditions."
"We have a responsibility to defend workers’ freedom of movement, which is a fundamental right in the EU."
"However, it is also our responsibility to defend employees’ conditions and to guarantee that everyone receives proper wages and enjoys proper working conditions."
"The transitional conditions were, and are, an attempt to attend simultaneously to both considerations."
"We have no minimum wage in Denmark."
"The transitional rules have therefore made it possible to monitor the influx of workers from Eastern Europe so that efforts could be concentrated on those employers who have tried to circumvent the rules governing wages and working conditions."
"The time is ripe for slowly phasing out the restrictions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in times of uncertainty, the European Union must return to its basic principles."
"We now need to complete the implementation of the four freedoms that form the basis of the internal market."
"The free movement of workers still needs to be implemented and, to that end, it is vital to lift the restrictions imposed when the new Member States acceded as soon as possible."
"This distrust is misplaced, because we can see that, in the 15 countries where the restrictions have been lifted, there have been no massive influxes."
"Surprisingly, only 2% of European citizens work outside their country, whereas a third of Americans live in a state other than the one in which they were born."
"The invasion is nothing but a fantasy, and the mobility of workers is a challenge."
"Mr Őry's report sets the objective of lifting the restrictions by 2009, and I support this objective."
"The French Prime Minister has also indicated that France would anticipate this movement by lifting these restrictions in a gradual and controlled manner."
"The resolution adopted by the European Trade Union Confederation in December 2005 opens up paths that reconcile the opening up of borders with appropriate protection."
"The amendments adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs go down this route, in order to ensure that employment law is applied in the Member States, specifically to ensure that Community standards are implemented, in particular those in the posting of workers directive, and in order to look into the creation of a European centre to coordinate the inspection services of the Member States."
"By producing standardised statistics on Community migration, we will be able to set up the toolkit for a social Europe within the Union, which will confirm that the free movement of workers must not be synonymous with dumping or the lowest common social denominator, but must be a factor in the economic dynamism that will enable us to iron out pockets of under-employment."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr Őry on producing an excellent report."
"I should like to make three brief points, the first of which concerns paragraph 1."
"As it came out of committee, it now calls on Member States to abolish the transitional measures in force."
"For many that has become the main focus of the report."
"I know that the rapporteur has felt pressured to table a compromise saying that Member States should consider abolishing those measures and specifically mentioning the three Member States that did not introduce them in the first place."
"Many in my group support the text as it now stands, feeling that we should be against any continuation of transitional measures."
"However, in saying that, they are reading it alongside paragraph 14, which says that Member States that continue to use such measures should take all steps to ensure that they do not continue beyond 2009."
"My second point concerns equal treatment."
"The rapporteur and others here today have made the point forcefully that it is not just a question of making sure that A8 workers have the right to freedom of movement of labour, we have to ensure inspection and enforcement regimes grant them full equal treatment and prevent exploitation in the 15."
"There have been serious breaches in both the UK and the Republic of Ireland."
"My final point relates to Directive 2003/109/EC, referred to by the Commissioner."
"It grants full access to the Member States’ labour markets for long-term resident third-country nationals."
"Parliament’s Legal Service has said this poses no danger of creating a situation where third-country nationals have greater access than A8 citizens."
"The Legal Service points out that Article 11 of the Directive says that Member States ‘may’ restrict equal treatment for third-country nationals in certain cases."
"Saying that Member States ‘may’ is not the same as saying they ‘must’ or that they ‘will’."
"The only way to guarantee equal treatment is to end transitional measures."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite the demands made by the Őry report, I am firmly convinced that both the transitional periods and freedom of movement can be maintained by those Member States that think it necessary to do so."
"If a country, with an eye to its own labour market and its economy, thinks it needs to continue to regulate access to the labour market, then it is perfectly entitled to do so. Here too, the ‘’ rule applies, and neither the Commission nor this House – perhaps not even a majority in the latter – should venture to exert pressure by making appeals to one country or another."
"To do so would be, as I see it, to misuse a highly volatile issue to whip up sentiment."
"Where this issue is concerned, I find myself unable to put Germany and Austria in the same bracket as Spain and Portugal."
"Germany is on the dividing line, and the conditions prevailing in it are quite different from those in the countries of Southern Europe."
"There is in this House so much talk of subsidiarity, yet suddenly, where the free movement of workers is concerned, Brussels and Strasbourg claim to know better than those on the ground in Germany or Austria."
"A few months ago, in its coalition agreement, the German Government reiterated its commitment to the transitional periods, and it did so not in jest, but on the basis of facts that have to be treated with respect."
"My country must continue to regulate access to the labour market for at least the next three years."
"What arrangements are to apply to the following two, must then be discussed on the basis of the new situation, and action then taken."
"By way of conclusion, let me point out that it was with this very problem in mind that there were great popular misgivings about the eastward enlargement, and yet we were always able to say: ‘There is nothing to fear; these issues have been regulated by treaty for five or seven years.’"
"Mr President, 1 May 2004 is a day that I shall always remember."
"On that day, I stood, together with Dr Otto von Habsburg, on the border between Slovenia and Austria and took part in a solemn ceremony."
"What was being celebrated was the fact that, as Slovenia became a member of the EU, a town that had undergone a post-war division into two parts – one of which came to belong to Austria and the other to Slovenia – was now being reunited."
"The symbolism was clear and, standing there, I felt strongly that people did not feel that they were entering something new but felt that they were being reunited with something of which they had always been a part."
"That, moreover, is the way things are."
"The EU’s ten new Member States are ten old countries of Europe."
"It is just that Communism had kidnapped them for 50 years, and now they are finally reunited with us."
"In the run-up to this reunification, Sweden’s Social Democrats had painted horrific pictures of how our country would be invaded by foreign workers who would dump our wages and exploit our social benefits."
"I and my party fought in the Swedish Parliament to prevent our country from introducing transitional rules."
"We wanted the new countries, which had for so long suffered under Communism, now to enjoy the freedoms brought about by EU membership."
"We refused to accept the Social Democrats’ propaganda and demonstrated the nature of real solidarity."
"We won the battle, and Sweden never introduced any transitional rules."
"Evaluations carried out now show unambiguously that Sweden has not in the least been exposed to the social dumping invoked by the Social Democrats as a scare tactic. Instead, freedom of movement has only had positive effects on the Swedish economy."
"The other countries that did not introduce transitional rules have also had the same experience."
"I have to say, moreover, that it was with great disappointment that I learned of several countries’ decision to extend their transitional rules."
"To do so when the scenarios invoked did not materialise is unreasonable."
"The only correct thing to do is to refrain from introducing transitional rules, and I hope that, in future, Europe will be influenced more by reason than by fear."
"We all know perfectly well that the free movement of workers is one of the four fundamental freedoms on which the whole idea of the European Community is based."
"However, we also know that this freedom is only valid and fully established only for citizens of the fifteen old Member States, while citizens of the eight new Member States, which became members on 1 May 2004, are subject to the provisions of the transition period and this transition period may last as long as seven years in accordance with the 2+3+2 year formula."
"As if this were not enough, according to certain EU directives, in some cases, long-term residents from third countries enjoy rights, which give them a more privileged status than citizens of the eight new Member States, to live and enter the labour market in fifteen EU Member States."
"And this means that by demonstrating solidarity with workers from third countries, we are discriminating against workers from the new EU Member States."
"As the first transition period ends on 30 April, we have a perfect opportunity to evaluate its consequences and effects on the economies of both the fifteen old Member States and the eight new Member States and to make appropriate decisions."
"True, we lack statistical data on immigration in the heart of the Community."
"It is difficult to come to objective conclusions, but today, it is already obvious that immigration from third countries greatly exceeds the flow of immigration at the heart of the EU, that is in the fifteen old Member States and the whole of the enlarged EU."
"It is also obvious that the countries which opened their labour markets to citizens of the new countries have really only benefited, while the transition periods encourage illegal work, unfair working conditions, discrimination against and exploitation of migrant workers."
"I am convinced that the European Parliament must encourage Member States to abolish the provisions of the transition period currently in force, as there are more than enough reasons to do this."
"Mr President, today’s debate is surely of vital importance as it concerns employment, the economy and the free movement of persons."
"It is appropriate to pose a key question, namely should labour markets be opened when there are job vacancies and a shortage of indigenous workers, in other words a shortage of people willing to work?"
"Allow me to reiterate. I referred to a lack of people willing to work, not to the unemployed."
"Alternatively, should labour markets be opened up so as to generate economic growth, which will lead to the creation of new jobs?"
"My convictions and experience to date indicate that opening up the labour market of a given country will generate economic growth and new jobs."
"We should bear in mind that increased employment and job creation will only be possible if we introduce genuine economic reforms, not just cosmetic changes."
"Entrepreneurs need to be convinced of the need for such reforms, but above all we must win over the trade union sector."
"Although these changes tend to be painful in the short term, they have a positive effect in the medium and long term."
"I shall now move on to a very opportune question, as we are involved in negotiations at WTO level."
"To what extent and at what pace should world trade be liberalised so as to achieve economic growth within the EU and create new jobs?"
"We would then avoid becoming simply an area where imported goods are consumed, with limited capacity for production."
"Finally, it is important to prepare for flexibility and mobility of the labour force."
"I believe that resources from the national and Union budgets must be devoted to reskilling and training for new occupations."
"At present it seems that despite high unemployment, we lack skilled workers …"
"I have listened with interest to the debate on Mr Őry’s report and I must say it has been exceptionally far-reaching, throwing light from many angles and many viewpoints onto the issue of freedom of movement for workers."
"Allow me to add to the debate one further strand that has not received mention."
"A transitional period has formed part of every enlargement of the EU, and every enlargement has been dominated by major fears, and these fears have, in every instance, failed to materialise."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the current Accession Treaty therefore provides for a gradual system made up of several stages, designed so that the final stage, in 2011, will be as short as possible."
"I am therefore delighted to be able to say now that, from 1 May this year, Europe will be making significant progress towards complete freedom of movement for workers."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like once again to thank you for a debate that has been very serious, very far-reaching and often very sharp – just as befits this serious topic."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The report of Mr Csaba Őry on the transitional system restricting the free movement of workers on the labour market of the European Union refers to the fundamental values of the European Union."
"The free movement of workforce is one of the most important fundamental principles of the European Union, and therefore we must reject any restrictions imposed on it, not only from economic, but also from political considerations."
"I agree with the statements of the report to the effect that workers coming from third countries should not be granted a more favourable situation than those arriving from EU Member States."
"The discriminating regulations in force contradict the political requirement for the strengthening of the European identity."
"The knowledge and feeling of belonging to the European Community can only be strengthened in citizens of new Member States if Member States provide equal rights in the area of employment and access to social benefits."
"I agree with the proposal calling on the Commission, the Member States, the social partners and the competent bodies of the private and public sector to develop a fair and transparent procedure to ensure that citizens of new Member States can work in all Member States of the European Union without discrimination, for appropriate wages, and with the provision of acceptable health and safety conditions."
"Since statistical data clearly show that employing workers arriving from new Member States is not disadvantageous for old Member States, and on the contrary, it actually contributes to their economic development, the antagonism felt by citizens of the fifteen Member States must be reduced by all available means, and the European requirement of the free movement of labour must be laid down in national laws, in accordance with the transitional regulation."
"Mr President, on a point of order, last week at the Conference of Presidents, the dates for the 2007 calendar were issued."
"The deadline for the tabling of amendments was yesterday evening at 19.00."
"In this House we have very strict rules that we must have original signatures for amendments to be tabled, but a whole bunch of my colleagues were held up in transit yesterday, did not arrive until after 19.00 and were therefore unable to sign amendments that had been circulated by the Campaign for Parliamentary Reform, amongst others."
"I know that you will not be able to change the Rule concerned at this particular point in time, but could you please look at it, because in just about every report we have a decent period of time to table amendments, but on the calendar of our sittings we have no time at all."
"– We shall look into it, Mr Heaton-Harris."
". Mr President, as the text has been almost completely eviscerated of its substance, I withdraw my name from the report and call on Parliament to reject it."
"– Mr President, in the sentence which starts with the phrase 'stresses the importance' and ends with the word 'subsidies', it is suggested that a word be added."
"This sentence would therefore be reworded as follows: 'Stresses the importance, therefore, of achieving positive results in reducing and eliminating its domestic subsidies'."
"– That concludes voting time."
"We have voted in favour of the amendments concerning European coordinators, since we believe that a voluntary and temporary coordination function may fulfil a purpose, especially in the case of cross-border projects."
"The June List believes that the EU Member States should cooperate on cross-border issues when cooperation contributes added value."
"Trans-European energy networks constitute such an issue, and we therefore also voted in favour of the report as a whole when it was debated earlier in Parliament."
"Quite a few of the amendments we voted on today are, however, unnecessarily bureaucratic, and the extra cost and the administrative burdens that these would entail are disproportionate to the potential benefits."
"We have therefore voted against these amendments."
". I should like to congratulate Mrs Laperrouze on her firm and timely recommendation for a second reading on the Council common position for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks."
"I endorse the rapporteur's view that it is necessary to reinstate into the proposal before us the provisions providing for the declaration of European interest and the appointment of a European coordinator for such matters."
"These measures are essential for properly completing the internal market for gas and electricity, which would guarantee security of supply."
"Also in this regard, I wish to highlight the positions expressed on such matters in recent European Councils."
". This is a unique opportunity to show the citizens that we are ready to develop a genuine European energy policy."
"We must therefore ensure that we have all the necessary instruments and tools to meet this objective."
"The trans-European energy networks will foster interconnections, interoperability and the development of energy networks in the enlarged Europe, and in turn stimulate the effective operation of the internal market."
"The construction of the future internal gas and electricity market is perhaps the most relevant objective of the proposal for a decision before us."
"Furthermore, the aim is to adapt the guidelines to the new shape of a European Union of 25 Member States, allow funding to be earmarked for projects of common interest, enable the internal market in gas and electricity to be completed, and, above all, to guarantee security of supply by means of interconnections between Member States and with neighbouring countries (south-east Europe, Mediterranean countries, Ukraine, Belarus). This approach to trans-European energy networks mirrors the approach followed for trans-European land transport networks."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Laperrouze report."
"– Mr President, there is no doubt about the importance of the campaign against undeclared employment as a means of counteracting negative trends in the labour markets, but the free movement of workers – contrary to what was hoped – will not enable us to get a grip on this problem."
"Those employers who want to get out of paying social security contributions will continue to do so in the future."
"Something else that is dubious is the way in which more and more businesses are forcing their staff into fictional self-employment as another way of attempting to evade standards on wages and minimum social security provision, and we must stop this development going any further."
"Over and over again, we ram home the point that an improvement in the employment situation is essential, but, at the same time, the EU encourages workers to be mobile and more flexible, even though studies have proved that the reality is that new forms of work – such as part-time working – do nothing more than share out a scarcely-changing amount of work around more people."
"We are not being energetic enough in counteracting these developments, and it is for that reason that I have voted against this report."
"– Mr President, the MEPs belonging to the Free Democratic Party did participate in the vote on the report (No A6-0086/2006) on the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States."
"We did this out of a desire to express solidarity with our colleagues in promoting our group’s concerns, whilst nevertheless remaining convinced that employment policy is not a matter for the EU, and that this should be dealt with by the Member States rather than by us here in Strasbourg or in Brussels."
"If the European Union wants to be successful, it must concentrate on its essential functions, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, which needs, in future, to be taken seriously and adhered to."
"In principle I am opposed to this type of report in which, on eminently routine matters within a particular policy area, Parliament repeats already known positions and reaffirms its overall good will."
"This does not contribute to greater confidence in Parliament, and it legitimises the position of those who want to see ever greater EU intervention even in such areas of policy, in this case employment policy, that should be the province of the individual Member States and be exposed to competition."
"I have, however, chosen to vote in favour, and for an important reason: freedom of movement of the labour force."
"Those decisions that have permitted transitional rules that discriminate against workers in the new Member States are a flagrant departure from the principle of the freedom of movement of labour and an absolutely disgraceful way of acting towards the EU’s new Member States which have been very enthusiastic about joining the EU."
"Experience from countries that have had limited transitional rules, or none at all, has emphatically shown that there is no need for such rules and that the ‘invasion’ that certain political leaders had threatened would happen has to no degree materialised."
"Rather, there is a need to attract more people who want to work instead of putting obstacles in the way of those who wish to do so."
"The need clearly to point all this out and clearly to express Parliament’s rejection of any form of extension of such obstacles is, for me, a perfectly good reason for supporting the report."
"Although the Kovacs report on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States, on which we are voting today, raises points relating to equality between men and women and fighting against discrimination, it does not mention what we consider to be the crucial issue, namely that of protecting workers’ rights."
"Accordingly, taking account of the National Reform Programmes submitted by the Member States and the measures put forward for complying with these guidelines, we have tabled amendments to the report aimed at making the guidelines more workable and easier to timetable, thus ensuring effective implementation of women's rights, access to high-quality public education and training, the creation of stable jobs with rights, and more public investment in health and housing."
"Unfortunately the majority in Parliament rejected our proposals. We were therefore unable to vote in favour of the report, although we do support some of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"We therefore abstained from the vote on the report, and voted against the legislative resolution on the employment guidelines, which appear to pave the way for openly liberal economic guidelines."
". The reports produced by the European Parliament regarding employment and social policies rehash a tiresome vein of European sermonising that, apart from producing a mountain of paper, has had no results at all."
"Besides the failure of the Lisbon process, which we see every day, this poorly finished replastering over the guidelines from a decidedly ‘indecisive’ decision by the Council is not going to save employment and the economy in France."
"The dish proposed tries to please everyone."
"It retains the Commission's liberalism, but at the same time states that the European institutions should give themselves greater control over self-governed nations."
"To make it more attractive, the whole thing is garnished with good intentions when it comes to protecting the weakest within this monstrous model, which they happily mix up with immigration, and have a history of not putting up with any arguments on this issue."
"However, it is precisely on these points that we can find the answer to our problems."
"If our economy and employment are going to rise like a phoenix from the ashes, we need to put a stop to immigration for the purpose of increasing the population, pursue policies to increase the birth rate, and apply Community preference and protection in Europe and national protection in France."
". The guidelines for Member States’ employment policies challenge the EU, rightly in my view, to respond to some of the essential employment issues."
"Their concerns rightly focus on the question of those excluded from labour markets, such as younger and older people and other similarly marginalised citizens, either in their own countries or in other Member States."
"I feel, however, that there is a balance to be struck between challenging Community and national institutions and advocating appropriate, effective solutions."
"The debate on employment policies has a European dimension that should not be overlooked."
"This has, in fact, been a constant concern of mine as an MEP, because I feel that reformist synergies need to be created in the European area and that Parliament is one of the most appropriate institutions to achieve this objective."
"The primacy of competition is one of the pillars of the internal market and has underpinned the process of liberalisation and privatisation in key sectors such as energy, transport and communications. This process has been stepped up since 2000 with the adoption of the Lisbon Strategy."
"It is clear that what has been implemented thus far has not only failed to bring the promised price reductions, improved access to and quality of services and an end to monopolies; far from it."
"It has, rather, served to exacerbate unemployment arising from restructuring and mergers of these sectors and the loss of State sovereignty in relation to key areas."
"Although the report claims it seeks to combat dominant positions and monopolies, it accepts the guidelines of the Commission report for 2004, focusing on energy and telecommunications, and advocates once again the total liberalisation of the gas and electricity sector, a priority for the March 2006 Spring Council."
"Furthermore, in the communications sector, which has already been substantially liberalised, the emphasis is placed on competition in the broadband sector and on the internationalisation of production. This will make it even easier to relocate production or links in the production chain."
"We therefore voted against."
". The explanatory statement to Mr Lipietz's report is much more instructive than the report itself, which contents itself with heaping praise on the Commission's 'remarkable' work in hunting down the slightest hindrance to free competition."
"The explanatory statement expresses regret at the lack of studies into the real effects of Commission decisions or into the dogmatic application of the rules on State aid."
"It mentions that the market, in other respects perfectly virtuous, may not be able on its own to achieve certain political and even economic objectives."
"It suggests that the liberalisation of certain markets has led to the good old public monopolies being replaced by private oligopolies, thus taking away the benefits without creating any added value for consumers."
"Finally, it emphasises the Commission's total lack of self-criticism when its ill-judged decisions lead to economic disasters, as in the Rhodia affair, for example."
"The general impression that comes out, however, is that Brussels' competition policy is the expression of the Commission's ultraliberal doctrine against 'economic patriotism', paradoxically put into practice by a nit-picking bureaucracy that continually interferes in business strategies and national policies."
"In the context of vicious global competition, that will generate nothing but unemployment."
"– European competition policy has rules and objectives which will destroy small and medium-sized businesses and allow the European monopolies to take over, by financing and privatising them, rather than consumer interests, as you hypocritically maintain."
"Moreover, the word 'competitiveness' is synonymous with greater exploitation of the workers, with the massacre of their rights and with reductions in the reward for labour, when contemporary requirements are increasing."
"Legislation on competition is at the service of the anti-grass roots Lisbon Strategy and its objective is to control, prevent and shrink any subsidies or state aid to satisfy grass-roots requirements which the workers may have extracted with their struggles."
"It is a lie that competition helps to reduce consumer prices."
"Experience to date has illustrated the opposite: the markets have been shared out, profits have increased for companies and prices have increased for the workers."
"Is it not also in the name of competition that young people are being led into sweatshop working conditions which will be extended to all workers?"
"Young people in France are right to protest and we stand by them."
"They constitute the hope for radical change against the exploitative policies of the EU and the governments, which is why we are with them."
"Mr President, I would like to say a few words about Hammerstein Mintz’s report and voting behaviour."
"I do support openness, but I am also in favour of a certain degree of realism."
"It is perfectly obvious that the Council meetings should be open, but in points 14 and 15 this Parliament voted in favour of the meetings of COREPER, the Permanent Representatives – that is to say the ambassadors of the EU – being open, and those of the Conciliation Committee too."
"We can certainly insist on this, but one would assume that the Council also has the right to insist that all our group meetings, preparatory meetings and all meetings of the Conference of Presidents should be open."
"I therefore support openness, but I do not think that it is realistic to insist on openness on the part of COREPER."
". I voted in favour of Mr Hammerstein Mintz's report on the openness of meetings of the Council when acting in its legislative capacity."
"At a time like this, when it is becoming necessary to move towards a political Europe, it is increasingly difficult to understand why the European Council continues to meet behind closed doors when acting in its legislative capacity."
"Besides the fact that this position is contrary to Article 1(2) of the Treaty on European Union (Maastricht Treaty of 7 February 1992), which lays down the principle of open European decision-making, it also does not provide the openness that our fellow citizens expect from the running of the European institutions."
"We will never be able to reduce the divide between the European structures and the people by acting this way."
"Pending the ratification of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, the European Council must, as a matter of urgency, reform its own rules of procedure to anticipate this move towards greater openness in its deliberations when meeting in its legislative capacity, whilst maintaining privacy for exchanges between Heads of State or Government."
". I abstained from the vote on the openness of Council meetings, because I feel it deals with a false problem."
"By forcing the Council to work under the scrutiny of the cameras, we will end up with formal exchanges and backroom negotiations."
"All negotiations require a certain level of confidentiality."
"We are of the view that the Council’s and Coreper’s meetings must be public when those organisations act in a legislative capacity."
"This is an important democratic principle if voters are to be able to hold elected representatives accountable."
"Unfortunately, the draft report contains a number of points in support of the adoption of the draft Constitutional Treaty rejected in the referenda in France and the Netherlands."
"We have tried to get the relevant parts removed from the report by requesting separate votes on precisely these points."
"Irrespective of the outcome of these votes, we wish however to vote in favour of the report as a whole since reforms relating to openness in the Council’s and Coreper’s work is a priority issue, and we wish to put pressure on the Council to alter its Rules of Procedure."
"We are, however, strongly opposed to the way in which, in the context of this important issue of openness, the European Parliament’s majority has interfered in the debate on the future of the Constitutional Treaty."
". This report is a result of the European Parliament Ombudsman's inquiry into the openness of the Council."
"The European Parliament Ombudsman considers that the meetings of the Council, when it acts in its legislative capacity, are not open to the public and the Council's refusal to decide to open up these meetings is an instance of maladministration."
"This timely report follows on from the British Presidency's call for greater transparency."
"Moreover, public opinion polls and statements by NGOs, civil society and the academic world underscore citizens' wishes for increased accountability of their governments regarding EU issues."
"I agree it is unacceptable that an important lawmaking body of the EU still meets behind closed doors when acting as a legislator, especially at a time when the EU sees itself as a promoter of democratisation and accountability."
"I am therefore in favour of public meetings of the Council to be broadcast and webcast, as well as for official transcripts of the legislative meetings to be issued."
"The requested amendments to the Council should be regarded as a long overdue adaptation of the Council to the European reality and institutional equality in lawmaking."
". I heartily congratulate my Group colleague, Mr Hammerstein Mintz, on this crucial report, as it cuts to the heart of so many of the problems the EU faces today."
"In Scotland where I come from, as in so many countries the biggest confusion about the EU is the lack of transparency and the feeling that the EU is somehow not accountable; and to my mind all of this stems from the Council of Ministers meeting behind closed doors, often in the dead of night."
"For an organisation that talks so much about openness, we see little of it in practice outside of this House, and opening the doors of the Council would go so far towards informing the people of Europe about what is being done in their name."
"This report is only the start of that process and we must continue to press this crucial issue."
". I should like to congratulate Mr Cashman on his important report containing recommendations to the Commission on access to the institutions' texts, to which I lend my backing."
"I particularly welcome reference to the need for the Commission to submit a legislative proposal on ‘the right of access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, and general principles and limits on grounds of public or private interest governing this right of access’. This proposal must be prepared in interinstitutional debates and must follow detailed recommendations."
"We also share the view that the new rules on access to documents should be implemented only after the amended regulation has entered into force, without any retroactive effects."
". Since ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty and entry into force of Article 255 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC), transparency has become a fundamental principle of the European Union, the primary aim of which is to strengthen the democratic nature of the European institutions."
"This report calls on the Commission to create a legislative proposal on the right of access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents."
"Through this proposal, the report seeks to adhere to the principle of subsidiarity, the fundamental rights of citizens, the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, particularly on Article 8, and Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I am fully supportive of this report as I believe the EU not only has an obligation to be as open and transparent as possible to its citizens; it also has to take a leading role in setting an example to governments and parliaments of Member States as well as to those of accession and candidate countries."
". I congratulate Mr Cashman on this report and was pleased to support it today."
"The problems many Members have had over access to documents have been an issue all across the House and it is only right that we should be starting to address it here."
"I only hope we will see the aims of this report backed up by action."
"– Mr President, in the WTO, the EU is under pressure in various areas."
"On the one hand, we will have to accept certain changes in the interests of combating poverty in the poorest countries, while, at the same time, we are not allowed to be too generous in the unilateral concessions we make."
"The ACP countries, with their demands for reduced tariffs, risk harm to themselves."
"Since that surely cannot be what these negotiations are intended to achieve, I have voted against this report."
"At the same time, we have to prevent the threatened lifting of the ban on the import of genetically modified materials from being put into effect."
"The European Union has the chance to accomplish this by acting as a strong community on the international stage."
"Finally, we also need to resolve without delay the problem with the Chinese imposition of customs duties on motor vehicle components and replacement parts, or else the last car manufacturers will end up leaving Europe and heading for China."
". – I voted in favour of the outstanding report by my colleague and friend Mr Papastamkos on the assessment of the Doha Round following the December 2005 WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong."
"I feel that economies, and in particular western economies, should support the Doha development programme, which provides for a kind of open and fair trade that is designed to reduce poverty around the world by helping both developing and developed countries to move forward."
"If we do not do this, there will be a high political price to pay, in particular through the rise of extremism."
"I welcome the fact that these negotiations have recognised the ability of multilateralism and international trade to create wealth and, in turn, social progress."
"We will all be able to see how a unified, strong political European Union can play a prominent role on the world stage in this fight against a situation in which national self-interest prevails over weakened international institutions."
". The WTO is now trying to find solutions to problems that would never have existed at all without it and its attempts to force global free trade upon us, regardless of the cost to the people: dumping of all kinds, problems with counterfeiting, access to the market barred to most countries apart from those in the European Union, transparent subsidies (in Europe) or disguised ones (everywhere else, particularly in the United States) that distort competition, and so on."
"The global market is a jungle in which the weakest, the poorest, are the targeted victims, and the only region that actually respects the rules of the game, Europe, is a collateral victim."
"In order to support the development of the least-developed countries, we must not integrate them into the WTO, but protect them from it."
"Like certain Nobel economics prize-winners, we feel that free trade can only benefit all sides when it is between countries at the same level of development, and that trade between other countries needs to be regulated; this, by the way, does not rule out favourable trade provisions for the developing countries."
"Neither does it mean that each 'zone' formed in this way needs a common trade policy centralised in the hands of a supranational bureaucracy."
"In short, free trade is not an end in itself."
"This own-initiative report sheds light on the EU’s double standards in international trade policy."
"There is a lot of enthusiastic talk about the need for developing economies to open up their markets to European companies."
"At the same time, the rapporteur says that EU agriculture has a ‘multifunctional character’, which there is a ‘need to respect’."
"We believe that, in the long term, free trade leads to a better world."
"Account must, however, be taken of different countries’ levels of development."
"If, at the beginning too of the development process, trade is to have the effect of reducing poverty, the EU must modify its trade policy by abolishing agricultural aid and allowing poor countries to compete on good conditions."
"Because the report for the most part contains negative wordings, we voted against it in today’s vote."
". With this resolution, the majority in Parliament has sought to pave the way for the liberalisation of international trade – in the agriculture sector, non-agricultural products and services – in the current round of WTO negotiations, which it is hoped will be concluded by the end of 2006."
"The deepening of trade liberalisation – circumventing the current contradictions or weakening the positions that some of the so-called developing countries have hitherto advocated – would have extremely serious consequences for the workers and for people in general."
"Take the example of services."
"By 28 February, either the EU or the USA had submitted applications for the liberalisation of the following sectors: transport (air and sea), audiovisual and culture, information technology, construction, teaching, energy, the environment, telecommunications, distribution, architecture and engineering, postal, financial and legal services."
"This means that in relation to these sectors attempts are being made to remove any restrictions to foreign investment, cross-border establishment and provision of services, nationality requirements and limitations on competition."
"In other words, attempts are being made to remove mechanisms that are fundamental to less (or more) economically developed States being able to guarantee their development and meet the needs of their people. This will delight the large economic and financial groups in the EU and the USA, in their exploitative, inhuman greed."
". This report on the outcome of the Hong Kong WTO meeting comes at a crucial time, as the negotiations currently hang in the balance."
"We voted today to send a strong political signal to the negotiating parties, including the EU, to honour commitments to a successful conclusion of this round geared towards the poorest countries, as agreed at Doha."
"As Labour's spokesperson on International Trade, I submitted a number of amendments to this report at its committee stage."
"Then, as now, I called for the exclusion of key public services (including water) from liberalisation drives."
"On the paragraph relating to NAMA, I called for flexibility in the number and range of coefficients used in formulating tariff cuts, so as to leave adequate policy space for developing countries to choose the rate at which they liberalise."
"I voted for a similar amendment today."
"On agriculture, whilst I agree with the Commission's assessment that negotiations should be pursued in parallel with those of other sectors, I could not vote in favour of calls by some colleagues for the current EU offer to be made conditional and even retractable."
"I believe the current offer should at least be maintained."
". The Papastamkos report on the WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong has led us to make two remarks."
"Firstly, it should not be difficult to understand that international trade has tremendous potential to promote development and prosperity."
"On the one hand, the more commercial transactions, the higher the level of dependency and cooperation between the Member States. On the other hand, the more intense the international trade, the greater the economic prosperity of the various countries, which will help to improve people’s living conditions and to make the world a safer place."
"Secondly, the inevitable conclusion is that anyone wishing to see a world with more trade and more fair trade, a world in which the rules are complied with, will almost certainly leave the summit disappointed."
"As 2006 goes on, we are further and further away from the objective of successfully finishing the round, begun in 2001, by the end of this year."
"If this aim is to be achieved, however, we need to reach agreement on the advantages of free trade and on the rules to which that free trade needs to be subject."
". This report has been amended so much that it was not possible for me to support it, even though I agree with some of the points."
"The aims of the 'Make Poverty History' campaign and the march in Edinburgh last summer have so comprehensively not been met that it is a sorely missed opportunity."
"We could have sent a louder, clearer message today to our governments and to the European Commission."
"Instead we have virtually endorsed the status quo which I do not want to see continue."
". I should like to explain why I ultimately voted against the report in the final vote."
"It was because Amendment 22, which condemned the Commission's insistence on liberalising services within the EU and elsewhere without supporting this with appropriate social and environmental legislation, was rejected."
"I fully agree with the fact that no country should be forced to liberalise any service sector and that sectors such as health, water supply, education and audiovisual services in particular must be excluded from liberalisation."
"This part of the amendment was narrowly defeated: 291 in favour, 299 against and 20 abstentions."
"For that reason, I did not want to vote in favour during the final vote."
"– Τhe Kommounistiko Komma Elladas voted against the report on the assessment of the Doha Round, because it moves in and repeats the reactionary, anti-grass roots framework of the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong and the extravagant claims of Euro-unifying capital, as defined and promoted in splendid cooperation with the USA."
"The objective of the ΕU and the USA during the negotiations which are under way is even greater exploitation of the peoples and the wealth-producing resources of the developed, capitalist countries and even more of the developing and less developed countries."
"The ΕU and the USA, together with the other imperialist powers, are proceeding with the selective opening of the markets and the abolition of subsidies for agricultural products, to the detriment of small- and medium-sized farms, so that monopoly capital can penetrate the markets of the developing and less developed countries for full control of industrial products, the provision of services and the extortionate exploitation of water, energy and so forth, in order to maximise its profitability."
". I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague Mr Garcia-Margallo y Marfil on the situation of the European economy as part of the preparatory report on the broad economic policy guidelines for 2006, which underlines the conditions necessary for sustainable economic growth."
"This report is vital for a proper understanding of why Europe is one of the areas of the world, particularly of the developed world, where growth is weakest."
"The excessive red tape that makes our economy less flexible, the fact that we do not have enough world leaders and that our small and medium-sized enterprises are progressing less quickly than those in the United States of America, low unemployment levels and low mean working times, and, finally, weak investment in vocational training, research and development: all of this to a large extent explains the current situation."
"In the global economic and social competition with which Europe is faced, it is a matter of urgency for the Member States, via their national reform plans, to work with the European Union to create the conditions for achieving the Lisbon objectives that aim to make Europe the strongest economy in the world."
". Here we have yet another report on the economic situation; yet another reaffirmation of falsehoods; and solutions simply offering more of the same."
"The economic and social situation remains precarious, with increasing inequality, unacceptable levels of poverty and unemployment, and economic growth remaining slow and unstable."
"What we are seeing is the financial side prevailing over the actual economy, whereby the emphasis is placed on the need to inspire confidence via the narrow implementation of monetary policy by the European Central Bank and the Stability and Growth Pact, and on the need to reduce taxes for businesses."
"These positions are liberalism in its purest form, and we utterly reject them."
"What has happened in the name of globalisation? The rights of the workers and social security have been undermined, greater flexibility in labour markets have been imposed (the magical concept of ‘flexicurity’, the CPE (First Employment Contract) in France being a prime example), the increase in the actual and official retirement age has been justified, the liberalisation of the energy sector has been promoted and the liberalisation of services has been called for, thus contributing towards labour deregulation and social and environmental dumping."
"This is great news for the economic and financial groups. As usual it is the workers and the least privileged sections of society that have to bear the brunt of the problems."
"Hence our vote against."
". Just like every year, the European Parliament's report on the broad economic policy guidelines is, in its observations, a catalogue of truisms and, in its proposals, a list of recommendations that Members on both the left and the right of this Parliament will adopt enthusiastically, but that the parties they belong to are careful not to apply when they are in power in their own countries."
"Besides this hypocrisy, I should like to underline three points that I found surprising: there is a complete lack of reference to the European Central Bank's unjustified increases of interest rates, which are contributing to the stagnation of the eurozone; the report views the European Union as a perfectly homogeneous area, made up of countries facing absolutely identical problems, while in fact the situation has become extremely heterogeneous since the last enlargement; and the call for European legislation that is 'compatible with that of our competitors' could constitute an unacceptable call for the lowest common social and environmental denominator."
"Even if we did not already consider that it was the policies of Brussels as a whole that were largely responsible for our economic difficulties, these three points would have been enough to justify our 'no' vote."
". I did not approve the broad economic policy guidelines, which, for a number of years, have done nothing but endorse the EU's liberal tendencies and are at the root of the weak growth, unemployment, uncertainty for employees and the withdrawal of our social protections."
"The report does not support any of the guidelines that would allow an alternative policy: maintenance of purchasing power, revaluation of salaries to revive consumer spending and growth, support for ambitious public investment in modernisation and employment, upward harmonisation of taxation and social standards to combat dumping, and the creation of a real economic government that has weight with the European Central Bank."
", . – The EU broad economic policy guidelines for 2006 include all the anti-grass roots measures which will bring about higher prices and greater inequality, poverty, uncertainty and unhappiness for the working class and grass-roots classes and greater wealth for Euro-unifying capital."
"This has been safeguarded in the National Reform Programmes, so that the noose of capitalist barbarity preached in the Lisbon Strategy can throttle the people quickly and with precision."
"There are numerous alibis: the ageing of the population in order to increase retirement ages, energy security in order to privatise the energy sector and convert it from a social to a commercial commodity, reduction in deficits as required under the Stability Pact by 'containing' public spending on grass-roots requirements and salary/productivity links in order to safeguard reductions in wages and pensions."
"At the same time, we have tax relief and simplified procedures in order to set up companies, flexible forms of work, lifelong training for market requirements and state aid and research at the service of companies, not the needs of society."
"It is the new attack by the ΕU on the working class and young people which only a strong mass movement can rebut; only a strong mass movement can open up new paths by putting into practice the huge wealth which is produced and must be reaped by its creators, the workers, not their exploiters."
". I have supported this report in its intention to alleviate the costs for many of the poorest countries for healthcare and drugs."
"Whilst I support the intention of Amendment 3 in alleviating these costs, the amendment is inappropriate as it provides for a blanket limit to all patient protection for products related to this field which could distort markets at a global level and potentially harm further development."
". I welcome the thrust of the concerns and recommendations contained in the broad economic policy guidelines for 2006."
"At this time, the debate should focus on workable decisions aimed at making the economic environment more conducive to growth, jobs, competition, innovation and wealth creation. We should not be wasting our energy on peripheral matters or, equally seriously, on what should be self-evident."
"The EU Member States, and their political leaders, have a duty to promote a political environment that is favourable to economic reform."
"What is urgently needed is discourse characterised by truth, courage and results."
"We need to be bold and to challenge our societies to invest in the future and in themselves. We need to be capable of creating the necessary conditions for that investment to take place."
"The future is not necessarily anything to fear. Yet most European governments appear fearful."
"It is because this report rejects that way of thinking and because it comes across as a challenge to take action with workable objectives and proposals, most of which I agree with, that I have supported it."
". I voted against the García-Margallo y Marfil Report because of its support for the Commission's Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base proposal, as stated in paragraph 16."
"This CCCCTB proposal clearly sets out the path to tax harmonisation, that great but mostly unspoken threat to Irish prosperity."
"Likewise I am opposed to the Home State Taxation scheme for SMEs."
"This harmonisation of taxes is directly opposed to the wishes of the Irish people."
"If we have a common European corporate tax regime, we will lose one of the greatest factors in maintaining our economic independence and our current state of prosperity."
"I see this as the thin end of the wedge to force a common European tax policy on Ireland."
"I have to advise the Irish Government to pay careful attention to this space, where our freedom is threatened, and to defend it most vigorously."
"It is the refrain from Irish Government circles that: No, there is no plan to harmonise taxes, and if there were, the Irish Government would reject it."
"Well, here it is, sticking its nose over the horizon; it's time for you to prove your mettle."
". Whilst we support the intention of Amendment 3 to alleviate the costs of healthcare and drugs for many of the poorest countries, this amendment is inappropriate as it provides for a blanket limit to all patent protections for products related to this field, which could distort markets at a global level and, potentially, harm further development."
"These issues are best dealt with at the level of the UN and WHO."
"The EPLP maintains its position on the issue of corporate taxation, which is not to support a recalculation of the corporate tax base."
"Whilst we seek greater coordination of tax authorities in trying to assist SMEs involved in cross-border trade, we acknowledge that this issue remains the competence of the EU Member States."
"The next item is the Commission communication on the amended proposal for a directive on services in the internal market and Communication on Directive 96/71/EC (posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services)."
"As everybody knows, this is the amended proposal for the so-called ‘Bolkestein Directive’ following its first reading in Parliament."
". Mr President, when we debated this proposal at the February part-session I said that the Commission would base its modified proposal on what Parliament voted."
"I believe you will see that we have honoured that commitment in the text adopted by the College today."
"We have endeavoured to respect the consensus you have reached on some of the key articles."
"You will find the amendments you have voted to Article 16 – freedom to provide services – and Article 17 – derogations from freedom to supply services – reflected in the modified proposal."
"We have excluded all healthcare from the scope of the proposal and, in line with the commitment given, we will come forward with a separate initiative on the health sector."
"The modified proposal also provides for the exclusion of taxation, temporary work agencies, security services and the audiovisual sector from the scope of the proposal."
"One issue on scope where we did not follow you is the exclusion of legal services."
"The Commission considers this is not required given that Article 3 already provides that in case of conflict between a specific directive and this proposal it is the former that will prevail."
"In addition, we have brought the wording on the exercise of an official authority in line with Article 45 of the EC Treaty."
"We have based the exclusion of social services on the various amendments you adopted in this regard."
"I am sure you will agree that any exclusion must be clearly defined, and this is what we have attempted to do."
"If we want to avoid diverging interpretation in Member States, then we must provide legal certainty."
"The text of the modified proposal specifies that the exclusion from the directive concerns those social services relating to social housing, children and support to families and persons in need which are provided by the state or by providers mandated by the state."
"In addition, the Commission will come forward in the next few weeks with a communication on social services of general interest, reflecting the importance these services have for our citizens."
"The decision to remove all interaction between the services proposal and labour law has in my opinion been one of the most important elements in creating a more positive atmosphere around this new services proposal."
"This has allowed us to move on from the allegations of lowering of social standards and threats to the European social model."
"While this perception was wrong, it did not go away, and poisoned the debate on this important proposal."
"In any event, the modified proposal is clear in this regard: labour law is completely removed."
"As part of the fallout from this, Articles 24 and 25 have been removed from the modified proposal."
"However, as I said during the debate in February, the Commission would come forward with a communication to address the issues surrounding the posting of workers, which Articles 24 and 25 were designed to address."
"In a moment my colleague Vladimir Špidla will outline to you the approach the Commission adopted today."
"I just want to add that this communication is a vital element in our efforts to reach agreement in the Council on the services proposal."
"There are two other issues in the modified proposal that I want to highlight."
"We have clarified in Article 3 that all special laws take precedence over the provisions of the services proposal."
"In particular, we have made it clear in Article 3 that the directive does not affect private international law and that, as a consequence, consumers will in principle benefit from the protection granted to them by the consumer protection rule laid down in the consumer legislation in force in their Member State."
"The Commission has also accepted that the professional liability insurance in Article 27 should be optional instead of compulsory."
"Since the European Parliament voted in February, there has been a growing realisation throughout the European Union that the consensus you achieved was the basis for taking this debate forward."
"Heads of Government at the European Council two weeks ago supported this."
"We have a window of opportunity for building on this growing consensus."
"I want to see the potential for growth and jobs that this proposal will bring realised as soon as possible."
"I will now present this modified proposal to the informal Competitiveness Council in Graz later this month."
"I feel confident that, with the active support of the Austrian Presidency and Member States, we stand a real chance of making significant progress during this Presidency."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has just adopted a communication containing instructions and explanations for Member States in respect of the posting of workers within the context of the cross-border provision of services."
"The communication also includes proposals aimed at helping the Member States to improve the practical implementation of administrative cooperation, access to information and supervising adherence to the directive on the posting of workers."
"The Commission announced this communication last February following voting on the Services Directive in the European Parliament, stating at the time that any annulment of Articles 24 and 25, which contain provisions on administrative obstacles to the posting of workers, would be decided on the basis of majority voting."
"The removal of these articles should not, however, be interpreted by Member States as meaning that they can introduce or retain excessive administrative obstacles against companies that are posting workers across national boundaries."
"The cross-border posting of workers is regulated under Directive 96/71/EC, the aim of which is to harmonise, on the one hand, the right of companies to provide cross-border services, and on the other hand the rights of workers temporarily posted to another state in order to provide services."
"The Directive is the main instrument for ensuring the free movement of services, and at the same time the main instrument for preventing social dumping."
"The legal explanation approved by the Commission today provides the necessary clarification in respect of which control measures may be used by Member States when monitoring whether the employment conditions set out in the Directive are being upheld."
"The aim is to ensure that Member States act in accordance with the principle of freedom of movement for services, while at the same time avoiding social dumping."
"The communication provides explanations and instructions for four types of control measure in particular: the requirement to obtain permission, the obligation to have a representative on the territory of the host Member State, the duty to declare and duties in respect of documents dealing with social and employment conditions."
"The conclusions of the communication are as follows: the obligation to have a representative on the territory of the host Member State is regarded as somewhat excessive, and it is considered sufficient if some of the workers – for example a manager – are appointed as contacts for the relevant authorities in the Member States."
"It is not considered reasonable that the duty to make a preliminary systematic declaration should be applied only on the grounds that a posted service is involved; the duty to retain documents is, of course, acknowledged, but this should apply only to documents that are absolutely necessary and which enable the authorities in the Member State to carry out effective support and control activities."
"It does not apply, for example, to social insurance documents, because these are dealt with under Directive 1408/71/EEC."
"It was also concluded that it is reasonable to request the preliminary notification of activities."
"Notifications must be made no later than the day on which the activities commence."
"The Commission intends to have easier access to information on employment conditions for workers and companies, and improved levels of cooperation between intra-state authorities."
"It is also essential to improve the resources available to workers and companies, in order to ensure the effective enforcement of employee regulations."
"On the basis of a study into the operation of the Directive which the Commission carried out and which can be found in the report from the Commission unit, we concluded that there is still much room for improvement in all areas, and the communication contains several proposals specified by the Member States for addressing these shortcomings."
"These include improvements to websites and other information resources, further resources for contact points and the bodies responsible for supervising the use of the electronic data transfer systems and improving contacts between work inspectorates."
"I regard as fairly important the suggestion that it is right for Member States to include in the information they provide details of the responsibilities that firms posting workers must fulfil, and not just general references to the employment law or legal system that applies in the Member State in question."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I firmly believe that the Posting of Workers Directive – provided it is applied correctly – constitutes an adequate and robust instrument for ensuring, on the one hand, the prevention of social dumping, and on the other hand, the free provision of services."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is not entirely dissatisfied with the state of affairs in respect of the services directive."
"In November, we in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection sounded the right note by holding out the prospect of a solid and even-handed document, and that is what was actually delivered."
"Encouraged by the Commission, we tabled proposals for sweeping changes which were subsequently met with a wall-to-wall majority in the plenary meeting."
"At the European spring summit – for surely that is what we can call it now – the Council congratulated us warmly, and we heard the Council express the wish for work to be continued on a services directive that opens up the markets whilst ensuring there is enough room for social protection."
"Today, we heard a detailed Commission position on our proposals and we notice that the Commission has kept its promise and remains very committed to supporting the line this House has taken."
"The services of general economic interest are retained, although, as we proposed, framed in a structure of their own."
"While the scope is limited, which is what we want, I would call on the Commissioner to take another look at how we should exactly define those social services."
"The directive has no impact on labour law whatsoever, and Commissioner Špidla explained the promised guidelines that pertain to the application of the posting of workers directive a moment ago."
"Fortunately, the consumer remains sufficiently protected in the end; the red tape is being trimmed down; and the freedom to provide services, as enshrined in Articles 16 and 17, is guaranteed."
"Whilst a different cooperation procedure may have been worked out for inspection purposes, we count on the Council to ensure that it works just as well as the one we had proposed."
"We know that a balance can be struck."
"This is something we would like to work towards, and we hope that the Austrian Council Presidency, with whom we are always prepared to enter into dialogue, will lead us to a directive that benefits the self-employed, professionals, consumers of services, consumers, employees, economic growth as a whole and creates many additional jobs."
"We wish the Council presidency the very best of success, and we are pleased that we did eventually get some positive cooperation out of the Commission."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its handling of the services directive, the Commission has leapt out from under the shadow that suddenly overspread it again last week."
"Commissioner McCreevy, my dear Charlie, as rapporteur and on behalf of my group, let me say how pleased I am that the Commission has kept the promise it made to this House and has done as it was bidden by the overwhelming majority in the plenary."
"I know that it took hours of work by the yesterday, but the most important law in Europe – second only to the Constitution – is now on the right track."
"We can accompany it down that road, or ought it to be said that the Commission is following where Parliament leads?"
"What we can say is that a crucial step has been taken in the direction of a social Europe, and I can tell the Commissioner that I am particularly pleased that the main bone of contention – the country of origin principle – has been binned."
"That is the greatest breakthrough as we work towards a social Europe."
"I am also very glad that you have done as this House has proposed and removed from the scope of the services directive such important areas as part-time working, security firms, the gambling industry and the whole of the health sector, although there is still a question mark over the exclusion of social services, and we will have to have further discussions on how the Commission's thinking in this respect is actually to be evaluated and interpreted."
"I am also glad that, contrary to what had formerly been feared, the services directive will be treated as secondary to the sectoral directives, something that this House saw as important, particularly in relation to the Posting of Workers Directive."
"I see what we have achieved as a major success for the people, for the social Europe, and, not least, for this House."
"By it, we, its Members, have demonstrated that we take seriously our rights in the service of the public."
"Matters are now in the hands of the Council of Ministers. Just how quickly we get proper legislation will depend on them."
". Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for the dynamism and promptness with which he submitted this speedily-drafted document."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe would go as far as to say that it represents an advance on the position which the European Parliament adopted, which is a good thing for employment in Europe."
"The ALDE Group takes the view that creating jobs is the best social structure there is, more so than protecting what we have achieved thus far."
"Unfortunately, there are a number of factors and sectors that remain excluded, which Member States could exploit in order to protect their own markets."
"That is what we call protectionism and is likely to result in many legal proceedings at the European Court of Justice."
"There are still container concepts, such as gambling, the audiovisual sector, and the list goes on, and what they cover is left to the Member States to decide."
"We would have preferred to see a much tighter definition and delineation of what is excluded and what is not."
"Unfortunately, there is no support for this at the moment, and more time may well be required."
"We hope that people will come to realise this."
"Sometimes, as is the case in France, this can cause problems if you want to reform in order to secure our current achievements and prosperity, not least for the sake of our children."
"Millions of people are still, every Tuesday, taking to the streets to protest."
"What a shame!"
"Politicians are there to take long-term decisions and, occasionally, to be re-elected in the very short term."
"Sometimes, we opt for the latter."
"In any case, we feel that a step has been taken in the right direction."
"We supported the proposal at first reading."
"We hope that some more light will be shed as to why a number of sectors are excluded."
"For example, as you mentioned yourself, the definitions should become less ambiguous so that it becomes more difficult for Member States to protect their incoming services from others."
"After all, mobility and dynamism in the economy will need to be improved and strengthened in the internal market if we are to be capable of competing with other large economic regions in the world."
"I think that that is how we can hold onto our prosperity."
"I thank you and hope that a positive outcome can be achieved very quickly during the forthcoming Council."
".Mr President, Commissioners, I think we should be delighted that the Commission has yielded to the double pressure of the European Parliament and of the Council."
"I believe that, given the current state of affairs in Europe, this is a shining example of the fact that parliamentary democracy within the European Union can work and that the Commission can effectively take on board the amendments voted for by the European Parliament."
"The European Parliament has substantially improved the Commission’s original proposal."
"That being so, I wish to emphasise the fact that the fundamental objections that we made, and which justified our group’s unanimous vote against it, still remain."
"They mainly concern two points: the scope of the Directive and the confirmed inclusion of services of general economic interest."
"Our group is in favour of a specific directive on services of general economic interest because we fear that their inclusion in this directive may stand in the way of any new proposal by the Commission."
"The second objection concerns the compromise reached on Article 16, which does not increase the legal certainty of the text and in fact takes us back to the case law of the Court, as well as to the requirement for the Court to give a ruling on a case by case basis, contrary to the wishes of the Commission and of Parliament."
"The ball is now in the court of the Council, to whom it falls to define its common position."
"In this respect, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance unanimously calls for the Council to amend and to improve this text, particularly in relation to the two points that I have just mentioned."
". Mr President, Commissioners, in any battle, it is advisable to assess each stage correctly."
"One must neither underestimate the points scored, otherwise one encourages defeatism, nor overestimate what seems to have been won, for fear of setting oneself up for disillusionment."
"In the case of the so-called ‘Bolkestein’ draft directive, where are we in this respect?"
"The points scored at first reading in Parliament by the opponents of the original text are undeniable."
"The removal of the reference to the country of origin principle and the adjustment to the actual application of the Directive are the most symbolic setbacks imposed on the hard-liners of liberal Europe."
"The exclusion of a number of sectors from the scope of the Directive and the granting to the host country of supervisory powers, which are, nonetheless, limited, conditional and difficult to implement, are also significant factors."
"Finally, the exclusion of labour law takes us back to the law currently in force."
"We shall examine the Commission’s new text under a microscope."
"If it appeared that the Commission was trying to reclaim part of the ground that it had had to concede, particularly by granting itself any automatic right of supervision, that would, in our opinion, constitute an unacceptable claim."
"If, on the other hand, it turned out that the Commission has included Parliament’s demands in its new revised draft directive, that would be both a fresh sign of the growing importance of our Assembly within the European institutional triangle and also, and perhaps most importantly, this would be the confirmation of the formative influence of the citizens’ sudden emergence in the European debate, especially since a certain 29 May 2005."
"That just shows you that our group has no intention of denying these developments."
"Having said that, however, does the result achieved to date manage to curb this craze for competition between workers, against which our fellow citizens are rising in ever-greater numbers?"
"That is the real question, and our answer is ‘no’."
"Apart from the exceptions stated, the Directive in its amended form in fact reinforces rules establishing a form of integration that is no longer based on harmonisation of legislation, but on freedom of the market."
"The present circumstances and the weight of the in this respect merit our renewed attention, especially at a time of the enlargement of the European Union to include countries whose social standards are attractive to economic and political leaders obsessed with lowering costs and lifting ‘barriers to competition’ in the notorious free market economy in which competition is open and undistorted."
"How are we prepared to depart from this repressive logic?"
"When the time comes for the great open debate on the future of the European Union, that is the central issue on which I propose opening up the discussion, particularly on the left."
". Mr President, Commissioners, I am bound to express the tremendous disappointment I felt following your presentation of the Commission communication today."
"The amended text of the directive on services lacks precision and its wording is frequently unclear."
"Countries opposed to a free market in services are bound to take advantage of these shortcomings."
"Commissioner McCreevy, at a meeting of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection two weeks ago, you stated that the excellent must not be allowed to stand in the way of the good."
"That is certainly true, but do you really believe that this draft, which represents the outcome of two years’ work on the liberalisation of the market in services within the European Union, is actually good?"
"Do you consider that the directive as it stands is an appropriate response to the expectations of the European economy at a time when global competition is becoming ever more intense?"
"I find it hard to understand the stance adopted by the governments of certain Member States of the old Fifteen."
"They are pursuing a short-sighted and selfish policy, and are hindering competition within the European Union."
"As to the inaction and peculiar apathy demonstrated by the European Commission, I simply cannot come to terms with that at all."
"The Commission is supposed to be governed first and foremost by the interests of the European Union as a whole."
"It is supposed to strive to achieve at least the aims enshrined in the Lisbon Strategy."
"Two months ago the European Parliament turned the draft directive upside down, as Mrs Gebhardt so aptly put it at the time."
"This was the result of a most unfortunate compromise between the two largest political groups in the House."
"Nonetheless, the Commission did then assure advocates of a free market in services that alternative arrangements would be made to compensate for the removal of liberal provisions from the draft."
"I refer in particular to Article 24 and Article 25, which were intended to eliminate the barriers currently encountered by posted workers."
"It is now clear that the European Commission has failed to honour this promise."
"To all intents and purposes, the document it has prepared on posting workers is simply a description of the barriers now in place."
"It does not contain proposals for sanctions of any kind against countries blocking posted workers."
"It is, however, incumbent on the Commission to make radical changes to its policy towards countries that are blatantly infringing Community law on the freedom to provide services."
"Finally, I should like to wish you every success in creating a free market within the European Union, Commissioners."
"Success in this endeavour is crucial for you and for the Union as a whole, but it calls for greater courage and determination on the part of the Commission."
"Mr President, the Council and the Commission have taken note of the vote on the Gebhardt report on the Services Directive, and we can only be pleased about that."
"For once we are in the majority, and we shall make the most of it."
"We largely helped to take out the most questionable aspects of the Services Directive, starting with the notorious country of origin principle."
"Nonetheless, a number of grey areas remain, particularly in relation to services of general economic interest, and it will be up to the Council to resolve them, in agreement with Parliament."
"For the time being, the danger is elsewhere."
"The Commission intends to revise, and make more liberal, the directive on the posting of workers, which could partially invalidate the European Parliament’s legislative function."
"Finally, we condemn in the strongest terms the Commission’s decision to reprimand France on the grounds that it adopted decrees against hostile takeover bids in 11 sensitive and strategic sectors, particularly in relation to defence."
"The Commission prefers to go against its own camp rather than to defend Europe’s interests at the WTO or in world markets."
"It is therefore up to the Member States to correct this institutional and political anomaly."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Commissioner McCreevy for fully living up to the pledge that he gave to us."
"He said that if we produced a balanced proposal with a strong majority from this Parliament, then the Commission would take that up and produce it as an amended text."
"And he has largely done that, as many colleagues have said."
"I am fully in support of that."
"It was a compromise."
"I make no bones about the fact that I would have liked to have seen a more liberal directive, but the fact remains that what is on the table is a major step forward in the internal market."
"Commissioner McCreevy, the point I want to make to you is will you please from now on become the strongest advocate of this directive."
"We want you to go out there and sell the package."
"You did not say in your speech that this directive contains a hundred separate measures directed at Member States to remove barriers to service businesses, to reduce bureaucracy, to simplify administration and to give more information."
"My colleague from Poland seems to have ignored that entirely in what he said just now."
"We also have as a central clause freedom to provide services, proposed by this side of the House."
"I am absolutely convinced, and I am sure you will confirm it, that the formulation fully respects – and I use the word from the directive – the rules under which service providers operate in their own Member State."
"That is a major step forward, but we need you to go out there and advocate it in a strong and positive way."
"Please take that as the first message, because we need to win the hearts and minds of the people out there, who think that we produced a diluted and weak piece of legislation."
"If you read it, it certainly is not."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank Commissioner Špidla very much, because we asked for a statement on the posting of workers directive as part of the compromise for removing Articles 24 and 25 of the proposal, and he has given us that."
"I think it could go further, but I am delighted that the two are linked together, which was a key demand from this side of the House."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add my thanks to the Commission, which has remained as faithful as it possibly could to Parliament’s position."
"I have to say, Commissioner, that the rather limited definition of social services gives me some cause for concern, and I would like Parliament and the Council to spend some time thinking of a better definition."
"I am delighted, though, that the Commission has adopted Parliament’s social clauses with regard to respecting labour and social security legislation and the collective bargaining agreements and also, Commissioner, that the services directive gives priority to the posting of workers directive and respects this fully."
"I have to tell Commissioner Špidla, though, that I am not entirely happy with the content of the communication on the posting of workers, and so I would insist on this communication being presented to the social partners and Parliament for consultation."
"Whilst it is a good thing that the red tape and restrictions which Member States impose and which have been repeatedly condemned by the Court of Justice will be eliminated, I get the feeling that the prohibitive clauses in the communication go much further than the administration of justice."
"For example, the opinion that the appointment of a representative among posted workers should be sufficient is tantamount to denying the Scandinavian countries their negotiation tradition."
"In addition, with the ban on previous permissions or registrations, you run the risk of undermining the system of licences, for example in the context of temporary employment."
"This will therefore need to be examined more closely."
"I should also like to give credit, though, for the good start that has been made on improving inspections in practice."
"It is vital that companies and employees should be better informed than they have been to date about the conditions of employment in relation to the posting of workers and that liaison offices become more effective."
"I also unreservedly endorse the idea of better equipping labour inspections and getting them to cooperate across the borders."
"This is something for which this House has repeatedly asked."
"Only then, I believe, will we have sufficient guarantees in place to create an internal market for services that function well while fully respecting the social ground rules."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in our opinion, it is imperative that the final text that we must arrive at fully preserves the balance achieved by the Members of our Parliament."
"If we must adopt a directive on the free movement of services, because doing so is a real necessity, then it will not be at any price."
"The Commission’s original draft was a clumsy text, ill conceived and unwise."
"Parliament has now completely revised this text, thus making it possible to complete the internal market while at the same time preserving our social model."
"We are grateful to you, Commissioner, for resisting the temptations and we suggest that you join with the European Parliament in working out a compromise."
"Henceforth, the ball is in the court of the Council, and we expect it to act as a responsible co-legislator."
"The Services Directive is now a structure balancing on pillars of equal importance to us."
"Calling one or other of them into question would be liable to bring down the whole structure."
"The Council, therefore, cannot ignore the political message that we have given it."
"Commissioner, Parliament’s vote on services has shown the way."
"Our fellow citizens would not understand if we were to backtrack."
"– Mr President, I am glad that it has dawned on the Commission that the Posting of Workers Directive is indispensable as a means of protecting workers in the European services market."
"The Services Directive must not be allowed to impose limitations on it."
"The Posting of Workers Directive establishes the principle of ‘equal pay for equal work in the same place’, yet I have to tell Commissioner Špidla that I do wonder how, in view of the criminal energy expended on circumventing this principle in practice, one local foreman or one registration on the day work begins is meant to be enough to ensure that the Member States can keep tabs on what is going on."
"If the means of control available to the Member States are intended to help protect workers, then it follows that no restrictions must be placed upon them, and that – rather than the assertion that such a thing is no more than a bureaucratic imposition – must be the guiding principle of the handbook."
"The Posting of Workers Directive must continue to have the protection of workers as its primary purpose."
"Mr President, I should like to add to the words of thanks that have been spoken to Commissioners McCreevy and Špidla."
"I have great admiration for the way in which you have met us halfway."
"What is now before us represents a big step forward."
"I have a few questions and comments."
"I shall start with you, Commissioner McCreevy."
"You said that you will be presenting a document on health."
"What do you mean?"
"Is it a directive?"
"Indeed, we cannot accept a situation where the European Court of Justice decides that we should monitor the situation closely, only for nothing to be done thereafter."
"I would appreciate it greatly if it was a directive that were to be tabled, because you have not mentioned the form that document would take."
"Turning to Commissioner Špidla, I agree with you both that Articles 24 and 25, as they were formulated originally, were included with the aim of making it impossible to put up administrative hurdles in the recipient Member State."
"I totally agree that something should be done about them."
"Having said that, wages and working conditions can also be skirted, which leads to improper competition on the labour market."
"That means, therefore that it is important for new policy guidelines to be drafted, also for the workers who are posted."
"I have a question, though. Why have you issued a communication, Commissioner Špidla?"
"I am asking you, because Mrs Schröder is writing a report on the posting of workers directive and you already have an assessment of the same directive at your disposal."
"Why have you issued a document that is difficult to enforce?"
"Why did you not decide to adapt legislation instead?"
"Mr President, I have one last comment to make."
"I am delighted with the fact that the monitoring procedure that checks the way we deal with each other is set to improve thanks to different labour inspections joining forces."
"We will need to have another talk about how we could reinforce this procedure."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, during the first debate on the Services Directive, a British Member said: ‘Fritz Bolkestein is well and alive and living mainly in France’."
"My group wishes the former Commissioner, Mr Bolkestein, a very happy retirement."
"Indeed, we hope that he will have a peaceful retirement, but his directive is well and truly dead."
"Henceforth, we shall have a Gebhardt – McCreevy directive."
"There are still, of course, the Bolkestein orphans."
"On the extreme left and among certain well-known anti-Europeans, the Bolkestein Directive had become an obvious bogeyman, the symbol of an anti-social Europe."
"These people have difficulty in accepting that the Bolkestein Directive is definitively dead and buried."
"Others have the same problem, notably some enthusiasts of ultraliberalism, and here I am thinking of those who saw in the Commission’s original proposal a sort of master key providing access to a totally deregulated Europe."
"I am thinking in particular of that French baron who tries to look modern by speaking American when he is speaking on behalf of big employers."
"Happily, though, the European Parliament has done its job, and a qualified majority of Parliament has rewritten the text that was submitted at first reading on the Commission’s original proposal in order to make it a respectable instrument that encourages the free provision of services, while avoiding any form of social dumping."
"The Commission has done well to broadly support the European Parliament’s position, even if we did observe a bit of shillyshallying last week."
"President Barroso has taken his troops in hand."
"We shall, of course, have to remain vigilant and we shall have to request some further information."
"Nonetheless, the Austrian Presidency would likewise do well to ensure that the Council supports Parliament so that we may quickly arrive at the proper Services Directive that we hope and pray for."
"Mr President, Commissioners, in Parliament we have held hearings concerning the Posting of Workers Directive, and these have shown that there is nothing wrong with the directive itself, even if it is complicated."
"However, there are huge problems with applying the rules in practice."
"People are unaware of their rights, companies do not know which rules they have to follow and public authorities interpret the directive differently from one another."
"Rather than amend the directive, we therefore have a great deal to do in terms of better administration and the better provision of information."
"The EU and the Member States must together ensure that it is possible, for example via the Internet and quick caches, to obtain better information."
"In that way we should be able seriously to reap the benefits of an internal market for services."
"I am looking forward to the Commission taking initiatives in this area and ensuring that the Posting of Workers Directive operates better in the future."
"Mr President, thank you for presenting the guidelines on the posting of workers."
"They certainly represent a further significant step towards the liberalisation of services."
"The Commission’s document outlines the administrative barriers illegally imposed on firms posting their workers abroad for work purposes."
"It also contains examples of rulings by the European Court of Justice, which considers that such practices infringe the Treaty."
"Unfortunately, however, the document does not propose any effective ways of resolving the present situation."
"The Commission has demonstrated quite clearly that it lacks the will to ensure compliance with Community law."
"Mere references to rulings by the Court of Justice are not enough."
"The barriers remain firmly in place in spite of the rulings, the Treaty and the Directive."
"Nothing has changed."
"More determined action is therefore called for, such as starting legal proceedings against those who have infringed the provisions."
"I fear that the proposal to prepare another report on progress achieved in eliminating barriers in a year’s time simply amounts to a further postponement of such action."
"In conclusion, I should like to say how taken aback many Members of this House were on discovering that health services had been completely written out of the Commission’s opinion on the directive on services, even though the parliamentary vote showed a majority in favour of their inclusion."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the honourable Members for their remarks."
"I shall reply to some of the specific questions."
"On the excluded sectors, it is important that we all remember that the provisions of the Treaty continue to apply to those services outside the scope of the directive."
"The College of Commissioners will debate the question of health within the next couple of weeks and the scope of the initiative will be decided at that time."
"Mr Kyprianou will have the lead and Mr Špidla and myself will be submitting our ideas to him."
"While I cannot be more specific today, I can say that at a minimum it will cover the issue of patient mobility and reimbursement for health expenditure."
"We will have to wait to see what Mr Kyprianou will bring forward."
"Mr Harbour is being a little pessimistic about the reception given to this revised proposal."
"It is true that there has been a degree of negative comment in some of the media, but views will change with time and when people have had more time to digest what was voted on by Parliament."
"I have vigorously sold the modified proposal to the Council of Ministers."
"At a meeting of the Council of Ministers on Sunday, 12 March 2006, I vigorously defended the intended revised proposal."
"I told the ministers that I intended to follow what the European Parliament had agreed in the main areas."
"While some ministers may have been somewhat sceptical initially, at the end of the meeting most were quite pleased as to what the outcome was going to be."
"The fact that the European Council last week overwhelmingly endorsed the vote in Parliament shows that the debate has moved on considerably."
"It is a good proposal."
"Mr Harbour outlines many of the initiatives and the good points in it and we should be prepared to sell it as a very important step in the services area and as a good day for Europe when this particular directive is adopted."
"As I have said in committee meetings – and recently I attended a meeting of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection – it is important to realise that the previous Commission’s proposal was never going to see the light of day as it was drafted."
"So those who defended the original proposals would have to recognise the political reality: it was never going to become a piece of legislation."
"What I as Commissioner and the College of Commissioners recognised was the political reality that we could not keep trumpeting how brilliant the proposal was while knowing in our hearts that it was going to remain on the shelf."
"We adopted the pragmatic approach of saying that we could see whether we could get a broad agreement among the Members of the European Parliament from the major groups because, if we could succeed in doing that, we would have a better chance of seeing the revised proposal through the Council of Ministers."
"In the meetings of the Council of Ministers that I attended there were as many divisions as there were in the European Parliament."
"So I think Parliament has clearly shown the way."
"Now that we have a revised proposal, we all should be prepared to sell it and to recognise that it is a major step forward."
"Some might describe it as an incremental step forward, but a major step forward it is."
"It will be of considerable benefit to the economy of Europe, because what is at issue here is galvanising the European economy to be able to sustain the kind of growth rates that would deliver the number of jobs that are so necessary."
"In my opinion the modified services proposal will do that."
"Given the broad consensus that has been reached on the most difficult points in this proposal, I am certain that the Council of Ministers will want to work closely with the European Parliament to try to reach an early agreement."
"We in the Commission will do all we can to facilitate an early final agreement on the text."
"If everybody maintains an open and constructive approach, we can steer this important proposal to a successful conclusion."
". Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the discussion that has just taken place."
"Allow me to touch on some of the points that have been raised."
"In the continuing debate between the social partners and representatives of the Member States, and especially also within the framework of parliamentary debates, the view has now taken hold that the Directive is fit for purpose and that there is no pressing reason for it to be subjected to any fundamental legislative reworking, although its practical application may give rise to a number of problems."
"In the course of discussing the Services Directive, Parliament obtained a promise that the Commission would include in its communication a round-up of practice to date and of the decisions to date from the Luxembourg court."
"It is absolutely clear, and I think it applies across the entire legal system, that laws should be used only in accordance with the purposes for which lawmakers have framed them."
"The Posted Workers Directive should protect workers who have been posted, securing for them the appropriate rights while preventing social dumping, protecting them from exploitation and saving them from being forced into accepting unreasonable social standards and thereby competing unfairly against workers in the host country."
"This is the purpose of the Directive and this was our determining viewpoint when formulating a strategy for the communication."
"It is not of course the aim of the Directive to create artificial barriers, and this means that every single barrier and every administrative procedure must be weighed up from the following standpoint: is it necessary and essential to the greater protection of workers?"
"If the answer is yes, then it will be in agreement with the Directive, if the answer is no, then it will not be."
"I can provide a typical example: the protection of workers unquestionably requires the use of official documents, but we can easily imagine that some documents may be unnecessary from this standpoint."
"This is one of the issues addressed in the communication."
"In a number of speeches a question also arose that was not connected directly with the communication, but was connected with the further development of the Services Directive and with issues relating to services in general."
"This was the question of social services in the public interest."
"I can report that the communication is already complete in respect of the fundamentals of this issue, and we expect it to be fully formulated by the end of April."
"The communication will, on the one hand, clarify some of the principal legal questions, because it is necessary to have precise and reliable interpretations of court decisions, and on the other hand it will put forward a number of other procedures that might be adopted with the further development and elaboration of the political concept of services in the public interest."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Services Directive and the related communication, along with the additional negotiations and subsequent steps, provide an example of exceptionally productive cooperation between the Commission and Parliament, within the framework of some highly demanding parts of our legislation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps I might be allowed one more comment, already touched on by my colleague Mr McCreevy, which is that we do indeed expect some new legislative proposals to be formulated in relation to health care, and particularly in relation to the movement of patients within the health system."
"Mr President, I am surprised that the European Union’s Austrian Presidency is not taking a stand on this very important communication from the Commission."
"Listening to Chancellor Schüssel, he speaks highly of the compromise reached by the European Parliament, and I should very much like to know whether the Austrian Presidency is now going to do its best to ensure that the Council adopts this new position of Parliament and of the Commission."
"Mr Goebbels, I would hesitate to describe your speech as a point of order, although it does affect the order of the debates."
"It is a question about the order, but I do not believe that the Council needs incentives from MEPs to speak if it wishes."
"It knows that it can speak, and if it has not asked to do so, it will be because it has not felt the need to."
"Silence is equivalent to assent."
"The debate is closed."
"– I am grateful to the Commission for having taken account of this Parliament’s position, which democratically reflects the demands of the majority of European citizens."
"I am sorry that certain social services are still excluded from the directive: services like affordable housing and support for children and families must not be subject to the laws of competition, but must aim solely at meeting the beneficiaries’ interests."
"I hope, therefore, that these demands will be adequately taken into account in the social services directive that the Commission has announced for the end of April."
"I am also pleased that the country-of-origin principle has been removed and that the new document on the posting of workers has been drawn up."
"I think, in fact, that we need to guard against social dumping by carefully examining the rules of the market, especially as regards wages and working conditions."
"It is important to ensure that competition improves job quality for the benefit of workers and consumers."
"The ultimate aim of the European Union is in fact not to increase the volume of business but to create a competitive society that serves its citizens, a society that helps to raise the living standards of its members in every respect."
"The next item is the joint debate ‘Better law-making’, which deals with four reports:"
"- the report by Monica Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the Commission's 21st and 22nd annual reports on monitoring the application of Community law (2003 and 2004) [2005/2150(INI)] (A6-0089/2006),"
"- the report by Bert Doorn, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on better lawmaking 2004: application of the principle of subsidiarity 12th annual report [2005/2055(INI)] (A6-0082/2006),"
"- the report by Arlene McCarthy, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the implementation, consequences and impact of the internal market legislation in force [2004/2224(INI)](A6-0083/2006) and"
"- the report by Giuseppe Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on a strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment [2006/2006(INI)](A6-0080/2006)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly delighted to take the floor today, not in my usual guise as my group’s representative, but as rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs representing a broader-based majority."
"As such, I should like to deliver a few messages about this report, the essential aim of which is to emphasise that the implementation of Community law forms an important part of the ‘better lawmaking’ dossier, alongside the other issues that we shall debate this afternoon."
"Implementation is an important part of law primarily because the situation at European Union level is unsatisfactory, as the Commission’s report points out very effectively."
"There are very serious problems particularly concerning environmental legislation as well as legislation on the internal market, and responsibility for that – there is no point in denying it – lies above all with the Member States."
"Non-implementation is also due, however, to the fact that the procedure is enshrined in the Treaties and is therefore not easy to improve."
"It is a slow procedure that provides for relatively inadequate sanctions: in order to arrive at a positive solution for the implementation of Community law by the Member States, the procedure often leaves much to be desired and takes a very long time."
"I should like to hear whether you believe that this issue of the implementation of Community law is a priority for the Commission or not."
"Judging from the communication, it does not seem to me that it is, because, as we know, it deals more with the aspect of withdrawing and amending directives rather than their proper implementation."
"I believe that there are substantially two schools of thought in the Commission: one that says, ‘It is best to avoid trouble with the Member States, so let us try to solve problems together with them,’ whereas the other says, ‘Let us apply the rules as they are, not inflexibly but at any rate positively, using procedures that as far as possible are fast and within the law.’"
"I should like to give some examples of that."
"We believe that several decisions made by the Commission regarding the initiation of certain procedures, such as those on GMOs in Austria, were made particularly quickly and effectively. On the other hand, in the case of France and its inability to implement the Natura 2000 Directive, we have been waiting for three years, ever since the Court of Justice’s decision, for the Commission to intervene under Article 228, which is the article on fines."
"Similarly, there are interesting situations regarding the citizens’ right to reimbursement of their medical expenses."
"This is an extremely important issue for the people themselves, but we realise that it remains unresolved because it is a politically complicated issue to take on."
"At the same time, Article 228 has only been invoked twice: once for the Greek waste discharge case, which was suspended after a very short time, and once for the Spanish bathing water case, which was withdrawn at the last minute because of an issue that the Commission itself admits is rather dubious from a legal standpoint."
"What answer do we give or what proposals do we make to resolve a situation in which we believe that the Commission should act more transparently?"
"First of all we believe that there should be greater surveillance and greater transparency regarding the ways in which Community law is implemented."
"I think it is important that the Commission pass on to us the compliance studies that it carries out on implementation of the law, which unfortunately we have not succeeded in obtaining."
"Secondly, I believe it is extremely important for resources to be transferred from all those bodies that will no longer produce legislation to those that will instead implement it."
"We do not agree with the idea, for instance, that there should be such a transfer to those who will carry out impact assessments, something that is currently being discussed in the Commission."
"Thirdly – and this affects us – we believe that the European Parliament should act much more specifically in the area of the implementation of Community law, not in order to change the Commission’s powers – I am aware that this is of great concern to the members of that Institution – but, on the contrary, to gain a clearer idea of what actually happens, as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and other committees do."
"I believe that the policy of naming and shaming with regard to the implementation of Community law is very useful and that the Commission should perhaps help us to apply it more decisively."
". Mr President, I would like to quote an article from an authoritative Dutch newspaper in May last year, just before the referendum in the Netherlands."
"The quote starts as follows: ‘Not Barroso, not Blair, but Mr van Alphen from the Netherlands, along with thousands of other national civil servants, takes the day-to-day decisions in Europe’."
"This article did nothing to contribute towards a positive basic perception in the Netherlands of the referendum."
"You know it all went horribly wrong."
"The Netherlands said no, which is worrying."
"It is these very rules and regulations that are a source of worry and that we should discuss in more detail today."
"We must work hard in order to remove the negative image the citizen has of rules and regulations."
"How can we achieve this?"
"We can do it by making them more transparent."
"We must also consider the administrative burden that results from them."
"Many companies have the mill stone of a heavy administrative burden round their necks, and if there is anything that affects companies’ competitiveness, then this is it."
"How do we achieve more transparency and cut the administrative burden?"
"We can do it, in the first place, by carrying out an actual impact assessment, and that is what is still lacking at the moment."
"We have seen many examples of impact assessments, and they all vary in terms of quality."
"Some are good, and some are not."
"If we in this House want to benefit from impact assessments, then they should offer impartial and sound information that is readily understood."
"That is what is missing."
"We in this House have first-hand experience of some impact assessments on amendments; we too have found that the quality varies, and that is why I propose an independent review of them."
"This need not be done by a weighty authority."
"This could be a panel of four experts in the field of impact assessment, who simply look at the impact assessments carried out by the Commission and those carried out in this House, and who then issue recommendations on that basis."
"In other words, there is no need for an agency or weighty authority; what we simply need is an independent quality review, one that is effective and external."
"Turning to comitology, the article I mentioned a moment ago had something to say about this too."
"It also included another paragraph, one about the committees, which I do not want to keep from you."
"‘You do not see them, you do not hear them, some 450 consulting clubs in Brussels, constantly take decisions that affect the everyday life of the citizens.’"
"More transparency is needed in that area too."
"When comitology leads to secondary legislation, this legislation must also be verified."
"We must demonstrate the implications of legislation of that kind by means of an impact assessment."
"The public will then see that we mean business and that we actually want this transparency."
"Finally, as Mrs Frassoni already pointed out, implementation is extremely important and Parliament should devote far more attention to it."
"When a report has been discussed in the plenary, then the work of the rapporteur is done."
"I would suggest asking the rapporteur in question, three years after approval in this House, to notify his committee of the state of play in terms of implementation."
"This will contribute significantly to the proper transposal in the Member States and also to sound contacts with national parliaments."
"Those are the proposals: more transparency, objective supervision of the impact assessment, limits to comitology, more insight into comitology and possibly a call-back right for the European Parliament should the need arise."
"Those are the components of an inter-institutional agreement that I think are needed in order to really get going with these rules and regulations."
". Mr President, as Chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection I very much welcome this joint debate on better regulation and the opportunity to discuss with the Council and the Commission how we can improve the regulatory experience for consumers, citizens and businesses that are at the sharp end of making sense of implementing EU laws."
"The confidence and trust of citizens, consumers and business in the EU itself is linked to their experience and perception of EU laws and the impact they have on their daily lives."
"I want to focus on improving better regulation for the internal market and ensuring that we achieve a sense of purpose in our law-making for consumers in the internal market."
"The internal market accounts for almost one third of the Community ."
"Good-quality, effective and simple legislation in the internal market should open up opportunities for cross-border trade and give consumers increased choice, while protecting environmental, social and consumer rights."
"At the same time, getting legislation right in the internal market is critical to achieving the Lisbon goals of jobs, growth and competitiveness."
"I believe that the internal market will benefit most from a joint and coordinated approach by all three institutions to improving the entire regulatory cycle."
"That means that we also need to think of the consequences of the midnight deals and compromises that we make, and consider whether they are going to confuse or clarify laws for end users."
"That starts, in my view, with good, clear drafting of laws, high-quality impact assessments and effective, comprehensive and transparent stakeholder consultation."
"The Member States too must take their responsibilities seriously and ensure good and correct implementation of internal market laws."
"They must resist the temptation often to gold-plate or add on national requirements."
"Although transposition rates are improving, as shown in the internal market scoreboards, there is still room for much improvement."
"That is why we are asking for a fast-track infringement procedure for test cases in the internal market."
"We need to learn from the failures and mistakes of EU laws."
"That is why we would like to see both and, in particular, impact assessments or evaluations of where we went wrong."
"Has this legislation achieved its objective or, on the contrary, has it led to distortion and fragmentation of the internal market?"
"Some believe that the impact assessments should be handed over to an external body."
"I do not share that approach, as I believe that the internal market laws should be the responsibility of Commission officials as part of the discipline of effective policy-making."
"However, the Internal Market Committee insists that all legislative proposals be accompanied by a quality impact assessment, a summary and a better regulation checklist on internal market proposals."
"Of course alternative regulation is a subject of much scepticism."
"While the interinstitutional agreement provides for this non-legislative option, we insist with respect to internal market laws that Parliament is both informed of and consulted on such alternative approaches."
"They are justified by impact assessments."
"Equally, we must have redress for the consumer and sanctions if these alternative regulations fail to deliver benefits for the consumer in the internal market."
"I want to stress the work of the Internal Market Committee as an active partner in the better regulation process."
"I know that Commissioners often say that Parliament does not take its role seriously."
"We were the first committee to commission our own impact assessment, under Mr Whitehead’s chairmanship, for amendments on the Toubon report on nominal quantities for pre-packed products."
"On the pyrotechnics proposal we are conducting an impact assessment on amendments proposed by our rapporteur."
"We will look at a cost/benefit analysis of his amendments to that proposal."
"We are conducting a hearing on the impact of public procurement laws on the internal market."
"EU public procurement accounts for 16% of EU GDP, yet the 1992 package of laws, as demonstrated in a number of ECJ cases, has not achieved the desired opening of the market."
"Let us be clear. It is the consumer, the citizen and businesses that pay the price when laws are not effective."
"Bad drafting leads to legal uncertainty, poor or confused transposition and at the end of the line is a confused businessman or consumer who loses confidence in the internal market."
"The ECJ, after years of deliberation, becomes the arbiter of better legislation."
"That is not the right way forward."
"Finally, I want to quote the cases of SOLVIT, which I believe is an excellent initiative of the Commission."
"A qualified doctor tried for a number of years to register as a doctor in Spain."
"He spent a large sum of money on legal fees, had lost confidence in the internal market, yet the SOLVIT system intervened and helped him within ten weeks to get registration in Spain as a doctor."
"That doctor said: ‘SOLVIT has restored my confidence in the internal market’."
"So, the reality is that good laws that are well drafted, easy to implement, easy to enforce and police, are the key to restoring confidence in the internal market."
"I hope that today’s debate is the beginning of a process of close cooperation, sharing best practice between the institutions in a close partnership of equals, to build and restore that confidence that the doctor I mentioned was asking us to achieve for him as a consumer in the internal market."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about three aspects, starting with the issue of simplification."
"There is no doubt that this House is, as a matter of principle, backing the Commission in its efforts at simplifying the lawmaking process, but I also want to make it clear that here, as in so many other instances, the devil is in the detail, and that we have to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater."
"Let me give you an example."
"Looking at this document from the Commission, for example, I see that they want to simplify the whole body of commercial and company law; now I know, as one of the Legal Affairs Committee’s permanent rapporteurs on this area, that many of the directives and regulations we have enacted on this were the result of highly complex negotiations and compromises and that there is, in any proposal for simplification, the inherent risk of Pandora’s box being opened and of the compromises arrived at after much effort ending up being once more open to question."
"That means that simplification is an instrument that must be handled with great care."
"It is for that reason that I believe that it is very definitely advisable that we should give some thought, when simplifying just as much as when codifying, to the possibility of the three institutions adopting an inter-institutional agreement stating in clear terms how one goes about simplifying laws."
"A second point to which I should like the Commission to give some thought is the issue of what priorities simplification proposals should set."
"Directives are customarily addressed to the national legislatures rather than to the public, and the laws with which practitioners have to deal are those enacted at the national level."
"It follows that the simplification of directives should be no more than a secondary objective."
"The Commission should give priority to regulations, for the simple reason that regulations are directly applicable as law and have a direct effect on those members of the public who have recourse to law."
"The second issue has to do with impact assessment."
"I want once more to ram home the point that most of us in this House regard an independent element in the assessment of laws’ impact as vitally necessary."
"In a report it produced in December, this House called for an independent agency on the American model."
"For my part, I want to make it clear that this is not a for me; it is something we can talk about."
"What I do regard as indispensable, though, is the participation of an independent external element in the assessment of the impact laws have."
"It is not acceptable that the officials who make proposals are also and at the same time the ones who are responsible for gauging what impact those proposals will have, for the consequence of that is that the impact assessment ends up being no more and no less than part of the justification for them, and that is not what we want."
"It is for that reason, then, that I believe we have to hammer out something sensible with the Commission in relation to this issue."
"An inter-institutional agreement has been in place since December 2003, according to which the Commission is, in principle, responsible for the impact assessment."
"That also means, though, that it is exercising a responsibility with and on behalf of the legislature, that is to say, for Parliament and the Council, and so we believe that we in this House, too, should have – and do have – a right to be consulted as to how this impact assessment is carried out."
"I might add that that is also the reason why we, in the Conference of Presidents, initially delayed adopting a resolution on the follow-up administrative agreements, since these, of course, have to be renegotiated, not least in the light of the resolutions that we will be adopting on these four reports in May of this year."
"I would also like to say something about something that is very definitely a live issue."
"On 16 March, Advocate-General Sharpston delivered an opinion in the case of Spain versus the Council, in the conclusions to which she refers explicitly to the impact assessment, stating that the absence of any adequate impact assessment is an indication of the legal act having been adopted arbitrarily, and that demonstrates and confirms the Court of Justice’s increasing interest in this issue."
"Further to what Mr Doorn has had to say on the subject, I think it is crucial that decisions arrived at by way of comitology also need to have their impact assessed."
"There are a whole load of cases that we could take as examples, where the real bureaucratic madness lay in the comitological decisions rather than in the legislation itself, so, here too, there needs to be proper monitoring of what impact laws have."
"Last of all, let me turn to the third issue, that of , that is to say the process whereby the interested parties are listened to."
"In preparing legislation, the Commission has come to rely very heavily on Europe-wide organisations and associations."
"I have nothing against the European lobbying associations, but the processes whereby they arrive at decisions are sometimes more complex than those in the Council of Ministers, and what emerges from them is often consensus compacted into nonsense."
"I believe we need still other forms of consultative machinery in order to get the information directly from those interested parties who are working at their jobs and therefore have to deal with these issues."
"So, for example, the consultative machinery we came up with through the network currently engaged in developing European contract law, with which we defined a limited category of person to be consulted, could be a good example of how to improve these mechanisms."
". – Mr President, I am glad to have the opportunity today to discuss with you an issue that is of great importance for Europe."
"I know from my own, very close, contacts with the public over recent months that the issue of ‘Better Lawmaking’, along with everything that is associated with it – perhaps not as a slogan, for many of them do not know what it stands for, but as a principle – is one of the issues of greatest interest to them."
"As you know, the Commission’s programme for this year is under the heading of ‘unlocking Europe’s full potential’, and rightly too."
"The Council is convinced that better lawmaking will be crucial in making this possible."
"It is our intention that lawmaking should support the citizen rather than hampering him, and the same is true – as Mrs McCarthy has already said – of the consumer, but it is most especially the case in business life, where too little has been done to foster the dynamism and creativity of small and medium-sized businesses in particular."
"Only recently, the European Council indicated its desire to promote small and medium-sized enterprises and provided some impetus in that direction."
"Studies have shown us that the administrative burden for businesses and members of the public is equivalent to between 2% and 5% of European GNP, and so it is our intention that a marked upturn in competitiveness be brought about by assessing the impact of the administrative burden, simplification, and a reduction in it."
"The term ‘better regulation’ is one that has recently been in frequent use, and I certainly agree with Mr Lehne that we should not throw out the baby with the bathwater and that this term is very often used rather loosely, and in such a way as to devalue it, in that it is not always clear what is meant by it."
"I can say on behalf of the Council that your House’s engagement with this issue in no fewer than four reports today is very much to be welcomed."
"The Council presidency continues to regard the Inter-Institutional Agreement on Better Lawmaking, to which reference has already been made today, as the framework for our cooperation."
"We intend to collaborate with the future Finnish Presidency, with the Commission, and, of course, with your House, in further advancing the agenda for the reform of the regulatory framework."
"Let me discuss in greater detail some of the areas that are significant in this context."
"I will start with simplification. The simplification of EU regulations is something that has a tangible effect on businesses and the public, and it is for that reason that it will be particularly efficient if it also enables us to gain greater credibility."
"Commissioner Verheugen’s screening initiative and the current plans for sectoral simplification and further efforts at horizontal simplification put us on the right track."
"I am also very impressed by the presence of the President and the Vice-President in this House today and by their participation in this debate, for we must encourage further progress down this road, and that is precisely what the Council and the Commission are doing by doing something to bring Europe closer to its citizens."
"As you know, the Austrian Presidency has to some extent taken ‘bringing Europe closer to its citizens again’ as its watchword, and these initiatives, including those on the part of the Commission, make a substantial contribution to doing that."
"They also help Europe to be successful in achieving the Lisbon targets."
"The Presidency of the Council is glad to see that the Commission is not only pursuing the ‘simplification of existing legislation’ by means of a general weeding-out of the , but is also planning to include in this the outcome of the Council’s efforts in this area."
"Together with the future Finnish Presidency and the Commission, we are working towards better working methods for simplification and towards maximising the efficiency of the cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, and so it is also useful that the Commission should, on an annual basis, provide the Council with information on its programme of simplification."
"We also propose that the simplification dossiers be put near the top of our agendas, and that the Council and Parliament should endeavour, where possible, to adopt simplification dossiers at first reading."
"The burden of administration – to which reference has already been made – upon the persons it affects is, of course, directly measurable and affects them directly."
"We need instruments in the European sphere to do just that."
"Such instruments exist; now all we have to do is to use them."
"The Presidency of the Council is currently drafting a paper on the prescription of quantitative targets in this area."
"As my third point, I would like to turn to the subject of the choice of legal instruments, for, whatever our efforts towards improving lawmaking, there are a number of important aspects of which we must not lose sight, among them the subsidiarity principle and the principle of proportionality, while at the same time taking care to ensure that the remains intact."
"It is not less Europe, but a better Europe, that we would like to see."
"The principles of subsidiarity and of proportionality are fundamental guidelines for action by the institutions in their exercise of EU competences and hence an integral part of better lawmaking."
"Subsidiarity and proportionality also play a central role in the choice of legal instruments."
"In carrying out impact assessments, several alternative courses of action need to be considered, one of which must be the option of acting at a lower level than the EU itself."
"Contrariwise, though, the interests of legal clarity and the smooth functioning of the internal market can be better served by regulations than by directives, and that, too, has been referred to today."
"All in all, it is crucial that, in each individual case, the instrument should be chosen that best enables Europe to achieve what regulation is intended to do, and so, in practice, there is a close connection between impact assessments, which are of considerable value qualitatively speaking, and the effective application of subsidiarity and proportionality."
"Both the Council and Parliament are already obliged by the inter-institutional agreement to have extensive recourse to the Commission’s impact assessments in the process of arriving at decisions."
"These impact assessments by the Commission can therefore also serve as the basis for an active discussion of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality."
"Perhaps I might take this opportunity to reiterate that we intend, in order to add depth to this discussion, to organise a conference on subsidiarity in Austria on 18 and 19 April, at which we look forward to valuable contributions from your House."
"As was generally stressed today, impact assessments must be produced to the highest possible standards of quality and must then actually be used in the negotiating process;"
"The Austrian Presidency of the Council will be producing what might be termed a handbook for chairmen of Council working groups with the title ‘’."
"We also want to encourage more cooperation between the institutions, particularly in respect of assessing the impact of major amendments proposed by the Council and in the consistent adherence to the agreed in all three of them, and, with this in mind, we look forward with great interest to the Commission’s impact assessment review, which has been announced for this spring."
"Overall, the presidency shares your House’s view that high quality impact assessments are essential components of an improved regulatory framework."
"Something else to which reference was made was the involvement of what are termed ‘stakeholders’ in consultation processes, which is vital if there is to be greater transparency."
"Interested parties must be fully informed about the options for consultation, account must be taken of their views when policies are drawn up, and they must also be given proper feedback."
"Let me conclude by adding something about transparency. If the public are to accept the decisions we take, it is important not only that the laws we enact be comprehensible and simple, but also that we do a better job of explaining how these decisions are arrived at."
"The decision-making process needs to be as transparent as possible for the general public."
"Our Federal Chancellor said this when presenting the Austrian Council programme, and it is a point I have emphasised on many occasions. The Austrian Presidency of the Council attaches importance to continued progress in transparency."
"The first steps have been taken by way of the resolutions adopted last December, on the basis of which we are now attempting to give this practical expression and, where possible, to highlight other ways in which greater transparency may be achieved."
"As I said at the outset, ‘better lawmaking’ is a project of public relevance and of direct concern to all of us."
"If it is accomplished successfully, we will, together, have been able to add real value and to again make the benefits of the European Union clearer to its citizens."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, European legislation is central to everything that makes the European Union special."
"We are, in fact, a Community based on the rule of law."
"Without law, we should have to rely on continual negotiation, on the balance of power between the Member States or else on goodwill, in theory only, on cooperation and on willingness."
"We do not want a Community based on the arbitrary and the discretionary."
"We want a Community based on the rule of law."
"It is law that can guarantee those freedoms that Europeans enjoy today."
"I believe that this is an important point of principle and here I would like to make a personal observation."
"Three days ago, at the European University Institute in Florence, I gave a lecture, the Jean Monnet lecture, which focused precisely on my conception of law in the European Union."
"I believe that it is more necessary than ever to reaffirm those principles of a Community based on the rule of law that is our Community."
"That is what makes it different from other experiments at international level."
"We make laws for a number of reasons: for example, to protect health by ensuring food safety, to protect the environment by setting standards for air and water quality and to lay down rules for businesses operating within the internal market, so as to enable them to fight on equal terms, avoiding all discrimination."
"We make laws at European Union level because the Member States have agreed that certain measures should be determined at Community level."
"In practical terms, it is indeed a matter of substituting a single rule, applicable throughout the European Union, for 25 national rules."
"For all that, we have to ensure that European legislation and regulations give added value: they must be targeted, they must conform to the principles of subsidiarity and they must be correctly implemented, while at the same time being proportionate to the needs that they are intended to meet."
"The measures adopted must not be excessive nor go beyond what is strictly necessary."
"We must avoid rules that are too prescriptive, that lead to unwarranted expense, or that may turn out to be counter-productive."
"We must also eliminate the cumulative effects of rules which, in time, end up overlapping with each other, an outcome that is detrimental to businesses, to the voluntary sector, to public authorities and to the citizens."
"Allow me, therefore, to congratulate the European Parliament on its excellent initiative to hold this debate on the topic of ‘better lawmaking’."
"It gives us the opportunity to examine this issue coherently."
"I wish to thank Mrs Frassoni, Mr Doorn, Mrs McCarthy and Mr Gargani, for whom Mr Lehne is standing in today, for their excellent work and for their reports."
"In order to properly evaluate the quality of our legislative initiatives, we need a set of measures and a strong guiding principle."
"That is what clearly emerges from the various reports, which I believe provide a sound basis for our exchange of views today."
"These reports and the way in which we respond to them prove that our two institutions have come a long way in recent years."
"The need for better lawmaking and for laying down better rules is the subject of a genuine consensus."
"Our legislative activity is a continuous process."
"We must work together to ensure that our political choices, whatever they may be, are translated into legislation of the highest quality."
"Here, I would also like to congratulate the Austrian Presidency on all of the measures it has taken in this respect."
"How do we perceive this challenge?"
"We acknowledge it: we still need to make improvements to all the stages of the cycle, that is, from acts already adopted to new initiatives, via proposals currently under negotiation."
"That is why the Commission has launched a vast system for better lawmaking that combines several measures: a system designed to evaluate the impact of the Commission’s important proposals; a programme designed to simplify the legislation in force and to withdraw a number of the Commission’s proposals that are awaiting consideration by Parliament and the Council; and more frequent recourse to other ways of resolving problems aside from conventional legislation, for example, self-regulation by the parties concerned or coregulation by the legislator."
"All of these measures are now producing tangible results."
"Let us look at impact assessment."
"Since 2003, the Commission has put in place a system to look at the economic, social and environmental impact of all its major proposals."
"Since the adoption of an integrated approach, 120 impact assessments have been published."
"We have also updated our guidelines to help staff to better examine options and impacts, including on competitiveness, and to focus attention on issues such as the cost of too much paperwork."
"This reflects a marked and profound change in approach and attitude."
"I believe it is real progress."
"We know that as yet assessments do not all meet the same standards."
"We know there is room for improvement."
"We recognise, as pointed out in Mr Doorn’s report on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, that quality can be improved and that quality control mechanisms must be strengthened."
"I fully subscribe to the need for a separate scrutiny of impact assessments; a kind of ‘four eyes’ principle."
"We are working on a comprehensive approach."
"First we need to ensure that our impact assessments are organised in the right way."
"As promised in March 2005, we are setting up a network of technical and scientific experts to help us develop methods of ensuring that impact assessments are comprehensive and of high quality."
"An external evaluation of the system is also under way, to identify where we are doing well and where we need to do better."
"Also, the authors of impact assessments need feedback to know if they have done a good job."
"That is why consultation is part and parcel of the impact assessment process."
"It is also one reason why all Commission impact assessments are on the Europa website."
"As for quality control of the individual assessments, I agree that an independent check should be carried out independently of the services that propose legislation."
"I suggest that the best guarantee of impartiality is to put such a check under the authority of the President of the Commission."
"I have asked the Secretary-General of the Commission to examine how best to step up our quality support and control."
"But let me stress that we need to work much more closely with you on impact assessment."
"I welcome the recent agreement on the common approach to impact assessment."
"This set of rules for dealing with impact assessment across all three institutions is an important step forward; it will facilitate our work together and avoid duplication of effort."
"Moving on to simplification, we have made a good start."
"The action programme, which we adopted last year, provides for the repeal, codification, recasting or modification of some 220 legal acts covering a wide range of policies."
"The programme, already under way in the automobile, waste and construction sectors, will be reviewed and updated in consultation with stakeholders."
"Other sectors such as foodstuffs, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and services will follow."
"We need your input to determine the right targets and to secure the best results."
"We need the Council and Parliament to speed up the adoption of simplification proposals."
"My reading from your reports is that we basically agree on what we are trying to achieve."
"Now we have to get down to work, look at the substance and deliver results."
"We are also tackling administrative burdens, which are particularly burdensome for small businesses."
"This means simplifying forms and modernising the customs code to assist electronic exchange of information."
"We are introducing the measurement of administrative costs in our impact assessments."
"It is essential that the Council and Parliament pay attention to the paperwork load when they suggest amendments."
"We also need to test new approaches to regulation, looking at co-regulation and self-regulation as a possible alternative."
"We can work more closely with industry, for example, to deliver results on a voluntary basis."
"I understand very well your concerns about not being closely involved in the preparation of non-legislative approaches."
"Where such approaches seem the best route, I fully accept the need to work out ways of keeping Parliament involved in their preparation and implementation."
"Finally, I would like to say a word about the implementation of law."
"This is a high priority for the Commission."
"I ask you to look at the conclusions of our College meeting today."
"We analysed 2055 cases of infringements."
"That was the decision of the Commission today."
"Sometimes the decisions are very difficult and we expect some Member States to react."
"I hope you support the strong commitment of this Commission to the implementation and enforcement of Community law."
"Our laws need to be correctly applied and implemented, otherwise our efforts as policy- and lawmakers are in vain."
"As more and more policy areas mature, we should see a shift in political attention and resources towards implementation."
"In fact that is a great priority for this Commission."
"This whole programme of better regulation – including implementation – has become a flagship of this Commission."
"I am personally devoted to it, as are Vice-President Verheugen and the whole College."
"As the Commission we need to manage infringement proceedings efficiently."
"I am conscious of the need to reduce the timespan on individual infringement procedures."
"We need quicker ways to respond to the problems faced by citizens in business."
"We should look at these broad issues of implementation together and explore constructive ways of dealing with them."
"Later this year I expect the Commission to come back to you with specific suggestions."
"I believe that the reports discussed today show a shared analysis of what needs to be done."
"We have been putting the building blocks in place and now we have to deliver on our commitment."
"I am convinced that if we work in partnership we can show that Europe is not about red tape and unnecessary burdens but about delivering what citizens need in the right way."
"I believe that if we work in partnership we will reinforce a Community based on the principles of law."
". I fully endorse what Mr Barroso said in the latter part of his speech."
"On behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I have drafted an opinion on Mr Doorn’s report."
"I should like to congratulate him on it and also thank him for including, virtually in their entirety, the various paragraphs that we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, had incorporated in our opinion, based on our experience."
"I would also like to endorse what Mr Winkler said and respond by adding a slightly different slant, namely that better regulation does not always mean fewer rules and regulations or deregulation, but rather more effective regulation that is mainly geared towards the outcome and end result."
"This cycle of preparation, consultation, formulating rules, impact assessment and subsequently the implementation and enforcement has been mentioned by various people."
"In our opinion, I argued that we should, in fact, start at the back and look at the process from that angle."
"How can we make the process effective and based on that, what are the rules that we need to draft?"
"A bad example of how this was not done, how this had not been given any thought and how the field dimension had not been drawn on at the preparation stage was the services directive which we discussed just now in its original form."
"Fortunately, this directive has now been changed by Parliament."
"I would also like to mention good examples from that selfsame Directorate-General market."
"Particularly in the area of the financial provision of services, a practice has been developed in that directorate and proposed by the Lamfalussy experts committee, which we call the Lamfalussy procedure."
"In this framework, it is indeed those who use the rules and regulations in practice, namely the supervisors, the economic operators, the consumers and users involved in the process, who should have far more say in terms of the content of those rules."
"We have also used this example to show others, and that is something we would like to make quite clear once again in this discussion."
"Whilst we have problems with the call back and Parliament’s responsibility as colegislator to be able to monitor what is eventually produced, the process as such is something we wholeheartedly support."
". Madam President, Mr Winkler, Commissioners, this debate is essential."
"It deals, after all, with the Commission’s right of initiative in legislative matters."
"Whether it is a matter of better regulation or of lawmaking, what is important is the way in which the initiative for the law is taken."
"If, in the Treaties, the Commission has been granted the right of initiative, it is because it has to represent the general interest."
"It has to show this ability not to be merely a sounding board for the various businesses concerned, but to represent all those who cannot necessarily organise themselves."
"In this respect, I think we are all convinced of the fact that better regulation is undoubtedly important for the world of business, but that it must also result at times in more legislation."
"That, Mr Barroso, is what Parliament told you very clearly, when your Commission was proposing to withdraw 68 proposals for texts and when, very clearly, in relation to Friendly Societies, we spoke of the need for legislation."
"On behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I drafted an opinion on Mr Gargani’s report, which focuses on simplifying the legislation and, in that regard, I should like to make three observations."
"Firstly, we must be mindful of the fact that, in this area, behind every technical question, there clearly lies a political question about content: what is it that we are simplifying?"
"What are we working on behind the simplification?"
"Secondly, there are those who sometimes believe that better regulation is synonymous with self-regulation."
"Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs we have, in the form of accounting standards, a perfect example of a situation where, in the absence of very specific democratic regulation, dangerous abuses can sometimes arise."
"Finally, the quest for simplification must also lead to the implementation of legislation that is better drawn up, whereby Parliament defines the principles and the rest is left to comitology."
"As you know, we fully support such an approach since it is based on a comitology agreement that fully recognises the rights of the co-legislator, that is to say the European Parliament, in the matter."
". Madam President, Member States touting protectionism as a positive policy option are dressing up protectionism as patriotism or are scared not of what Europe might become, but of what it already is: an economy based on free trade and competition."
"As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and a draftsman of an opinion on better lawmaking, I am adamant that boosting competition via regulatory reform is the initial stimulus that Europe needs to improve productivity."
"I see it as imperative that all future legislative impact assessments should take into account the increasing level of global competition."
"Furthermore, if the European Union is to become more responsible and flexible to the global current of market change, I propose to the Commission that a review clause be introduced into all new legislation."
"Also, it is fundamental that, under the guise of better lawmaking, alternatives to legislation be examined."
"Measures such as enhanced levels of consultation and mechanisms to quicken the resolution of disputes need to be investigated."
"The prime objective of all legislation should be to allow the internal market to function without cross-border obstacles to the growth of industries."
"We must grasp, therefore, the opportunities that are presented by substantial economies of scale through mergers and acquisitions."
"I am anxious that concrete steps be taken by the Commission to reduce the cost to business of complying with 25 different national regimes."
"I welcome the operation of the Financial Services Action Plan."
"However, Member States should not be allowed to become complacent in the implementation of these 42 directives."
"If commitment is lacking, then enforcement measures need to be put in place."
"Consistency and the rate of implementation need to be improved if the Lisbon objectives and the challenges of globalisation are realistically to be met."
"People need to realise that globalisation is here, and it is here to stay."
"It is unacceptable politically and economically that some Member States should seek to revert to protectionist policies."
"Irish companies and other European companies are trying to make a reality of the single market and tackle the challenges of globalisation head on, and the governments touting protectionism should not stand in their way."
"I support the efforts of the Commission and everyone else towards better lawmaking and towards the better drafting of European Union legislation, and yet I regret, at the same time, that the Constitutional Treaty has not been adopted."
"I regret this, specifically, because in the Constitutional Treaty we prepared a very good transparent regulatory framework, which offers us another opportunity to speed up the process of the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty."
"Today, Mr Barroso mentioned areas which require further review."
"He should add terrorism to that list."
"In the field of terrorism, we have already adopted 58 regulations, directives and so on – 27 of them are in the draft stage and some 15 are yet to come."
"In a nutshell, our regulatory system to combat terrorism is extremely untransparent: I am unable to navigate through it and I hope that terrorists are also unable to find their bearings amongst all this confusion."
"Europe is suffering from at least two forms of idealism."
"The first is normative idealism: if a given area is unregulated, we think that more regulation will solve the problem."
"The consequence of this is that regulation is allowed to expand out of all proportion."
"The second is organisational idealism: if we think that a field needs to be better regulated, we set up an institution."
"The last one we set up was an institution for equal opportunities, and the one before that was an institution for human rights. As if they were a guarantee of more and better regulation."
"These are illusions which will never become reality, so the Commission would do better to examine how these areas are regulated and, of course, how they impact on people."
"People are wondering if it is really necessary for us to have so much legislation, so many institutions etc. In addition, I do not believe that the Commission needs new institutions to supervise legislative acts and the revision of their drafts, because we have a Parliament which can fulfil this role perfectly well."
"Finally, European institutions will not rise in the public esteem through a multitude of regulations, directives and so on, but rather by acting transparently to benefit the people and strengthen the idea of Europe."
". Madam President, I wish to thank Mr Gargani for the clarity and commitment of his report."
"I am delighted that a large part of my opinion has been included and that his report took up my own two objectives, which are, first of all, the emphasis given to the fact that simplification is necessary but must not be achieved in any old fashion, and secondly, the affirmation of Parliament’s wish to participate fully in the simplification strategy."
"We can only welcome any initiative that aims to make the regulatory environment clearer and more coherent."
"It is, in fact, impossible to continue working properly with an of more than 80 000 pages."
"How, in these circumstances, can we talk to the citizens about accessibility and transparency with any credibility?"
"That is why the simplification strategy must be supported in principle."
"It should enable us, in the long run, to have Community and national standards that are easier to apply and less costly."
"This simplification, however, also entails a number of limitations, indeed dangers, and we therefore need to be vigilant."
"In particular, this report specifies that simplification must not take the form of a lowering of standards, that there are problems linked to the application of the Interinstitutional Agreement governing the recasting procedure and that it is therefore necessary to clarify the applicable rules in order to avoid conflicts of competence and procedural obstacles."
"This report also clearly affirms Parliament’s desire to fully participate in the simplification strategy and it puts the same emphasis on the need to protect Parliament’s prerogatives as on the question of the adaptation of its rules of procedure."
"Simplification cannot, in fact, take place outside of all democratic control and, in particular, outside the control of Parliament."
"Parliament must also give thought, within the context of simplification, to the improvement of its procedures and its internal legislative techniques."
"This issue will be the subject of a specific report that I am responsible for drafting."
"Finally, on the subject of alternative means of regulation, I am very pleased that this report demands a strict framework for recourse to coregulation and self-regulation, because it is essential to provide safeguards in this area."
". Madam President, directives and regulations all make up the law that is perhaps the main thing that our citizens see or feel as a result of our activities."
"Law is, as it were, our main product."
"But lawmaking, especially at a European level, is a process – a lengthy process – not an end point."
"This continuum is well represented by the various reports that we are discussing today."
"There are the Doorn and the Frassoni reports, one focusing on lawmaking and subsidiarity, the other on monitoring the application of the law."
"But our citizens should be at the beginning, the end and at the heart of this process, helping us set the agenda, lobbying and informing us as we make decisions and overseeing how the results work."
"The Doorn report has a special focus on the use of impact assessments."
"This is really welcome."
"But we have to take care."
"Impact assessment cannot displace political decision making."
"Of course, we need full and independent information from all sides on all aspects, not just the effects on business."
"Then we as co-legislators can decide, but it must be our decision, not that of experts, nor of technocrats, stakeholders or lobbyists."
"Give us all the information in a balanced manner, then, in full transparency, we can make a political decision for which we are accountable."
"No number of impact assessments or re-impact assessments should replace democracy."
"Let me turn to one of the main preoccupations of the Committee on Petitions."
"It is perhaps the committee in this House that is most in touch with our citizens."
"They come to us when the law is not working."
"The job of the Petitions Committee is to help citizens highlight the problems with implementation and monitoring of EU law."
"This work should be given a much higher profile and recognition, especially in the Commission’s annual report."
"For the umpteenth time, the Petitions Committee has emphasised the need for the Commission’s infringement proceedings to be more robust and we welcome, therefore, the proposals made by Mrs Frassoni in this respect."
"I was also pleased to hear the comments on implementation made by President Barroso."
"We have also underlined the place of our citizens in the lawmaking process."
"Many of us would like to see them have a role in initiating law, as foreseen by the European citizens’ initiative in the draft Constitutional Treaty; but sadly, probably, this is a matter for another day."
"But we could at least ensure that our citizens understand what we are doing in their name."
"There seems to be broad support for the proposition that each directive and regulation should be prefaced by a non-legally binding citizens’ summary."
"In short, let us have legislation that is accessible in its form, the way we make it and the way we enforce it."
". Madam President, I particularly want to welcome all the reports."
"As coordinator of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I particularly would like to commend Mrs McCarthy on the excellent work she has done, as well as our committee, which held a hearing on this topic."
"One of the lessons we must learn from this exercise – and I say this to the select group of colleagues around here – is that better regulation is a shared task for every single Member of this Parliament, whatever committee they belong to."
"It is good that we are broadening out the discussion, but too few people are engaged."
"The major point I wish to make tonight, linked to the amendments I made to Mrs McCarthy’s report, which were accepted by the committee, is that better regulation is a process."
"I agree with much of what Mrs Wallis says."
"The problem is that the process is difficult, complex and very few people understand it."
"We have to try to explain and simplify it, but we need to explain it to our own constituencies as well as to people outside."
"How many people in this Parliament can really say that they understand the procedures that have now been set up within the Commission to improve the quality of legislation?"
"How many of you know what your responsibilities are under the famous interinstitutional agreement, which was signed in this very Chamber two years ago by our then President, Pat Cox?"
"I suspect that if we had a questionnaire about it, most of you would have no idea what those obligations are."
"Surely the first thing, colleagues, is that we should be putting our own House in order; that each of us should have that simplified checklist."
"We should say, when the Commission sends us a proposal – and this again is a recommendation – that with each proposal there should be just a short checklist about the procedures that the Commission has already gone through and the ones that it will go through in future."
"If there are documents and impact assessments, they should be clearly attached to that."
"That is the sort of practical definition and clarification of the process that we need."
"If we do not do that, citizens outside will lose belief in the process."
"The better legislation process is vital for the future of the whole way we do business here."
". Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I want to extend very warm thanks to all the rapporteurs and to those who have drafted opinions, not least for having agreed to us having this joint debate on them here today."
"This joint debate makes it possible for us to see all the aspects that we have to debate today under the headings of ‘better regulation’ or ‘better lawmaking’."
"I have to admit that it is getting harder and harder for me to get any overview of this debate."
"There is often nothing visible behind the well-intentioned forms of words that we hear, and with which we are already familiar."
"I also sometimes suspect that this debate on better lawmaking is intended to distract us from our real functions as legislators and to serve as a pretext for inaction on the part of those who legislate for the Community or for better regulation meaning deregulation."
"The whole thing has now got so baffling that one is tempted to call for a process of ‘better regulation of the better regulation process’ or for the impact of the impact assessment to be assessed."
"I am grateful to the rapporteurs for having worked out some very definite measures, albeit in amidst all this fog, particularly to Mrs Frassoni for her report with its concrete proposals for improved monitoring of the process of transposing Community law, for speedier infringement proceedings and greater transparency for those citizens who bring complaints."
"After all, it is not acceptable that members of the public should bring a complaint, or that the Commission should commence infringement proceedings, and then see the proceedings suddenly halted without the public being given any real information as to why this has happened."
"This often puts them in a worse position in pending cases at national level, and so rather more transparency is called for here."
"Above all, I welcome the proposals that Mr Doorn has put together, especially those relating to impact assessment."
"We agree with him that the impact of acts of comitology needs to be assessed too, and with the idea that the impact assessment should be subject to independent review – independent, that is, of the relevant Directorate-General, but not necessarily conducted outside the Commission."
"The Commission has its political responsibility, and should not be required to surrender it; indeed, in this specific instance, it has no intention of really doing so."
"We do not agree with Mr Doorn, though, on the question of mandatory impact assessments for amendments proposed in this House and in the Council."
"I do not think that we, as legislators, should, in this respect, allow ourselves to be shackled and silenced."
"A good impact assessment carried out by the Commission will also make it possible to gauge the effects of amendments, and there is also to hand the voluntary application of the impact assessment, of which – as we have heard – the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has already availed itself, and that is something that should be discussed by the other committees too."
"What is true of better regulation is true of all other good intentions and of all the good things in this life: it is no good unless something is actually done about it, rather than it just being talked about."
". Madam President, I have been campaigning for many years for better lawmaking, particularly in my committee, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"We need better and more comprehensive impact assessment and we need to look at whether legislation is really needed at EU level, or best left up to Member States in many instances."
"If it is needed, we need to have a proper cost-benefit analysis of businesses, including small businesses, and the workforce alike."
"I would like to see the impact assessments being truly independent, better than what we have quite often at the moment: a justification for the need for legislation."
"Once legislation has been passed, it has to be implemented equally, as we have all been saying, across all Member States."
"If it is not being implemented, is it because it is unworkable?"
"If it is unworkable, then, as the Commission has said, repeal it."
"Finally, we need to make sure the interinstitutional agreement on better lawmaking is complied with."
"In a reply just the other day, the Commission admitted that little progress had been made."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to tell Mr Barroso that what was decided today on energy shows that where there is a will there is a way, and so it is our ‘will’ that you find a ‘way’ in a greater number of cases, particularly in the areas of environmental, consumer and health policies. That, however, is an obvious message."
"Mr Winkler, I was sorry to notice that you did not say a word on the subject of the implementation of the law, even though this subject concerns the Member States most of all."
"I also believe it would be interesting to hear the Council’s views on the possibility of reopening the talks on the part of the better regulation agreement dealing with the implementation of the law, which failed miserably before."
"In addition, on the matter of impact assessments, I do not hide my concerns, since this topic is becoming a kind of myth, a magic formula that in itself ought to make legislation better by basing it on scientific, impartial sources."
"I personally am sceptical on this point."
"Indeed, I am concerned that this topic is taking on too much importance, primarily because some of the proposals contained in the reports – particularly Mrs McCarthy’s but not only hers – introduce some bureaucratic elements that would be really complicated to administer, above all for the Commission."
"That seed of doubt has made my group realise how lucky we are that we have postponed the vote, because that will give us a chance to review the situation in order to reach an agreement."
"In addition, those items that everyone is talking about that have been considered crucial in an impact assessment, including administrative costs, too much red tape and excessive costs for businesses, whether real or presumed, are in themselves a political choice."
"I shall give you an example, Mr Barroso and Mr Verheugen: a letter from UNICE was all it took to drastically cut back the air quality strategy, despite a EUR 2 million impact assessment that said that the costs to consider were not only the costs to businesses but also the costs to people’s health."
"In the end, therefore, even impact assessments are political choices, and as a result I would ask you not to make them such a priority and so completely overstated compared with the other aspects of the law."
"I wish to say a final word about the issue of co-regulation and self-regulation."
"I should like the Commission to carry out a study to determine how well these procedures have worked because, according to our studies, they have not worked properly."
"The ability of businesses and companies to comply with these self-regulation agreements has been considered rather unsatisfactory by the companies themselves."
". Madam President, it is extremely lamentable that there seems to be only one running through the discussion on subsidiarity and better lawmaking, namely increased economic growth and more competition by means of fewer rules and regulations."
"This creates the illusion that, particularly in the regulatory environment, more attention should be paid to subsidiarity in areas such as social protection, the environment and consumer protection."
"All of this fits into the neo-liberal way of thinking that fewer rules and regulations are, by definition, a good thing."
"Reality, however, shows us that it is those very same European rules on the hallowed internal market that make life difficult for the European citizens."
"For example, it is those rules that require a small municipality in the north of the Netherlands to ask for permission from the European Commission before it can install a glass-fibre cable network for its own citizens, or that consider government support of the City of Amsterdam to the local zoo to be distortion of competition."
"No wonder the people of the Netherlands, having lost all faith in a further extension of Brussels powers and in the proposed Constitution which approved and backed this process, proceeded, by an overwhelming majority, to consign that document to the waste paper basket."
"Reality is that subsidiarity has been an empty concept for a long time."
"European institutions, headed by this House, rarely, if ever, question whether European interference in a certain area actually makes a positive contribution to the wellbeing of people and the environment."
"On the contrary; a steady stream of European rules and regulations continues to undermine the authority of national and regional governments."
"One example I would give of that is the European services directive, which, even in its amended form, will seriously erode the autonomy of municipal authorities in the area of licences or the local provision of services."
"In a nutshell, whilst a discussion on the quality and subsidiarity of European legislation is to be welcomed, it is totally naïve to assume that by scrapping a handful of rules or carrying out impact assessments, the fundamental problems of interference from Brussels can be solved."
"For this to happen, the internal market rules will, in the first instance, need to be completely overhauled."
". Madam President, I should like to thank the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council, as well as our rapporteurs, for the mood they have set with regard to this debate today."
"Obviously there are problems within our lawmaking process; there are difficulties which we can all recognise and see in our everyday working lives."
"One of the things that is most clearly and importantly needed is the codification and simplification of the existing body of law – the – not only to ensure that businesses can operate more freely or properly across the internal market, but also to guarantee that individuals recognise where their rights are protected; that there are clear and defined rules to ensure that big business cannot overrun the rights of workers; that consumers cannot be trodden under foot because of decisions taken by financial institutions or whatever else."
"That is why for many years we in Parliament have been attempting to put in place this idea of impact assessment with regard to all legislation, to test it before it becomes law, to see its necessity and to understand fully what its impact will be when it is eventually transposed into law."
"However, when you look at the whole question of lawmaking, the biggest difficulties and the biggest culprits are found at Member State level in transposition of agreed European law."
"This is where governments have already been represented at the decision-making process, where Parliament and the Commission have been involved, but when it comes to transposition there is a difficulty because of a local domestic political dispute or because of a fear of a backlash in that political area."
"I think it would be wrong for the Commission to portray itself purely in the guise of the terrible enforcer against the Member States, because sometimes there are mistakes and errors within the legislation which must be corrected, and flexibility is required to achieve this."
"My last point is that, in setting up any working groups or expert groups concerning better lawmaking, it is essential to get the practitioners of politics involved – not just technocrats or parliamentary draftsmen, but politicians themselves who can understand how this must be sold to the public and enforced at a local level."
"Madam President, at present it is only selected specialists who can read EU laws and work out the state of the law in a particular area."
"Every shepherd has to keep track of every sheep, but no EU institution knows precisely how many laws we have."
"We have laid down something like 20 000 rules filling more than 100 000 pages."
"The state of the law governing, for example, the fisheries area is to be sought in more than 70 different regulations."
"Why not combine all the rules governing the same subject in one simple act?"
"In that way, citizens themselves will be able to see and read the resultant act, which is the first precondition for their having influence."
"Bold type can be used to draw attention to proposed amendments, and words that are to be deleted can be written in italics."
"In that way, everyone will be able to see what the aim of the proposal is."
"We shall also adopt the democratic principle from our own constitutions, namely that, in future, it will not be possible to adopt any EU law without its having been decided on here in the European Parliament."
"Under these arrangements, EU laws would be able to authorise the issue of notifications, but any such instrument could be reconsidered on the basis of a straightforward majority in the Council and Parliament."
"All committee procedures in which a minority combines with the Commission to legislate against the majority in the national parliaments and the European Parliament should also be abolished."
"It is absurd that the Commission should have been able to approve genetically modified cornflakes when, their citizens having discovered what had really been decided behind closed doors, 14 out of 15 countries were opposed to such approval and country number 15 also came out in opposition."
"If legislation in its entirety is opened up to the citizens, we shall also obtain better laws."
"Madam President, the European Commission monitors application of Community law on a yearly basis."
"At present we are debating the Commission’s 21st and 22nd annual reports."
"In order to appreciate the scale of the problem, it should be pointed out that some four thousand infringement proceedings are involved."
"A so-called reasoned opinion has been issued for almost one thousand of these, and over 400 have been referred to the Court of Justice."
"It is a matter of regret that the Commission was late in submitting the 22nd annual report."
"This was only received in January 2006 and consequently Parliament was only able to refer to part of the Commission’s information for 2004 in its resolution."
"Paradoxically, it could be said that the more complaints, the better."
"This is because the complaints indicate that citizens of the Member States are playing an important role in the monitoring process and thus also in Union lawmaking."
"The citizens’ complaints are not symbolic in nature."
"They are part of the process of building a citizens’ Europe and in general they are an effective way of monitoring the application of Community law."
"The European Parliament’s committees should monitor the implementation of Community law closely, particularly in situations where the relevant rapporteur is required to participate actively in monitoring the application of a particular legal provision in individual Member States and also, naturally, when it comes to calling for immediate action should any infringements be noted."
"The efficiency of the process should be improved by abbreviating the internal procedure, as was rightly included in the draft European Parliament resolution."
"It would also be appropriate to authorise individual Commissioners to exercise direct control over the transposition of Community provisions into national law within the stated periods of time."
"This could be achieved by authorising Commissioners to address requests for dealing with infringements within their particular sphere of competence directly to Member States."
". – Madam President, your helping me to make a very practical contribution to better lawmaking by being privileged to meet with the Conference of Presidents and have very in-depth discussions with them about legal acts is very definitely relevant to this debate."
"I am in any case grateful for your understanding."
"I would like to say something, very briefly, about one or two of the issues that have been touched on in this debate."
"A very large number of speakers had something to say about the comitology issue."
"We have a saying in Austria to the effect that one should not cluck over eggs that have not yet been laid, but, under the Austrian Presidency, we have returned to the comitology issue with a great deal of commitment."
"We have already had two rounds of very detailed negotiation with your House’s appointed representatives, the latter of which took place a couple of hours ago."
"After a number of years, I believe we are now on the right track towards finding a solution with which both the Council and Parliament can be satisfied."
"Whatever emerges will in any case be an improvement on the current situation, since it goes without saying that Parliament will have a say in those legislative acts that are adopted through the codecision procedure with its agreement and that of the Council."
"We are not far away from a solution, and I hope that we will arrive at finally sorting this out by the end of this period of six months."
"That will help improve our lawmaking processes."
"Mrs Frassoni was, of course, quite right in what she had to say about the implementation of the law and its importance."
"This is a matter for the Member States rather than for the Council as such – on behalf of which I am of course speaking – but the individual Member States are of course endeavouring, in their discussions with the Commission, to find better ways of ensuring that the law is applied."
"We too – by which I mean ‘we Austrians’ – are of course just as much affected by this as any other Member State; infringement procedures have the same effect on us as on any of them."
"Speaking as a lawyer, I can say that every law does of course need machinery whereby it can be put into effect; that is important, and we are also endeavouring to pay more attention to the Commission and to find better ways of enforcing and applying the law."
"The fact that what I said about this was not said in the name of the Council does not of course mean that the application and enforcement of the law are any less important than the legislative process itself."
"The question of legislation and of the review of legislative acts already adopted is of course at the forefront of the Council’s considerations."
"Madam President, I cannot help it, but when I see the name Winkler up there, I immediately think about Henry Winkler: remember the guy who was Fonzie in Happy Days?"
"It is good to have an Austrian Minister as Fonzie, giving the thumbs up to better regulation!"
"We have three linked issues in this plenary session."
"The first, which we dealt with yesterday, was to do with transparency and the openness of the Council; the second is this debate on better regulation and legislation, and the last one we have this evening is on citizenship."
"I support all those initiatives; I think they are great;"
"I think the work that the Secretary-General is doing in the Commission under Mr Ponzano is extremely good and I would like to recommend all four reports that have been put on the table today."
"Having said that and given that we are talking about better regulation, when I started going through the reports, I got a bit uneasy."
"I will just read you the language."
"I think there is a communication problem here."
"Mrs Frassoni drew up a great report, but paragraph 18, ‘Notes that the SOLVIT network has proved its effectiveness in the internal market as a complementary non-judicial mechanism which has increased voluntary cooperation among Member States ...’."
"It is all true, but if you are sitting up there trying to listen to this, you are not necessarily going to understand what it means."
"Mr Doorn, on better lawmaking, at paragraph 5, ‘is of the opinion that the Lamfalussy procedure is a useful mechanism; regards the convergence of supervisory practices as crucial; welcomes the work of the Level 3 committees in this respect and supports the call for an adequate toolbox;’ – great."
"Then, the McCarthy report – which I think is the clearest one – states in paragraph 6, ‘requests that the Commission carry out both and impact assessments on legislation to assist in identifying whether key policy objectives have been met ...’, and the Gargani report has exactly the same."
"What I am trying to say is that we need better regulation, better lawmaking, but it is to do with simplification and us understanding what we are deciding on and people understanding what we are trying to decide on."
"That is what better regulation is all about; therefore, we need to use better language."
"I cannot imagine how that sounded through the Finnish interpretation!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, under the guise of a technical debate, there is hidden here a debate of great political importance."
"We need better lawmaking, of course, but without deregulation and without sidelining the legislator itself."
"In this regard, I wish to express my very strong reservations about certain mechanisms, including alternative regulatory mechanisms such as regulation and self-regulation."
"They have their place but, in the interest of the citizens and of consumers, I believe that they must not, under any circumstances, take the place of the law, which confers rights but also duties and therefore constitutes the most legitimate democratic tool."
"As regards consultation prior to the legislative process, I call on the three institutions to organise, alongside the economic operators, the actual participation of the social partners and of civil society in all its diversity."
"It is, in fact, the responsibility of the public authorities to support the organisation of these players - consumer associations, public service users, associations fighting against exclusion or community education associations – throughout Europe."
"Finally, I should like to comment on the simplification rolling programme that is supposed to facilitate the Lisbon Strategy."
"I am surprised that it includes as its main principle the recasting of the regulation on organic farming, when even the producers in this sector are not asking for that, and that proposals as important as those on the status of the mutual benefit associations and of the European Association have, at the same time, been withdrawn from the legislative programme."
"Madam President, I quite agree here with those who think that a slimming diet would be good for the Europe of regulation, a Europe that is fussy about principles and, sadly, more lax about the monitoring of the transposition and proper application of our legislation."
"This much is clear: ten years after the launch of the SLIM programme, and despite the signing, two years ago, of the ‘Better lawmaking’ interinstitutional agreement, there is still a long way to go."
"We have still not curbed the Union’s appetite for legislation."
"I am therefore delighted that the Commission is now proposing to us this balanced diet: three conditions to ensure that this agenda functions, strengthens the Union and brings it closer to Europeans."
"It has been said that Europe should make laws only when it can do better than other levels of authority."
"As we have just heard Mr Stubb say, from the Canaries to Scandinavia, by way of Brussels, we must avoid once and for all using European jargon, and we must speak and write laws in the language that is most easily understood by all those for whom it is intended."
"There are many more examples."
"Thirdly, this slimming diet that we want and that the SMEs, in particular, also want is not a casual, non-interventionist diet."
"It must be stressed - and here I shall conclude, Madam President - that better regulation does not mean lack of ambition."
"I agree with Mrs Frassoni: it is REACH, for example, that I am thinking of in highlighting this last point."
"Madam President, I congratulate all our rapporteurs in undertaking this gargantuan effort today and shall focus briefly on two points: Council transparency and Mr Doorn’s report on subsidiarity."
"As we heard yesterday, a lack of Council transparency remains the elephant in the room; it remains the root cause of so much discontent with EU lawmaking in general."
"Surely the Council can take more steps towards meaningfully meeting in public."
"Right now only Havana and Pyong Yang operate in such an opaque fashion."
"We should be doing better than that in the 21st century."
"More substantively, turning to subsidiarity and especially paragraphs 25-29 of Mr Doorn’s report, I give my own country, Scotland, as an example of the missed opportunity that subsidiarity currently represents."
"Scotland is currently part of a Member State not known for its enthusiastic EU engagement and yet our parliament in Edinburgh would represent an enthusiastic partner in better EU lawmaking."
"Our parliament has total responsibility for health, the environment, justice, education, fishing, agriculture and many more areas, yet the EU view of subsidiarity too often stops at the Member State when, in fact, the more relevant partner may well be much more local."
"I would associate myself with all of Mr Doorn’s recommendations on impact assessments, although I echo Mrs Wallis’ comments on political engagement and stress that such engagement must be as local as possible."
"Then perhaps we will see subsidiarity starting to work for the betterment of EU legislation in the future."
"Madam President, I do not think that this debate can be reduced to a debate on the quality of legislation."
"The actual quantity of EU legislation must also be debated."
"The fact is that the number of EU laws has risen dramatically in recent years, and the EU is now legislating in a host of new areas."
"At the same time, it is extremely unusual for the EU to give its right of decision-making back to Member States or to repeal legislation."
"The combination of a very large quantity of legislation and the deficient quality of such legislation makes for a lack of clarity and makes it difficult to implement legislation in practice."
"Where quality is concerned, there is a lot that can now already be done, and the reports contain proposals for doing these things."
"Out-of-date legislation can be repealed."
"Other legislation can be simplified, and some can be merged and consolidated."
"All that is fine, but another way of approaching legislative work is also required."
"In determining the direction to be taken by legislation, we need to focus more on objectives and less on detail, and we need to give the Member States greater freedom to choose how they are to pursue the objectives set."
"Impact analyses are fine, but it is not always so easy to measure what we want to measure."
"More often than not, it is simpler to measure straightforward economic factors than, for example, environmental factors."
"We had this debate in connection with the debate on the chemicals policy, REACH."
"It was easy to measure a company’s costs, but difficult to measure the huge benefits in terms of public health and reduced human suffering of there being fewer diseases."
"This means that there is a need to be rather careful in this area."
"If there is a real desire to simplify matters, the number of EU laws must be reduced, and the area that is absolutely the most overregulated is agricultural policy, where most matters could be returned to Member State level and thousands of laws could be abolished."
"A number of speakers refer to the European Constitution."
"The fact is, it would have made these problems worse by increasing the EU’s power and making it easier for the EU to appropriate new legislative powers and to be able to legislate in areas in which it really ought not to get involved."
"We should therefore thank the Dutch and French voters now as well."
"Madam President, a legislator’s skill is demonstrated not only by the ability to make sound laws, but also by the ability to refrain from regulating where no regulation is needed."
"Accordingly, the statements in the report on broadening and tightening the principles for assessment of the cost and impact of legislation deserve strong support."
"There is a reference in the report to the negative impact of political compromises on the development of European law."
"The directive on services is a case in point."
"Each of the two sides of the debate maintains that it has won the day."
"For the Socialists, Mrs Gebhardt claims she turned the directive upside down, whilst for the Conservatives Mr Harbour rejoices that an excellent compromise has been reached."
"Who is mistaken?"
"Perhaps nobody is?"
"We may well have come up with a document consisting of dozens of contradictory provisions, in the hope that it will contain something for everyone."
"It amounts to feel-good therapy for the Member States, the Union as a whole and also for this House."
"We are, however, salving our consciences at the expense of the citizens, the entrepreneurs and the quality of our laws."
"Madam President, further to the reports on better lawmaking that are the subject of today’s discussion, I should like to make a few observations about the role of impact assessments."
"I gather from Mr Doorn that he is in favour of a random test being carried out by a panel of authoritative experts."
"I wholeheartedly support the idea behind it."
"Like him, I call for a truly independent committee, one that is not made up of representatives of the three institutions."
"We have examples of this in the Netherlands, in the shape of the committee that monitors the environmental impact reports."
"If you have had a few bruising encounters with such a panel, then you are bound to clean up your act the next time."
"I would also like to add that legislation is always a learning process, but the explicit description of it as such in Recital J of the Doorn report is, in my view, far too negative."
"We do what we can to adopt sound legislation."
"We are bound to get it wrong the odd time, but to see this as an objective from the outset strikes me as taking things too far."
"Madam President, you are an eminent specialist on the ancient Japan of the Tokugawa era, during which people were deliberately kept in ignorance of laws deemed to be state secrets, knowledge of which was restricted to a small number of great lords, because it was thought that in this way people would retain far greater respect for standards about which they knew nothing."
"Well, I sometimes wonder whether we do not, in fact, draw our inspiration from this ancient Japanese legislation."
"In reality, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the complexity of European law is the perverse effect of a group dynamic to which we are all party."
"What is it all about?"
"Firstly, the initiative rests with the Commission, but behind every Commissioner, there is, of course, the general management and the officials who are part of it."
"Next, it passes to the Council."
"In theory, the Council is composed of ministers."
"They reach agreement on a text, provided that each of their respective bureaucracies recognises in it all of the standards that are to feature in the joint text, then the text is passed to Parliament and Parliament appoints a rapporteur."
"Naturally, the rapporteur, as is perfectly legitimate, wants his name to go down in history."
"His name is much more likely to be remembered if he adds standards rather than removes them, and that is without mentioning the Members who table amendments, the important role of lobbies and so on. Thus it is, ladies and gentlemen, that we arrive at a real regulatory monster."
"I have been in this Parliament for 17 years and, right from the very first year of my taking up my seat here, there was already a debate being held on the simplification of European Community law."
"I have the impression that we are no farther forward with this than we were 17 years ago, the only difference being that the situation has got even worse."
"What is to be done then?"
"We have to agree on the meaning of the terms used."
"We need a proper dictionary of Community law, a code like the Civil Code, or the Commercial Code or the Penal Code, which is organised rationally and divided into parts, sub-parts, chapters, sections and articles, in such a way that, when we are working on a text, we know in advance that we are going to amend such and such an article."
"In short, we need to make a great effort towards simplification."
"I fear that, despite the good intentions expressed by the rapporteurs, we are not quite there yet."
"Thank you."
"– Madam President, Commissioner Verheugen, I should like to start by taking this opportunity to thank all four rapporteurs for their constructive work on this issue, which is not only preoccupying pub regulars, but increasingly politicians, too."
"What I found particularly refreshing about this debate was the speech by Mr Gollnisch, in which he made a truly impassioned plea for the establishment of the European Constitution, something which we obviously have in common – I was previously unaware of this."
"Indeed, I also believe that, with the European Constitution, we would be in a very much better position in the field of normative lawmaking than is presently the case."
"I am glad that we are pulling together on this."
"I believe that we should always bear in mind with regard to better lawmaking that the aim of all these reports on the subject is not, of course, to improve the familiarity of the individual citizen with the legal texts, but to provide Member States with a simple text to help with transposition."
"Therefore, we need to keep our objective clearly in mind when faced with these challenges."
"Naturally, in this particular context – and I do not mean to be ironic in any way when I say that I have to expressly agree with the previous speaker for once on this particular point – we complain that our legislative process is not at all transparent in the field of comitology. This legislative process has been criticised in this House from time to time."
"For this reason, I am convinced that we need external scrutiny of European legislation, and that this cannot just be carried out by the Commission itself."
"The question arises whether this could be carried out by an agency – and you are all aware of our reservations about the creation of further agencies: ‘no increase in bureaucracy to reduce bureaucracy’ – or by other external authorities."
"At all events, Parliament should be involved in choosing these external authorities."
"Therefore, the four reports we are discussing today also provide an excellent starting point for arriving at a common position between Parliament and the Commission, and possibly even the Council, on this issue."
"Madam President, better lawmaking in the European Union calls for sound provisions formulated more transparently, and also for swifter and more effective implementation and application of such provisions."
"There are still too many instances of incorrect implementation of Community law."
"This is partly due to the poor quality of the provisions and partly to deliberate action by the Member States, intent on undermining Community legislation for political, economic or administrative reasons."
"In addition, the national courts in many Member States are still reluctant to implement the principle of the primacy of Community legislation."
"If Union legislation is not deemed to be binding on all, and its transposition and implementation depend entirely on a government’s good will, the outcome could be the objective renationalisation of Community policy, as Mrs Frassoni rightly highlights in her report."
"Clearly, this would be very detrimental to the internal market and to the entire ."
"Lack of uniformity of transposition may also lead to incorrect implementation of Union legislation should different provisions be implemented in different countries, thus undermining the Union’s credibility."
"If we are not capable of bringing pressure to bear upon the governments of Member States to transpose Union legislation correctly, we cannot expect people to believe that Union institutions such as the Commission, the Council or the European Parliament will effectively defend citizens’ rights derived from Union law."
"Madam President, the European Parliament must be the standard bearer for better legislation."
"The European Parliament’s work must be transparent and clearly formulated, and we must, in particular, remove the administrative barriers in European legislation."
"I therefore call on Parliament's leadership to ensure that our legislative work is better coordinated so that we do not again end up in a situation in which the committees propose amendments that contradict each other."
"At the same time, we must prioritise legal certainty and predictability for our citizens and not let the authorities or the European Court of Justice have too much discretion."
"The President of the European Council - the Austrian Chancellor – has attacked the European Court of Justice for arrogating too much power to itself."
"However, the Court is merely doing its job, because we legislators are not doing our own sufficiently well."
"I am, unfortunately, afraid that, with the Services Directive, we are in the process of repeating previous errors and that we are letting the European Court of Justice have too much scope for interpretation."
"This is an area in which we must all do better at second reading."
"– In my meetings with internal market stakeholders I have often faced criticism over current European legislation."
"Poorly drafted legislation often makes it difficult to transpose drafts into the legal systems of the states concerned."
"Participants in the public hearing on this matter, including Commissioner Verheugen, have confirmed that textual ambiguity often causes legal uncertainty or, alternatively, distorts competition and fragments the internal market, weakening the ability of consumers and enterprises to make full use of its benefits."
"I therefore welcome the recommendations of the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, for the Commission to continue consolidating, simplifying and codifying Community legislation in order to make it easier to understand."
"It goes without saying that the rule should apply that improvements in legislation must not weaken environmental, social or consumer standards."
"Based on my experience from drafting the report on financing European standardisation, I fully agree with the rapporteur that only good, clear and, above all, simple laws on the internal market will benefit citizens, consumers and enterprises, helping the European Union to strengthen its position with regard to competitors in the global economy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that better regulations will provide a basis for efforts by European institutions to create jobs and generate growth in the European Union under the revised Lisbon Strategy."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank the four rapporteurs for establishing a new architecture of better legislation for a Europe that is closer to its citizens."
"Madam President, there was a time when laws were made by gods; gods made perfect laws."
"Then the gods became tired and men began to make laws, and laws are now imperfect."
"At the moment, therefore, whether a law is good or bad is decided by nobody but ourselves, the only criterion for judging whether a law is good or bad is democracy, the criterion of the majority, because, as Rousseau said, ‘it is reasonable for the majority to decide, rather than the minority'."
"Having established this principle in the modern democracies, democracy is representative and it is the parliaments that legislate; they can make mistakes, but the only criterion for legitimacy is the parliamentary majority."
"On this basis, I believe that the greatest danger to democracy at the moment is the technocracy associated with economic interests — what is known as self-regulation or co-regulation — which is a way to put general interests into the hands of the individual interests of the few, and that is something we should remember."
"I myself, having been elected to many terms in office, would not be prepared to renounce my legislative responsibilities in favour of sub-contracting and in favour of technocratic interests."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I realise that the new approach to European regulation requires changes in thinking, and possibly even changes to agreements."
"If we wish, however, to retain the public’s faith in the single market, we must stem the outflow of investment and the loss of jobs."
"This means that we must not only reduce and simplify legislation, but we must also, in my opinion, reconsider the original aims of both European and national regulation."
"This is a serious political challenge."
"It is also up to us, ladies and gentlemen, to demand that every single measure, whether aimed at, for example, protecting health or the environment, is subjected to an impact assessment."
"Mrs McCarthy is requesting this in the report of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection I would add that it must be made clear what costs will be borne by European producers, by how much public finances will be increased or depleted and what will be the effect on unemployment in our regions."
"In particular we should know in advance how regulations aimed at improving standards will affect the competitiveness of European products vis-à-vis third countries, so as to ensure that the main outcome is not the further migration of plant and capital away from Europe."
"Better regulation also means that, in the context of costs, we will investigate seriously whether the new measures might really improve the health or social conditions of our citizens, or whether this is merely an unfounded assumption."
"Both as a doctor and as a politician I do not like it that so many European and national regulations are merely populist gestures."
"Against that, I have no clear ideas on how to protect consumers against the harmful or counterfeit products from third countries that are displacing quality European products."
"An example of this might be the children’s footwear from Asia that has orthopaedic defects."
"The only solution to this would be a mandatory new health certificate for children’s footwear, which would also be better regulation for the public."
"I am sorry that the Commission is being so slow to codify consumer protection and the protection of intellectual property."
"Never before has the standard of European regulation been as important as it is today, when the Union faces serious competition from third countries."
"The political aim of today’s regulation is to safeguard both fair competition and the European consumer – not only inside but also outside Europe – and also to motivate the creativity of our citizens while ridding them of ineffective regulation."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, better Community lawmaking means assessing and defining the endeavour with regard to its technical side."
"The complexity of national administrations, the limited facility for transposition and, often, the lack of will exacerbate things."
"Sanctions by the Union itself would appear here to be the most effective measure."
"Nonetheless, the wager for the proper application of Community legislation is the shaping of political and, above all, social will."
"The proper application of Community legislation is a procedure which would allow Europe in the medium term to reduce its inertia and become more competitive in the international globalised environment, for the benefit of citizens, consumers and companies."
"We need rules which are clear, integral and comprehensible."
"Such texts, of course, presuppose clearer agreements between their authors."
"It is very important to simplify and rationalise the legislative ."
"It would be even more preferable for laws respecting the principles of transparency, proportionality and consistency to regulate the basic points of a sector and make provision for implementing measures which also relate to the technical details."
"As for the effectiveness of the arrangements, it is important to assess the costs and benefits of application."
"Social dialogue is therefore needed with the agencies involved, which will thus be in a position to act as joint legislators."
"As regards major political proposals in particular, this is the only way for us to win the confidence of the citizens."
"A good law is not a labyrinthine law with strict procedures, it is a law which is convenient for citizens and, at the same time, makes them jointly responsible for its application."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the impression that this debate has made it clear that the problem at the heart of our discussion here is regulatory impact assessments."
"In my opinion, it has absolutely nothing to do with democracy being replaced with technocracy."
"That is not what this is about."
"It goes without saying that the democratic institutions are still in control."
"The Commission makes decisions on proposals on its own responsibility, as, of course, do Parliament and the Council."
"This matter hinges on a vital point, namely that we are changing the procedures governing our support."
"Currently, the EU makes legislation on the basis of ‘learning by doing’."
"We decide on something, and something comes out of it in the end that has some effect or other."
"If we subsequently discover that the effect is undesirable, we have the problem that, thanks to the EU’s complex procedures, we cannot just quickly amend these laws, as national parliaments do, but need a complex procedure lasting many years to revise directives and amend regulations."
"Thus, different mechanisms are needed from those often existing at national level."
"We need to know what we are doing."
"What regulatory impact assessments do is give us support; we are informed of the consequences our actions will have by independent people, too."
"Even though, ultimately, the political decision remains ours to take, we still need this support."
"That is quite crucial when the Commission, the Council and Parliament have to take decisions on behalf of 470 million people in such a large economic area."
"For that reason, too, it is vital to have an independent element."
"I would appeal quite clearly once more to the Commission to work to ensure the introduction of this independent element within its own structures, too."
"If it does not, Parliament – if it takes itself seriously – will be forced to conduct its own independent impact assessments in each case."
"That is contrary to the spirit of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2003."
"We should like the Commission to do this on its own initiative, so that we have sound bases for decision."
". – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to try once more to explain what this is all about, and what it is not about."
"It is not about less legislation, nor about worse legislation."
"It is not about deregulation, nor about neoliberal free-market radicalism."
"It is purely and simply about shaping the European legal system such as to make it understandable to the public, and such that the European economy can use it for growth, investment and job creation."
"It is really the simplest thing in the world, and I am astonished time and again at the kind of motives being attributed to such a clear, unambiguous concept."
"Whether or not we believe that we have too many European laws or that these may not always be good enough is irrelevant."
"We are not talking about a matter of belief, but about an alarmingly large proportion of the European public being convinced that that is the case."
"We are talking about European entrepreneurs and trade unions unanimously saying that that is the case."
"Too much bureaucracy, too many laws, overly complicated laws, too many unnecessary restrictions."
"It does not matter if this is really the case; what matters is that those for whom we make the laws are convinced that it is."
"That is why we had to do something."
"The ‘better lawmaking’ exercise proposed by the Commission uses all the instruments that have been mentioned here – various ways of simplifying and modernising legislation without changing its content."
"To reiterate: the important thing is not to change the substance of regulations, but to make them user friendly and transparent."
"I would once more solicit Parliament’s support."
"In reality, of course, we are concerned here with two large projects, two different projects, one of which is the retroactive screening of the whole corpus of legislation."
"Let us not fool ourselves, however."
"When European integration was still in its infancy, the attitude towards the adoption of legislation was quite different from that which prevails today, and, going back a little further, astonishing things are to be found in the annals of our statute books."
"No one is denying that modernisation is needed there."
"The screening of the whole corpus is no simple matter, and I should be very much in favour of our agreeing on common procedures for this, too, and not just with regard to codification, where this has already been done."
"A separate issue is how to make regulations or laws in future."
"The issue of impact assessments plays a quite fundamental role in this connection."
"I agree with all of you here who have said that it is essential in a democracy that the legislature knows the consequences its action will have for those affected."
"Of course, that does not mean that the legislature will refrain from acting once in possession of that knowledge."
"It will always be a matter of judgment."
"If the Commission were to say that a piece of legislation would incur costs to the economy of EUR X billion but that, on the other hand, this legislation had to be presented in order to meet the public’s need for health protection, the decision would not be a difficult one."
"The Commission would then say that the protection of public health takes precedence, even if it costs money."
"I should like to make it clear here that impact assessments do not automatically mean that, should it emerge that one of our actions also incurs costs, we simply say: we shall not do it."
"It is a case of knowing exactly what we are doing."
"Some important thoughts have been expressed here on the issue of how best to organise such impact assessments, and I can tell you quite frankly that a discussion on this issue is currently under way in the Commission, and both President Barroso and myself are truly of the opinion that the current system needs to be changed."
"I wholeheartedly agree with those of you here who have said that the final decision on the validity of an impact assessment cannot lie with those who performed it, and that work on an impact assessment cannot be carried out exclusively by those making the law associated with it."
"That is exactly the way President Barroso and I see it."
"We are discussing the best possible solution."
"Indeed, in his introductory statement, the President said that he is considering establishing an independent authority under his own responsibility for screening impact assessments."
"We are ready and willing to continue our dialogue with Parliament, therefore."
"The same goes for the comitology procedure, in which, indeed, we largely endorse Parliament’s requests, and also for all the other ideas that have been expressed here."
"I should just like to impress upon you once more that this exercise should not be dealt with in a technical, bureaucratic or formalistic way."
"It is truly a highly political exercise."
"It is intended to help reinforce public confidence in the system of European integration as a whole, and to help provide our economy with a stable, reliable framework, so as to resolve the great social issue of our time, namely that of the future of our jobs."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 16 May."
"The rapporteur did an excellent job in identifying the obstacles in Community and Member State laws that create difficulties in the operation of the internal market."
"The solution is the review of the existing laws and a better, more cautious preparation of new laws."
"This is the responsibility of the legislation process itself."
"Neither the Commission, who prepares and executes the laws, nor the legislating Council and Parliament are passing on this responsibility to others, and particularly not to external bodies."
"Parliament has a role and responsibility in the review of existing laws in its capacity of legislator."
"I respectfully ask the Commission to cooperate closely with Parliament, in the spirit of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making."
"When preparing future regulations, it is not expedient to further complicate the long, bureaucratic procedures."
"If we were to create an independent external audit body today to examine the quality of impact assessment studies, why should we not create an independent external inspection body tomorrow, to examine the independence of the audit body?"
"Rather than multiplying the bodies inspecting procedures that have proved to be wrong, we should develop new, more efficient working methods to improve the regulation of the internal market."
"Together with the review of the laws, the Commission, Council and Parliament must also reconsider their own procedures, and if required, they must transform them responsibly."
"Finally, I would like to call the attention of all three institutions to the fact that society will only trust and respect European law if we ensure full publicity and social control."
"European legislation is too complex and sometimes superfluous: an intelligent overhaul must make it possible for us to fight against this unhealthy and damaging lack of clarity."
"On the one hand, we should make improvements by reducing and simplifying the existing legislation."
"In this simplification project, as for any new measure adopted, the principles of proportionality and of subsidiarity must be respected: the European Union where it is necessary, when it is more effective than the Member States acting independently, as much as is needed, but no more than is needed."
"The application of these apparently technical principles involves making a judgment as to their social, cultural or other appropriateness, even though there is no effective mechanism with which to monitor their application."
"This loophole was filled by the draft Constitution."
"While we are waiting for it to be ratified, we have to wonder about the proper application of these principles."
"On the other hand, we need to improve the monitoring of the transposition of Community law because lack of legal certainty undermines the competitiveness of our businesses."
"The introduction of national correspondents is a positive measure if the controls encompass a quantitative and a qualitative analysis and include an impact analysis regarding the social, economic and ecological environment."
"These impact analyses must be comparable: they must therefore be standardised."
"In order to achieve this aim, the European Parliament must strengthen its power in this area."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0017/2006)."
"The following questions have been submitted to the Commission."
"Is the Commission planning an EU-wide information campaign to ensure that organisations which will have to comply with the new directive on money-laundering and terrorist financing 2005/60/EC(1) (e.g. banks and legal firms) have sufficient information on new procedures?"
". The Commission recognises the importance of raising awareness on the new, more comprehensive EU regime against money laundering and terrorist financing."
"That is why the Commission has already undertaken a number of information initiatives."
"In that context I would like to mention: first, the Commission's participation in outreach efforts European professional organisations initiated by the OECD Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing; secondly, the ongoing consultation on the impact of the second Anti-Money Laundering Directive on the legal profession, which will lead to the publication of a report this summer, probably in July; thirdly, an extensive consultation of all stakeholders in the context of the preparation of possible implementing measures under the third Anti-Money Laundering Directive; fourthly, participation in conferences organised by Member States as part of their responsibilities for implementing EU money laundering directives."
"In view of those ongoing initiatives, the Commission currently is not planning to conduct a further EU-wide information campaign."
"However, the Commission continues to monitor closely the implementation of the directive, and it would not rule out further actions if there are shown to be problems in particular sectors and EU action would have added value."
". Commissioner, that all sounds very good, but my eye was caught by something in the Law Society of England and Wales’s new money laundering newsletter."
"It referred to an extensive industry that has developed around services aiming to help lawyers with their compliance duties."
"It struck me that, as the third money laundering directive brought in the notion of proportionate checks of risk sensitivity, we need to make sure that the compliance falls where the really serious risks are."
"Often constituents come to me because as individuals they have difficulties opening bank accounts."
"I hope that you will convey that message."
"It truly has to be risk-sensitive compliance."
". In this particular directive the point about risk sensitivity is well made."
"There are different categories of risk and the authorities should draw up their procedures on the basis of those risk assessments."
"That is clearly specified in the third directive, and the point is well taken by the MEP."
"I would not like to see a whole industry developing around people charging exorbitant fees for what should be a relatively reasonable procedure."
"The levels of risk should be assessed."
"There is very little to be done for those at a low level of risk, and there are higher categories."
"That is clearly set out in the directive."
"I thank the honourable Member for raising this question, because it gives me an opportunity to emphasise the point that she made in her supplementary question."
"Commissioner, bearing in mind that the IRA is believed after its Northern Bank robbery to have exploited money-laundering opportunities in Bulgaria, what specific steps are being taken to ensure that the authorities and organisations there, and indeed in Romania, are ready and able to implement the legislative requirements on money laundering and terrorist financing?"
". The honourable Member will be aware that part of the procedure that any applicant country must go through is that it must ensure that the directives of the Community are put into effect."
"That will apply equally to Bulgaria and Romania."
"The Member is probably also aware that these recommendations stem from the Financial Action Task Force – FATF, as it is known – and most countries around the world are bound to implement the recommendations of that particular body."
"In the EU we have taken it upon ourselves, in a directive, to implement the recommendations, which has been done in the third money laundering directive."
"You can rest assured that Bulgaria will be taking those measures into account in its legislation, as it is part of its deal to acquire full membership of the European Union."
"Does the Commission have sufficient practical and legal powers to force tough and timely action to prevent Member States drawing up national legislation, for example, permitting company poison-pills to deter extra-territorial takeovers?"
"Does the Commission have sufficient powers to effectively challenge countries that unilaterally choose to label certain industrial sectors as off-limits because of a declared national interest that is self-defined?"
"Should the EU be granted any further powers in order to take control of this situation and if so what should these be and how should they be advanced?"
". The President has pointed out that I am taking this question on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Kroes."
"The Commission has significant powers to ensure that Member States fully respect the internal market rules and do not create unlawful obstacles to cross-border mergers."
"If a Member State violates internal market rules, the Commission can launch an infringement procedure pursuant to Article 226 of the EC Treaty."
"This procedure may require a certain time, as the Commission has, at two separate stages, to grant the Member State the opportunity to express its view before introducing an action before the Court of Justice, which then has to take the final decision on the alleged infringement."
"Where justified by the circumstances of the case, the Commission can act more speedily by giving very short deadlines to Member States in the pre-litigation phase and asking the court to grant interim measures."
"Even in that case, the Commission is obliged to take into account the observations of the Member States, including late responses, as it is settled case-law that the proper conduct of their pre-litigation procedure constitutes an essential guarantee required by the EC Treaty, not only in order to protect the rights of the Member State concerned but also to ensure that any contentious procedure would have a clearly defined dispute as its subject-matter."
"Moreover, in cases where a Member State intervenes with regard to concentrations with a Community dimension, the Commission has special powers to adopt a decision under Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 139/2004, known as the Merger Regulation."
"Pursuant to that provision, the Commission has the exclusive competence to assess concentrations with a Community dimension."
"Member States can adopt measures which could prohibit or prejudice or such operations only if, first, the measures in question protect the interests other than those taken into account by the Merger Regulation and, second, those measures are necessary and proportionate for the protection of interests compatible with EC law."
"Public security, plurality of media and prudential rules are considered to be interests compatible with EC law."
"Measures adopted in pursuit of those interests must in any event be necessary and proportionate, and the Commission may seek information from the national authorities about the intended measures in order to verify this."
"The other interests must be communicated to the Commission before the adoption of those measures."
"The Commission must then decide, within 25 working days, whether the national measures are justified for the protection of an interest compatible with EC law."
"The Commission considers that the abovementioned provisions can allow it, in a timely manner, to act against any unlawful protectionist measures adopted by Member States."
"The Commission is, moreover, firmly committed to use all the powers at its disposal to ensure full compliance with EC law."
". That was a very lengthy response, but with respect it was not really an answer because I appreciate what the powers are."
"My question is whether you really needed any more powers."
"Specifically you said that the pre-litigation phase could be speeded up."
"I should like a specific answer please: as regards the post-litigation phase, would you not agree that sometimes that can take several years and then again several years before a penalty is applied?"
"Would it not be handy to have powers to cut that short and make it even sharper?"
". I can understand the intent of the supplementary question put by the honourable Member."
"Yes, it is sometimes frustrating to have to wait for a considerable period of time before there is action."
"However, we are a Community of laws and we must abide by settled law on this."
"The procedures must be followed."
"Even in Member States these types of actions take some time."
"Although sometimes there are mechanisms to expedite the process in Member States, and even in the Community you can exercise rights to expedite the process, it is still pretty time consuming."
"So, I am afraid that we cannot rule by or by in this Community."
"It would be an abuse of privilege."
"I do not think anybody would advocate that."
"On the other hand, it is sometimes frustrating that there is such a considerable period of time, but I do not see any other way around it."
"Furthermore, I do not foresee any Member State rushing to give the Commission more immediate new powers or powers to expedite the process."
"We have to live by what is there."
"The ‘first job contract’ that has been introduced in France allows businesses with more than 20 employees to take on a young person of under 26, with a two-year trial period during which s/he can be dismissed without reason."
"These employees would not benefit from the protective labour-law clauses requiring an employer to justify dismissal."
"Article 2.2 of Directive 2000/78/EC(2) deems discrimination to have occurred ‘where one person is treated less favourably than another is’, inter alia on grounds of age."
"Does the Commission think that the ‘first job contract’ complies with the principles of the directive?"
"If not, what steps does it intend to take vis-à-vis the Member State concerned?"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Désir, the Commission has not yet received notification of the French law referred to earlier in the question raised by the Member, and the Commission is therefore not ready to express a detailed opinion on the law."
"The aim of Directive 2000/78/EC, as already mentioned, is in fact to prevent discrimination in the area of employment, especially age discrimination."
"The Directive also sets out several exceptions to the general rule."
"Allow me to quote directly from the Directive."
"‘Nevertheless, differences in treatment in connection with age may be justified under certain circumstances and therefore require specific provisions which may vary in accordance with the situation in Member States."
"It is therefore essential to distinguish between differences in treatment which are justified, in particular by legitimate employment policy, labour market and vocational training objectives, and discrimination which must be prohibited’."
"Another quotation: ‘Putting in place special conditions regarding access to employment and vocational training, and occupation, including dismissal and remuneration conditions, for young people, older workers and persons with caring responsibilities, in order to promote their vocational integration or ensure their protection’."
"So you see, the situation from the standpoint of the Directive is of a twofold nature. The Directive acknowledges different forms of handling, where there are legitimate grounds, and different measures, where such measures are of a character that is in proportion with the purpose for which they are intended."
"I have nothing further to say about the situation that currently prevails."
"The definitive viewpoint on any notified law must understandably rest with the Court of Justice in Luxembourg."
". Commissioner, I think, in fact, that when the Commission receives notice of the First Employment Contract, it will be important that it can conduct a precise analysis of the conditions in which this law would authorise allowing the employment contract of young people under the age of 26 to be terminated during the first two years."
"If, as you have said, directive 2000/78 allows differences in treatment, including on grounds of age, it is within the framework of positive actions, of actions proportionate to the desired objective."
"Recently, a judgment was delivered by the Court of Justice – Mangold judgment of 22 November 2005 – concerning another piece of legislation, the German ‘Hartz 4’ law, which relates to provisions for older workers."
"This judgment took the view that, in this case, the way of renewing fixed-term contracts exclusively for these older workers was not proportional to the desired objective."
"I think that, in the case of the First Employment Contract, nobody believes that the measure in question is favourable to young people under the age of 26."
"This is therefore clearly an act of discrimination towards them, which denies them the benefit of a number of elements of employment law."
"I hope that the Commission will rely on Court of Justice case law in order to condemn this First Employment Contract."
". Mr Désir, you cited one particular case which is very important for assessing similar situations, since the Directive does in fact assume that each measure will be on the one hand proportionate and on the other hand legitimate in relation to its purpose."
"In the case you mentioned relating to older workers, the Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled that the purpose was legitimate but the measure was not proportionate and therefore the measure was rejected."
"At this point in time, as I have said, due to the fact that the law has not yet been notified, we do not know what form it will take, and indeed I have even read reports in the media that its final form has still not been determined, so it is impossible for me, as a representative of the Commission, to provide further details."
"– Mr President, in EU Member States such as France, Germany, Spain and Italy, a full-blown labour market for trainees has developed."
"Increasing numbers of regular workers are being replaced by unpaid or poorly paid trainees, or in Germany, for example, by state-financed ‘1 euro jobs’ – in which previously unemployed persons are entitled to earn EUR 1 per hour on top of their unemployment benefit – which are not liable to tax or social-security contributions."
"To what extent is the Commission aware of this problem?"
". The Commission, of course, monitors the labour market in the individual Member States, as well as developments in employment legislation."
"Incidentally, a Green Paper on the development of employment legislation in Europe will be published shortly, and will become, I hope, the basis for some very far-reaching discussions on the customs, methods and development of employment law and employer-employee legal relationships in the EU Member States."
"Otherwise, of course, the Commission can monitor and take decisions only within such frameworks as have been provided under the Treaty, and here it must be said that the Treaty does not provide direct links to employment legislation."
"Council Regulation (EC) n° 485/2005(3), consideration 3, stipulates that 'it is appropriate to extend the possibility of withdrawal of fishing vessels from the Community fishing fleet with public aid to vessels which are transferred to the countries affected by the tsunami for the benefit of the fishing communities concerned.'"
"Since this Regulation requires the Member States to inform the Commission on a regular basis, could the Commission tell me how many demands to deliver such vessels came from which countries that are victims of the tsunami, how many vessels have been offered from the Member States and how many vessels actually have been sent to which countries in the Indian Ocean?"
". Council Regulation (EC) No 485/2005 to which the honourable Member refers extends the possibility of withdrawal of fishing vessels from the Community fishing fleet with public aid to vessels which can be transferred to the countries affected by the tsunami for the benefit of the fishing communities concerned."
"This possibility is granted on an exceptional basis, under certain conditions and only during a limited period."
"While several countries in the Indian Ocean whose fishing sectors were affected by the tsunami disaster enquired about the possibility of a transfer of vessels, only Sri Lanka submitted a formal request for vessels."
"It concerned 120 vessels with an overall length of 9 to 12 metres. The Commission informed Member States of the request and reminded them on several occasions of the obligation to report on the transfer of vessels."
"Despite the unanimous adoption of the regulation by the Council, all 20 Member States which are engaged in maritime fisheries have now informed the Commission that they have not identified any possibility of transfers of vessels in response to the Sri Lankan request."
"As the regulation sets a deadline of 30 June 2006, there are at present no more prospects of transfers of vessels under the scheme."
". Mr President, I have, then, no option but to conclude that the regulation we approved was a meaningless exercise, which is in fact what we predicted."
"I think that the regulation as it was presented was nothing but an act of public relations and it is evident from the Commissioner’s response that this was a bad piece of legislation."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner an additional question: if this regulation does not help the countries affected by the tsunami rebuild their fishing fleet, can he say whether the Commission has taken other measures in order to really help those countries build their own boats and organise a more appropriate way of fishing in the regions that were hit by the tsunami last year?"
". Obviously, when this legislation was enacted, by way of exception to the rule that had been established, under which it was no longer possible to effect transfers of vessels to third countries, it was made subject to certain significant restrictions, one of which related, for example, to the length of the vessels."
"I remember the discussion here in Parliament that we should not allow a situation where vessels would be transferred to third countries stricken by the tsunami without imposing any conditions because that could, in actual fact, increase the fishing effort and therefore intensify the problems that existed in certain fisheries in those third-country waters, but that the vessels should be suitable and appropriate to the fisheries that were traditionally carried out in those countries."
"Therefore, we had restrictions with regard to the size of vessels, the age of vessels, the fact that vessels should not use towed gear and other conditions relating to ecological resource management and seaworthiness."
"Having said that, I must underline the fact that the responses we have received from the Member States on why it was not possible to identify vessels for transfer to Sri Lanka were either that there were no appropriate vessels available among those to be decommissioned in certain Member States, or that decommissioning was not foreseen in certain other Member States, or that the incentives provided for the transfer of vessels were not sufficiently attractive."
"I must also underline the fact that this was a Commission initiative aimed at trying to help the countries affected by the tsunami, with regard to the fisheries sector specifically, if there was scope to do so."
"There was an element of additionality which was therefore the main thrust of the assistance, albeit under the general umbrella of development cooperation rather than under the fisheries portfolio."
"It was an ‘optional extra’ that was not taken up."
"I must underline that the end result was that certain individual Member States gave assistance to the tsunami-affected countries by providing funds for the acquisition of vessels which have been purchased without any control measures."
"The end result today is that there is a significantly larger fleet in the tsunami-affected areas, which creates much more pressure on the fishing effort than before and creates further problems."
"Rather than moving in the direction of sustainable fisheries, according to the information we have, there are significantly more problems than there were before."
"– Mr President, is the very example the Commissioner has just given not a typical indication that the Union should endeavour to view disaster relief as a separate entity and provide funds promptly to this end – as, indeed, had already been done in the case of the floods – rather than attempting to push things forward by way of derogations within traditional policy areas: fisheries, transport or other policy?"
"After all, experience has shown that that takes far too long and does not work."
". Yes, obviously it is important to try to strike the right balance between the needs of the countries that would be affected by such disasters and long-term assistance, which should aim not to create further pressures or difficulties for those countries by trying to help rebuild the economy in a sustainable way."
"We are trying to do this specifically with regard to fisheries; however, unless there is closer coordination between Commission initiatives and the individual initiatives of Member States, the chances are that the possibility of success will be limited."
"The Commission has admitted that the ban on deep water gillnets approved by the Council in December 2005 is not backed up by scientific reports on the subject, nor have any studies been conducted on its socio-economic impact."
"At a meeting with the coordinator for interested parties on 25 January 2006, the Commission indicated that it planned to resolve the problem as quickly as possible by amending the TAC regulation, saying that the ban would be a temporary one until use of such fishing gear could be regulated."
"The launch of the schedule of measures was to depend on the decision taken by the Regional Advisory Committee for north-eastern waters on 31 January 2006."
"At that meeting, it was unanimously agreed to inform Commissioner Borg that there was disagreement with the process leading up to the ban and it was decided to set up a working party to regulate the use of fishing gear of this kind."
"Given that a rapid decision is needed, because of the adverse socio-economic effects of the ban, when will the Commission submit its legislative proposal?"
"Has it made plans for any transitional measures to attenuate the effects of the ban until the proposal is submitted?"
". Mrs Miguélez Ramos’ question concerning the ban on the use of deepwater fixed gillnets to the north and west of Britain and Ireland follows a number of written questions on the same subject from her and from Mrs Fraga Estévez and Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna."
"The ban, which took effect on 1 February 2006, was introduced in the TAC and Quota Regulation that was adopted at the Council in December 2005."
"It was proposed in response to the report of the DEEPNET investigation, which highlighted the potential damage that those fisheries may be causing to deepwater sharks and other species."
"The DEEPNET Report was carried out by reputable scientific organisations in Ireland, the United Kingdom and Norway, and so was taken seriously by the Commission."
"In parallel to the prohibition in Community waters, at its annual meeting in November 2005, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission adopted an identical prohibition of deep-sea gillnets in its regulatory area from 1 February 2006."
"First, I should like to reassure you that this ban is intended as a temporary measure in response to serious concerns about the practices of some of the participants in such fisheries and in particular about the impact of those practices on vulnerable species such as deep-sea sharks."
"Those species are in such a poor state and take so long to recover their numbers once depleted that the Commission has to react very quickly without waiting for definitive scientific advice from the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF)."
"The prohibition was originally envisaged as an emergency measure in September but deferred until the December Council to give time for consultations."
"Unfortunately, no concrete suggestions for alternative measures were presented in time for inclusion in the proposal discussed at the Council in December."
"I am aware that most of the fishermen using such gear behave responsibly and that it is a minority who are causing concern."
"For that reason, I would like to introduce measures to regulate the activity of deep-sea gillnets at the earliest opportunity."
"The Commission has already had some feedback on possible approaches, especially from the North-Western Waters Regional Advisory Council, which suggests an earlier reopening of the hake fishery and a limited number of vessels participating in the monkfish and deep-sea fisheries with observer coverage."
"The Commission services will meet with the North-Western Waters Regional Advisory Council and scientists on Friday, 7 April 2006, where we will discuss those possibilities."
"Depending on the outcome of that meeting, a proposal to allow a limited fishery under an observer programme could be made in May 2006."
"The data collected by such a programme could then be made available to the STECF, which will address the issue in late June or early July."
"The geographical limits of the prohibition were determined by the coverage of the DEEPNET study."
"I am aware that there may be similar problems in other areas, but we currently have no information that would justify enlarging the area of the prohibition."
"That is another reason for bringing in effective legislation applicable in all areas as soon as practicable."
"Unfortunately, the prohibition is bound to create economic difficulties for the fleets concerned."
"No transitional measures to mitigate the effects of the ban have been planned, but I would encourage Member States to make full use of the possibilities that are already available for the temporary cessation of activities under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance to help those most severely affected."
"I thought that you were going to tell me something rather newer. For example, that you would insist rather more on those dates that you have mentioned;"
"What I really wanted to ask was what possibility is there of amending this decision immediately, what possibility is there of amending the Regulation on TACs and quotas, so that the pelagic longlines at least – which fish hake with nets that do less harm, as you yourself acknowledge in letters that I have seen – can return to those waters; and what timescales the Commission has in mind for the definitive regulation of fixed gillnets, so that the sector does not have to remain in a situation of uncertainty."
"I ask this, Commissioner, because this decision had and has still having very negative effects, in particular socio-economic effects."
"."
"Yes, there are two aspects to it: one concerns the action that can be taken in the short term to try to soften the impact of the temporary imposition of the ban on deep sea gillnets."
"We are discussing this with the North-Western Waters RAC, and a meeting is scheduled for 7 April when, hopefully, we will be able to discuss this matter with the North-Western Waters RAC."
"Immediately afterwards, we will hopefully be able to take certain decisions on introducing the possibility of limited fisheries for hake and perhaps look at the possibility with regard to monkfish, establishing a system of supervision on board vessels."
"We are also looking into establishing permanent measures which would replace the driftnet ban to cover all Community waters."
"Later in the year, we could then come up with a proposal to withdraw the driftnet ban and replace it with permanent measures, satisfying ourselves that there is no longer any risk of irreparable damage to the stock of deepwater sharks as a result of fishermen leaving nets in the sea for extensive periods, fishing on their own account and causing significant damage to the habitat."
"The Commissioner probably finds himself between Scylla and Charybdis in this argument, but I am sure that he will bear in mind the great damage that drift nets and gill nets have done in the past to, for example, the wild salmon in the North Atlantic, and that he will be robust in protecting the fisheries from that method of fishing."
". Yes, one needs to draw a distinction, because we are speaking here of deep-sea gill nets, which are normally used very selectively, and therefore we do not want to discourage the use of this type of gear."
"However, if nothing is done, such fishing for an extensive period of time causes significant damage."
"Therefore, we want to curtail the abuse of the use of gill nets, not their proper use."
"So, on the one hand, given that the use of gill nets is quite selective as a gear, we would not want to discourage that; but on the other hand, we certainly want to discourage the abuse of gill nets, as that would create so-called ‘ghost nets’, which continue to be used for fishing for a period of a month or so, causing significant damage to the species concerned."
". I would like to remind the honourable Member that the negotiations on the new EC-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement are concluded and that the Commission and the Moroccan Government initialled the draft agreement in July 2005."
"With respect to its territorial application, the text of the new agreement is no different from the previous agreement, which ended in 2000."
"With regard to the honourable Member’s specific question, I would like to point out that the Polisario Front is not formally accredited with the European Community."
"There is no formal policy dialogue between the Commission and the Polisario Front."
"Concerning fisheries negotiations, the Commission has been authorised by the Council to negotiate with the Kingdom of Morocco."
"It has no mandate to extend the negotiations to third parties."
"In the framework of the preparations for the negotiation of the EC-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement, the Commission thoroughly evaluated the political, legal and economic implications of an eventual agreement."
"In this case, as in others, the Commission is taking care to avoid a situation where the conclusion of new agreements in the field of fisheries could become a factor in international disputes or conflicts."
"Regarding the issue of the EC-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the question of Western Sahara, the Commission took special care to fully respect the relevant principles of international law and support the efforts of the United Nations in finding an appropriate solution with regard to Western Sahara."
"The content of the initial text, as in the case of the previous fisheries agreement, does not in any way prejudice the issue related to the international status of Western Sahara."
"The Commission is convinced that the new EC-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement is in conformity with international law and with the opinion of the UN Legal Advisor of 29 January 2002."
"The Commission’s view with regard to the geographical scope of the agreement has been confirmed and endorsed by the opinion of the Council’s legal service and the European Parliament’s legal service."
". – Within the context of the EU’s development policy, the Union has earmarked funding for refugee camps for the Sahrawi people run by the Polisario Front in the Western Sahara region."
"I should therefore like to ask, once again, whether, as part of its approach to the problem of Western Sahara, the Commission intends to ask the Polisario Front what it thinks of this agreement, given that it will have far-reaching implications for Western Sahara."
". As I said in my previous response, the negotiations were conducted by the Commission with the representatives of the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco."
"The authorisation that we had from the Council was to negotiate with Morocco."
"The negotiations concluded with an agreement which entails that any fisheries carried out in waters within the jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Morocco should benefit the communities directly adjacent to where the fisheries are carried out."
"It is therefore the responsibility of the Kingdom of Morocco to see to it that any benefits deriving from fisheries carried out in waters adjacent to the Polisario Front area would go to the communities living there."
"Commissioner, this morning Parliament agreed to reject the Council’s request to apply the urgent procedure to the Agreement with Morocco."
"What will be the consequences of the European Parliament’s decision this morning in terms of the entry into force of that agreement?"
". Yesterday, I took part in a meeting of the Fisheries Committee of the European Parliament, and the understanding is that the rapporteur will present his report to the Fisheries Committee in early May, with the possibility of submitting amendments, which would then be put to the vote in the Fisheries Committee in mid-May, and then come to the plenary for a decision during the Strasbourg part-session in May."
"I will be discussing with the Austrian Presidency the possibility of having the Council decide on this agreement in the meeting of the Council of Ministers later on in May, so that if it works in that way, the agreement can come into effect from the beginning of June."
"That would mean only month’s delay as regards the terms agreed between the Commission and the Kingdom of Morocco."
"The European Council has reached an agreement on the financial perspective for the period 2007-2013. What impact will the latter have on development policies for the outermost regions?"
". On the basis of the European Council agreement dating from 16 and 17 December 2005, the situation of the outermost regions for the period 2007-2013 is as follows."
"For the parts of Europe concerned, there will be a higher co-financing rate under the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund."
"It will be 85%, both for regions under the convergence objective and for those outermost regions which are part of the regional competitiveness and employment objective."
"There will also be a specific additional financial allocation to help finance operating aid to offset the additional costs which are incurred in these regions due to their geographical location."
"The co-financing rate under this additional allocation will be at the level of 50%; this additional allocation amounts to EUR 35 per year per capita in each of the seven outermost regions."
"We then have specific situations as regards individual outermost regions."
"There is Madeira, which will be keeping the status of a phasing-in region, but at the same time will benefit from more generous financial transitional arrangements, similar to those of the statistical phasing-out regions."
"There are also the Canary Islands, which will benefit from an additional envelope of EUR 100 million over the period between 2007 and 2013."
"With regard to territorial cooperation – the objective set for the policy – all the outermost regions will be eligible for the transnational strand of the European territorial cooperation objective, and the French outermost regions, like the Canary Islands, will be eligible for the cross-border strand."
"In addition, Madeira, the Azores and the Canary Islands will benefit from special provisions applicable to Portugal and Spain."
"As you know in the case of Portugal, Madeira and the Azores will also be eligible for the Cohesion Fund, as also for the temporary application of the n+3 rule for the period 2007-2010."
"In the case of Spain and the Canary Islands, that means they will also be eligible for the Cohesion Fund and for an additional allocation that was awarded to Spain in the form of a technological fund."
"The participation of the Canary Islands would be by decision of the government."
"As you may know, the outermost regions can also benefit from specific measures, which aim at supporting traditional sectors of these regions."
"There will be specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union, as well as specific treatment under the rural development policy, in particular concerning the intervention rates of the new European agricultural fund for rural development."
"On top of that, of course, there are the ordinary instruments that exist under our policies, and all the regions will have access to all the Community programmes envisaged under all the titles of the European budget."
"Those in brief are the specific measures available under the new financial perspective for the outermost regions."
". Commissioner, so far the Commission has done great work helping the outermost regions, but it is clear that in the new financial perspective there is a reduction in the European Union's overall effort."
"I would like simply to ask you a very specific question: whether, within the new context of the crisis taking place in regions close to the European Union, North Africa in particular, it is possible for the European Union, through the outermost regions and the new fund allocated to the neighbourhood policies, to help to resolve the problem, which affects the whole of the Union, of mass access to the European Union for immigration."
"In other words, what cooperation instruments could we have in order to prevent the immense crisis taking place in the regions close to these outermost regions of the European Union?"
". As you know the regions in Europe can also use part of the funds allocated to them to invest in those regions that are not in EU Member States, but which are part of neighbouring countries, so this possibility of using part of the allocation on neighbouring territory is open to the outermost regions."
"Additionally, within the European neighbourhood and partnership instrument, which is still currently under preparation with regard to its legal form by the Commission, there will be the possibility of working together with neighbouring countries and regions on issues related to those that you are addressing to create jobs and employment opportunities on the other side of the border."
"In the Canaries, in particular, they will be able to allocate part of the money in the new neighbourhood and partnership instrument and thus will be able to have external cooperation, for example, with the border areas of Morocco."
"So that is what this policy, through the financial instruments, can do."
"But on top of that comes a political concern."
"Within the Commission we had a discussion a week or so ago on the situation in some of the outermost regions in the context of migration and the difficult situations experienced."
"So, within other instruments and politically, the Commission will be involved in the very near future to help address this issue."
"We have some financial instruments, which are restricted."
"As you have said yourselves, the budget is not what we expected when the Commission put the proposal on the table, nevertheless, in addition to those restricted financial means, there are also efforts to work with neighbouring countries, or regions next to our outermost regions, to find political solutions to some of the problems."
"The challenges faced by the outermost regions of the Union are very similar to those challenges which are facing the northernmost regions of the EU."
"Would you say that the balance between EU support to the outermost regions and EU support to the northernmost regions is now met in the proposals for cohesion?"
"In addition, could you briefly outline what the cofinancing rates and special targeted measures are for the northernmost regions of the European Union, especially the northern parts of Finland and Sweden?"
". It is a very difficult question."
"It is very difficult to see what balance is in this case, because the issues and problems faced by those regions are very different."
"Some of our regions suffer because they are very sparsely populated and that means that infrastructure costs are very high."
"This is a challenge not only for us at European level but also for the governments involved."
"Other regions suffer from overpopulation and from problems of migration."
"Therefore, it is very difficult to measure what is balanced and what is not."
"As you know, within this very restrictive budget during the Council – which is also part of the European tradition – there were also additional requests put on the table."
"What I presented – all those additional measures which were offered to the regions – is something that came during the Council and was not part of a global balanced proposal of the Commission."
"We have to look at the current situation and try to make those resources work as well as possible and try to use the resources that were allocated to the sparsely populated regions of Sweden and Finland in the most efficient way and do the best we can."
"However, I do not see a need to compare the EUR 540 million that Finland and Sweden received for those regions to the money allocated to the outermost regions."
"The situations are very different: the money has a different value."
"The Commission will certainly work with both types of problems – in the outermost regions and the sparsely populated regions – to get the best we can from the funds which will be available."
"– Commissioner, the Commission indeed presented a very ambitious financial framework."
"The Council cut it drastically at its December meeting."
"Negotiations are currently being held in the trialogue."
"What I find a little lacking here is the role of the Commission."
"If the Commission presents such an ambitious proposal, why is there nothing more to be heard from it, and why is Parliament no longer willing to fight to receive the budgetary resources we need for the implementation of these programmes?"
"This particularly concerns rural development – not only in the outermost regions, but in rural areas in general, where a massive transfer of funds is required to reach necessary levels."
". I do not have the feeling that the Commission is not strong in the negotiations."
"My understanding is that we are trying to help reach a compromise at a level that would be satisfactory for all three institutions."
"It so happens that the two institutions – the Council and Parliament – have gone quite far in financial terms; in terms of the level of the budget that is on the table."
"The Commission’s efforts should go, in my view, towards helping them to find a compromise."
"The level of budget is extremely important."
"We hope that we will have the funds also for those areas that were cut so seriously in December."
"But it is also important to reach agreement."
"I do not know what the trialogue looks like as I do not participate in it, but I can imagine that there are moments when the Commission’s role is to be the one who helps to find a compromise."
"That might give you the impression that we do not care about money, but that is not the case."
"We do care."
"We know that if we had more money we could do more for Europe, with Europe and in Europe for all citizens."
"However, sometimes realism and the challenge of timing are also important."
"That is my understanding."
"Under the n+2 rule, one of the CSF criteria, funds earmarked for a particular programme must have been disbursed within two years."
"Can the Commission indicate the amounts and programmes in respect of which the Greek Government has requested an exemption from the n+2 rule?"
"What stage has been reached by the Commission in considering these requests?"
"Is it possible, under the third CSF, to extend beyond 2006 the deadline for the signing of contracts?"
"If so, under what conditions?"
"Is it possible for Community funding under the third CSF to be used after the end of 2008?"
"If so, under what conditions?"
". You may be aware that the before the end of last year the Greek authorities submitted to the Commission a list of requests for exemptions from the n+2 rule."
"The total amount was more than EUR 655 million."
"The intention was to cover an amount of EUR 342 million, potentially subject to the n+2 rule."
"The request submitted relates to 12 operational programmes in Greece and also implies the intervention of three funds: the ERDF, the ESF and the agricultural fund."
"The Commission has completed the processing of the Greek request concerning the application of the n+2 rule and reached the conclusion that what is left as the potential cut due to the n+2 rule is EUR 8 638 000, which is less than what was initially on the table. We are still waiting for confirmation by the Greeks and, if they confirm this, this will be the amount the Commission effectively expects as the commitment."
"The second part of your question concerns the eligibility period for the commitments and payments."
"As you know, for the 2000-2006 programming period, the eligibility period ends on 31 December 2008."
"Commitments are, theoretically – and I would like to stress that – possible during the entire eligibility period, which means 2008."
"However, commitments should be made early enough to allow the final recipients to implement the operations and projects and to carry out the payments before the final eligibility date for the expenditure, which is the end of 2008."
"We will close the expenditure for all the Member States under the current financial perspective on 31 December 2008, with the exception of programmes and measures which are covered by state aid."
"According to the rules, this eligibility date is 30 April 2009."
"I also want to inform you that, according to all our legal analyses and the information we have in the Commission, there could be no exceptions to these conditions – I mean the end of 2008 or April 2009 – as regards the final possible date of eligibility."
"So the final date is the end of 2008 or April 2009, and that is the situation."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to ask you something else."
"Given that acceptance of the exemption requests shifts the pressure to forthcoming years, I should like the Commission to tell me how Greece's obligations for the years 2006 and 2007 are being formulated and what is the Commission's prediction, if there is one, for the application of the n+2 rule for these two years?"
". With this kind of question it is too risky to embark on an effort to respond without good checking and preparation, so I can make a commitment that we will try as early as possible in the next few days to respond and come back to you with an assessment of the current situation as regards the payments and commitments for Greece."
"Questions 48 to 59 will be answered in writing."
"As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:"
"What is the Commissioner's view of the current state of preparations and the schedule for the introduction of the euro in the ten EU Member States which acceded to the EU on 1 May 2004?"
"According to opinions expressed in the press and in official statements, assessment of new EU Member States’ readiness to join the euro zone will take account not only of the Maastricht criteria but also of each country’s general economic level of development."
"Specifically, it has been declared that Slovenia, on account of its higher level of GDP per head than that of Lithuania and Estonia, can be invited to join the euro zone, whereas the latter two countries will not be invited to do so even if they fulfil the Maastricht criteria, including the level of inflation."
"Are these statements accurate?"
"Can the Commission give a clear assurance that any decision on the accession of new Member States to the euro zone will be made on the basis of the Maastricht criteria alone and not of any other criteria?"
". I shall respond to Mr Posselt’s first question by saying that Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia have set 1 January 2007 as their target date for adopting the euro;"
"Cyprus, Latvia and Malta propose adopting the euro on 1 January 2008;"
"Slovakia intends to do so on 1 January 2009; the Czech Republic and Hungary hope to enter the eurozone in 2010 and Poland has not set a target date."
"At least every two years, or at the request of a Member State, the Commission and the European Central Bank must report to the Council on the progress made by the Member States in terms of compliance with their obligation to become full members of the Economic and Monetary Union."
"In February 2006, the Commission, in agreement with the European Central Bank, announced that the next convergence report, on all of the States that are not members of the eurozone, except the two with an opt-out clause, the United Kingdom and Denmark, will be published in October 2006, that is, two years after the last assessment."
"Nevertheless, in accordance with Article 122 of the Treaty, two Member States, Slovenia and Lithuania, have asked the Commission and the European Central Bank for an individual report on the progress they have made in terms of convergence; the Commission and also the European Central Bank intend to adopt this report on these two Member States on 16 May 2006."
"In the event that the assessment of compliance with the economic and legal convergence criteria is positive, the Commission would present the corresponding proposal and, following consultation of this Parliament, in the middle of June the European Council could analyse and, if appropriate, adopt, a decision, and definitive proposed derogation could therefore be discussed by the Ecofin Council on 11 July."
"Independently of this process, we in the Commission of course maintain regular contacts with all of the States intending to enter the eurozone, we monitor them very closely and we cooperate with them in relation to the practical preparations for this important decision."
"In response to Mr Paleckis’s question, I must say to him that of course the Commission will apply the principle of equal treatment when assessing the progress of the ten new Member States in terms of economic and legal convergence."
"As I have just said, the countries will be assessed according to the procedure and the criteria laid down in the Treaty, in particular Article 122, and the Commission obviously has no intention of changing this procedure or introducing additional criteria."
"With regard to the inflation criterion, as you are aware, the Treaty states that the Member State in question is obliged to maintain sustainable price trends and an average inflation rate which does not exceed that of the three Member States with the best price stability results by any more than 1.5%."
"The Commission proposes applying this criterion rigorously in the future, just as it has done in the past."
". – Mr President, I am much obliged to the Commissioner for his precise answer."
"However, if I may say so, he spoke so fast at the beginning that the German interpretation was practically incomprehensible."
"I should like to query whether I have understood correctly, therefore, that the last two of these ten Member States, namely the Czech Republic and Hungary, are due to join in 2010?"
"I should like to ask the Commissioner whether developments have really been finalised, or whether there are some of the ten Member States who have requested postponement beyond 2010."
". Thank you for your response to my question."
"The Maastricht criteria are being strictly applied to those countries which are applying for entry into the eurozone."
"Lithuania cannot be accepted into the eurozone, even though it currently exceeds the inflation criteria by a mere 0.1%."
"Lithuania complied with this condition over the past six years, as did others."
"In the current eurozone, many members are infringing one or other of the Maastricht criteria."
"For instance, some large countries for many years breached the conditions on budgetary deficit without receiving a red card, the same with inflation and other criteria."
"Are the new Member States not being discriminated against here with these double standards?"
". I shall begin by responding to Mr Posselt and I shall not speak too quickly."
"The objectives I have mentioned in relation to when Members States wish to enter the eurozone, are dates defined by those States themselves."
"The first three countries, Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia, originally stated that they wished to enter the eurozone in 2007."
"For its part, Hungary has set a target date of 2010, as you have mentioned."
"As I said before, the only one not to have set a target date is Poland."
"That is a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient condition."
"The sufficient condition is that the assessments of both the Commission and the European Central Bank, of compliance with the criteria laid down in the Treaty, indicate that the Member States that wish to enter the eurozone have indeed complied with those criteria."
"Both sides must demonstrate will: the Member States and ultimately the Council, on the proposal of the Commission, once the Commission and the European Central Bank have judged that the criteria have been complied with."
"That is the situation."
"In the case of Poland, which is the only one of the Member States that has not yet set a target date for entering the eurozone — Sweden is also in this position following the ‘no’ vote in the 2003 referendum — the Commission would point out that it is the obligation of the Member States themselves — except in the case of those with an exception clause, which are just the United Kingdom and Denmark — to propose their entry into the eurozone and it is our obligation and responsibility to assess whether or not they conform to the requirements."
"I cannot tell Mr Paleckis in advance what the content of the report that the Commission will adopt on 16 May will be and it would be even more difficult for me to anticipate the content of the European Central Bank’s report, for obvious reasons."
"What I can say once again to the honourable Member — and I have said this on many occasions — is that the Commission is going to assess whether or not the criteria have been met as defined in the Treaty."
"The Commission does not set these criteria on a whim."
"It is a requirement of the Treaty and our obligation is to comply with the Treaty, and I would repeat that in making that assessment, we shall be treating everybody equally, and we shall not be applying certain yardsticks to some countries and other yardsticks to others."
"In short, therefore, compliance with the Treaty, a clear and rigorous assessment of whether or not the criteria are met and equal treatment for everybody."
"I will be able to inform you and all of the honourable Members of the conclusions of this analysis on 16 May."
"New Member States must comply with the convergence criteria in order to introduce the euro."
"In order to ensure compliance with the convergence criteria, the Commission and Council are formulating various proposals for these Member States."
"My question is this: may a Member State follow an economic policy that ignores the proposals of the Council and Commission, and if it does, what does it risk by doing so?"
". Mr President, in general, for all of the Member States with derogations, which are not members of the eurozone, but with an obligation to join in the future, we carried out that assessment in October 2004 and we will repeat it in October 2006."
"In the case of the two Member States that have made individual requests for that assessment — to which they have the right, according to the Treaty — that is, for Slovenia and Lithuania, we shall present our individual assessment for each of them on 16 May."
"I cannot tell you the result of a report that will be adopted by the College of Commissioners on 16 May in advance."
"If you wish, I shall come to Parliament on the afternoon of 16 May to explain the content of the report to you, but I cannot say anything before then."
"– Mr President, the Commissioner has already mentioned one of the problems."
"We are discussing how seriously new Member States are taking their commitments, but what we are not really discussing is how, specifically, a Member State that has been meeting the criteria for some time but obviously does not wish to join the eurozone, namely Sweden, sees its future."
"The question is whether the case of Sweden could potentially set a bad example to others, who are now new Member States."
"The Commissioner named a new Member State that has not yet announced a date."
"If sanctions are not imposed, will this not set a negative precedent?"
". I agree with Mr Rack that we are facing a problem, because there is one Member State that called a referendum, the result was negative and, on the basis of that negative result, it cannot, it does not wish to, or it does not intend to, comply with an obligation that falls to it as a Member State."
"We must deal with the issue of how to resolve this question."
"The Commission felt it prudent not to do so immediately after a referendum."
"The Commission must fulfil its obligation to comply with the Treaty while at the same time taking account of the opinion expressed by the citizens of that Member State, but I have not forgotten that the Commission must hold talks with Sweden to consider how that country can fulfil its obligations as a member of the European Union in the future."
"The same thing is happening in relation to Poland, which had originally proposed a particular year as an objective for its entry into the euro."
"The new Polish authorities say that they do not accept the objective of their predecessors and that they are not setting a future objective at the present time."
"And I have had the opportunity to remind the new Polish Government that it will have to do so."
"We do not want to apply pressure, but we cannot forget that this is an obligation for the Member States."
"As I said before, we must combine fulfilling our responsibilities with political prudence, but what I will say — and I have said this publicly on other occasions — is that compliance with an obligation which falls to the 25 countries of the European Union as Member States cannot not be put to a referendum."
"In this case there is an exception in place for two countries, the United Kingdom and Denmark, but, the State’s obligations should not be put to a referendum generally, and neither should the 23 States without an opt-out clause do so, because the question of whether or not a Treaty is complied with cannot be put to a vote."
"Commissioner, I wanted to ask about inflation."
"As we are aware, inflation in the eleven countries, which were first to join the economic and monetary union and were ready to introduce the Euro, has surpassed the index for a significant period."
"Only two countries did not exceed the index."
"The others exceeded it for between 10 months and almost six years from the end of 1998 to the end of 2005."
"My question: are we applying double standards to the new states and is the economic and monetary union a technical union or is it simply a political union."
". Mr President, the Commission’s obligation is to ensure compliance with the Treaties and it goes without saying that on previous occasions, when the eurozone was created, or when the twelfth member of the eurozone joined, the Commission and the Council of the time, with the opinion of the European Parliament, took account of the obligation to ensure compliance with the Treaties."
"Myself as Commissioner, and the Commission, headed by Mr Barroso, are naturally not going to fail in our obligation to apply the Treaties and ensure compliance with them."
"The economic criteria, including that of inflation, are stipulated in a protocol annexed to the Treaty and of a legal value identical to that of the provisions and articles of the Treaty."
"We cannot therefore ignore them or amend them."
"It is true that an academic discussion is under way on a correct definition of the criteria, but the procedure for changing the Treaties will consist of an Intergovernmental Conference and a process of ratification when the time seems right and when there is a sufficient majority to do so."
"It is not for the Commission to change the Treaties and it has the obligation to apply them."
"It is true that there is asymmetry, because compliance with the criteria is required in order to enter the eurozone, but then, once a country is a member, it can fail to comply with the criteria; once a country is a member of the eurozone, it can have more inflation, more debt or more deficit."
"In the case of deficit and debt, there are rules relating to budgetary discipline – Article 104 of the Treaty – and the Stability and Growth Pact but, in the case of inflation, those rules do not exist, but there are some rules that are probably tougher than legal rules in application of the Treaty: the rules of the market."
"There are currently countries in the eurozone that are suffering considerably because they are not able to moderate the evolution of their inflation or their unit labour costs."
"I believe that we must also take account of the harsh reality of how the markets judge those who do not comply with certain rules, quite apart from the Commission’s obligation to ensure compliance with the rules of the Treaty."
"Is the European Commission satisfied with the practical operation of the Stability and Growth Pact or does it envisage changes to the rules governing the operation of this Pact into the future?"
". Mr Crowley, the revised Stability and Growth Pact was agreed by the Ecofin Council almost a year ago, in June 2005, following a political agreement within the European Council in March last year."
"Our initial experience of the revised Pact has been positive, encouraging, and the indications are that the Member States have a renewed commitment to that framework."
"In all recent cases that have been dealt with, when the Commission and the Council have applied the rules of the excessive deficit procedure, in accordance with the letter and the sprit of the revised Pact, there has been full consensus and there have not been the political discrepancies and difficulties that arose last time."
"With regard to the preventive aspect of the Pact, the assessment of the 2005 stability and convergence programmes, which have been carried out during the first months of 2006, have shown that the Member States have set their medium-term budgetary objectives in accordance with the agreed principles."
"Some countries have even decided to set more ambitious objectives, which reflect a national strategy aimed at guaranteeing greater sustainability of public finances."
"With regard to adjustment to the mid-term objective, the Member States that are not yet in a situation of medium-term balance are generally fulfilling the requirement to make a budgetary effort at least equivalent to 0.5% of their GDP, in structural terms."
"To name certain cases, I would remind you that, since the new Pact was approved last year, the excessive deficit procedure has been applied to Italy, Portugal, Hungary, the United Kingdom and Germany, with unanimity in the Council and without the problems of political acceptance which arose during the previous stage."
"In response to your question, therefore, the Commission is pleased with the way the new Pact is operating."
". Thank you, Commissioner, for your response."
"On the last point that you made with regard to the rules concerning excessive public deficits and the fact that proposals have been made to Italy, Portugal, Hungary and the United Kingdom, what about France and Germany?"
"Both of them have public deficits that are well beyond the limits agreed under the criteria."
"In particular, what about the undermining of confidence in the Stability Pact which that creates on the wider market?"
"That is particularly apparent when we look at the current difficulties concerning the recognition of the euro and the eurozone economy within the United States and in the Far East, and at the constant questioning concerning the enforcement of the rules concerning the Stability and Growth Pact in those areas."
". Mr Crowley, Mr President, the excessive deficit procedure is being applied to France and it is subject to the procedure laid down in Article 104(7) of the Treaty."
"In accordance with its obligations to apply the Council’s recommendations within the framework of the excessive deficit procedure, the French authorities were obliged to bring their public deficit to below 3% in 2005. Last week, the French authorities notified the Commission that the public deficit at the end of 2005 was below 3%."
"Over the next three weeks, by 24 April, Eurostat must analyse the figure notified by the French authorities, and will explain whether or not those figures, a deficit of 2.87%, are correct."
"In the event that they are – I hope that they are, although I cannot anticipate Eurostat's decision – France would have complied with the recommendations in 2005."
"The French Government also intends to bring its deficit to below 3% during 2006; the European Commission takes note of this and is pleased with the French Government's intentions, but we are going to publish our spring economic forecasts on 8 May."
"Until then I will not be able to predict what our economic forecast will be for this year, but, without anticipating the final assessments, I believe that the budgetary situation in France is improving with regard to our forecasts a year ago, amongst other things because the French Government, and in particular the Finance Minister, Thierry Breton – whom I thank, as I did publicly the other day in Brussels – are politically committed to complying with the Stability and Growth Pact."
"This is a sign of the way the renewed consensus in relation to the new Stability and Growth Pact is working."
"A year ago, before the revision of the Pact, we would have been unlikely to hear the French, the German, or the Italian Minister repeatedly expressing their political commitment to bring their public accounts into line with the recommendations to them from the Commission and the Council for the application of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Two years ago it would have been impossible; a year ago it was difficult."
"Today it is a reality, a genuine political commitment."
"But we still have difficult times ahead of us, because we must not be content with deficits of 2.8%."
"Europe, the European Union and the largest economies of the eurozone must pursue fiscal consolidation until public accounts, in the medium term, are in a situation of balance in structural terms so that we can deal with the significant challenges facing us for the future, the first of which is the consequences of the ageing of the population."
"With regard to the euro, confidence in the eurozone’s economy is growing day by day, and certain indicators of confidence, such as the German IFO index, are showing fifteen-year highs."
"Figures on the indicators produced by the Commission services for which I am responsible were published yesterday, and they show that levels of confidence are at their highest for five years."
"We had not achieved such levels of confidence since the previous expansionary phase."
"Our currency is remaining perfectly stable in the currency markets, in fact it is over-valued according to certain economic sectors."
"The euro is used in the financial markets, in the debt markets and in the capital and money markets at world level to a degree that is disproportionate to the relative weight of the eurozone’s economy within the world economy."
"I therefore believe that we must be vigilant, but we must also be pleased with our achievements during the first seven years of economic and monetary union."
"Has the introduction of the longer-term presidency for the eurozone had any practical implications for your work as guardian of the Treaties and guardian of the Stability and Growth Pact?"
"What are the practical effects of the longer-term presidency of the eurozone?"
". When the Member States of the eurozone decided to appoint a stable President of the Eurogroup, I expressed my great satisfaction."
"I was convinced that regular, continuous and permanent dialogue with the President of that body, which is not a Council body, but which in practice holds very important debates and responsibilities, was going to be an effective decision."
"When I found out that the President was going to be Jean-Claude Juncker, my confidence was confirmed."
"I can now say that relations with the President of the Eurogroup are excellent, our contacts have been continuous and the preparation of meetings has improved considerably."
"I believe that the role it plays towards the outside, expressing the views and the criteria of the eurozone countries, is greatly appreciated."
"I take an extremely positive view of the institution, of its institutionalisation, of its President and of the work of that institution and its President."
"I believe that the eurozone’s needs in terms of the coordination of economic policy are obvious."
"Earlier I mentioned the problems faced by certain eurozone economies, in dealing with losses of competitiveness resulting from an evolution above their average unit labour costs for example."
"Certain economies of the eurozone are facing problems with inflation of assets, there is a clear need to improve the dialogue between the Eurogroup and the President of the European Central Bank."
"All of these functions are being carried out by the Eurogroup, and this is largely due to President Juncker’s effective and intelligent direction of the Eurogroup’s work."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner what level of discussions he has had with Member States of the eurozone in relation to their performance and their potential performance."
"In the case of Ireland, for example, asset inflation, the price index for houses, went up 1.5% in February."
"We have had double-digit inflation in housing for some time and it looks like we will continue to have that."
"If there is a hard landing in the construction industry; it has implications for revenue; it has implications for unemployment payments and therefore revenue; it has implications for consumer confidence."
"Have you had discussions with the Irish Government on this issue, and to what extent has the Commission considered the implications for a eurozone member of the possibility of a hard landing?"
". Of course I discuss the evolution of the eurozone economy, and not just the eurozone, but the whole of the European Union."
"In particular, however, since you have asked about the eurozone, I discuss the economy of the eurozone bilaterally with the various Ministers of the zone and with the President of the European Central Bank, and collectively once a month in the meetings of the Eurogroup."
"In the majority of meetings of the Eurogroup, an item is dedicated to analysing the economic situation."
"Sometimes the economic situation is analysed in a general sense, and sometimes a specific aspect of that economic evolution is looked at."
"With regard to inflation, the body responsible for maintaining inflation, in accordance with the objectives set by the European Central Bank, is the European Central Bank itself. It is an independent institution, which, pursuant to the Treaty, has a mandate from the other European institutions to preserve price stability, and which makes its decisions entirely independently, but also holds a dialogue with the other institutions."
"The President of the European Central Bank participates in the meetings of the Eurogroup each month."
"Furthermore, the President of the Eurogroup and the Commissioner responsible for Economic and Monetary Affairs are invited to take part, with the right to speak but not to vote, in the meetings of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, and we accept those invitations."
"On the issue of housing, in particular, in one of the items at the last meeting of the Eurogroup in Brussels in March, we discussed the situation of the housing markets, which is not the same in all of the countries of the eurozone."
"Certain countries in the eurozone have the problem of property inflation, while other countries have the opposite situation, in some cases with total stability and, in others, a decrease over several years in the price of houses and other real estate property."
"This internal divergence within the eurozone with regard to real estate prices creates problems, because, by definition, there can only be one monetary policy in the eurozone, while its impact varies from country to country."
"We have discussed this issue."
"The European Commission has undertaken to present new analyses and new considerations to the Eurogroup over the coming months."
"If you are particularly interested in knowing our analysis of property prices in certain countries of the eurozone, I will send you the latest three monthly report on the economy of the eurozone which was published a few days ago by the Commission services under my responsibility."
"The questions that have not been taken due to lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex)."
"That concludes questions to the Commission."
"The next item is the report (A6-0076/2006) by Mr Takkula on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 2007–2013 the programme ‘Citizens for Europe’ to promote active European citizenship (COM(2005)0116 – C6-0101/2005 – 2005/0041(COD))."
". Mr President, I wish to start this presentation of my report by expressing my thanks to all those who have participated in this work."
"This came before our Committee a year ago, the proposal was put to Parliament on 6 April 2005, and from the start of May our Committee began to deliberate on it."
"Since then statements have been given by the Committee on Budgets, on which Neena Gill has done such good work, and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on which Giusto Catania has also done good work."
"There has also been a statement on this issue from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, drafted by Maria da Assunção Esteves."
"I would like to thank them all for their excellent, well-informed statements."
"I might say that this year we have been very busy, and I also want to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee’s determined female – and male – members, who have assisted me in this, and all the others who have been involved."
"We are now at a point, then, where this is to be voted on tomorrow, and I was thinking of saying a few more words about this report."
"It contains four Actions."
"The first is ‘Active citizens for Europe’, which includes town-twinning and which has now received a lot of positive publicity and feedback through the existing programme."
"Citizens’ projects also come under Action 1."
"Action 2 is ‘Active civil society for Europe’."
"This is a means of acquiring structural support for EU think tanks and civil society organisations as well as support for civil society projects."
"This is also a very important Action."
"Action 3 is ‘Together for Europe’: high-visibility events, studies, dissemination and information."
"Action 4 is ‘Active European remembrance throughout Europe’."
"The purpose of this programme was specifically to reach those Europeans who, for one reason or another, have not yet managed to take part in the European agenda."
"As we know, currently there are people who have for some reason felt the issue of Europe to be alien to them, and Europe has even seen growing exclusion."
"Through this programme we have tried to find those people and create a programme suited to them so that they too might experience what it is to act together, what European identity is, and how we can strengthen the common European identity."
"Both the recent events in connection with the European Parliament elections and the results of referendums show that far too few people are interested in matters that affect all of us."
"As we know, it is important to strengthen European identity and it is important to increase activity in which all nations of Europe are involved, thereby creating opportunities for everyone to participate."
"In a word, this programme has worked on the assumption that what we needed was not an elitist programme, but a programme that would be appropriate for all Europeans."
"Some might say that it is a bit of a patchwork quilt or that many issues of greatly varying importance have been put in the same programme, but it is tailor-made precisely in order to overlap successfully with some existing programmes and really give all Europeans the opportunity to get involved in Europe."
"Now it appears that, although the Committee was almost unanimous (just two abstained and the rest voted for the programme), a few amendments are going to be tabled at tomorrow’s part-session."
"They mainly relate to Action 4, active remembrance."
"They also concern organisations which are already mentioned in this programme."
"Regarding these organisations, I would like to say the following: I hope that this part of the programme that deals with active remembrance will help us adhere to its original purpose of supporting memorial sites to the victims of Nazism and Stalinism, because the impact of these totalitarian regimes was a European-wide one and was not limited to a single country."
"Regarding this, I want to thank Marianne Mikko in particular, as it was she who made a strong case for the Stalinist component and wanted it to be included."
"In this connection I must say that I hope that we will keep to our views on this."
"I also hope that the additional remarks which have been made by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance with regard to these new organisations, , the Berlin-based and the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, can be adopted as part of this programme."
"Unfortunately, time is so short and I have gone over mine, so I cannot speak here any longer, but I will say thank you for all the support."
"I hope that the vote will go as we on the Committee would like it to."
". Mr President, it is one year since we proposed this important programme to promote European citizenship."
"Tomorrow you will vote on the report, which reflects a lot of work since that time, and it is an important step towards the adoption of the new generation of programmes."
"I should like to thank all the listed committees, in particular the Committee on Culture and Education and its rapporteur Mr Takkula for his efforts, combining determination and modernisation."
"The report reflects this balance and shows that the committee shares the concerns of the Commission about the necessity to promote the active participation of citizens in the construction of a common Europe."
"The proposal is based on the conviction that the strengthening of active citizenship at European level is closely linked to the development of a sense of belonging to the European Union and of a European identity, which is complementary to other identities: national, regional and local."
"Common values, history, and culture with all its diversity will therefore be the building blocks of the programme."
"The parliamentary committee adopted several amendments that enrich our proposal with references to European values."
"I note with pleasure that the report followed the Commission's proposal on the various actions of this programme, ensuring continuity of activities that proved to be successful and the introduction of innovative projects and methods for citizens' participation."
"I appreciate that the report proposes the integration of a new, fourth action providing support for memorials to victims of Nazi and Stalinist regimes, as agreed by the European Parliament, Council and Commission in November."
"I should like to come now to the question of designated beneficiaries."
"The Commission has proposed a limited list of six designated bodies because of their uniqueness in the European arena."
"Three of them celebrate the memory or continue the work of the founding fathers, while the other three are pan-European umbrella organisations."
"All of them have been supported for many years by the European institutions."
"All of them contribute to the objectives of this programme."
"I appreciate the fact that the committee shared our philosophy and confirmed the choices."
"It proposed adding one more organisation: the Maison de l'Europe."
"All the previously mentioned characteristics apply to this organisation."
"This pan-European network of local organisations is aimed at engaging citizens in the construction of Europe."
"I am therefore pleased to say that the Commission could support this amendment, provided that it does not mean other organisations will be eligible for this designation."
"Finally, I should like to give my thoughts on the issue of volunteering."
"This was mentioned in the proposal as an example of the field of interest of this programme."
"An amendment by the committee proposed deleting this reference."
"We believe, however, that volunteering is a powerful tool for developing social cohesion and commitment towards society and that it therefore deserves special attention within the programme."
"Those were, in brief, the main points to which I wanted to draw your attention."
"You will have noticed that our views converge on many points."
"Let me emphasise the importance of continuing our constructive cooperation, despite the current uncertainties about the financial questions connected to this programme."
"In the interest of citizens, we should make every possible effort to reach an agreement as soon as possible in order to prepare for the implementation of this programme by January 2007."
"Your vote will send an important signal to the European citizens, as another important step is taken towards a Europe for citizens."
". Mr President, first let me thank the rapporteur for his report."
"This is a key programme, be it citizens for Europe, or Europe of citizens."
"The last time we asked this question in 1992, half the EU citizens surveyed said that they never felt European."
"I think that figure has probably decreased over time, but not as dramatically as we would like."
"But whether we feel it or not, we are European citizens and we share the rights and privileges citizenship brings."
"This programme should make people aware and proud of their EU citizenship."
"However, it is important to remember that we already have invested in similar programmes aimed at engaging with citizens."
"The problem has been that the Commission's strategy in this area has been piecemeal and confused."
"Therefore, what I would like to ask the Commission is: can it guarantee that this is not going to be just one more programme?"
"Will it really make a difference?"
"Will it be linking with other actions in a coherent, overarching strategy?"
"I really hope so, but I would like the Commission to explain how."
"Speaking, as I am, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, I am concerned that the ambitions are not backed by resources."
"Therefore, once again we are raising expectations only to dash them."
"I can understand all the Members wanting to address their preferred issues within the scope of this programme, but the funding for it, I believe, is far from adequate and we need to look very closely at some of the amendments that have been put forward."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for paying special attention to organised civil society at local level, including the disabled."
"However, I regret that we have not pushed enough for the Commission to do more to reach the most disadvantaged communities."
"Finally, I wish this programme every success and hope that the monitoring and evaluation issues that the Committee on Budgets has put forward are taken up."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of citizenship is central to the revival of the European Union’s political project."
"There are no shortcuts to revitalising Europe’s role on a global scale."
"What it needs is for a real constituent process to be created, avoiding attempts to revive a constitutional treaty that has been killed off and erased by the will of the people."
"We need to build an intercultural society emphasising Europe’s mixed-blood identity and, above all, we must encourage the integration of immigrants and the extension of citizenship rights."
"That is why we also think that the European citizenship concept must be tied closely to residence, with the explicit aim of encouraging inclusion."
"In that respect, we believe that the ‘Citizens for Europe’ programme can be a useful and valid means of promoting European citizenship rights, which should be increasingly dissociated from national criteria."
"The programme’s actions are worthy of support, and I refer in particular to town twinning projects and active European remembrance."
"I believe we need to be clear on the latter point, however."
"The 20th century was one of wars and authoritarian regimes, and there were countless victims of the deportations and mass killings carried out by the Nazi and Stalinist regimes."
"Twentieth-century European history cannot be commemorated, however, without remembering the victims of its Fascist regimes: in Italy, Fascists deprived men and women of their freedom for two decades, and there are many connections between the Italian regime and the Nazis."
"Spain, Portugal and Greece only recently won back democracy and freedom."
"Antifascism is a European value and cannot be reduced to a national event, and we therefore believe that it is now worth remembering the victims of Fascism to prevent similar events from happening again."
"There are still neo-fascist groups in Europe today, who feed on xenophobia, homophobia, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism."
"Excluding the victims of such authoritarian regimes from the programme would be both tragic and a threat to the promotion of citizenship and a common European identity."
"We therefore hope that Amendments 62 and 63 will be adopted."
". – European identity is defined as the point where universal values of human dignity meet with a series of separate traditions."
"This identity, which after all is simply one more way of life, is boosted by the Citizens for Europe programme under discussion today."
"The programme promotes an ethical awareness of the world, which is the deepest expression of European citizenship."
"The programme paves the way for a political model for cooperation between the general public and the EU institutions."
"This will help turn the citizens into participants in the European political process."
"This is why the programme is of key importance."
"Europe now has the task of becoming political and of moving from being a market to being a public area of debate."
"This drive towards European citizenship, however, poses a major challenge for the institutions."
"The citizenship policy means that the EU institutions must also become more political."
"The issue of European citizenship very much revolves around the way in which the institutions promote people’s interest in European policy."
"There is an obvious need for institutional reform in Europe and for new rules that can attract and empower the European public."
"There is also a clear need for a political focal point around which there could be a European political sphere."
"Yet for this to happen, Europe needs to be more political in all of its structures, in terms of the citizens, the parties and relations between the institutions."
"Perhaps the European public debate is waiting to be kicked into life."
"Perhaps the European public debate is waiting for a defining moment and for a Constitution."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU is indeed going through a rough patch at the present time."
"Following the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands, European citizens have become increasingly sceptical towards the EU’s institutions and rapid EU enlargement."
"The programme ‘Citizens for Europe’ is intended to promote active European citizenship and to reduce dissatisfaction and alienation."
"My group actively supports the programme’s main objectives: promoting European values and achievements and preserving cultural diversity, in order to foster cohesion among Europeans."
"This programme is one of the tools that could help the EU to achieve these objectives, by means of town-twinning activities, citizens’ projects, building up European networks in the civil-society sector, and adult-education centres."
"Furthermore, as we have heard, the importance of ‘active European remembrance’ should not be underestimated in this regard, namely the preservation of memorial sites relating to Nazi and Stalinist deportation and mass extermination."
"Memorial sites for the victims of the crimes perpetrated by these totalitarian regimes, whose impact was felt throughout Europe, have been included in the programme and are to receive funding; both of which have the support of my group."
"The proposed total budget is to be EUR 235 million within the framework of the Financial Perspective for 2007–2013."
"In view of the ambitious objectives of ‘Citizens for Europe’, this funding does not, of course, reflect the programme’s real importance as a tool for making citizens aware of their European identity and common values on the one hand, and the strengthening of and support for European integration on the other."
". Mr President, Europe should first and foremost be there for its citizens, and not only the citizens for Europe."
"That is why I am pleased to see that Mr Takkula’s report has turned the Citizens for Europe programme into the Europe for the citizens programme."
"I am less impressed with the way in which the Council of the European Union is full of the importance of involving the citizen in the European Union, but subsequently fobs us off with an excuse when it comes to funding the Europe for the citizens programme."
"The Council’s parsimony does it no credit."
"What is worse, it has made the discussion on the Takkula report particularly difficult, because when we talk about involving citizens in the European Union, we actually mean all citizens."
"This also, for example, includes those European citizens who have become the victim of dictatorial regimes or internal strife in Europe, or new citizens, immigrants and citizens from third countries who have lived in Europe for a long time, as well as citizens of all ages."
"Were sufficient funds available – which they are not – we would have certainly been able to fund a wide range of projects that would have touched all those groups."
"As it happens, we can only fund a very limited number of programmes."
"To avoid disappointment on the part of people who are full of excitement when they come to submit their applications, only for the Commission to turn them down, Mr Takkula was brave enough to disappoint people at this stage, so as to make it absolutely clear from the outset who qualifies for funding and who does not."
"That is understandable and in general, I support this way of working."
"When it comes to remembering victims of European dictatorships, however, this approach is painful and lamentable."
"Are the victims of one dictatorship more important than another?"
"Of course they are not."
"We should try to avoid creating that impression, even at the risk of the Commission having to disappoint people at a later stage."
"That is why I hope that everyone will back the amendment tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, in which we make an appeal to remember the victims of all European dictatorships."
"The European citizen should not be at the receiving end of the Council’s economy drives."
"It is still not too late."
"The final decision on the financial perspectives will be taken before the report returns to this House for second reading."
"I would make an urgent appeal to the parties involved to make more funds available for culture, in general, and the Europe for the citizens programme, in particular."
"Without citizens, the European Union is nothing, as indeed the Council, Commission and Parliament have proved time and again."
"We therefore need money on the table, because the programme offers many opportunities, including town twinning opportunities, support for think tanks and NGOs, as well as the promotion of contacts between European citizens, for example in sports clubs."
"They are all fine ideas, but fine ideas with no money to back them up are nothing but empty promises."
"If Europe wants to be there for its citizens, it should not leave them in the lurch now."
". – Mr President, I am particularly obliged to the rapporteur, Mr Takkula, for his commitment, which goes to the very heart of the EU."
"This Europe should be a matter close to the heart of its citizens; that is the basic idea behind the present programme."
"Promotion of active European citizenship should be increased."
"It is a matter of improving the integration of citizens, as most of them reject Europe, and know far too little about European ideals, values and objectives."
"The EU is alien to the majority of citizens, who do not consider it their homeland."
"European integration policy is failing."
"For many, Europe is too top heavy, too complicated, too unfathomable, too cold."
"That is why the rapporteur’s approach of arousing interest in Europe in areas that citizens are passionate about, for example sports clubs, cultural initiatives and leisure activities, is a very viable one."
"I should like to make a plea here today for the promotion of more Eurovision events through the medium of television."
"One Eurovision Song Contest a year is not sufficient to give citizens a lasting understanding of the diversity of this continent."
"Why is there not a European Cinema Contest, for example, or Eurovision dance contests, or ‘European Idol’, or European Saturday-night shows in which the individual Member States compete against each other for fun?"
"This is the only way to successfully generate interest – maybe even enthusiasm – on the part of even apolitical European citizens in their – our – Europe."
"At the present time, there is frequent contact with representatives of European television companies with regard to the new ‘Television Without Frontiers’ Directive."
"Let us also call for and promote more commitment to Europe in the national entertainment programmes on television."
". – Mr President, Commissioner Figeľ, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, welcome this programme warmly – being, as it is, an attempt to respond to the crisis of confidence in Europe perceived by many citizens."
"It is important to be able to hold broad debates at the coalface on Europe’s understanding of itself in political and cultural terms, on its social responsibility and its future, and also on the role it wants to play in the world."
"After all, having the opportunity to speak to large numbers of citizens at the coalface – young people, the elderly, people in cultural organisations and political associations – about all Europe’s political issues is the only way to reach the people and their hearts more successfully than we have done in recent months."
"That is why the issue of Europe’s future is so central to this programme – but equally so is that of Europe’s past."
"Indeed, it is unfortunately the case that Europe is the continent whose totalitarianism, whose National Socialism and whose Stalinism has brought great suffering, murder and crime upon not only Europe but also other parts of the world."
"Therefore, I think it right that this programme recall that very totalitarian past, that we reappraise that past, and that we be sensitive and do everything possible to ensure that such things cannot happen again."
"I should like to state explicitly, therefore, that I do not see this as a matter of competing with other dictatorial regimes that have existed in Europe."
"It is of course right to reappraise these at national level – and we are all attending to this – but it is equally right that this European programme make reference to Europe’s totalitarianism."
"Therefore, I, too, am in favour of the rapporteur’s motion."
". – Let us begin with the name of the programme: ‘Citizens for Europe’ or ‘Europe for citizens’?"
"The difference is not the result of an oversight by the Commission."
"It is the result of the prevailing culture in the European institutions."
"There will not be new citizens for Europe while the Europe of the institutions continues, with its policies, to exacerbate the social fissures and the identity problems."
"No programme for citizenship can resolve this divorce."
"Yet if the programme, right from the very name, is indicative of this primary urge, then that cannot be a good thing."
"I therefore welcome the change of name, although I should like to see the consistency that is currently lacking."
"I should therefore like to highlight three aspects: Given the scarcity of resources there are two options open."
"Either the money is concentrated on few, highly conspicuous actions or it is distributed among projects promoting European citizenship."
"The rapporteur has opted for compromise, while seeking to raise the stock of the second of those options."
"I would have gone much further."
"I have nothing against major events, but I am totally opposed to lying."
"The greatest virtue of this programme is that it can be carried out by the associative networks, which, on the ground, foster citizenship."
"Any deviation from this option would distort the very idea of citizenship."
"Consequently, the idea of earmarking a substantial sum of money for support for six, now eight, institutions, without any kind of contest, is similarly unsustainable."
"The normal procedure in any civilised society is to select projects by means of transparent contests."
"At the other end of the scale is the law of lobbies, arrangements and favours."
"In this particular case, eleventh-hour agreements were reached in order to accommodate two more organisations."
"I am not judging their actual merits, but I am criticising the complete lack of merit in this method of awarding grants."
"The exact opposite would be a lesson in Europe citizenship, whereby contests are run and, hopefully, the contestants are rewarded impartially on their merits."
"My final question relates to the problem of memory."
"With the entry of the new countries from the East, it is perfectly understandable that the idea of associating the memory of the victims of Stalinism with the victims of the holocaust has emerged."
"That is fair enough, but does not tell the whole story."
"What is missing is something to honour the memory of the victims of fascism in southern Europe."
"Our view of citizenship must be that of respect for the pain of the victims, their families and their descendents."
"There cannot be any other criteria."
"In Portugal there is a citizens’ movement campaigning against turning the police headquarters of the old regime into luxury flats, rather than a museum."
"Each person brings his or her memories to Europe."
"With those memories, all of those memories, memory itself can be a component in citizenship."
"Fascism was an example of totalitarianism."
"It was also European."
". Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise that we should not just talk about the important values common to the people of the European Union, but that we should also actively put into practice the content of Mr Takkula’s report."
"This is all the more true since concerns are growing that in the globalised world understanding of Europe and its identity is vanishing."
"In fact, we must develop a multi-faceted, honest and democratic Europe that is open towards the rest of the world."
"We particularly need to pay attention to historical and cultural aspects."
"We need to promote measures to remember the mass deportations and the victims of both Nazism and Stalinism – I repeat, and Stalinism."
"We should preserve the evidence of these crimes."
"Such tasks bear witness to progress in the European Parliament’s thinking, as displayed by Members."
"Unfortunately, this cannot be said about the formulations prepared by the Council."
"Incredibly, these have retained the connivance characteristic of the cold war years with the half-truths of European history imposed by the totalitarian Communist regime."
"The Council must be reminded that Stalinism too was totalitarian and was no less destructive a regime for those who died among Europe’s peoples."
"The Takkula report is good."
"It represents the now regular affirmation that historical truth does not distinguish between Nazi crimes and Communist crimes."
"Crimes are and remain crimes."
"It surprises me that in this citadel of democracy, justice and truth motions can still be encountered that attempt to weigh in the scales of importance the memories of those who died in the Holocaust or in the gulags."
"I thank the rapporteur and those Members with modern ways of thinking for speaking about a Europe that is honest and based on common values and accurate history."
". Mr President, I should like to conduct a little experiment."
"I ask people in the Chamber to remove their headphones for three seconds."
"One, two, three."
"What did you hear?"
"Absolutely nothing!"
"That is the sound of silence that heralds the clamour for this piece of legislation."
"Are there demands to do something?"
"No!"
"Will it address the fundamental concerns of 450 million people struggling to earn a living or find solutions to everyday problems?"
"No, again."
"It is well known that something that you give but which cannot be disposed of has little value to the receivers since they have made no effort to get it."
"How cheap then is European citizenship, which is forced on people, is unwanted and cannot be refused or renounced."
"So here we go again!"
"Another huge propaganda project to distort and hide the truth."
"The hope and belief seems to be that this will cure the scepticism that is growing across the continent."
"Low Euro-election turnouts, vocal opposition to enlargement and the rejected Constitution are all, apparently, to be remedied by throwing EUR 235 million at projects to persuade the people that the EU is actually doing something good for them."
"This is pay-as-you-go citizenship."
"The price rises as your rights go."
"The EU will not listen to the people it is meant to represent."
"Instead it attempts to bribe its way to a position of favour."
"Yet European integration is exactly what the people are increasingly opposed to."
"Why?"
"Because each and every country is slowly waking up to the reality that one size does not suit all in the eurozone, and neither now will one citizenship."
"I have said before that, if the EU is the answer, it must have been a stupid question."
"That millions of citizens in countries across the world agree with me is really quite comforting."
"Mr President, citizenship and statehood go together; hence the desire of the promoters of the European project to produce European citizenship."
"True citizenship, however, does not need money thrown at it to make it real or desirable."
"Loyalty to it is born of the heart, not of the pocket."
"Surely we could find better uses for the EUR 230 million or even EUR 290 million, as some want, than promoting this contrived notion of European citizenship."
"At the end of all this wasted expenditure, the French will still want to be French and the British will still want to be British, and no one but the political Euro-elite will prize citizenship of Europe above that of their own country."
"Why then do we have to try so hard to defy the natural order and create a synthetic substitute, when in our Member States we can all enjoy the real thing?"
"GM citizenship may be for some; it is not for me."
"Mr President, an essential element of effective and engaged citizenship is an understanding of a society’s shared and common heritage."
"A heritage denied, ignored or distorted leaves a society divorced from reality, its true nature and character still oppressed, still deprived of its birthright."
"Accordingly, the rapporteur’s Amendment 29 is of enormous importance to those hundreds of thousands of Central and Eastern Europeans whose families or family members were executed, were deported or died in Stalin’s gulags, for no reason other than that their survival was judged to be a threat to the illegal occupation of their countries, agreed by Hitler and Stalin under the notorious Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact."
"In this connection, there has been discussion of other amendments in the name of Mr Sifunakis: Amendments 62 and 63, which refer to conflicts in Spain, Portugal and Greece."
"It seems to me that these are important issues, but they should be considered in another context."
"I hope that the whole of Parliament will support Amendment 29, so that we do not dilute the message that Hitler and Stalin were joint criminals who vented their anger on the peoples of Europe."
"The NKVD, the Soviet Union’s People’s Commissariat of Internal Affairs, under Order No 001223, entitled ‘On the operative accounting of anti-Soviet and socially alien elements’, issued on 11 October 1939, was the prelude to the mass deportations ordered by Merkulov, the USSR’s People’s Commissar for State Security, and put into effect by his deputy, Serov."
"On the night of 13 and 14 June 1941, 34 260 people were deported from Lithuania, 15 081 from Latvia and 10 205 from Estonia."
"This was just the most notorious of the many deportations which continued until 1951."
"It is significant that the EU will now support the commemoration of the victims of both those dictatorships."
"Without truth, there can be no reconciliation."
"The Russian people today are no more responsible for Stalin’s crimes than are the German people for Hitler’s."
"But European citizenship and good neighbourliness can only be based on respectful ..."
"Allow me to make another correction: the translation spoke of the Malta Agreement."
"Malta is a beautiful island."
"It was the Yalta Agreement that was meant: just a small difference."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the low turnout of European citizens at European elections and the rejection by two countries of the Constitutional Treaty are perhaps the tip of the iceberg of what is sometimes a difficult relationship between European citizens and the European Union."
"That is why we need a programme which will be able to motivate European citizens on the weak points; in other words make them participate more actively in common ventures, with the objective of mutual understanding between citizens and between the different cultural and historic permutations of the European identity itself."
"As regards the 'Citizens for Europe' programme, in the report on his proposal on which he worked with a great deal of zeal, our honourable friend Mr Takkula has renamed it from its original title of 'Citizens for Europe' to 'Europe for Citizens', thereby filling a gap in the programme, which will join existing Community programmes such as the 'Lifelong Learning' and 'Youth in Action' programmes which mainly target young people."
"However, European history also integrates two difficult periods during the 20th century which also form part of our common memory and history."
"The memory of the victims exterminated and displaced and imprisoned by autocratic regimes must remain alive."
"We cannot and must not forget the tragic moments which our continent experienced 60 years ago in the concentration and extermination camps at the hands of Nazism, nor of course can we or must we forget the crimes committed by Stalinism."
"However, we cannot keep selective memories alive."
"We cannot honour the memory of the victims of Nazism and Stalinism and, at the same time, forget the fascism and dictatorships of southern Europe."
"This year we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Community, two countries in which fascism, over a period of 40 years, left tragic remains behind it."
"We also celebrate the 25th anniversary this year of the accession of Greece to the European Community."
"From 1946 to 1974, concentration camps operated in Greece in which thousands of citizens were exterminated for their political ideas."
"The islands of Yiaros, which the Romans also used as a place of exile, and Makronisi became a tomb for a great number of people who lost their lives there as a result of the hardship and torture which they suffered together with thousands of other citizens exiled to these islands at that time."
"The common factor which links the states of southern Europe is that the stabilisation of democracy in these countries was achieved to a great extent thanks to their accession to the European Community."
"The 'Citizens for Europe' programme which we are debating today will therefore acquire material and overall value."
"That is why the amendments referred to earlier by my honourable friend Mr Catania and others must also be adopted, because they supplement the most extensive and very important report by our honourable friend Mr Takkula."
"I welcome and endorse the European Commission's new initiative ‘Active European Citizenship’."
"I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on a well prepared report."
"The promotion of European citizenship is an essential condition for the European Union, which has been successfully enlarged, to function."
"The European Union needs a programme, especially after the 2004 enlargement, which devotes particular attention to its citizens."
"At the moment, the deficit of active democracy is one of the most acute present-day problems faced by the European Union, and therefore, we welcome efforts to form a European identity, to foster citizenship and promote active participation in the area of European integration."
"In Lithuania, public opinion polls indicate great mistrust in important state institutions by residents, and there is a sense that voter participation is decreasing."
"These indicators are also similar in the European Union."
"An average European has also little faith in, whether it be political parties, his country's government or parliament."
"By introducing the active citizenship initiative, the integration of European values will be noticeable in individual national societies, and the European identity, which is actively formed, will also have a positive influence on common European Union decisions."
"The institutions of the European Union must become accountable not just to the governments of Member States and their delegations, but to the citizens of Europe."
"The implementation of measures will create greater transparency and a degree of responsibility in the political process of the European Union."
"European culture and its diversity will be fostered, and cooperation between citizens and organisations of various countries will be encouraged."
"The same evaluation of the past, Stalin's gulags and the fascist Holocaust, would strengthen European citizenship."
"It is important that this programme is accessible to all interested parties, that is non-governmental organisations and educational institutions."
"This initiative is the key to citizens having a conscious effect on their own and their children's future in Europe."
"Mr President, as a European and Catalan I fully support the need to reinforce historical memory in order to avoid future disasters while we learn from our past."
"In Mr Takkula's report there is a proposal to finance historical sites related to the main totalitarian regimes that Europe endured during the 20th century – Nazism and Stalinism."
"I agree with him, but we would also like to extend this proposal to other aspects directly related to this kind of authoritarianism."
"In our case, in the Catalan country, we suffered Franco's dictatorship which was closely related in origin to Nazism and Italian Fascism."
"The only president of a democratic nation killed as a consequence of World War II was Lluís Companys, President of the Catalan Autonomous Government."
"The first civilian population bombed indiscriminately by hostile aircraft was Guernica, the emblematic town in the Basque country."
"If we neglect Franco's regime and other dictatorships in southern Europe and the need to rescue the historical memory of this dark period of our history, we avoid discussing the consequences of dictatorships, some of them very disturbing for the European Union, even today."
"Mr President, the measures contained in the Citizens for Europe programme will help create sound principles for coexistence and interaction between nations."
"They will raise awareness of each nation’s individuality and promote recognition of its national cultural heritage."
"In addition, they will contribute to the elimination of stereotypes and help our citizens to become more favourably disposed towards diversity."
"I was pleased to note that in the section concerning memorial sites to victims of totalitarian regimes, financial support is made available not only for remembrance of victims of Nazism but also for activities relating to Stalinism."
"Throughout its history, Europe has suffered under a great many cruel and inhuman dictators, and none of this suffering should be forgotten."
"In view of the meagre budget allocated to this particular aim, however, our efforts should focus only on the two most shocking and horrific of these regimes, whose effects were felt on a massive scale with consequences at global level."
"Stalin and Hitler’s regimes must become symbols of evil, and be imprinted on our children’s consciousness as murderous systems."
"This will prevent any recurrence of such regimes."
"Accordingly, we must also ensure that suitable sums are allocated to the implementation of appropriate cultural programmes in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party, and this time I am also speaking as the mayor of a lovely town north of Rome."
"As mayor, I have undertaken countless activities to promote a European identity, encouraging the citizens to participate and cooperate, especially through twinning and cultural exchanges in which young people and students, together with others, have played a leading role."
"I find, in fact, that citizens who deal on a daily basis with problems that are often far removed from those addressed in this House need tangible demonstrations of the fact that there is a basis of common values for all 450 million Europeans."
"They will have to feel this very strongly if the gap between the people and the institutions is to be closed."
"I therefore support the Commission’s proposal and all the activities proposed, especially those that promote the European values of democracy, freedom and respect for human rights: I think they are valid and should be endorsed."
"I therefore hope that this project will be taken forward with as much institutional and financial support as possible."
"Other concomitant measures are needed, however."
"First of all, there is a need to improve communications and information on the activities of our institutions at a local level, and we should therefore promote information campaigns, debates and talks on major European topics."
"I also believe that any measure to promote so-called ‘European citizenship’ will be fruitless unless during the coming debates we take due account of the needs, demands and expectations of civil society."
"Making citizens feel that they really are taking part in the many huge challenges that we still have to face is perhaps the most realistic way to create a solid, common foundation on which to build our future."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am much obliged to Mr Takkula for the work he has done, and I am also pleased that it really had the support of the whole committee."
"This programme represents the only opportunity for most citizens of participating in the body of European thought, and becoming involved, as active members of our civil society."
"In effect, the referendums in France and the Netherlands have made it necessary for us to explain things better, to explain enlargement, to explain the Constitutional Treaty, to dispel people’s fears about globalisation."
"This programme makes all of this possible, with the help of intermediaries, who receive money from this programme."
"I am pleased that the Commission named some of these, therefore."
"Indeed, there is no need to reinvent the wheel; there are institutions that have been working on European citizenship for a long time already."
"To Mr Allister – he is not here any more, unfortunately – who said earlier that he does not want to be a European, I can only say that I am a citizen of Saarland – a small German – I am a German, and I am a European."
"It is like a Russian doll; it is possible to be all of these, none of them are ruled out."
"Collectively, we are all committed to European values, however."
"I deplore the fact that we have thrown ourselves too much into the issue of Nazi and Stalinist memorial sites."
"In this connection, I should like to say to Mr Sifunakis – who has also already left, unfortunately – that he actually exceeded his powers."
"His motion regarding these memorial sites was defeated in committee."
"The committee decided against it."
"Mr Sifunakis then proceeded to write to all the members of the committee as its chairman, requesting that they kindly follow him this time."
"As far as I am aware, that is something that has never happened in this House in my 16 years here."
"I hope that my fellow Members will not follow him."
"I should like to make one final point – one already touched upon by Mr Battilocchio: we need town-twinning activities, which do a wonderful job."
"This is another area in which it is possible to achieve more with a little more money than a great deal of other things that could have been devised."
"I would ask the Commissioner to include the three additional organisations we want to involve."
"These have done a wonderful job, and he can rely on them."
"– Mr President, ‘Citizens for Europe’ means arousing citizens’ interest in Europe, informing them about Europe, involving them in decisions, offering them means of communicating, and ultimately filling them with enthusiasm for Europe."
"We are unfortunately becoming further and further removed from the latter."
"I am convinced, however, that the present programme has the potential to contribute a great deal towards reducing Euroscepticism."
"As Mrs Pack has just said, one key aspect is town-twinning activities, which foster mutual acquaintance and understanding by means of common selective, but also structured, multiannual agreements."
"This is a very inexpensive communication project but, unfortunately, is not being recognised as such."
"If we were to increase investment in this project, we could dispense with many a brochure."
"The aim of citizens’ projects is to bring interested parties together to work on European issues, which makes it possible to reach a broad public."
"If included in networks, clubs and associations can be an effective tool for reaching citizens, strengthening social cohesion and preventing exclusion or discrimination among a wide variety of groups of people – an important basis for active citizenship and the European dialogue."
"The ‘active European remembrance’ campaign has been included in this programme for the first time, as the committee is of the opinion that European history needs to be discussed in the context of a broad public."
"The discussion has also shown – and this shows that we were right – that this important issue should not be dealt with as a small contribution to this programme – as a peripheral phenomenon, as it were – but calls for a programme in its own right. This is in order to draw attention to all forms of dictatorship and their victims, including, in particular, making young people and future generations aware of the atrocities perpetrated by past regimes, and to work on ensuring that our democracies are, and remain, strong enough to render such inhumane regimes impossible in future."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate Mr Takkula on his excellent work and outstanding report. The first thing that I welcome in it is the proposal to change the title of the programme from ‘Citizens for Europe’ to ‘Europe for Citizens’."
"This inversion of the words encapsulates the whole meaning of the culture that, from now on, should lie at the heart of Community action: the means and not the end for Europe’s peoples to achieve their aspirations."
"I am delighted that greater attention is being paid to the citizens and that there is a new-found sensitivity to issues of culture and European identity."
"This is shown by the fact that the agenda for this plenary session also includes the reports by Mr Hammerstein Mintz, on the opening of Council meetings to the public; Mr Cashman, on access to the institutions’ texts; and Mrs Prets, on the European Capital of Culture."
"We in this House therefore have the opportunity – I would even say the duty – to make this Europe more transparent, more democratic, easier to understand and, hence, more acceptable."
"At such a difficult time in the European integration process as we are now experiencing, when nationalist, separatist tendencies appear to be gaining new legitimacy, disseminating mutual knowledge about our different cultures is certainly a vital means of social integration and of exalting the values that unite us, and it plays a key role in the fight against racism and xenophobia."
"To conclude, that is why I think it is important to endow this programme with more substantial, more adequate funding."
"Mr President, the sense of belonging and feeling European also needs to be developed in Europe’s citizens, who no longer want to be subject to Europe but want to create it instead."
"Mr President, Mr Figel’, Mr Takkula, ladies and gentlemen, in the last century the distinguished historian Hannah Arendt concluded, with wonderful simplicity, but accurately, that nothing is in principle more characteristic of totalitarian regimes and dictators than the astonishingly short space of time it takes for their crimes against humanity to be forgotten and, just as astonishingly, the fact that new tyrants can calmly appear in their place."
"The chance to observe new Stalins and Hitlers has unfortunately not disappeared even to this day."
"For precisely this reason our shared duty is not to allow the crimes committed by the Nazis and Soviet totalitarian Communism to be forgotten."
"We must remember the horror that occurred when the insane ideas of two tyrants subjected the peoples of Europe to mass murders, people slaughtered in death camps and the distortion of destiny, blackening the pages of Europe’s history."
"Regardless of the difference in their individual ideas, both totalitarian regimes can be considered equal."
"Both Hitler and Stalin organised mass deportations, set up death camps and ordered mass murders, slaughtering millions of people, among them defenceless children."
"I can say with certainty that nearly every European family has a story to tell about the blighted fates of fathers, brothers or sisters."
"The crimes of Hitler’s Nazis and of Stalinism cannot and must not be forgotten, particularly this year, when 14 June will mark the passing of 65 years since the start of the ruthless mass deportations from the Baltic states."
"Thank you, Christopher Beazley, for reminding us of these facts."
"Today we should foster among Europe’s peoples understanding of the principles of respect for democracy, freedom and human rights."
"We should do this so that no contemporary copycat Stalin could ever even dream that he would go unpunished."
"We must actively support projects that preserve the memory of Nazism and Stalinism, mass deportations and the dead."
"We must show our children the places connected with mass deportations and concentration camps and we must preserve the memories of the victims."
"I call upon you to vote for a reunification of Europe’s history!"
"Mr President, tomorrow we will vote on this report on the ‘Citizens for Europe’ programme, which, as other speakers have said, is intended to promote active European citizenship and which comes within the context of the Union’s concern about the citizens’ distance towards the European institutions and the difficulties they face identifying with the process of integration."
"I would like to express my full support for this programme and congratulate Mr Takkula on the work he has done."
"Let us talk about Action 4 of this programme, which is aimed at the preservation of the memorial sites related to Nazi and Stalinist deportation and mass extermination;"
"I also fully support the memory of these hideous regimes that marked the European and world history of the 20th century."
"I would also like to add, however, that under no circumstances can we exclude other victims, who are equally innocent and unfairly treated by history, such as the victims of fascism and other European dictatorships."
"In fact, Mr President, less than a month ago, the Council of Europe adopted a resolution on the international condemnation of the Franco régime."
"If one of the objectives of this programme is to forge a European identity based on common values, history and culture and to strengthen European integration on the basis of respect, mutual understanding and appreciation and cultural diversity, the European Parliament must not fail to acknowledge the history of many European countries which for years suffered repression and murder in their fight for freedom."
"Spain’s transition to democracy is inextricably linked to our entry into the European Union twenty years ago."
"And, within the framework of this programme, it is right to recognise the victims of this black period in our history, because that would quite rightly contribute to strengthening the citizens' ties with the Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the lack of budget – which is a reality — cannot justify the exclusion of certain victims at the expense of others."
"We should not be comparing different wars or quantifying a massacre according the deaths involved, but rather remembering all victims, so that by preserving their memory we can prevent such events from ever happening again."
"I would ask you, therefore, to support the amendments supported by more than 60 members from different groups in this Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, because they will enrich the programme, on the basis of the full recognition of European historical memory and with a view to strengthening a feeling of citizenship."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the detachment of the public from the institutions and bodies of the European Union, the lack of identification with the process of European integration and also the failure to involve the public in debates over the extent of future enlargement are all confronting the EU as a whole with a sizeable problem."
"This has manifested itself most strikingly in the French and Dutch referenda on ratification of the EU Constitution."
"In other countries too, however, including those that joined in May 2004, there are negative manifestations of the information deficit."
"One positive aspect is the public’s desire for more information, and also their interest in rational and sensible activities."
"The Citizens for Europe programme under discussion today is an instrument with the potential for fulfilling this demand."
"Some of the actions set out in it are already proving their value today, and are being intensively pursued."
"One positive example of this is the twinning programme, which any community can participate in regardless of its size."
"The programme is particularly amenable to small communities, as it is very easy to obtain a grant and there are no unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles."
"The minimum grant for funding, for example, meetings between members of partnership communities is set very low so that where there is demand it will not be difficult to find the financial support."
"The twinning partnerships of towns, and the way that citizens work together to solve European questions or to support voluntary organisations, can strengthen shared European values while at the same time respecting national and regional diversity."
"The Member States must supplement these actions with activities in the areas of culture and education."
"An emphasis on the fight against racism, xenophobia and intolerance, as well as support for multiculturalism and multilingualism should be recognised as a priority and a common interest."
"I would like to end by expressing my appreciation for the work of the rapporteur and for the willing cooperation of the Committee on Culture and Education."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Takkula’s report deals with an extremely important topic."
"Congratulations on your good work."
"Today the European Union is becoming a fairground where the politicians of the Member States are guided only by their own interests and the objective of satisfying their voters."
"There is not enough of a feeling among citizens of the Member States of the European Union that they are actually citizens of Europe."
"In order to develop a feeling of citizenship, it is important to know one another’s history."
"Before and after the Second World War, many European peoples languished under totalitarian rule."
"My homeland Estonia was wiped from the map by one of the most ruthless dictators in history, Stalin."
"We no longer had our own flag or national anthem, and our capital city was Moscow."
"Stalinism’s twin brother was Nazism."
"These two ideologies, which were born at the same time, divided Europe among themselves with the Hitler-Stalin Pact."
"Stalin held the entire eastern part of Europe under dictatorial rule for half a century."
"Hitler’s war machine violently subjugated the part of Western Europe in which local dictators were unable to seize power themselves."
"In seeking the equal remembrance of the victims of Nazism and Stalinism, I am fighting against the merely token acceptance of the new Member States into the European Union."
"I condemn all forms of totalitarianism."
"I would like to emphasise, however, that Nazism and Stalinism are the cornerstone of all other totalitarian ideologies."
"Rulers like Franco, Mussolini and Salazar tortured their victims on the example set by Hitler and Stalin."
"Each Member State of the European Union should take responsibility for the just assessment of their dictator’s actions in their home country."
"At the moment, however, we are discussing Stalinism and Nazism, which transcended and did not respect state borders."
"It is the duty of the Member States to collectively condemn the cruelties of Hitler and Stalin, which split Europe in two and separated it with an Iron Curtain."
"Let us therefore work together, in the framework of the ‘Citizens for Europe’ programme, to jointly remember the victims of Stalinism and Nazism."
"Mr President, I have two remarks, one is on the report and the other is of a general nature."
"Firstly, I should like to congratulate my friend Mr Takkula on his report."
"It is his first report, it is a big report and he has done an excellent job in raising all the key issues."
"I support every bit of it."
"I also support all the wording on Stalin and Hitler."
"I must admit that, although I am not a member of the committee, I fully support what Mrs Pack said."
"It is quite amazing that the chairman of the committee, Mr Sifunakis, takes a completely opposite view to what has been decided in the committee, but so be it."
"If I did not know Mr Takkula well, having read this report, I might even think that he is a federalist, but perhaps not this time round."
"My more general remark is really about European citizenship and national citizenship."
"Some people seem to think that we are somehow trying to create a European prototype, but I disagree."
"I am a federalist myself, but I think that identity is first local, then national and after that European."
"I have lived in Brussels for seven years."
"To be quite honest, when I came to Brussels, I had a few prejudices about nationalities."
"For example: Finns do not talk at all; every German has the same sense of humour as our President in the chair today; every Frenchman always speaks through three points; no Italian has ever drawn an operative conclusion."
"That was the feeling I had when I came to Brussels."
"Those are the national prototypes that we have."
"To be quite honest, after seven years I think that my prejudices have only strengthened – in a very positive way, but, nevertheless strengthened."
"So we are certainly not creating any kind of a prototype European."
"It seems to me that the only time that we can really feel European is, for instance, through sport: the Ryder Cup in golf is a great example, and Eurovision is something that brings us together."
"However, all in all, I think this report is great because it gives us four pieces of action."
"I can support each and every one of them."
"It has no propaganda in it, so I hope the Commission takes it seriously and takes on board all the changes that Mr Takkula has proposed."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the programme to promote active European citizenship, used correctly, has the potential to become a very valuable tool for bridging the gap between the EU and its citizens and combating Euroscepticsm."
"With a budget of less than EUR 300 million for seven years and with 36 countries involved, expectations are high."
"Nevertheless, in view of its four different action fields, implementation will be difficult."
"For this reason, I should like to thank Mr Takkula, who has made real efforts to achieve a balance and also to refrain from making any cuts in the small budget, for example in the field of town-twinning activities."
"These are citizens’ projects that strengthen European consciousness and identity at grass-roots level."
"We want to promote the active, civil-society projects in the EU, in which there is so much idealism: they need our attention and support."
"We want to support the public-relations activities of the Europe Houses and of the institutes operating throughout Europe."
"I would ask the Commissioner to incorporate our proposals."
"The fourth action is also very important to me, as a German Social Democrat."
"I hail from Nuremberg, the city of the Nazi Party conferences."
"In the present day, the city is making efforts to shake off its old image and restyle itself as a city of human rights."
"Anyone wanting to actively shape the future needs to be aware of his past, which is why action 4, ‘active European remembrance’, is so important."
"We need to remember the victims of the violent Nazi and Stalinist regimes, and also the relevant places and memorial sites."
"We also need to remember all the victims of dictatorships, however, and therefore I would ask you to support Amendments 54 and 55 by my group."
"The reason for this request is that we should be very careful not to play victims off against one another."
"Mr President, I welcome Mr Takkuli’s report and the proposal to create an additional, fourth action entitled Active European Remembrance."
"Much has been said in this House about economic and social integration, but there has been a tendency to overlook the role of historical integration as a key element of integration."
"Europe has always reflected its past and continues to draw on that legacy today."
"Communism and Nazism were two totalitarian regimes that contributed equally to the bloody history of the 20th century."
"It is not appropriate to use the term Stalinism."
"Communism in general was a curse of the 20th century."
"The nature of relations between European countries and nations is coloured by historical experiences, but even the most difficult and painful of these can be transformed into strong ties of affection."
"Pope John Paul II said that despite tremendous achievements in a number of areas, the 20th century was characterised by the mystery of evil."
"We have carried this legacy of good and evil with us into the 21st century."
"The House has debated issues relating to historical policy on a number of occasions."
"I could mention the debates on the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, the anniversary of the end of the Second World War and the 25th anniversary of Solidarity for example."
"These debates revealed the extent of misunderstanding of basic historical facts and of our historical legacy."
"The notion of a European identity must be based on acceptance of the truth about our past."
"Remembering the victims of mass deportations and extermination undertaken by Communism and the Nazis will not foster distrust amongst nations."
"It will instead remind us all of the fundamental right to freedom, the rule of law, and respect from others."
"This is the only way for the European Union to make its founding fathers’ message of unity in diversity a reality."
". Mr President, I should like to thank all the participants in this debate for their very interesting points and contributions."
"We can easily agree that, although the consensus is strong, there are sometimes questions about programmes or European identity, but that identity is none the less emerging."
"We perhaps see it more from the outside than the inside, but it is complementary to our basic personal, national, local, regional dimensions; it is enriching."
"It is important to remember tragedies in Europe, especially at a time when we are still looking for war criminals on the continent."
"It is not such a long time ago that many parts of Europe were full of bloody places, borders and mass graves, and it is important to remember that."
"I do not need to answer specific points because I covered them at the start."
"Regarding finance, we are in negotiations."
"I hope that strong support by Parliament, as seen recently in relation to citizenship, youth and education programmes, will be seen at the final meetings of the Troika or current negotiations on the Financial Perspective."
"We will mainstream citizenship issues via different actions and different programmes, because that is important."
"The last point concerns the title."
"I think both the Commission and Parliament are partially correct."
"It is only partially correct to state that there is either Europe for citizens, or citizens for Europe."
"If you recall John Fitzgerald Kennedy’s message to the people, Europe can be built only on the foundations of mature citizens, and a mature Europe can deliver many answers to our citizens."
"So, we need both: Europe for citizens and citizens for Europe."
"I believe that this programme can contribute to such a mature community(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday."
"– Developing a European identity, improving mutual understanding and integration, and valuing diversity through dialogue are fundamental objectives for consolidating the European Union."
"European unity cannot be imposed from above, but rather must be the outcome of everyone’s sense of responsibility."
"The actors must be families, social groupings, the widespread voluntary sector and grass-roots associations."
"Bringing people together and encouraging local communities to meet to exchange experiences, opinions and values are all necessary for European citizenship to mature."
"Being a citizen of Europe means being part of a culture that has at its centre the richness of a life lived responsibly and loved creatively, a life to which we courageously bear witness against all comers."
"Let us keep an active remembrance, in which the horrors that we Europeans have witnessed may serve as a warning for a different future."
"Such a remembrance in my city, Padua, in my region, Veneto, will breathe life into the creation of a Remembrance Museum in Villa Venier, in the municipality of Vo’ Euganeo."
"The ‘Citizens for Europe’ programme is therefore an inspired idea that should be developed and passed on to every single country, town and municipality in Europe, and it has our staunch support."
"The Commission can agree to Amendments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 28, 29, 31, 34, 39, 43, 46, 50(2), 51 and 61."
"Amendments 12, 14, 16, 20, 27, 30, 32, 37, 41, 42, 44, 48 and 52 can be accepted in principle provided that they are redrafted."
"Reserved position pending agreement on financial perspectives on Amendments 36, 45, 49 and 50(3)."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments 8, 9, 11, 13, 23, 26, 33, 35, 38, 40, 47, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 62 and 63."
"The next item is the report (A6-0061/2006) by Mrs Prets on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community action for the European Capital of Culture event for the years 2007 to 2019 (COM(2005)0209 – C6-0157/2005 – 2005/0102(COD))."
". Mr President, the European Capital of Culture action is probably one of the most popular European initiatives."
"It has been appreciated by Member States and the general public alike since its birth 20 years ago in 1985, thanks to Melina Mercouri."
"The main idea is still to highlight the richness and diversity of European cultures and the features they share, as well as to promote greater mutual acquaintance between European citizens."
"This is also a topic very close to the previous one."
"However, our experience has shown that some aspects of the current programme of cooperation need improvement, mainly in four areas: competition between cities, the role of the selection panel, the European dimension of the action, and the monitoring process."
"That is why last year the Commission adopted the proposal that is intended to replace the decision of 1999."
"That was a parliamentary request voiced by Mrs Prets and I promised at that time personally to introduce a new proposal."
"The new system should encourage Member States to organise competition at national level between interested cities."
"A mixed selection panel should evaluate the applications as part of the national competition."
"That mixed panel will be made up of seven experts appointed by the institutions, together with six experts to be nominated by the Member State concerned."
"The Member State will then propose one city to the European institutions."
"As in the past, the Council will make the final decision concerning the designation of the city."
"In addition, the proposal lays down streamlined and clearer criteria compared to those in the current decision."
"Following the designation of the European capitals, a monitoring process will be put in place to provide cities with support and advice in finalising the preparation of the programme and in particular with a view to ensuring that European added value is effectively reflected."
"A prize will be awarded to the European Capitals of Culture that meet the criteria and objectives of that initiative."
"At the same time, I will propose a substantial increase in the Community contribution to such cities participating in the programme via the Culture 2007 programme."
"I am very pleased that Parliament, the Council and Commission have worked in close cooperation in order to find compromise amendments suitable for all."
"This report is in line with the Commission’s approach and clearly improves our proposal, so I think that this new scheme creates a good balance between local and national interests and enhances the European dimension."
"I am sure that this will increase the transparency of the selection process and the visibility of the action."
"I would like to confirm that the Commission welcomes this report and accepts all the compromise amendments."
"Consequently, I expect adoption of our amended proposal at first reading."
"I should really like to thank the Committee on Culture and Education and in particular the rapporteur Mrs Prets for her efficiency and effort."
". – Mr President, as the Commissioner has already mentioned, some aspects of this 20-year-old agreement were in need of reform."
"Although a new decision had been presented in 1999, this had overlooked the fact that we were to be joined a few years later by ten new Member States – perhaps even more – and so these new Member States needed to be taken into account."
"Consequently, we now have a partnership system."
"The proposal that was presented to us at that time was unsatisfactory."
"In 2004, we drew up another new proposal, but an abridged one, as we were in a hurry so as not to obstruct the process for the 2009 and 2010 cities, and thus accepted its shortcomings."
"The Commission kept its promise, however, and, six months later, did indeed present us with a new draft."
"Our priority is to redefine the role of the panel."
"We have had problems with it in the past, and so we need to ensure that we have a better one in future. This new draft makes the panel more democratic."
"This means that the Member States and the candidate countries are represented on the selection panel, at the pre-selection stage, and are able to make their contribution this way: it is not only those in Brussels who have a say, which is very important."
"In the second phase, there is a monitoring and advisory panel, which follows this process critically, but plays a supporting role too instead of just identifying shortcomings."
"That is very important, as the cities very often feel left alone with their preparations and do not know exactly how to deal with all the rules."
"Competition was another crucial issue; we wanted to strengthen the competitive element."
"The Member States should bear in mind during the preparatory period that what is important is new cultural activity, and that the public and the individual regions are also involved."
"Although I am stressing the competition issue, I should also like to point out that there are no doubt some smaller countries who are unable to hold major competitions."
"In such cases, a single candidate city would be permissible, but it would have to meet all the challenges and requirements for becoming a European Capital of Culture."
"One essential criterion, and a discussion point, is the European dimension."
"The cities are required to create European added value, and the question is: what is the European added value?"
"How do the cities reflect it?"
"How can we explain to the cities precisely what task they have to perform?"
"The Commission has not managed to define this with absolute precision, which I can understand, as it is very difficult."
"The Commission has promised to present the best practice model on a website."
"This website is a very important means of giving guidance and of sharing enquiries and experiences, which is very important to the candidate cities."
"I would ask the Commissioner to ensure that the guidance and website are indeed present when this project enters into force."
"One satisfactory aspect is the funding – not as regards the amount, as there will be another problem in that regard."
"The new Financial Perspective is likely to reduce the amount envisaged for the European Capitals of Culture, too, which we greatly regret."
"If I take as an example the city of Linz, which now has an investment volume of EUR 60 million, but only 0.86% of this comes from the EU, I do wonder why the burdens are so great."
"Of course, one could say it is a matter of image: it helps the region, it helps the city, we are investing in the future, we are investing in sustainability – this is another important aspect."
"Whilst we are on the subject of finances: it is gratifying that this prize is now to be awarded three months in advance."
"That will undoubtedly help the cities, as up to now the main problem has been that cities are always left worrying about their money after the event, after everything has been concluded."
"I hope and wish that this is really the case in practice and that, therefore, the European Capitals of Culture do indeed face a very democratic future."
"I hope that sustainability, good reputation and the impetus given to art and European culture in general find expression in this report, and also in the activities and implementation that follow."
". – Mr President, even though everything has really been said already, I should like to add something, as it is a matter of great concern to me that the European Capital of Culture really become what we have believed it should be all along, namely an advertising medium for European culture."
"This cooperation, which was previously intergovernmental – it was actually a government action – has now developed into an interinstitutional matter."
"This means that we enjoy excellent cooperation, and also, as Mrs Prets has already said, our voice has been heard."
"For years, we have been appealing for something substantial for the panel to evaluate and select, for the cities to make an effort to reveal European added value and not just what they already have."
"This action, in particular, makes us aware of the importance of European culture."
"The cities are the culture bearers and cultural mediators of the EU."
"This competition gives them the opportunity to bring a very great deal of elements together; there can be cross-border cooperation between regional cultures."
"I could not agree more about the importance of also holding a competition to this end."
"Taking Germany as an example, I can say that the competition to find the 2010 European Capital of Culture was a wonderful event, with 10 cities aspiring to be the best."
"The initiatives they took did not peter out, but are being passed on."
"They set up a network with the Hungarian cities, and I believe that the Commission should set great store by that."
"The website is a potential tool for passing on such things, too."
"I am pleased that the Commission has now overcome its administrative hurdles and a prize has been established – which is not really a prize, of course, but rather the money owing to a city, and means that the city finally has this money at its disposal as it begins its work."
"All in all, this action is a very good thing, which, in both this context and that of our previous debate on citizenship, helps the public to see Europe’s great cultural diversity."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I want to give my honourable friend Mrs Pack an explanation as regards the letter."
"All members of parliament – I say this for your benefit Mrs Pack – receive letters urging us to support amendments tabled by our honourable friends."
"This is for the simple reason that we cannot all know the content of the hundreds of amendments tabled."
"I receive such letters, just like everyone else."
"Now, as regards a comment made by another honourable friend, the committee chairmen exercise their right, like all members of parliament, to table amendments and, even when they believe that they may not be approved in committee, they also have the right – which is not contrary to the Rules of Procedure – to table them in plenary."
"I think this is something we all do."
"To come back to the point, the cultural capitals are today still the biggest and best organised political institution in Europe."
"No other cultural action in the European Union has the same range today or, most importantly, the same projection and mass participation on the part of citizens."
"In addition, it is hard to think of many other modern European initiatives in the field of culture which have constituted a standard."
"However, experience has shown, as other honourable Members mentioned, that certain specific aspects of this institution could go no further."
"The main need is to improve the selection method of cultural capitals."
"This is something that has been done and the honourable Members who participated in the previous committee chaired by Michel Rocard worked a great deal on this."
"The current framework really does not safeguard competition, as we have heard."
"Another important issue is that the European dimension is often missing from the programme;"
"I have found this to be true of cultural events which I have attended within the framework of three or four cultural capitals."
"The new proposal, on which our rapporteur, Mrs Prets, has done a very good job, tries to reconcile the various viewpoints both within Parliament and within the Council."
"Finally, I want to say a couple of words about the prize."
"It is important, as the Commission proposed, that there should be this prize in honour of Melina Mercouri."
"The proposal that the prize should carry her name was no coincidence on the part of the Commission or, of course, on the part of the 25 Council representatives who accepted it, because Melina Mercouri was the inspiration, the artist who worked the whole time she was Minister of Culture for this prize to be established."
"It was therefore her idea and I think that it is important for it to bear her name in future."
"Of course, there has been a compromise in relation to the initial proposal."
"To finish, I should like to add that the cultural capitals are embraced by the European Union."
"At the same time, however, apart from independence of choice, what the Member States need as a guideline is to determine better the methods of intervention mainly in infrastructures if not in programmes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much like the Commission’s proposal, which is designed to strengthen the European dimension and to improve the transparency of the selection procedure for the European Capital of Culture."
"The Prets report is excellently structured and I congratulate the rapporteur on that. Two proposals that I find highly convincing and interesting are the idea of naming the prize that the Commission proposes to award to the chosen city after Melina Mercouri, for the reasons just mentioned by Mr Sifunakis, and the proposal to set up a website creating links between nominated cities, encouraging the exchange of know-how and best practices, and providing information on the candidate cities."
"I personally believe it is essential to strengthen the association between the European Capital of Culture programme and tourism, a major industry, so as to take full advantage of the enormous economic and social potential that an event of this scale can produce, and also to ensure that it acts as a lasting incentive for the development of the city and the surrounding area."
"In this respect, I should like to resubmit the proposal that I put forward in this House during the debate on the Queiró report: to create a European capital of tourism."
"Further support for this proposal is provided by the enhancement of the urban dimension."
"The new agenda for 2007-2013 will in fact focus decisively on the role of cities."
"As you can see, Italians are operative."
"If Mr Stubb, who jokingly described my fellow-countrymen as being incapable of drawing operative conclusions, were still here, I would tell him, equally tongue-in-cheek, that perhaps he has been influenced by some bad examples and by his political friendships."
"To conclude, Mr President, I hope that tomorrow Parliament will adopt the Prets report, since it is a thorough, rich text that highlights an important Community scheme designed to bring Europe closer to the people through culture, as well as to encourage the development and revitalisation of cities."
"– Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mrs Prets for her committed and competent work on this report."
"Even though some of the previous speakers have already mentioned the problems that occurred in specific cases, I should like to emphasise that, so far, the history of the European capitals of culture has by and large been a successful one."
"The individual cities named as capitals of culture have benefited, but so has Europe as a whole, because, time and again, these European capitals of culture have made it clear how diverse, rich and varied European culture is."
"Nevertheless, I should like to focus on two aspects of this redrafted report that are particularly important to me."
"Firstly, the idea of sustainability requires the capital of culture action not to be purely event-based, but to make a real contribution to encouraging greater social interaction, more promotion of art and culture, and new architectural designs."
"This also includes the issue of structural change, and the value of cultural activities for Europe as a whole."
"Secondly, the objective of establishing a truly European outlook and exchange and of emphasising European added value is a really decisive point in the redrafting of this programme, and there is still more to be done in this regard."
"The best way we can win people over and generate enthusiasm is to make it clear what European interaction really is, and not to refer just to what was already available without it, but to get together with many European players and develop new facilities."
"That will make the idea of European capitals of culture even more attractive in the years to come."
". Mr President, much experience has been gained from European Capital of Culture events."
"The celebrations have had both positive and negative consequences."
"On the positive side, we have noted a flourishing of creative activity, cultural exchanges abroad and patronage for cultural events."
"The cities have been promoted and their citizens’ cultural ambitions awakened."
"On the negative side, I could mention the concentration of effort and resources on specific cultural events at the expense of social and cultural movements in the city and region concerned."
"I could also refer to the lack of a detailed impact assessment of the programme undertaken, and the imposition on Member States and city authorities of criteria that are often inappropriate to the needs and traditions of the cities and regions."
"I should comment too on the lack of clarity and transparency regarding the financing of activities from European funds."
"Latterly, a tendency to restrict the role of Member States and selection in identifying European Capitals of Culture has become evident."
"This is a worrying development and we would do well to consider what is most desirable, effective cooperation or imposing one’s will on others."
"Personally, I am in favour of dialogue and the creation of conditions for active participation in culture, so as to promote its beauty and diversity."
"Thanks are due to Mrs Prets for her report and all the efforts involved."
"I trust that in the course of future work we shall endeavour to draw on positive experiences."
"I hope too that we will eliminate aspects that are not conducive to further development and which, on the contrary, limit the cultural diversity that is vital to bringing about integration and national dialogue."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have placed on record a minority opinion in accordance with Rule 48 of our Rules of Procedure and I shall not vote in favour of this draft."
"Nonetheless, I thank Mrs Prets for her work."
"I shall give you the reasons for my position."
"The project that aims to designate each year a European Capital of Culture gave rise, at the time of its inception, to enthusiasm and to a desire to stand out from the crowd, as well as to the awareness that culture is a valuable asset."
"For a decade now, the Commission and Parliament have been trying to inject a new dynamic into the project, but they have gone about it using the same resources that are crippling the European project in general."
"Instead of rebuilding the initial enthusiasm, with citizens who were supposed to identify with the project, the Commission and Parliament are setting themselves up as judges."
"With my amendments, my proposal was to give the Member States the task of designating the European Capital of Culture according to their own criteria."
"That would have encouraged them to shoulder their responsibilities."
"Instead of strengthening subsidiarity in order to construct the European identity, an identity that is founded on our diversity, the institutions are now acting as project managers: they dictate, make selections and judge, without, for all that, bearing the cost of their decisions, since the European Union’s financial contribution remains small."
"Bureaucracy rises like a rampart between local initiatives and, Commissioner, I can only hope that future panels will be more conscientious than those who judged the Luxembourg 2007 project without even all being present and without being informed about the plan to extend to the Great Region and without realising that Luxembourg’s proposal to choose Sibiu in Romania as a partner town was to become so innovative."
"Culture amounts to more than just publicity events."
"The Capital of Culture project should be more than a long firework display of events and, in order to ensure continuity, I proposed to link with the consultations a network of Capitals of Culture to be organised with the support of the Commission."
"Instead of that we are now witnessing the parody of a network that jumbles together some of those that have been legitimately appointed with those who have assumed this title for themselves."
"It is time we finally protected the title of the European Capital of Culture."
"Mr President, needless to say I totally disagree with the previous speaker, with all respect."
"I wish to congratulate Mrs Prets on a thorough and carefully set out report."
"It is universally recognised that the programme of the European City of Culture, or European Capital of Culture as it was later renamed, is a well-tried and very useful concept and much credit must be given to those who set it up back in the mid-1980s, especially to the then Greek Culture Minister, Melina Mercouri."
"She was indeed an inspirational and talented woman who, in her stormy life, fought courageously for democracy and for the promotion of European unity through culture."
"Programmes such as the one we are discussing tonight indisputably help bring European citizens closer together and strengthen the bonds between them."
"They help promote understanding amongst our people and increase the appreciation of and respect for each others’ diverse but unifying cultural history."
"Over the years some problematic areas have been identified and this Commission proposal, which will eventually be amended by Parliament, will no doubt improve and enhance the programme further."
"Hopefully, in speaking in what is for me a foreign language – English – I am assisting in unifying our European aspiration to have a common language of communication some time in the future."
"On the basis of the experience gained in the 20 years that the programme has been in operation, and due to changes necessitated by the recent enlargement, a review is now urgently needed."
"Two of the main alterations necessary are improvements in the selection procedure to be followed and putting a system in place that will ensure that once a city is chosen, a well-planned programme will be carried out successfully."
"I would like to highlight the wisdom of two innovations of the proposal: the pairing-up system and the prize."
"I do not have time to go into detail. I once again congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report."
"In a culturally and ethnically diverse Europe, it is very important that we build bridges between nations."
"Our guiding principle must be, and must continue to be, to preserve our own culture and to become acquainted with the cultural riches of other nations."
"Culture is the most unobtrusive and effective link that binds nations who want to live in peace and mutual cooperation."
"The European Capital of Culture makes such a link possible."
"At the same time, it also offers an opportunity to many host cities for greater investment in cultural facilities and projects, with long–term positive effects on the economy."
"This project also encourages citizens to become culturally involved and to familiarise themselves with culture in all its dimensions."
"I also welcome the proposal for a prize to be awarded if a city meets the criteria for the European Capital of Culture, as previous organisers have, in many cases, complained about a lack of resources, as the European Union allocated these only after the report had been submitted."
"Our total commitment represents only a fraction of the contribution compared to the amounts invested in European Capitals of Culture by local communities, the Member States concerned or the private sector."
"For this reason, we must not complicate the process of raising funds with demanding administrative procedures."
"Instead, we must make the job easier for the organisers, as that alone will contribute to a better relationship between citizens and European institutions."
"The proposal for a joint selection panel to nominate the capital city is also a good idea, because it takes more account of the international dimension, and there will be more opportunity for a fairer selection, because on a national level there is a greater chance of bias towards a particular city."
"Mr President, along with eight other European cities, my home city of Krakow, in Poland, was the European Capital of Culture for 2000."
"It was my pleasant duty to serve as Director of the European Capital of Culture programme at the time."
"I should like to state that the European Capitals of Culture programme is the most notable of the programmes emphasising the cultural unity of our continent."
"Furthermore, it is a programme that arose from the citizens’ initiative."
"It did not come about on the initiative of any institution such as the Commission or Parliament."
"Greece and Mrs Mercouri in particular deserve to be congratulated on the idea of finding a way to show what Europe is all about, and what the cultural unity of our continent actually means."
"In fact, it would be right and proper for this award to be named after Mrs Mercouri, who was then the Greek Minister for Culture, since this is what Greece and Mrs Mercouri deserve."
"How should the role of the European Commission be defined?"
"I am now addressing Commissioner Figeľ in particular."
"The Commission’s role should be to offer support and advice, to point out errors and counsel on appropriate measures to be taken."
"It ought not to get involved in administrative issues, as it is so prone to do."
"In particular, it should guard against such an approach in this instance, as the EUR 500 000 award is just 2% to 5% of the entire fund allocated for implementation of the European Capitals of Culture programme."
"Commissioner, a way must therefore be found to disseminate relevant information and support Internet sites and other publications."
"We need to learn the lessons of the successes and failures of former European Capitals of Culture."
"They are all part of the Association of European Capitals of Culture."
"Mr Figeľ, you are responsible for financing 25 networks, and the Association of European Capitals of Culture should be one of them, so as to ensure that services are available to the cities that are to play this important role in the near future."
". I think that the Capital of Culture programme is as popular in the field of culture as Erasmus is in the area of education."
"Both programmes are approximately 20 years old, and should we so wish, we could say much about the past and future of these programmes."
"I am convinced that not only the Committee but also Parliament is keen to make sure that the Capital of Culture programme becomes even better and more popular, and I believe that we are heading in that direction."
"I would only like to add that the fact that ten cities in Germany and eleven cities in Hungary are competing for the 2010 title reflects an interest, competitiveness and movement or dynamism in the field of culture and cultural heritage, which is good for the whole of Europe."
"I would like to thank you all and to say that we are actually doing many of the things that Mr Sonik has mentioned in the field of information, consultancy and assistance."
"We would also like to increase the value of the prize or financial aid to EUR 1.5 million."
"All this, however, depends on the outcome of tomorrow’s voting and on the discussions about the Financial Perspective."
"Having said that, I am convinced that this activity, this component of cultural cooperation, deserves significant support."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report promoting the value of culture within the European Union."
"As we work on new approaches it is important to bear in mind that the new Member States endured many kinds of pressure on their cultures during the Communist period."
"In addition, the variety and identity of these cultures was negated."
"Enabling such countries to become more involved in European Capital of Culture events is a unique opportunity to harness the unprecedented energy generated by societies in the so-called young democracies."
"I cannot fail to mention an outstanding candidate amongst the cities hoping to be named European Capital of Culture for 2010."
"I refer to the city of Goerlitz-Zgorzelec, where I had the good fortune to be brought up and educated."
"This is a most remarkable city, because despite its chequered history of cruel divisions, the people of Goerlitz-Zgorzelec have contrived to keep human, economic and especially cultural links alive."
"This city was marked by history and divided by the post-World War II border, but thanks to European Union activities it now has an opportunity to be reborn on the map of Europe."
"It stands to become a place where reconciliation, understanding and supranational and cultural cooperation operate at all levels."
"It is an example of how common interests and the will for dialogue can overcome divisions and resentment, which might have been deemed impossible."
"I commend this approach to all undertakings at European level, not just to cultural ones."
"The European City of Culture project’s important role and its mission are undeniable; it contributes to preserving the diversity and richness of European cultural heritage."
"It helps a great deal as regards learning about each other’s cultural traditions and values."
"Transparency, clarity, monitoring and best practices present the fundamental requirements of all types of selection procedures of the European Community and this should be carried out in the selection of European Capitals of Culture as well."
"I can only strongly support the inclusion of Bulgaria and Romania in the programme, giving way to the interest expressed by the two potential new Member States to take part in this action; given the symbolic importance of making them already feel a part of Europe and in order to further enrich our cultural values and diversity."
"The inclusion of the Cultural Month initiative in the project has the capacity to help people learn about other nations’ cultural heritage and to extend the project to a wider international level."
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"– the report (A6-0087/2006) by Mrs Doyle, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases (PE-CONS 3604/2006 – C6-0065/2006 – 2003/0189A(COD)) and"
"– the report (A6-0090/2006) by Mrs Doyle, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to emissions from air conditioning systems in motor vehicles and amending council Directive 70/156/EEC (PE-CONS 3605/2006 – C6-0066/2006 – 2003/0189B(COD))."
". Mr President, I should like to ask the Commission to take the floor first."
"I believe it has a statement that it wishes to put on the record, to which I would like to be in a position to reply."
". Mr President, I should like to pass on greetings from my colleague, Mr Dimas."
"Please allow me to introduce the position of the European Commission on this matter."
"First of all, I would like to express my appreciation to the delegation of Parliament that took part in the conciliation meeting with the Council on 31 January."
"In particular I would like to express my thanks to Vice-President Trakatellis and to the rapporteur, Mrs Doyle, and to congratulate them on the outcome."
"The discussions in the Conciliation Committee were constructive and the final outcome on key issues – such as standards for containment, labelling, placing on the market, promotion of alternatives, as well as on a number of other important topics – is satisfactory."
"The Commission can therefore support the conciliation text and I would encourage Parliament to endorse the very good result obtained by its negotiating team."
"I believe that the regulation on F-gases, as well as the directive on mobile air conditioners in cars, will make a significant contribution to the EU’s fight against climate change and to our efforts to achieve our Kyoto emission reduction target."
"The Commission estimates that the legislation that we are discussing today will, by 2012, cut emissions of fluorinated gases by some 20 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually."
"That implies a reduction of 20% compared to 1995."
"In the absence of measures, emissions of fluorinated gases would have risen by 50% in the same period."
"From 2020, when all measures will be fully implemented, the effect will be a reduction of 40-50 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent."
"EU climate policy builds on close cooperation between the Commission and Member States."
"Only through common and combined action, at European and at national level, will the European Union be effective in reducing its emissions of greenhouse gases."
"The Commission therefore welcomes measures taken by Member States to reduce national emissions in order to meet their burden-sharing target."
"In that context, however, the Commission’s responsibility is to preserve any right it might have to ensure that all actions carried out to reduce emissions of F-gases are compatible with the Treaty."
"That is why the Commission should like issue the following declaration on the question of stricter national measures:"
"‘The Commission notes the agreement between the European Parliament and the Council on the insertion in the regulation of a provision allowing Member States to maintain, until 2012, more stringent national measures compared to those laid down in the regulation, should these measures be adopted before 31 December 2005."
"It results from the Treaty that if, after the adoption of a harmonised measure, a Member State considers it necessary to maintain national measures that are justified by important requirements specified in Article 30 of the EC Treaty, or relating to the protection of the environment or of the working environment, this Member State notifies them to the Commission, indicating the reasons for their maintenance."
"Additionally, the Treaty specifies the rules for the acceptance or rejection of these measures by the Commission."
"The Commission is therefore obliged to reserve its position on this issue, including any right it may have under the Treaty.’"
"Once again, I thank Parliament for its open and constructive approach on the F-gases package."
"The outcome is strong and effective legislation, which, once again, demonstrates the European Union’s capacity to match its words with concrete deeds in its climate policy."
". Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for accepting my invitation for him to lead off in the debate tonight, because I have concerns about the declaration he has just put on the record and I will be reverting to it during the debate, as, I suspect, will other colleagues too."
"This legislation is a fascinating case study for anyone interested in the institutional decision-making processes of the European Parliament."
"Firstly, I wish to thank all my colleagues, in particular the shadow rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, for the cooperation we had during a long and difficult enough debate at times."
"Fluorinated gases were introduced in the nineties to replace the ozone-depleting CFCs and HCFCs."
"They are used in all sorts of applications, some essential, others less so: in insulating foams, in aerosols, in refrigeration and air conditioning systems; in fire protection equipment and switchgear and even in the soles of ‘air-tech’ jogging shoes, as well as, of course, in double-glazed windows."
"The list is very long."
"As the debate on climate change developed following the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the harmful impact of these fluorinated gases, owing to their high global warming potential – GWP – came to be recognised as a major contributor – up to 5% and rising – to the greenhouse effect."
"Not only do these gases have high GWPs, the most potent – sulphur hexafluoride or SF6 – has a GWP of almost 24 000 times that of CO2, the most common greenhouse gas."
"They also have very long half-lives."
"If no measures are taken, the Commission estimates that emissions of fluorinated gases will be 50% above the 1995 levels by 2010."
"Others would cite a much higher figure."
"With the measures agreed in this package of legislation, they will be reduced by more than 20% from the 1995 levels by 2012."
"Of the six greenhouse gases listed in the annex to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, three of them are fluorinated gases."
"In all, the current legislation encourages a reduction in emissions of 25 fluorinated gases – hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride – through containment, responsible use, recovery, destruction and disposal."
"The aim of the legislation is to enable Member States to meet their Kyoto targets by containing the leakage and restricting the use of fluorinated gases."
"Whereas the original Commission draft proposal was in the form of one regulation with a single market legal base, namely Article 95, the Council reached a common position which took the form of two separate texts: a directive based on Article 95 and a regulation based on a dual legal base consisting of Articles 175 and 95."
"The rationale for the split of the Commission’s original proposal into two different texts, suggested by the European Parliament at its first reading, was to move all the requirements relating to emissions from air conditioning in motor vehicles from the proposed regulation to Framework Directive 70/156/EEC on the type-approval of motor vehicles."
"The proposed regulation would then focus on the remaining statutory applications."
"So, having chopped it in two and taken the highly dubious step of dividing the regulation between two legal bases – the main thrust being environment, with some ancillary provisions grounded on the single market legal base – the Council handed the baton back to Parliament."
"In the second reading in Parliament, there was no definitive resolution on the crucial vexed issue of the dual legal base of the regulation, which was retained."
"My proposal, as rapporteur, to adopt a single environment-linked legal base as the only means of achieving legal certainty, did not obtain the required qualified majority."
"Amendments were adopted, however, which attempted to underline the fact that stricter national measures are allowed under single market measures, provided they are proportionate, non-discriminatory and not purely economic in nature. Article 176 of the Treaty explains this mechanism relating to the environment or the Article 175 laws."
"This outcome created great uncertainty for a number of reasons."
"Firstly, there was the matter of general principle that, in the interests of promoting better, simpler and clearer legislation, the introduction of an unevenly weighted, dual legal basis represents a dangerous direction and precedent in European policy-making."
"Secondly, there is the ECJ’s consistent case-law according to which there should be a sole legal base which reflects the preponderant purpose or the centre of gravity of the legislation."
"The centre of gravity of this regulation is indisputably environmental protection, which would warrant an environment base – an approach of minimum harmonisation."
"Finally, there was the unresolved question as to whether the Member States that already have more ambitious legislation in force – notably Austria and Denmark – would be allowed to keep those measures, or whether the EU would force them to lower their environmental standards in an area of combating climate change at a time when there are already difficulties in meeting Kyoto targets to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases."
"Given the implacable divisions within the Council on this final issue of stricter national measures for certain Member States, a third reading in conciliation was inevitable."
"After many exhaustive weeks of informatory preparatory work and meetings, the Conciliation Committee reached agreement on a joint text for the regulation concerning certain fluorinated greenhouse gases – f-gases – on 31 January 2006, which addressed the main points of disagreement between Parliament and the Council, which are namely: the possibility for the Member States to keep or introduce national measures stricter than those foreseen by the regulation; technical provisions regarding f-gas containment; reporting and review of the regulation; definition of placing on the market; cross-border transport or shipment of f-gases for recovery; labelling; notification of measures introducing further bans on f-gases; and the area of training and certification."
"However, the key point that I want to refer to again is the issue of stricter national measures."
"Important for encouraging an environmental race to the top was the agreement on the general principle that Member States can maintain or introduce stricter national measures in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty."
"In the specific case of the existing national measures in Denmark and Austria, against which the Commission has been considering legal action, a safeguard clause was introduced which would allow the two Member States to keep their legislation until 31 December 2012."
"Both countries already have strict legislation on f-gases in place – since the 1970s in the case of Denmark – and they view it as a key measure in their policy mix to achieve their Kyoto climate change targets."
"I believe the legislation now agreed and awaiting final sanction by our colleagues in this Parliament tomorrow strikes an equitable balance between environmental protection and single market concerns."
"It reaffirms the European Community’s commitment to reducing climate change and will provide a considerable stimulus to the development of new environmental technologies, thus contributing to our Lisbon Agenda knowledge economy goals."
"It will do so in a measured, sensible and proportionate way that recognises certain critical uses for these gases, which, we must not forget, can be useful in certain circumstances for the very reason that they are excellent insulators."
"Electrical or electronic switch gear, amongst other vital uses, will continue to use f-gases in a contained environment."
"There is no better or more suitable substitute in that case, and that must be the test."
"The conciliation compromise was welcomed by the three institutions, by myself, by my European Parliament colleagues, by Minister Pröll, on behalf of the European Council, and by the Environment Commissioner, Mr Dimas."
"It was the only equitable and honourable outcome."
"To quote directly, Commissioner Dimas welcomed the agreement as ‘a clear and positive political signal’ but alluded to the fact that the Commission would later decide whether to issue a declaration on the record when the legislation was finally adopted, as it is scheduled to be tomorrow."
"I should like to lay down a marker in relation to the declaration we have just heard from Commissioner Figeľ, speaking on behalf of Commissioner Dimas."
"In the laborious process of negotiating this legislation, it was the clear intention of the legislators – Parliament and the Council – to provide for the widest possible interpretation of the powers for environmental measures to be taken on the basis of a single market legal base."
"I strenuously reject any attempt by the Commission to construe the terms of that legal base so as to narrowly confine it to Article 95(4), which outlines a prior notification procedure."
"Such a declaration represents a misinterpretation of the outcome of conciliation, where there was a clear if implicit intention to allow stricter national measures on the basis of Article 95(10)."
"While any declaration from the Commission in this context is non-binding, it may play a role in the purpose of interpretation of the ECJ on this subject, if perchance this legislation, which has already spanned two legislatures, gets a fourth reading at the Court in Luxembourg, as was my concern from the start."
"Tonight I want to make it clear that the principal aims of this regulation – to cut our emissions of fluorinated gases – should be respected and adhered to in the fullest sense."
"I regret the fact that the Commission has not to date made the gesture of withdrawing its letter of formal notice to the Danish Government."
"I would urge Commissioner Figeľ to put on the record tonight the Commission’s intention of doing so as soon as possible."
"The directive on air conditioning systems in motor vehicles was the second arm of the package of the two proposals to emerge from the Council’s first reading on the recommendation of my predecessor as rapporteur, Mr Goodwill."
"I welcome the pioneering decision to introduce a phased ban on fluorinated gases with a global warming potential of more than 150 times the potency of carbon dioxide in motor vehicles."
"This ban will apply to new vehicle types in 2011 and to all new vehicles in 2017."
"Bringing the measure into line with the long-established vehicle type approval system will also maintain the competitiveness and ensure the compliance of European car manufacturers."
"The risk threshold will eliminate the main air conditioning gas currently in use and it will allow less harmful gases to be used instead."
"In practice, most vehicle producers are likely to introduce carbon-dioxide-based systems."
"But the important point is that we are allowing the development of these new systems without being technology prescriptive and without infringing our obligations under the WTO."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Doyle."
"Her statement showed how vigorously she has fought, both in committee and in plenary, for this issue, which is of particular importance for Austria and Denmark, because we are the two Member States with stricter regulations in this area."
"Above all, we have shown that it is possible to have stricter regulations without causing economic damage."
"I therefore have to ask the Commission why it has once again tried, in its declaration, to pull the plug on European unity."
"Environmental policy and popular satisfaction are united, and we in Europe are united."
"The Commission's attitude therefore greatly surprises me, because we successfully concluded a conciliation procedure between the Council and Parliament."
"The joint draft of the European Parliament and of the Council, which was approved by the Conciliation Committee on 31 January 2006, provides that Member States may retain national requirements stricter than those foreseen by the Regulation until the end of 2012."
"The additional paragraph 3 in Article 9 gives the Member States, and in particular Austria and Denmark, the option of retaining their existing further-reaching bans on the placing on the market of fluorinated gases."
"If such a safeguard clause was not introduced, the Member States would have to revoke the existing bans that go beyond those in Annex II to the regulation, or have them approved by the Commission."
"Under Article 95(10) of the EC Treaty, harmonisation measures such as the regulation on these fluorinated greenhouse gases may include a safeguard clause temporarily authorising the Member States to take different measures."
"This authorisation has to be granted pursuant to the process laid down in the regulation and in the form prescribed there."
"Despite this, however, the Commission does not refer, in its declaration regarding Article 9(3), to the process laid down in the regulation, but repeats the wording of Article 95(4), according to which the stricter national provisions – which, moreover, are justified by recent scientific findings – must be notified to the Commission for approval."
"I think that this clearly goes too far and does not correspond to what the Council and Parliament agreed."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to express warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Doyle, who has given the initial impetus in several important areas in order to keep the environmental quality of these proposals intact."
"I look back with pleasure on her tenacity during the trialogues."
"We have a result we can be proud of."
"Tomorrow, we will have achieved two milestones permanently, or at least, that is what I thought before we heard the statement."
"A first milestone has been achieved in the area of climate policy."
"There is broad consensus here in this House that we must take climate change seriously."
"Measures are needed urgently in order to reduce the level of greenhouse gases."
"The curtailment of f-gases constitutes a major step."
"F-gases are potent greenhouse gases that are used in all kinds of products, including air-conditioning and cooling systems, fire extinguishers, foam used in the construction industry and even in the soles of shoes."
"It is good that Parliament and the Council have drawn a clear line."
"Greenhouse gases must be reduced as much as possible."
"Innovation is important, and that is how global warming is decelerated."
"The second milestone is of major importance politically, namely the internal market."
"We made our views clear at first reading."
"Instead of the internal market legal base, we opted for the environment-linked legal base."
"This was warmly supported by a majority in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"The reason is that a number of countries had taken further measures off their own bats."
"With regard to the internal market legal base, Austria and Denmark were at risk of having to withdraw their more extensive measures, which is really unacceptable."
"The internal market should maintain a high level of environmental protection."
"If that is not the case, it should be possible for the Member States to take more extensive measures."
"Europe is not there to impose changes for the worse on the Member States, or to deny the Member States the scope to adopt decent environmental policy."
"We have managed to drive this message home at least."
"It is Parliament’s and the Council’s wish for Member States to be able to take more extensive measures."
"The Commission must, of course, closely monitor the situation and ensure that the restrictions of market access are proportionate."
"Commissioner, in all honesty, I find your statement lamentably insubstantial."
"I had at least expected you to have shown the political will to give Member States wishing to take those more extensive measures all the leg-room they need."
"It was really unnecessary to read out Article 95, with which we are all familiar, and we actually expect the political will from you to grant Member States this leg-room."
"This is what is desperately needed, because innovation is important for climate policy, but ultimately also for our economy and for the Lisbon agenda."
"So in that respect, I would like to see you withdraw the statement you made a moment ago."
"I think that we have not heard the last of this."
"Mr President, I shall begin by thanking Parliament’s rapporteur, Mrs Doyle, who has done a sterling piece of work on this matter."
"It has been a genuine pleasure to be a member of the conciliation delegation."
"On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe I should like to offer my sincere thanks for the constructive cooperation."
"The outcome achieved by the conciliation committee is a victory for the European environment and for the people of Europe."
"Consideration has been given to countries such as Denmark and Austria, which have taken the ban on fluorinated gases further, and other countries can follow their lead."
"This proves that the EU puts the environment before everything else."
"When, tomorrow, the European Parliament adopts the conciliation committee’s document by what I hope will be a very large majority, I assume that Environment Commissioner Mr Dimas will take the opportunity to withdraw the Commission’s letter of formal notice addressed to Denmark."
"That should be a natural consequence of this new statutory text."
"Now that the Community legislation has been changed, there will be no basis for taking legal proceedings against Denmark at the European Court of Justice."
"It was depressing to hear in the corridors that the Commission’s legal service has refused to accept the outcome of the conciliation or has tried to misinterpret it."
"Allow me to remind the Commission that it would be quite unprecedented and completely unacceptable if the new Community legislation were not administered by the Commission. It would also be detrimental to cooperation with, and confidence in, the Commission."
"The Council and the European Parliament have approved the agreement and the content of the conciliation document."
"The Commission was a party to the agreement of 31 January 2006 and is therefore partly responsible for it."
"I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to withdraw the letter of formal notice addressed to Denmark following tomorrow’s vote when a large majority of Parliament has voted in favour of the document."
"Anything else would be unacceptable in terms of future cooperation."
". Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Doyle for her excellent collaboration and for being so willing to try to find compromises on which we could all agree."
"But having said that, while my Group can live with the directive on mobile air-conditioning – although in our view it is still too weak – we cannot accept the results of the conciliation on the regulation on F-gases, in spite of Mrs Doyle's good offices to try to get a better deal, but which ultimately failed."
"The European institutions like to pride themselves on their international leadership in terms of policy on climate change, the greatest threat we face, and yet this regulation is a tragedy of missed opportunity and sets back the potential of our climate policy by decades."
"We are talking about gases that have enormous global warming potential."
"They include sulphur hexafluoride, which is over 23 000 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and yet will still be permitted in some applications."
"Yet what we have in front of us is a regulation with a legal base that casts doubt on the ongoing right of Austria and Denmark to keep their stricter national laws beyond six years and that will actively work against the ability of other Member States to adopt them."
"We have a regulation that fails to recognise the fact that alternatives already exist for most F-gas applications, that fails to promote substitution and that will set back the introduction of safe and innovative alternatives for years, not just in the European Union but in the developing world as well, where F-gas emissions are predicted to grow enormously over the next few decades."
"We have a regulation that represents a shameful capitulation to the F-gas industry."
"So I repeat again the question that others have raised: Would the Commission clarify once and for all whether it will drop the proceedings against Austria and Denmark?"
"At the very beginning of February my colleagues and I wrote to Commissioner Dimas to ask this question."
"We have still not received a response."
"This is unacceptable and the proceedings should be dropped immediately."
"Mr President, our group did not vote in favour of this compromise in the conciliation committee, and we shall not vote in favour of it in plenary tomorrow."
"We are not satisfied with the content, and we are definitely not satisfied with the legal basis."
"That is not a criticism of the rapporteur."
"We believe that Mrs Doyle has done the best she possibly could in a difficult situation and has tried to go as far as humanly possible in claiming the right to retain and to introduce better environmental requirements."
"Given, however, the very weak position in which she found herself following Parliament’s second reading, she was unable to achieve the only reasonable objective, namely that of having environmental Article 175 adopted as the only legal basis."
"For us, the only acceptable outcome is for environmental legislation to be allowed to be precisely that."
"We see two problems with this compromise."
"The first problem is that, in our view, larger steps could have been taken where various parts of it were concerned."
"More rapid progress can be made in abolishing these very dangerous greenhouse gases."
"The most serious consideration of all, however, is that there is now an active risk of putting obstacles in the way of countries that want to tighten up their national legislation in this area."
"This situation violates the spirit of the Kyoto Protocol and could be an obstacle to countries that wish to combat climate change which, as we all know, is the most serious environmental threat we face."
"Where Denmark and Austria are concerned, they are to be given a guarantee up until the year 2012, whereupon the guarantee will come to an end."
"We shall then not know what is to happen, and there will again be a danger of these countries actively being forced to curb the legislation they already have."
"Where other countries are concerned, there would in actual fact be an end to reform if the Commission does not take a different decision."
"This situation is completely unacceptable."
"It also means that countries within the EU will have difficulty producing new technology – which is precisely what this document says they should be doing – with a view to taking the lead by banning dangerous gases and forcing alternatives to be produced using just such new technology."
"By their action, the Council and the Commission are preventing new technology from being produced."
"In our debates, we usually agree on the seriousness of climate issues, and we usually agree with the researchers’ reports we see, saying that the situation is more serious than we believed a few years ago."
"Then comes this statement from the Commission, showing that it has learned nothing about climate issues."
"What you are saying is that the market remains more important than the environment."
"Companies’ right to sell dangerous gases is more important than political opportunities to combat the greenhouse effect and climate change."
"It is remarkable that such a thing can be said in 2006."
"Mr President, I have some really good news: the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, and the Vice-President, Mr Verheugen, have today promised to withdraw the three extant letters of formal notice concerning fluorinated gases."
"The Commission will thus be a party to the compromise reached between the Council and Parliament in the conciliation procedure."
"The undertaking is particularly gratifying because the Commission had adopted a declaration, reserving to itself the right to declare the Austrian and Danish bans on fluorinated gases unlawful."
"The declaration was a provocation, which we can now put to one side."
"I should like to thank Mr Barroso and Mr Verheugen for their personal support in this matter, and I should also like to thank the President of the European Council, Mr Schüssel, who has offered his personal support in relation to a matter that was initially dropped by the Council of Ministers when Austria took over the Presidency."
"There are also, in fact, reasons for thanking ourselves here in this Chamber, because we voted in favour of the much discussed Amendment 45, which made the victory possible."
"By means of amendments we shall turn the decision concerning fluorinated gases into a minimal rule in which countries are given permission to go further in protecting our common climate."
"Three hundred and sixty-seven votes are needed if we elected representatives are to have real influence, and we obtained 370."
"We therefore owe the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Mr Florenz, and the rapporteur, Mrs Doyle a considerable debt of gratitude because they stood firm in their support for minimal rules, even though they were exposed to heavy pressure, including from their own group."
"I also wish especially to congratulate those responsible for now creating a clear precedent for our being able to introduce minimal rules, even when the legal base is the internal market’s provisions."
"We are obtaining a greater number of possible ways of taking account of security, health, the environment, the working environment, consumer protection and animal welfare, and we are moving a step away from regimentation and from what is referred to as total harmonisation."
"I hope that this will not be an isolated development but, on the contrary, will herald a new direction for European cooperation."
"People will thank us if, by means of majority decisions, we secure a common level of protection and, at the same time, give countries permission to be pioneers."
"In this way, everyone will sense that progress has been made."
"Danes and Austrians will be quite uncomprehending if the Commission makes its efforts to combat climate change a political priority and, at the same time, punishes Denmark and Austria for making a special effort."
"Mr Verheugen, Mr Dimas and Mr Barroso would be uncomprehending, too."
"The Eurocrats in the departments of the Commission have now hopefully been put in their place."
"We representatives of the people have made a difference, and we can be proud of our joint efforts."
"The next task must, of course, be that of convincing all the countries that there are technical alternatives, so that we might obtain a common EU ban on fluorinated gases, preferably before 2012 when the Kyoto Agreement is to be renewed in a spirit of consideration for future generations."
"I hope that Mr Barroso and Mr Verheugen will firmly resist those who are trying to drag them down into the mud."
"Mr President, I must thank my colleague, Mrs Doyle, for her role as Parliament’s conciliator in this demanding regulation and directive package."
"The regulation and directive before us are both important steps in our objective to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"From experience I know that heading the conciliation process is an exacting task that makes great demands on the rapporteur."
"Fluorinated greenhouse gases are one example of how difficult it is to solve environmental problems."
"You solve one and new ones can easily come along to take its place."
"When at one time we switched to using fluorinated hydrocarbons in cooling systems, aerosols and other applications, we succeeded in dramatically reducing the use of chlorofluoride hydrocarbons, which make the ozone layer thinner."
"The Montreal Protocol was an attempt to phase out CFCs, as these gases are harmful to stratospheric ozone."
"That was a good thing, but agents that make the ozone layer thinner were replaced by powerful greenhouse gases."
"Their potential for global warming is 100 or even 1 000 times greater than carbon dioxide, and the time the gases take to disperse into the atmosphere can be very long indeed."
"Fluorinated gases account for at least 5% of the greenhouse phenomenon."
"This is why the threat of climate change means we need to cut down on the use of fluorinated hydrocarbons."
"The text for a regulation now adopted by the Conciliation Committee will encourage the continued development of alternative technologies and the adoption of existing technologies, nevertheless making possible sustainable operational models to achieve the objective."
"Hopefully, we are now wiser than we used to be and will continue to be better able to predict the possible dangers of alternative solutions."
"One of the biggest problems with the regulation under discussion was its legal basis."
"I hope that the two legal bases now chosen will prove, despite everything, to be a workable compromise and will not cause problems of overlap."
"At the time, I voted for one legal basis, Article 95, but with the highest standards."
"I have always wondered why environmental grounds are always automatically thought to be more environmentally friendly, while those for the internal market are branded as being in the interests of industry."
"It would be in the environment’s best interests to combine a harmonised market with ambitious targets."
"Only then would there be a proper incentive for our industry to compete on a level playing field in an environmentally friendly way."
"– Mr President, in the discussions prior to Austria's accession to the European Union, one of the main arguments put forward by those opposed to accession was the danger that environmental standards would fall."
"We are now faced with a tragic example of this."
"Greenhouse gases are currently on the agenda, and the effects of climate change can be seen in the news, in the form of the floods in Germany and Austria."
"Climate protection really must be our absolute top priority, particularly now."
"What do you imagine interested citizens think of you when you give free rein to greenhouse gases in the name of the internal market?"
"Austria and Denmark have acted consistently."
"The economies of those countries were flexible enough to adapt and to deliver the goods."
"Do you now want to protect the dinosaurs of the market, who do not want to move, from those who were lively enough to change?"
"I call on you to rectify this error."
"Given the dangers now facing the global climate, penalising the pioneers of environmental protection is completely absurd."
"– Mr President, at the end of the debate you are now getting a hefty dose of Austrian contributions."
"Austria may well, unfortunately, not always be a model pupil when it comes to environmental policy, but on the issue of fluorinated greenhouse gases we have stricter measures than were proposed in the package of harmonised legislation."
"In my view, the European Union has two choices: either we harmonise at a high, ambitious level, or we continue to allow the Member States to retain their stricter, more ambitious targets and measures."
"Austria and Denmark – as has frequently been mentioned, including, commendably, by the rapporteur, who has continually defended this position – have laid down general bans on the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases."
"Experience in those countries has shown that there are alternatives to these gases."
"The draft approved by the Conciliation Committee at the end of January provides that Member States may retain stricter national requirements until 2012."
"This step is possible under Article 95(10) of the Treaty – the 'safeguard clause', which allows stricter measures to be retained temporarily."
"The European Parliament and the Council have agreed on such a safeguard clause."
"This ensures – at least for the time being – that Austria and Denmark can continue to apply their stricter regulations."
"It also means that the scientific evidence referred to in Article 95(4) need not be provided."
"I am pleased that Mr Bonde obviously has access to more recent information according to which there is a better declaration from the Commission."
"The statement we got from the Commissioner at the start of this debate was not satisfactory."
"That, too, has been stressed in a number of contributions."
"I also call on the Commission to take note of the attitude of Parliament and the Council and to give the Member States the necessary room for manoeuvre."
"Mr President, I had actually intended to make a different speech but, having heard the debate in this House, I must thank Mrs Doyle for her splendid contribution."
"I cannot, however, in any way see how her efforts might bear fruit, as the Commission is expressly saying that only those countries that have more stringent rules now may be given permission to stick to those rules."
"There is nothing about countries being able to go further and no assurance of Denmark being able to go further."
"When I think of the zeal with which Mrs Doyle’s proposal at second reading was fought against, I do not understand from where Mr Bonde, Mr Busk and the others derive their optimism."
"There are no reassuring signals."
"We are faced here with a proposal that is an affront to all constructive forces working in favour of the environment."
"There is, in fact, such a thing as substitution."
"Alternatives do exist."
"We have efficient refrigerators in Denmark and Austria, yet the choice has been made to defer to the fluorinated gases industry instead of to the environment."
"I cannot see anything in the Commission’s pronouncement that goes any way at all towards pledging anything more constructive."
"It is therefore exclusively Mrs Doyle whom I shall thank for her splendid but, it has to be said, entirely fruitless efforts."
"Mr President, I too wish to thank Mrs Doyle for taking such a heroic stance in this Assembly."
"The Council and the Commission have defended old, outmoded technology in the internal market instead of defending the climate."
"History will not be kind in judging such action."
"For example, why are we not banning fluorinated greenhouse gases in the refrigerators sold to consumers? Ninety per cent of the market is already free from fluorinated greenhouse gases."
"It is an extremely straightforward matter simply to decide to ban them."
"Why do we allow sulphur hexachloride, which does 23 000 times more damage to the climate than carbon dioxide?"
"The only way of obtaining an alternative is, of course, to set a time limit, whereupon research would come up with the right alternatives."
"Moreover, there are now already a number of alternatives."
"There must be a typing error in the Commission’s speech, because I would have thought you would very happily have looked forward to countries’ introducing more stringent legislation in order to achieve the Kyoto objectives."
"I can only assume that there is a typing error in the speech, for the Commission surely cannot be responsible for such an outmoded and old-fashioned policy."
". Mr President, would it be in order for the Commissioner to respond now to some of the points that were made?"
"I know it is very late and we are testing your patience."
"If not, it will come up tomorrow before the vote."
"I would also like to make a request on the record now, so the message gets through, that we will be calling on the Austrian Presidency to comment tomorrow on this specifically."
"Would the powers that be send the message, so there is no misunderstanding: tomorrow we would like them present."
"Apart from having the Presidency, it is a particularly important case for Austria."
"There were many important points put directly to Commissioner Figel';"
"I should be delighted if he would respond to them."
"There is a lot of unhappiness here about the Commission declaration."
"The Council will be here tomorrow."
"The Commissioner may respond today."
"As far as I am aware, Commissioner Dimas will be here tomorrow."
"Commissioner Figeľ, would you like to add anything?"
". Mr President, I can give the assurance that we believe that sustainability is not only a Treaty principle but also the most important principle, individually and socially, in building economic progress with social and environmental responsibility."
"I say that as a Member of the Commission and as a father and politician, not just because I am replacing my colleague Mr Dimas."
"What is not environmentally friendly is not economically sound."
"You can be confident that we mean it."
"As to the question on the declaration, I am not in a position to withdraw the declaration, which I delivered on behalf of the European Commission, but I can assure you that the adoption of the new legal status – the vote on the conciliation text – will have an impact on the pending cases, which have been mentioned repeatedly."
"We will revisit or re-examine these cases in the light of this new situation – the outcome of conciliation – especially as we will have new Community legislation in this area."
"That is all I can say at the moment."
"."
"Mr President, there was a particular charge, that I think needs answering, that the Commission’s Legal Service is working behind the scenes to undermine the conciliation decision."
"Is that true?"
"Is there a difference between DG Enterprise and DG Environment on this issue, and has DG Enterprise won the battle?"
". I know of no differences."
"I only know the Commission’s position, which I have defended or stated here."
"We will continue in accordance with it. It is important that you take the Commission’s position into account, not corridors, messages or signals."
"I do not know about them."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"I would like to begin today’s sitting by welcoming Mr Alexander Milinkevich, democratic opposition leader and Belorussian presidential candidate, most warmly, on my own behalf and on behalf of all of the Members of the European Parliament."
"Mr Milinkevich, as leader of the unified opposition, you had the courage to stand for the presidential elections held recently in Belarus, which were seen by our Parliament as in no way democratic."
"The European Parliament admires your courage and the perseverance that you showed both during and after the election campaign, and would like to express its full solidarity with you, your fellow countrymen and your country."
"Europe will not be fully democratic until Belarus is a free country."
"You may rest assured that the European Parliament will continue to support human rights and democracy in your country."
"You can see that certain Members of Parliament are wearing scarves bearing colours intended to express this support visually and I must tell you that, thanks to the reform that we promoted recently and which is now in force, the President can allow the presence of these external symbols. Under the previous Rules of Procedure, the President would have had to demand that they be removed."
"We should therefore be pleased with the reform of the Rules of Procedure and you will note that sometimes the Presidency’s initiatives are positive."
"We shall now proceed to the item on the state of progress of the negotiations of the financial perspective."
"In relation to this issue, I would like briefly to inform the House that our negotiating team, chaired by Mr Lewandowski, reached an agreement with the representatives of the Commission and the Council."
"As you know, Parliament had proposed quantitative and qualitative objectives for the financial perspective. On the one hand, an increase in global resources and, on the other, a better structure and better ways of executing the budget."
"With regard to the position of the Council in December, the ceiling has been increased by EUR four billion in fresh money, which will be added to the resources of certain programmes which had been severely cut, in particular Erasmus, life-long learning programmes, innovation and assistance for small and medium-sized businesses."
"An increase in the reserves of the European Investment Bank of EUR 2.5 billion is being added to those additional resources, in order to fund programmes to promote research and development, transport networks and aid to small companies."
"The flexibility instrument maintains the sum for the current period, two hundred million per year, but with the possibility of unused resources being transferred to the next two financial years."
"That is the summary of the agreement reached yesterday, but I am sure that our rapporteur, Mr Böge, will be able to present that agreement more fully."
"The political groups will have the opportunity to assess the agreement in our debate."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will admit it openly; I am not satisfied with the outcome."
"If you look at the detailed analysis of the Financial Perspective for the enlarged EU that the temporary committee has worked to produce, you will realise that even this result leaves out some of the things we urgently need in order to add European value or means that others will have to be worked on over the next seven years."
"Even so, let me say that, under the prevailing conditions under which we had to work, everyone involved went to the very limit of what could be expected of them in finding a long-term solution to the Financial Perspective and an inter-institutional agreement."
"The President was quite right to point out that Parliament’s concern has not been merely with figures; it has also been interested in the qualitative aspects and in making a start on the reform of European budgetary policy, in new financial instruments, in the de-bureaucratisation of the whole procedure, and in guaranteeing parliament’s rights in the foreign policy instruments, as well as in the question of what part Parliament is to play in any potential review in 2008/2009."
"We have, then, within the bounds set by the inter-institutional agreement, by means of joint and unilateral statements, worked through the whole of this package of qualitative elements and reform projects, and we believe that we have done so adequately; we have, at any rate, in every respect taken a line that adds up to progress towards a qualitatively improved European budget policy."
"Bearing in mind our detailed knowledge of the programmes – for we have gone deeper in analysing them than the Council ever has – Parliament took the view that the figures we agreed on represented the absolute pain threshold, but if, for example, we have, in the sphere of lifelong learning or overall as regards competitiveness for growth and job creation, succeeded in getting an extra EUR 2.1 billion in order, for example, to send 40 000 more students on exchange within Europe, then our commitment to European added value has paid off."
"I would like to express my thanks to the whole negotiating team under Janusz Lewandowski’s chairmanship, to Mr Walter and Mr Mulder for their excellent cooperation and also to the group coordinators."
"It was only because we worked very much across group boundaries and as a close-knit and single-minded negotiating team that we managed to achieve this result at all, and for that I am most warmly appreciative."
". Mr President, I am very pleased to be here today to share with you my satisfaction with the agreement reached by negotiators from the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspectives."
"I would like, in particular, to congratulate Mr Böge, Mr Lewandowski, Mr Mulder and Mr Walter for their remarkable job, which I know was done under very difficult conditions."
"I would also like to thank Chancellor Schüssel and his Finance Minister, for their untiring efforts to reach an agreement."
"I have followed the negotiations very closely, determined to ensure that we reached a good agreement."
"I can tell you that I am proud of the role played by the Commission – namely by Commissioner Grybauskaitė – during the negotiations, which were very difficult."
"I truly believe that the outcome of those negotiations is clearly better than the agreement reached at the European Council."
"Knowing at first hand how hard it has been to get to this stage, I can honestly say that this is a success."
"It is good news for Europe because it means we now have the funds to match our ambitions for the development of the Union over the next seven years."
"We now have a clear financial framework to boost development of the ten new Member States that joined in 2004, and of the two new Member States still to come."
"I am particularly pleased that we will have increased funding for programmes directly related to the new Lisbon Agenda, namely, research, lifelong learning, trans-European networks, competitiveness and innovation."
"Almost EUR 50 billion will be available over the next seven years to enhance the research effort at Union level."
"Moreover, for the first time the agreement entails a joint effort with the European Investment Bank."
"European Investment Bank funds act as catalysts for public and private investors in research and technological development, as well as trans-European networks and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"There will also be significant increases in funding in the important area of justice and home affairs."
"Another of my priorities, as you will recall – it was the subject of my letters to the President-in-Office of the Council, and of some of my statements here in Parliament – was to secure additional funding for programmes that reach out to our citizens, such as culture, youth, health and consumer protection."
"That has now been achieved."
"That would not have been possible if we had not worked together to increase that funding after the agreement at the European Council."
"I have also taken note of the comments made on this matter just now by Mr Böge."
"Our spending on external actions will also increase, enabling us to continue to promote European values in the wider world."
"Thanks to that agreement, it will be possible to enhance substantially the Union’s common foreign and security policy."
"The agreement reached by the negotiators will now have to be endorsed by Parliament and the Council."
"We hope this happens without further delay."
"We have also worked hard to ensure that the future budget of the European Union will be based on principles of sound financial management."
"I also take very good note of what Mr Böge just said on that: it is not just about figures."
"Figures have increased, yes, but it is not just about figures, it is about transparency, it is about accountability, it is about the quality of the expenditure and the quality of the way we work together – Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"It is fair to say that the role of Parliament in the process has been strengthened and it will also play an important role in the review of the financial perspectives, which will be one of the top priorities in the coming years."
"I can confirm to you today something I have said on several occasions: as you know, we have been asked by the Council to come up with a proposal for a ‘review clause’ for the future of the financial perspectives and we want to work as closely as possible with Parliament on that matter."
"I know it was difficult."
"I know that not everybody is happy and nobody will be completely happy – let me say that the Commission is not completely happy – but it was once again a good demonstration of our commitment and our spirit of partnership, that is why I want warmly to congratulate all negotiators."
"I think we should celebrate this achievement and then move swiftly to build on the momentum created by this agreement to accelerate and complete the legislative process necessary to get all programmes up and running as from next year."
"We have no more time to lose."
". – Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the road here has been a long and difficult one, and without this Parliament we would not be where we are now."
"I recommend that all of us consider not only the national interest – or what we believe to be the national interest, but should consider the interests of the community, the interests of the European Union, of the Europe in which we share."
"Had that not been borne in mind, we would not have ended up with this result, to which our response is ‘yes, but’."
"As Mr Böge rightly said, we are of course not 100% satisfied, but we do know that no more could have been achieved."
"I would like to thank the Members of this House – Mr Lewandowski, who chaired the working party, Mr Böge, Mr Walter and Mr Mulder – for their efforts at persuasion."
"We can take pride in having had such a negotiating group to achieve this result."
"We have a high responsibility for the European Union, and that responsibility is not in the least to do with money; on the contrary, it is all about democracy, parliamentarianism, transparency and openness."
"It is about winning over the public to the cause of Europe, so that this Europe of ours may be convincing."
"That is why, when European funds are spent at the national level, we want the national authorities to share responsibility for this money being spent properly."
"Where there are deficits, they must not always be attributed to the European Union, for the national authorities must accept their share of responsibility for them."
"We insist on the European Parliament being given a say in, and responsibility for, reviewing the European Union’s outgoings in 2008/2009."
"Let me say, with all the emphasis I can muster, that there must be no repetition of the haggling that we have seen going on over recent weeks and months."
"This must be the last time that our negotiations should be so lacking in conviction."
"I agree strongly with the President of the European Council when he says that we have to give thought to how we endow the European Union with its own revenues that, rather than constituting a burden on the public, will result in Europe having sufficient resources, so let us work together to that end."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is less than we wanted, more than what many of us expected, and a victory for reason."
"There are a number of things laid down in the inter-institutional agreement to which I attach particular importance."
"First among them is the revision clause."
"In 2008-2009, we will be reviewing all the figures all over again."
"Those who are currently dissatisfied – dissatisfied, that is, with everything – should note that the consequence of this is that part of the process that has been set in motion by the change in the EU’s budget is a first step."
"The Commission has undertaken to submit proposals for the necessary next steps in respect of the revision clause to be taken in 2008/2009."
"What has been agreed is better financial management, and that is a vitally important step."
"It is quite essential that the resources at our disposal be actually spent and used effectively."
"Actually putting into effect the undertakings we have given each other and the agreements we have made with one another will be a great step forward."
"There is another great step forward that we have taken, and it has to do with the requirement that the Member States should now produce their own reports with evidence of what they have done with the resources, and – as Mr Poettering has just said – this represents the abandonment of the attitude that ‘success is national, but failure is in Brussels’."
"The Member States must now give an account of what use they and their authorities have actually made of the money."
"It is quite vital that that should have been agreed to."
"It has also proved possible to extract more money, and for that I want to take this opportunity to say: Thank you, Mr Böge, thank you, Mr Mulder, thank you, Mr Lewandowski, but I would also, and on behalf of my group, like to thank our colleague Mr Walter, who – as other members can testify – drove a hard bargain for our group in the closing stages."
"He is from the Moselle valley and is used to flooding; whenever the waters are at their height, Ralf is at his best, so warm thanks to him."
"I want to close by doing something you will not often hear me doing, and thank the Commission for their constructive cooperation in this stage of the negotiations."
"I would also like to thank Chancellor Schüssel, the President of the Council, who – as we know – still has a pile of work to do, but, having been so constructive in negotiations, he can count on our support in bringing round those recalcitrants on the Council whom he has not yet won over."
"All in all, I think yesterday was a good day."
". Mr President, on behalf of Liberals and Democrats I too would like to thank Mr Böge and his team, Messrs Mulder, Walter and Lewandowski, as well as the Austrian Presidency, for the agreement that they have reached."
"I hope this agreement will commend itself for approval to my group, to the House and to the Council and Commission."
"I would not pretend that my group is satisfied with the outcome."
"We feel that we are not providing enough money for the research and development that our Union needs for the Galileo Programme, for the trans-European networks, for lifelong learning: all of the things we should be financing properly to convince our citizens of the added value of the Union."
"We know that it is fashionable in the national capitals of some of our Member States to pour cold water on common endeavour."
"It started with the letter to Mr Prodi from six Heads of State and Government two years ago, envisaging reducing the budget to 1% of GNI – a deeply corrosive policy."
"But if the centripetal force for our Union is no longer coming from visionary leadership within, it will certainly come from developments beyond our borders."
"I hope that our Member States will use the review of EU financing that they have agreed on to look again at providing our Union with the resources it needs."
"Our group hopes, too, that we can make progress – as suggested by the Council – towards a proper statement of assurance, so that the auditors can finally sign off the accounts for the Union."
"That is, it seems to us, a minimum for regaining public confidence."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you will not be surprised to hear that my group is not particularly satisfied with the agreement reached, nor particularly convinced that more could not have been obtained."
"Unlike you, President Barroso, I do not believe that this agreement will be able to provide us with adequate funds for our ambitions, and I must admit to having been surprised by your statement."
"I think that the basic problem remains the same, namely that the Member States are unwilling to finance the European Union’s necessary programmes. This strikes me as a political problem that we will need to address in the years to come."
"I too would like to thank the negotiating team – composed entirely of men – and the team that participated in this difficult work – composed entirely of women from my group."
"The financial perspective is still conservative in structure and is certainly not directed towards reform."
"EUR 20 billion has been cut from rural development, and ambitious projects like Natura 2000 are still today without funding."
"The European Council has announced that there will be a revision clause, but has refused to include it in this agreement, with the result that we do not really know what will become of this clause."
"What is more, I would like to know from the Commission – and I hope its members are listening to me – whether or not its intentions to improve the decision-making system relating to external programmes are genuine, because there are conflicting opinions on this that I would like it to clarify for me."
"Finally, I would like to address a few words to Mr Schüssel."
"You have often spoken about issues that are important to us, like the European tax and the system of own resources."
"It seems to me that these subjects must absolutely be kept on the agenda, because today, with this truly unsatisfactory agreement – which could have been a great deal better than it is, if only the Council had wanted it to be – I do not think that we will be able to achieve real progress for our citizens between now and 2013."
". Mr President, Mr Schüssel, Mr Barroso, my group has never advocated a thoughtless increase of the budget."
"What is more, we do not believe that the budget is the only instrument available to the Union when it comes to facilitating healthy growth and balanced development."
"Thus, it would undoubtedly be very helpful if the European Central Bank were to play a different role in this regard."
"Nevertheless, the budget is always the expression of a political desire."
"There is no point in us harbouring lofty ambitions if we reject the financial resources needed to fulfil them."
"That is particularly true in the case of enlargement, which everyone knew, even before the start of the process, would entail legitimate costs, particularly in the context of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund."
"That is why even Parliament’s original demands and the Böge report seemed to us to fall a long way short of the financial needs corresponding to the commitments made."
"We therefore agreed with Parliament’s decision to reject the European Council’s cut-price compromise of last December."
"You were right, Mr Barroso, to point out at the time the drastic cuts that a financial perspective such as this would entail and to call for resources for education, research, the trans-European networks, cooperation and so on. From the point of view of these objectives, the 1.5% increase demanded by our negotiators was in itself extremely modest: 1.5% of 1.04% of the Union’s gross national income."
"As far as the Council was concerned, however, that was still three times too much."
"Under these circumstances, my group takes the view that our credibility depends on our rejecting this farce and that, consequently, we must shoulder our responsibilities."
". Mr President, when I heard just before midnight yesterday that our negotiators had reached a compromise with the Council and the Commission concerning the new Financial Perspective, I experienced contradictory reactions."
"On the one hand, I wished to recognise the efforts of our negotiators and all their good work."
"I was also much relieved that 15 months of uncertainty and dissent threatening the Union’s finances had been brought to an end in this way."
"There was a risk that lack of a new Financial Perspective would mean us debating all the budget parameters except for compulsory expenditure on an annual basis and running permanently behind with adoption of the budget."
"That is the positive aspect of the situation."
"On the other hand it must be pointed out that the new Financial Perspective certainly falls short of expectations, as it implies drastic restrictions to the redistribution of Union resources."
"It is anticipated that the Union’s GNI will increase by about 15% between 2007 and 2013, whilst its budget will only increase by around 2% in the same period."
"The figures speak for themselves."
"Against this background, the Council’s resistance to adopting our negotiators’ very modest proposals amounts to pettiness."
"It has often been said that certain political tendencies represented in this House demonstrate an incomprehensible Euroscepticism, and that this is especially the case of those originating from the new Member States."
"I am actually interested in establishing which of the parties are Eurosceptic and perhaps even anti-European."
"Might they perhaps turn out to be the governments of those states that are constantly cutting Union budget expenditure, and that believe it is possible to create more Europe for less money?"
"I shall urge colleagues in the UEN Group to support the compromise on the new Financial Perspective."
"Nonetheless, if we continue to regularly fall below the thresholds set in the Perspective in the annual budgets, the Union’s future will be bleak indeed."
"I simply suggest not blaming the new Member States for such a situation."
"The Union’s financial problems are largely due to meanness of the old Member States."
". Mr President, I feel, having listened to what has been said this morning, that the European Parliament is once again indulging in its favourite sport and pastime, that of navel gazing."
"All we are really discussing are the minutiae of interinstitutional agreements – or perhaps at this stage one should say ‘disagreements’ – but are we addressing the real issues of the European Union budget?"
"Is anybody prepared to really talk about the fact that the auditors have refused to sign off the accounts for 11 years in a row?"
"Does anybody here want to have a bet with me that it will not be 12 years in a row, or perhaps 13 or 14?"
"The whole thing is fatally flawed, is it not?"
"We have a budget system that is overly complicated, but my question is: do we need a budget at all?"
"Well, Mr Blair, having collapsed in the negotiations, having been totally outwitted, outclassed and outplayed by President Chirac, has signed a really rather bad deal for the British taxpayer."
"And now a majority of British people are asking: ‘why are we paying GBP 39 million a day into an organisation which cannot sign off its own accounts’?"
"Why should British taxpayers be helping to build a new underground system in Warsaw and new sewers in Budapest?"
"Why are we paying all this money to a group of countries that sell us far more than we sell them?"
"Surely, to subsidise your economic competitors is the economics of the madhouse!"
"Nobody sensible would indulge in it."
"So it will not be very long, Mr President, before the British are not going to be paying any money into the European Union."
"I know that all of you have benefited for the last 30 years, but I apologise in advance."
"There will be no British cheque coming to any of you within a few years, but we have enjoyed ourselves whilst we have been here."
"Mr President, with regard to the finding, we all agreed that this sum of around EUR 1 000 billion, which is meant to provide for seven years of the European budget, is a modest one, when the US budget, for one year alone, is USD 2 500 billion."
"Under these circumstances, the claim made in Lisbon that, in 2010, Europe will be the most competitive economy on the planet is akin to the behaviour of Nikita Khrushchev who, in 1960, at the United Nations, said, ‘In ten years’ time, the Soviet Union will have caught up with the United States’."
"Thus, from this perspective, and notwithstanding our successful attempt to secure a fistful of some thousands of extra euros, the proposals that we make in this Chamber remain just as unsuitable in the face of the universally recognised need for investment in laboratories, hospitals, universities, retirement homes, high-speed train services and so on. This means that the Council and Parliament only differed over an extra ‘nought point something’ in relation to GDP, because they draw their inspiration from the same source, which can be summed up in two words: Malthusianism in terms of economic policy and fundamentalism in terms of budgetary policy."
"Malthusianism is everywhere in the Union and in the CAP, regarding quotas, set-aside and the uprooting of vines."
"The European Parliament, in this very Chamber, inflicts poverty on its catering staff and its drivers, who earn the shameful sum of EUR 1 000 per month!"
"This is an example of the sordid economic reality that is reflected in the fundamentalism of our budgetary policies and in the budgetary technique of the Union’s Financial Regulation."
"Everything is done to avoid spending!"
"The Union’s Financial Regulation lays down the principle of budgetary balance."
"Mr Barroso, you need to go back to the days of Dr Salazar in order to find that principle, when the United States, in 100 years, has only had 38 balanced budgets."
"In other words, if our plan was to revise our financial perspective, then we should have revised the ultraliberal ideology underpinning it, but to question the three scourges of Anglo-Saxon thinking – Malthus, Adam Smith and Ricardo – was quite another matter."
"Thank you very much to everybody who has spoken."
"The Council and the Commission have been able to hear the political groups, who have expressed differing degrees of dissatisfaction, in some cases satisfactory dissatisfaction and in others dissatisfaction pure and simple."
"They have also been able to hear an appeal for work to continue with a view to providing the Union with a system of own resources which in future budgetary negotiations will put an end to the haggling based on national self-interests to which several group chairmen have referred."
"Mr Schüssel, we would like to urge you to continue along this road which you have bravely outlined."
"We are sure that that is where the Union’s future lies, with better budgets so that the Union can achieve its objectives."
"The political groups will discuss the agreement that our negotiators have reached on its behalf and Parliament will vote on it during its next part-session."
"That concludes this item."
"– The agreement reached in the trialogue on the financial perspective is bad news because it is EUR 108 billion down from Parliament’s original proposal."
"The 1.05% of GNI proposed for commitment appropriations falls well short of the 1.21% proposed by the Commission and the 1.18% proposed by Parliament."
"In response to the agreement reached at the December 2005 European Council, Parliament has put forward a proposal calling for a further EUR 12 billion to compensate in full those areas such as the Algarve affected by the statistical effect."
"The amount obtained only came to EUR 4 billion – largely funded by redistributing money from other headings – earmarked for priorities, such as the Lisbon Strategy and the Stability and Growth Pact, other than the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund,"
"The amounts agreed are woefully inadequate for the purpose of tackling the economic, social and environmental situation in the enlarged EU, where inequality has increased and where there is an even greater need for cohesion."
"We voted against Parliament’s proposal in June because it did not go far enough to guarantee economic and social cohesion, it penalised cohesion countries and it was guided by the priorities laid down in the so-called ‘European Constitution’."
"For these reasons, we have no choice but to oppose this new agreement."
"We shall continue with the debate on the results of the European Council and the Lisbon Strategy."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to be able, in my capacity as President of the Council, to again greet you, Mr President Borrell, you, honourable Members, and you, Members of the Commission."
"I am now appearing before you for the second time, and you will perhaps recall the promise I made at the beginning of the Austrian Presidency, to the effect that we did not want this to be a presidency characterised by our own themes, aspirations and desires, but that we wanted to offer you a team presidency, one that would see us working very well together with you, the democratically-elected European Parliament, with the Commission, and – of course – with the Member States too."
"Regaining the confidence of the people is a massive task, and it is one that we can accomplish only together, and it is together that we must address the great issues that Europe alone can resolve."
"In so doing, we must make use of all the institutions."
"There is no point in one institution pointing the finger at another or criticising it."
"We are all in the same boat and must keep a firm hold of the oars and row together if we are to gain speed and be able to reach our destination."
"I believe that you too can see that we have, from the very outset, tried to establish this collaborative approach within a team presidency."
"Without making much fanfare about it, the past weeks and months have seen us, together with you and the Commission, able to achieve quite a few solutions."
"I would like to start by giving you a brief report on the European Council."
"A year ago, under Luxembourg’s Presidency, we set ourselves the task of giving the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment new impetus."
"It is not enough to come up with rhetorical and woolly phrases; what we need instead is results and actions of the kind of which Robert Schuman spoke, when he said that Europe would not be built in a day, but by action, and probably by actions in the plural."
"We have also, and for the first time, brought about institutional change, by involving the European social partners in the deliberations of the European Council, which was attended by the President of the European Trade Union Congress, Mr Cándido Méndez Rodriguez, with the President of UNICE, the Union of Industrial and Employers’ Confederations of Europe, Mr Ernest-AntoineSeillière, taking part in the discussions, and with the President of the European Central Bank, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, present for the first time. The President of this Parliament, Mr Borrell, did of course speak for it and thereby make a very important contribution to this discussion on business and job creation."
"Our presidency has set itself very definite objectives."
"You have yourselves been able to see from the media that many of them were highly contentious."
"We have not allowed ourselves to be discouraged by this and have included several very precise formulations in the conclusions, particularly in those concerned with work and growth."
"The most important thing for us is that the employment situation should be improved for the sake of Europe’s unemployed, who number some 18 million."
"In practical terms, we want to achieve a 1% growth in employment by means of the national reform programmes and improved framework conditions, which would amount to the creation of some 2 million jobs a year, or, by 2010, a net increase of an extra 10 million."
"Secondly, it is our quite deliberate intention to concentrate on the training of the young, so that 85% of young people under the age of 22 should get higher education."
"Our intention is that the number of school drop-outs should be reduced by 10%, and, quite specifically, that by as soon as next year, all young people should, within six months, be offered either a job, an apprenticeship or the chance of further training, with this period later being reduced to four months."
"We have agreed a gender equality pact in the workplace, ‘flexicurity’ is being discussed in great detail at every level, and the globalisation fund proposed by the Commission provides us with the proper means of giving, through retraining or additional training, a new chance in the labour market to those workers adversely affected by structural change."
"The next big issue is, of course, the question of how that is to be achieved, and we have taken the decision to prioritise the small and medium-sized businesses that were, formerly sometimes treated less than kindly."
"We have considered the practicalities of how we can make life easier for small and medium-sized businesses – of which there are some 23 million – by reducing official procedures and abolishing administrative rules."
"The Commission – in the persons of Commissioner Verheugen and President Barroso – has put forward a highly intensive programme of ‘better regulation’, following a Dutch model and providing quite crucial impetus towards a 25% reduction of administrative chores."
"We want to make it easier for young entrepreneurs to start up businesses."
"The intention is that they should be able to get one up and running within a week, with a single point of contact ensuring that small businesses do not have to deal with umpteen different administrative bodies, but can start operating as quickly as possible."
"I am very much obliged to the Commission for raising the de minimis threshold, which, I know, was not an entirely simple matter within their own institution."
"Doubling this threshold is a vitally important initiative and enables us to make life much easier for small and medium-sized businesses and also makes it easier for us to encourage and support them."
"I would also ask you not to forget that we, through the European Investment Bank, have made available an additional EUR 30 billion through subsidised loans, guarantees and sureties, enabling small businesses in particular to make real strides in creating jobs."
"The third topic I would like to address is knowledge and research."
"We are perfectly well aware that one consequence of Europe’s wage levels is that we can get the better of our competitors only if we do more for training, research and knowledge."
"It was, of course, as long ago as 2000 that we set the 3% target."
"The only thing is that we have not achieved it."
"What is new about these conclusions is that we have got every single country, in the annex to the conclusions and which forms part of them, to commit itself to being able to actually achieve this 3% target in every year right up to 2010."
"My comment on the previous debate is that, if we succeed in this – and it will of course call for considerable efforts – the consequence of it will be that EUR 100 billion more per annum, drawn from the national budgets and from private industry, will be invested in research."
"That would be the most massive injection for growth that one can imagine in this area."
"It is still true that the European Investment Bank will help us out with EUR 10 billion in additional risk capital, and, if the private contributions are added to that, that adds up to an additional injection of EUR 30 billion."
"It strikes me as particularly significant that the European Council has adopted Mr Barroso’s idea of founding a European institute for technology, although it was at first highly controversial, for the understandable reason that there are those who fear the creation of huge parallel bureaucracies, while others fear that the existing centres of excellence could lose out."
"I fully support the basic idea that the Commission is putting forward here, the idea of creating a link between institutions of higher education and industry, between research and development on the one hand and the end users on the other."
"This would not be some sort of super-authority, but a perfectly developed network primarily intended to really cooperate with the institutions in the Member States."
"I congratulate Mr Barroso and the Commission on their proposal’s adoption and acceptance, and we look forward to concrete proposals for legislation by June of this year."
"Something else that is important while we are on the subject of the budget is the undertaking we have given to make substantially more funding available for students’ programmes and for exchange programmes for apprentices."
"You have already heard about the additional EUR 800 million in the budget compromise right now."
"That is a very interesting and important initiative towards giving young people new prospects."
"What was interesting was that I recently read a number of studies that considered in a critical light the reasons why we have as yet not achieved the ambitious goals of our strategy – Lisbon, jobs, employment – and one of the reasons given by the Sapir report and also by the was that there was too little 'national ownership' – dreadful term! – which means, in as many words, that nobody in the Member States actually feels themselves to be responsible."
"This is where I am setting a good example: at the last Council of Ministers in Austria, I decided that we would have a coordinator at ministerial level, so, with immediate effect, our Minister for the Economy and Labour will be the political coordinator for this whole process, and I will invite every Member State to do likewise, so that we will have policy coordinators who can then – perhaps in the Competition Council – monitor our achievement of the goals we have set ourselves."
"That would be a vitally important move towards establishing the credibility of what we have, together, undertaken to do."
"One thing that was of course completely new was energy policy, and here the prime mover was the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, although I also want to thank Tony Blair for having in fact set the whole thing off at Hampton Court."
"It was of course the first day of January this year that gave us a real wake-up call and raised the alarm, for it was on 1 January, while I was sitting alongside Angela Merkel at the New Year’s concert, that the Russians cut the energy supply – by 30% in the first night, and by 50% in the second."
"We managed – with the help of the Commission, of Commissioner Piebalgs and many others – to defuse the crisis within four days, but the problems have of course not gone away."
"Almost all the producers are based in political crisis zones; nearly all global conflicts have something to do with energy."
"Raw materials prices are fluctuating wildly; there is but little diversification."
"Some of the time, and in some areas, Europe is at high risk of a black-out."
"Climate change, with all its attendant phenomena, is an issue that we have to face; an answer has to be found to the issue of the worldwide increase in demand for energy, and we must not, of course, lose sight of the enormous security risks."
"The whole situation positively cries out for a new joint effort on the part of Europe, and the Commission has done a first-class job of preparing the ground with its Green Paper, which the Council has taken on board, also defining as its three objectives security of supply, the competitiveness of our own industry and the improvement of environmental quality."
"In practical terms, we agreed on a 20% reduction in energy use – something that I do not think goes without saying and is therefore all the more significant."
"What that in fact means is that the EU is setting itself the long-term target of decoupling economic growth from energy consumption."
"I regard this as one of the most important decisions that this Council has taken, and one which will demand enormous efforts if it is to be put into effect."
"We want to increase the contribution of renewable energy from the present 7% to 15%; that, too, has been a cause of much controversy and is in no way an automatic process."
"Both at the national level and together, there is much to be done."
"The use of biofuels, which currently stands at 2%, is to be increased to 8%, and that will inevitably demand technology and research; it will involve consideration of second-generation biofuels, the implementation of CARS 21, and cooperation with the motor industry, and brings with it an enormous opportunity for growth, of which we want to make use."
"Turning to the cross-border trade in electricity, we aim to achieve a 10% share between networks, which would substantially reduce the risk of a black-out for our consumers."
"It must not be forgotten that the pipelines, the networks, the power stations and network security offer economic opportunity, with between EUR 800 billion and EUR 1 000 billion invested in them, mainly from private sources."
"If we make wise use of this by way of a common European economic policy, it will prove to be a powerful generator of jobs and will also make us more secure."
"Connected with this – and this is something else we debated frankly, without public disagreement – there is the requirement that there should be no protectionism in a relatively small market like Europe."
"Having been Minister for the Economy, and hence also for energy, for six years, I know what I am talking about here."
"There may well have been a time when we could all, off our own bat, create national champions or believe ourselves capable of disregarding European regulations, but those days are gone."
"What is needed is for the markets to be opened up, and it has been agreed that this is what will happen to the electricity and gas market by mid-2007."
"The instruments to do this exist; the Commission is in possession of them, and so let it go ahead and use them without further ado, for one reason why it is the guardian of the Treaties is in order to guarantee security of supply to our consumers."
"It has to be said, though, that the energy mix has lost none of its importance, and the decision as to what source of energy to use still has to be taken at national level; that is something I want to make perfectly clear."
"Each country must make up its own mind whether or not it wants nuclear power stations;"
"Austria’s position is quite clear on this – and I know that other countries take a different one – and that must be respected."
"I guarantee that it will be, and so, of course, does the European Parliament."
"It is vitally important that we consider this not only in economic terms but also in the foreign policy context, and that is why it was agreed that the Commission, working jointly with the High Representative, Mr Solana, should produce a strategy paper on the foreign policy dimension of energy policy."
"With hindsight, these discussions and these decisions will be regarded as a breakthrough in terms of a genuine common European energy policy."
"Reviews to be carried out in every term of the coming presidency will ensure that this issue is not to be lost from sight."
"It also, though, strikes me as very significant – and reaching consensus on this was not easy, for I had to spend a lot of time talking with all the Heads of Government in order to prepare the way for it – that I managed to get everyone to accept the decision on the services directive that your House took democratically and by a large majority."
"I am also grateful to the Commission for having, as soon as today, produced a proposal that is – as far as I can see so far – in line with this consensus."
"I really am keen that we should work together as closely as possible in a fast-track procedure at second reading in order to arrive at a joint resolution as quickly as possible."
"I would also like to express my thanks to the social partners at the European level for having played their part in this."
"The employers did not find this easy, but they did make a constructive contribution."
"Following this breakthrough – for that is how I regard the services directive – I would, though, ask for a similarly committed approach to a second important matter, that being the Working Time Directive."
"We all know how important it is that we make progress here, and how it will be if we do, but we will need to be sensitive in taking account of national peculiarities."
"I regard this as an example of an area where the subsidiarity principle can come into its own."
"A sensible compromise is preferable to having no solution at all."
"I would be very happy if we were to be able, during the Austrian Presidency, to achieve together real progress at all three levels – services, the Working Time Directive and the budget."
"That brings me to the budget."
"I know as well as anyone that bringing it into being has been a problematic business."
"Some of you, of course, may be permitting yourselves smiles of amusement in the knowledge that it has – contrary to what one might presume – demanded hard work on the part of three presidencies: Luxembourg, the UK, and now Austria."
"This budget is for a period of seven years and is intended to provide not only legal certainty for the programmes but also, and primarily, to enable the new Member States to implement the things for which they hope."
"I really am appreciative of the way in which – as everyone in this House has in fact pointed out – we have thought in terms of the whole and not of individual interests."
"Believe me, I too have had to intrude on several internal security zones to arrive at this common consensus."
"As you will be aware, this has also called for a very great deal of dedication on the part of the Austrian Presidency’s negotiating team – our finance minister, our foreign minister and of course myself – in our dealings with Mr Barroso and Mr Borrell, to whom we are very grateful."
"You will also be aware that we had to stick closely to the December compromise; we were able to offer up to 3.5 billion, although Parliament wanted 4 billion, and it testifies to the presidency’s teamwork that the Commission eventually helped us out by coming up with the missing half billion for administrative expenses, so that Parliament got the minimum of 4 billion in the programmes that it wanted."
"If one includes the European Investment Bank in the analysis, one comes up with some interesting results."
"There will be a billion for strengthening the EU’s external aspects, and an extra billion will really stiffen the sinews of the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"You can add to that EUR 5 billion for the Lisbon Strategy, half from the European budget and half from the European Investment Bank, cash."
"The rest are loans, taking the figures up to 10 billion for research, 20 for the trans-European networks, 30 for small and medium-sized businesses – all in all, EUR 60 billion."
"There have been some very considerable shifts, and I believe that this is a compromise that we can honestly recommend should be accepted."
"I must now also go to COREPER and to the other Member States, but I do think we have already achieved something that really is credible in the eyes of the outside world."
"Finally, there is foreign policy, where we have, quite apart from managing such crises as bird flu, the row about the cartoons, the gas crisis and the great foreign policy issues, to clarify a number of points, but that is not the main issue today."
"There is only one issue I want to mention, because I have seen that Alexander Milinkevich is up in the gallery, and that issue is one that also featured at the European Council."
"The situation in Belarus is, of course, a tragic one;"
"I can tell you right now that that is how I personally see it."
"I had, yesterday, the honour and pleasure of a long personal conversation with Mr Milinkevich."
"He is a calm and reasonable man and deserves from us every conceivable political and economic support wherever it is required, especially through the various party families, for the opposition in Belarus is constituted by a platform composed of the most diverse groups."
"The state’s forces having been brutal in their treatment of demonstrators, hundreds are still in jail, and thousands of students have lost their places at university; workers have lost their jobs and families their incomes."
"A number of Member States have formed a coalition, the Visegrad states – Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary – among them, and Austria is also playing its part by offering scholarships to Belarusian students, and this is what prompts me to ask the Commission for support, in order that we might give Belarus real help."
"Above all, we must join together in raising our voices and demanding the prompt release of the internees, in particular of the presidential candidate Alexander Kosulin."
"At the same time, we should also stress that the EU has no interest in isolating Belarus, and certainly not its people."
"We should also support civil society in Belarus in establishing the democracy they want."
"The regime there will be subject to the restrictive measures we adopted at the European Council for as long as it continues its authoritarian approach and systematically suppresses civil society."
"We still have three months of our presidency ahead of us, and I know that there is a lot of work in store for us, but I am confident that we will – as we have done before – resolve the important issues through good contacts and good cooperation."
"I am very confident that you will, as you have done before, have your own contributions to make, which may well be critical or exacting, if you have particular thoughts or ideas."
"I can promise you my absolute cooperation, and I will also try to move as much as possible forward at Council level, without great fanfare and proclamation, but rather in such a way as to achieve real results."
"That is my programme, and I believe I can point to its having achieved a certain amount even before our presidency has reached its halfway term."
". Mr President, Mr Schüssel, ladies and gentlemen, contrary to the prevailing scepticism and contrary to a certain cynicism that is taking hold today, I believe that it can be said that, despite the difficult times it is experiencing, Europe is making progress, and the European Council of 23 and 24 March demonstrated that an enlarged Europe can also make progress."
"The momentum initiated last autumn has put Europe and our institutions back at the centre of the debate."
"The message emerging from the European Council is clear."
"Europe needs to tackle the main problems linked to economic growth and employment."
"The week before the Spring European Council, I presented to you, in this Chamber, the issues at stake in that meeting, which was a crucial meeting because it represented the first occasion on which the revived Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment was to be implemented."
"I can tell you today that the objectives set by the Commission have been attained."
"I am thinking not only of the excellent reception given to our Green Paper on energy, but also of other practical proposals, including the one concerning the European Institute of Technology."
"In saying that, I am not speaking merely on behalf of the Commission, I am also speaking on behalf of the general European interest: I believe that we can unreservedly congratulate ourselves on the outcome obtained by this Spring European Council."
"Guided by the excellent work and the perseverance of the Austrian Presidency, the Heads of State or Government have accepted the principle of partnership for the new Lisbon Strategy."
"They have declared themselves ready to move into top gear and they have also taken major decisions paving the way for the actual implementation of our commitments under the new Lisbon Strategy."
"We now have monitoring mechanisms."
"We have 25 national reform programmes."
"From now on, the European Parliament, the national parliaments, the political forces, the social partners and public opinion in general can embark on a course whereby measures take the form of results: they can move on from the stage of rhetoric to the stage of practical measures in the form of results."
"The key word in English was ‘delivery’: the practical presentation of results."
"The main example taken up by the European Council concerns the move towards a genuine energy policy for Europe."
"The person who recounts the history of European integration in 20 or 25 years’ time will be able to say, without any exaggeration, that an energy policy for Europe was launched in March 2006, under the Austrian Presidency."
"We are only just at the beginning with this, and it will not be easy."
"There will be resistance, but there is resistance because there is change."
"If there were no change, then there would be no resistance."
"On this matter, I can assure you, on behalf of the Commission, that it will exercise all of its powers in relation to integration, because – and we wish to state this firmly – there is no reason why Europe should have 25 energy markets."
"There is no reason why, in this day and age, Europe should have 25 national energy policies."
"We need a common strategy for Europe in relation to energy."
"There is no room for nationalistic reflexes."
"The Member States have reaffirmed their desire to work together in seeking common solutions and acknowledge the Commission’s central role in terms of setting up open and competitive markets at Union level."
"As regards the Lisbon Agenda, we have no time to lose and we now need to get results."
"It was in this spirit that, immediately after the European Council, Mr Verheugen and I met the national coordinators overseeing the implementation of the Lisbon Agenda."
"We informed them of the Commission’s desire to thoroughly fulfil its role not only in terms of providing support and assistance, but also in terms of monitoring the implementation of the national reform programmes."
"I wish to congratulate Mr Schüssel, who has just announced his desire to increase the level of representation responsible for monitoring the Lisbon process in his own country, Austria."
"We should also like to take advantage of this to launch an appeal to all of the Member States to do the same."
"Sound technical preparations are obviously important, and we are very pleased with the technical level attained for this exercise in the various Member States."
"That being said, we also believe that it is important for the programme’s success that we increase its standing in the political hierarchy, as Mr Schüssel just announced in relation to Austria."
"Furthermore, the Commission will continue to provide impetus at European level."
"We also agree on the need to launch exchanges of practical experiences."
"We believe that the time has come to hold meetings in the various Member States, something that we are going to do from autumn onwards."
"This close contact with the Member States is crucial when it comes to making progress with our programme, but it is not enough."
"Allow me, in this Chamber, to lend my support to Parliament’s powerful message concerning the need for the greater and even more extensive involvement of all of the actors concerned at this crucial stage of implementation."
"We have made efforts to clarify the levels of responsibility and competence of the various institutional, economic and social actors at European, national and regional level."
"We must now promote a genuine kind of ownership of the Lisbon Strategy by all of these actors."
"I call on you to focus all of our efforts on the crucial reforms with a view to preparing Europe to rise to the challenges of globalisation, together with that of an ageing population."
"We can win the globalisation battle."
"In order to do so, every one of us must also participate in the communication efforts and in the public debate."
"I welcome the partnership that exists between the European Parliament and the national parliaments."
"As recently as January, you debated the Lisbon Strategy in this context."
"I can only encourage you to pursue this dialogue and offer you the Commission’s support."
"Your Parliament and the national parliaments are the key actors in this debate because, together, they all represent the people of Europe."
"We will be unable to make a success of the necessary reforms without the broad support of the people, who will ultimately benefit from our efforts."
"There was vision in this European Council, but it was also a practical European Council."
"It left everyone with an in-tray of work for the coming months."
"Not least, it gave the Commission a clear mandate for action over the coming months, and I want particularly to thank Chancellor Schüssel for his team work, team spirit, the way he understood, the way he supported the role of the Commission and the need to give consistency and continuity over time for the work that will follow different presidencies of the European Council."
"That approach of partnership between the Council, the Commission and Parliament is essential."
"Without that spirit and cooperation we will not be able to achieve real progress."
"One area where Parliament’s role has already been decisive in finding a compromise was and is precisely that of the services directive."
"It took some time to convince the Heads of State and Government, but eventually the European Council backed the line that Parliament agreed and that also received our support."
"If you remember, since the beginning I have said, and the Commission has said, that if there was a real, clear consensus from Parliament, we would be ready to work with you to resolve this services directive issue."
"Yesterday, we presented to you our amended proposal and you see that it fully reflects the compromise endorsed by a large majority in this House in February."
"The revised text preserves the balance between the urgent need to unleash the full potential of the internal market for services and the preservation of our European social model."
"In parallel, we presented the communication providing clear guidance on the application of Community rules on the posting of workers."
"As to freedom of movement for workers, I also want to commend the announcement made by several Member States following the Commission report in terms of anticipating the end of the transition period for the free movement of workers."
"After Ireland, Britain and Sweden, we now have Finland, Spain, Portugal and most recently the Netherlands, which have announced their wish to anticipate such freedom of movement for workers, so that is the way for us really to have an enlarged Europe that works."
"We will also follow this amended version of the services directive with a communication on social services of general interest."
"We are also working hard on health services."
"On the basis of the text now presented, I expect the Council and Parliament to conclude the legislative procedure rapidly."
"I would also like to mention three areas where I believe the European Council took decisions which will have a real and lasting impact."
"First, business: we all know that for new jobs we must look to business and small and medium-sized enterprises, because they create most of the jobs."
"The decision to cut red tape for new business is a sign that Europe is now becoming open for business."
"As for SMEs, I was glad that the Commission received support for its approach on state aid rules and for cutting administrative burdens."
"We will take this work forward swiftly."
"Secondly, knowledge: the proposal for a European Institute of Technology excited some debate."
"Good."
"I take it as a sign that the EIT has real importance."
"A flagship for European excellence in education, research and innovation is a genuinely new idea which needs imagination and drive to work."
"With the green light from the European Council, we will be working to flesh out the plans and to show how the European Institute of Technology will be an effective catalyst for knowledge and growth in Europe."
"As I said in my introduction, the European Council paid particular attention to energy."
"It put the Union on the path to a real energy policy for Europe."
"It endorsed the triple goals of our Green Paper: sustainable, competitive and secure energy."
"It also set out the practical measures to be taken, including some of the 20 specific proposals set out in the Commission Green Paper: a real internal market for energy, a coherent external policy, effective support for energy efficiency and renewables."
"The Commission’s forward programme for energy is now very busy."
"As a result, I really believe that specific measures will be delivered."
"It was important for this not to be a one-shot show."
"Now it is very fashionable to speak about energy, and now Member States accept what – let us be frank – two years ago would have been impossible to accept: that we need a common strategy."
"So, for the June European Council, as Chancellor Schüssel said, the Commission and the High Representative will come up with some ideas on the external dimension of energy policy."
"We decided to put that matter under constant review, monitoring it every year at the spring Council."
"That was important in terms of consistency."
"After all those internal points, the European Council was also able to send a strong message of commitment on the Belarus situation."
"The Commission is working with the Council very actively to promote the reinforcement of civil society in Belarus and to support the independent media so that the citizens of Belarus have access to media that is not censored and not controlled by a government that does not respect the fundamental principles of a democratic state."
"We are now moving in the right direction."
"We are putting words into action."
"We know what we should do; we agreed to do it, and now we are doing it."
"We are doing it in partnership with the European Parliament, the European Council and Member States, and also with businesses, trade unions, consumers and citizens across Europe."
"I believe that is the only way to deliver more growth and new jobs."
"I believe that is the right way to get out of a very negative situation for Europe."
"As I said earlier, there is now a feeling in Europe of scepticism, sometimes cynicism."
"The right way to change that is to deliver concrete results, to resolve the services directive issue, as we have been doing, to settle the financial perspectives, as I hope will now be done."
"I will not comment on that now, because I did that in my introductory remarks."
"So, if we can achieve results, we will create the best atmosphere for settling the institutional problems that have to be settled and for creating a new impetus for this Europe."
"That is our duty."
"We should do more to achieve it."
". – Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the European Council, Chancellor Schüssel, spoke of the responsibility that the European institutions have in common, and the President of the Commission has just been talking about actions."
"Addressing the President of this House in particular, I can say that my impression is that we – by which I mean you three and the whole European Parliament – find ourselves today in a situation in which this sense of community and of shared responsibility for the future of the European Union is making itself felt."
"It is my profound conviction that this is a good opportunity to restore, by our visible actions, the mindset that makes this European Union appealing to those who live in it, and to do this also with reference to other issues that we are not debating today, such as the Constitutional Treaty, to which we have to find a solution."
"That is our shared responsibility."
"I am very pleased to note that the President of the European Council is working hard, together with us and with the Commission, on the common destiny of Europe, and doing so unspectacularly but with professionalism and efficiency, and sustained by European conviction."
"People – often wrongly – see Brussels as a symbol of bureaucracy."
"Success will be ours if we – and on this point it is particularly the Commission that I am addressing – carry the Lisbon process through to a good conclusion, spelling it out that we want less bureaucracy; what we want is a freer internal market, for the stronger the internal market is, the more we will succeed in opening up the market in the European Union – something in which the services directive is an important instrument – with less regulation, fewer subsidies, and more competition, so that we become all the more competitive on global markets."
"It follows that we must go for fewer laws and more freedom for businesses, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, for the less bureaucracy and the fewer the costs that small and medium-sized businesses have to bear, the greater the capacity for job creation."
"That is what matters most of all, for we are not talking here about the economy in the abstract, but about the people of the European Union, and that is why I am glad that the President of the Council has just had something to say about young people, for the worst thing of all, in fact, is for young people to have nothing to look forward to, and that is a state of affairs that we must do everything in our power to prevent."
"If I may turn to energy policy, we have heard from the Polish Government, which does not demonstrate much commitment to Europe, that it expects European solidarity in matters of energy policy, and I say that they are right to do so, for this European Union is founded upon solidarity."
"We need a European energy policy, but what I would also say to the Polish Government is that, if they demand solidarity in this area, we can expect them to display the same solidarity when it comes to the future of the elements, the substance, and the principles of the Constitutional Treaty."
"Solidarity is not a one-way street, and on it we keep on meeting one another."
"We need solidarity with one another for the sake of our European future."
"As my time is up, let me make one final observation: perhaps we have to give some thought as to how this House and the chairmen of its groups can adequately express themselves; they do not need as long as the President of the Council and the President of the Commission, but we must share out the time properly."
"Mr President, this House has just welcomed Alexander Milinkevich."
"It was my group that expressly invited him to be here today."
"While we debate energy and the economy, we must never lose sight of the foundations on which we stand, namely our values, human rights and human dignity, which are the reason why we are taking a stand for democracy in Belarus, and it is our doing so that makes our defence of human rights in Europe, and around the world, convincing."
". – Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, if we are going to assess the European Council, there are things to be said in its favour, for, the last time it met, it showed evidence of possessing the will to revitalise the European project, and that is something that we note with approval."
"Before the last meeting of the Council, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the President of the Party of European Socialists, submitted on its behalf a plan of action for growth and employment that we had drafted together with the socialist ministers of the economy and finance."
"At the heart of this action plan is the use of state investment and public expenditure as means of stimulating private spending, the very same thing that you spoke of when you said that the available resources of the European Investment Bank would be used to this end."
"That is a good socialist approach, and, in taking it, you can count on our support."
"As regards energy policy – and this is a topic to which I should like to return, since it is at the heart of your report on the European Council – it is indeed the case that we need a single European strategy for it, and the first thing to be noted when we consider one is that the Member States decide their energy policy for themselves."
"Please allow me to reiterate this point."
"You have again told how, at the moment that Russia turned the gas tap off, you were at the New Year’s Concert, sitting next to the German Federal Chancellor."
"Now I do not know whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship at work here, but that is something we can disregard."
"Perhaps you could do me a favour and say to her, not at the next New Year’s Concert, but the next time you meet her: ‘Angela, do as I do and leave energy policy alone’."
"As far as nuclear power is concerned, that is the right thing to do, and you will get a lot of support for doing it, not only from people in your own country, but also in Germany."
"The crucial issue is about how we apply solidarity to our handling of energy policy."
"This is something that the Council has to decide, and it cannot follow the example of Buridan’s ass, which stood between two piles of hay and ended up starving to death because it did not know which one it should eat from."
"It is of that that the European Council reminds me in almost every area, for the problem is always the same."
"We hear the Council making fine statements about what Europe has to do, and when its members – your fellow Heads of State or Government – go home, they forget the undertakings they gave to Europe and answer only to their national publics."
"There you see the European crisis in a nutshell; that is what our institutions have to overcome together."
"The European Parliament is playing its part in this."
"We have put together a decent services directive – the adoption of which by the Commission was announced yesterday – and I regard one of the highpoints of the last Council meeting as being the Council’s unanimous statement that they would make that, too, one of the planks of their common position."
"That is a good sign."
"It shows that Europe – under this House’s leadership – is making headway."
"It is an unfortunate fact that this cannot be left to the Council and the Commission alone, and so we will carry on biting at your heels."
"One final comment, Mr Schüssel: I have to agree that everything looks good around the middle; the Austrian Presidency is doing a good job."
"Today, again, you made a number of remarks – and you know perfectly well to what I am referring – in which you alluded to certain aspects of what needs to be done over the coming weeks."
"All in all, you are a smart operator: you assured Mr Berlusconi that you were willing to help him save Europe from Communism, only then to meet with Mr Prodi a couple of hours later."
"You know how to balance different interests in such a way that it works to your benefit."
"If we can all make good use of that skill for the good of the European Union, then we will be right behind you."
". Mr President, the cynics in Liberal Democrat ranks would say of last month’s Council that it could have been worse."
"Congratulations to the Austrians for avoiding a row."
"The Presidency conclusions were, as so often, pledges of economic reform in directly inverse proportion to acts of economic reform."
"But the optimists among our number note that the tone of these Presidency conclusions is different."
"As Mark Twain said of Wagner’s music: ‘It’s not as bad as it sounds.’"
"Even socialist prime ministers have accepted that the game is up, that the market has to come in to give us growth and prosperity."
"All Council members accepted that environment policy can make an important contribution to jobs and growth."
"We are making progress and, combined with the prospect of an interinstitutional agreement on the financial perspectives and the economic growth that we now foresee, there is hope again for our Union."
"I welcome in particular the Commission’s decision this week to mount legal challenges to those flouting the rules of liberalisation, because that is the kind of action that we need from the Commission to make progress."
"The European Union is remarkably resilient."
"Progress may not be made in one area, but it springs up somewhere else: an energy policy for Europe, a good step forward; or more countries wanting to join the eurozone."
"The drive for common endeavour may come now from the challenges from outwith, rather than conviction from within."
"But I hope that the Austrian Presidency and the Finnish Presidency that follows it can take this new spirit forward and help us to reconstruct a constitutional basis on which to build our Union for the future."
"My Group believes it is time to drop the focus of the spring Council on economic reform."
"You need three Councils a year."
"You need to discuss other issues – important issues such as Belarus."
"You could have discussed, as proposed by some Member States, the issue of Guantánamo Bay, where EU residents are still kept."
"An unwillingness to upset the Americans prevented you from doing so."
"Let us see a bit more European spirit coming out of these Councils."
"Let us start to rebuild the Union with the active involvement of Member States."
"Too often in recent years we have seen in Rome, in Paris, in London and even in Berlin attempts to unpick the Community method, to pull Europe apart at the seams – national capitals that risk enhancing global anarchy in the name of preserving national sovereignty."
"I was very surprised to see you, Mr Schüssel and Mr Poettering, and all of the glitterati of the European People’s Party in Rome, supporting the re-election campaign of a Prime Minister who has undermined Europe’s values at every turn ..."
"frustrating progress in judicial cooperation, even judicial proceedings; overstepping the borders of propriety, of a free and independent media, or even of electoral systems; using the Presidency of the EU to embrace Vladimir Putin, ignoring Russia’s actions in Chechnya."
"The European People’s Party claims to be pro-European."
"That is hardly the action of a pro-European party."
"If the Italians vote wisely on Sunday there will be a pro-European government in Rome and perhaps it can work together with the new government in Berlin to re-establish the equilibrium that we need in our Union and start to put Europe back on an even keel."
". Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Schüssel, Mr Winkler, Mr Barrot, I would not wish to provoke Mr Schulz into taking the floor again by pointing out to him that my group could certainly agree with the last remarks made by Mr Watson on the Italian situation."
"That being said, Mr Barroso rightly pointed out that the people expect results and that the European Union’s legitimacy comes from the obligation to provide results."
"We need instruments and resources first, however."
"In this respect, allow me to turn to Mr Schüssel and the Council – since we are, in fact, debating the Council’s conclusions – and put three proposals to him."
"My first proposal concerns the EU budget, which was discussed a short while ago."
"I believe that it must simply be repeated that this budget is insufficient and inconsistent from the perspective of the Lisbon objectives."
"The proposals currently on the table are EUR 110 billion below the figure proposed by Parliament and EUR 200 billion below the figure proposed by the Commission."
"My first suggestion is that we therefore need to speed up the work on the European Union’s own resources, as you yourself pointed out."
"The second suggestion concerns the role of the European Investment Bank."
"I believe that what has been decided is interesting, Mr Schüssel."
"EUR 30 billion is all well and good, but ten times that amount is actually needed, according to economists’ estimates."
"From that perspective, I believe that the Council ought not to paint itself into a corner and agree to open a debate on the European government bonds."
"We must harness the savings of the general public in Europe in order to finance both sustainable transport networks and eco-efficiency."
"To begin with, this could be done in the context of the eurozone: the Council conclusions refer to this."
"I believe that this is an important point."
"Finally, here is my third suggestion: I believe that the debate within the Council on the development of taxation systems in the countries of Europe must genuinely move forward."
"As you are well aware, in the next 20 years we will be faced with the problem of funding social security systems in nearly every country in Europe."
"If we continue not to take decisive measures enabling tax to be charged on mobile bases, including at European level – which, I might add, brings us back to the issue of own resources – then the present situation will endure, with greater inequalities in the distribution of incomes together with an increase in the number of poor people that social safety nets will no longer manage to support."
"There you have three suggestions, Mr Schüssel, and I would hope that the Council, under your Presidency and under subsequent Presidencies, will look into these types of proposal."
". – Looking at the conclusions of this Spring Conference and comparing them with what is actually happening in our economies and our societies, the only conclusion one can draw is that the gap between the policies and the citizens is widening."
"Where are the practical measures to address the need to double economic growth and jobs with rights in order to reach the levels of 2000?"
"Where are the responses to unemployment, which has reached 18.5% of young people of working age under 25 and around 10% of women of working age?"
"Where are the responses to the growth in unstable, poorly paid work, at a time when 32% of employed women work only part time and over 43% of employed young people only have a temporary contract, without any future prospects?"
"The truth is that the only responses put forward have been the few vague commitments in terms of jobs, without any reference to the quality of that work or the practical measures to achieve this, and this is the most glaring symptom of the increasing tensions in a number of EU countries."
"It is particularly shocking that there have been no responses to poverty, which affects over 15% of the population, and that poverty has not been deemed a serious violation of human rights. Social inclusion should therefore be at the top of the political agenda of the Commission, the Council and the Member States, and this is simply not the case at the moment."
"I should therefore like to propose a challenge. What is needed is a change of direction, whereby the accent is placed on economic and social cohesion policies."
". Mr President, I wish to thank the President-in-Office, as well as President Barroso, for their contributions here today."
"However, I wish to begin by saying that I absolutely deplore the way this House has been used this morning, in this debate, to fight national political elections."
"If we in Parliament cannot show enough maturity to deal with the real issues of the European Summit and the European Council, rather than going back to basic party political bickering between different individuals, then it is a sad reflection on this House."
"In fact, a lot of positive things have come out of the European Council meeting that we should be promoting very strongly, in particular the commitments given to increasing employment opportunities and increasing the amount of money to be put into research and development; assisting in the expansion of the lifelong learning and education and training programmes; utilising the resources available to the European Investment Bank to kick start small and medium-sized enterprises, to give them an opportunity to create the jobs and to create the economic wealth and growth which is necessary within the European Union."
"The overall new policies that we are trying to work towards include a common energy system, where we recognise, of course, the rights of the Member States to deal with their own energy issues, but also see where those individual Member States can cooperate with each other to guarantee minimum resources as regards safety and security, with regard to interconnection and to guaranteeing the proper use of funding for research and development as regards new renewable energies and in particular on biofuels."
"In our desire to help the environment, whilst at the same time reducing our dependence on imported fuels, we could use new energy crops to run all of our public transport in the European Union, if we so wished."
"We could use solar energy to heat our houses, if we so wished."
"We could use biomass to heat factories, schools and hospitals, if we so wished."
"However, that requires us to make an investment to guarantee that the technology is available for all and, through our taxation, to give preference to energies that are less damaging to the environment, as we did with the introduction of unleaded petrol many years ago."
"Looking at the positive side, yesterday we saw where Parliament can respond."
"With regard to the services directive and the financial perspectives, Parliament is willing to act as a political body to ensure that it can deliver on behalf of the European citizens, in cooperation with the other institutions."
"However – and this is the downside – when we speak about small and medium-sized enterprises and encouraging greater growth in research and development, and put forward the wonderful idea of a European institute for technology and expertise, the one thing that is missing in all of that is a proper EU legal framework for the protection of intellectual property rights, because companies and businesses will not invest in R[amp]D unless they are guaranteed protection for their ideas."
"We have failed miserably in the European Union to put in place a proper legal framework to allow that money to be utilised alongside the public funding that is available."
"We have delivered on our commitments, we must now ensure that we can deliver on our future promises for the future generations in Europe."
"– Mr President, we have heard certain things from the President of the Commission."
"I will comment on the phrase he used, when he said that we need to get past nationalistic reflexes; of course he used the word 'nationalistic' to make national reflexes sound scary."
"But did we not teach national reflexes to the peoples of Europe at the time when communism and internationalisation reigned supreme?"
"In the face of the internationalisation of communism, we cultivated national reflexes in the people."
"We named the League of Nations 'League of Nations', not 'League of States'; we named the United Nations Organisation 'United Nations Organisation', not 'Organisation of United States', precisely in order to cultivate national reflexes."
"Now we are telling them to abolish these reflexes, precisely because we need to serve the globalisation which is the other face of internationalisation."
"That is the truth, and when you talk about a common energy policy, it means that you are committing the states to not being able to have their own national energy policy."
"If they do not have their own national energy policy, it means that they cannot have better relations with the Gulf States, which have oil, or with Russia, which has energy."
"Consequently, you are taking all the peoples, all the states hostage and, of course, the people understand that and that is why they react."
"Mr President, the improvement of Europe’s economy and of its citizens’ standard of living depends on all the economic entities acquitting themselves well on the global market."
"This requires all the somewhat sluggish European institutions to work efficiently."
"It also calls for available resources to be focused on internal reforms."
"Legal provisions and internal operating procedures must be adjusted to current needs."
"Accordingly, I call for the changes proposed by the President to be adopted by urgent procedure."
"I would like to emphasise that the Financial Perspective is not as good as it could be, and that there is considerable shortfall affecting various sectors of the economy."
"These matters should be dealt with at the earliest opportunity."
"Issues relating to many sectors of the economy such as agriculture should simply be dealt with by urgent procedure, as is the case for energy, amongst others."
"This would enable Europe’s economy to develop satisfactorily in future."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we can all feel it in our bones: these are good times for the European Union."
"The services directive and the Financial Perspective are coming up to the finishing post, the Presidency’s record for the first half of its term is a good one, and there are plenty of winners, including SMEs, young people, the trans-European network projects, and much else besides."
"Let us remind ourselves: the Summit a year ago was a flop, with its debates dominated by accusations and counter-accusations, and everyone saying that the EU was in crisis."
"Half a year ago, the Summit was rejected; the EU seemed paralysed, with little to show for itself, and a large majority in this House repudiated what emerged from the December summit."
"What, then, is happening today?"
"Our Parliament has demonstrated its capacity for driving things forward; none of the three institutions has thrown in the towel, and the Council is once more capable of negotiating and getting the job done."
"Together, we have brought the EU back on course; we can all feel that in our bones."
"We cannot – and I certainly do not want to – separate this success from the Council’s Presidency and from its President, Wolfgang Schüssel."
"His experience, his professionalism, his way of working, his habit of taking action rather than making speeches, has brought us all together and made today’s result possible."
"For that we are grateful, and we Austrians can take pride in it."
"The Financial Perspective has involved the reallocation of a total of EUR 7.9 billion; together with what came out of the Summit, the services directive provides us with the most potent programme for growth and job creation in the EU for years."
"There is more work to be done on it, so that what we have set ourselves we may actually bring to pass."
"– Mr President, I shall try to stick to the facts."
"One fact is that there has certainly been some progress on the energy policy front, at any rate as far as the last Council is concerned, but what we have to concern ourselves with now, Mr President-in-Office, is its implementation."
"What I would like to see is a lot more thought given to implementation and infrastructure."
"Reference has already been made to Poul Rasmussen and his initiative."
"On Monday, we adopted the directives on the Trans-European energy networks; we now have to get our hands on the money for them."
"Since there is too little for that purpose in the European Budget, we must find national budgets that will contribute their share."
"You said that we are all in the same boat, and that everyone has to row;"
"I do not see everyone bent over the oars just yet, but I hope that will happen."
"As regards the foreign policy elements – and this is something I would like to address to the Commission – we have been making this demand ever since the Commission was appointed, ever since it took office."
"It is late in coming, but it is on the way, and I hope that we will get some statements in this half of the year."
"The President of the Council is right to say that our atomic energy policy is a matter for the nation states."
"While I do of course endorse the Austrian approach, the issues of safety and of proliferation, along with the comeback that atomic energy is making, will have major roles to play, and that is where I would like to see more being done."
"Science and research: the list included with the Council conclusions is actually a sad one."
"Two countries – Sweden and Finland – are way out in front, and it is thanks to them that we hit the 3% mark."
"Nor, alas, is even Austria far enough advanced to reach 3%."
"In this respect, too, we all need to pull on the oars, particularly those of us with higher incomes and greater economic clout, who must row more strongly, so that we achieve the 3% we have aimed for."
"My last remark has to do with the services directive. I am grateful for your support."
"This will be an essential element in the social Europe, provided that we can get it through this House and that you can get it through the Council."
"That is quite crucial."
"Although you referred to the employers, you did not mention the employers in the cooperative sector – which is itself of vital importance – or, in particular, the employees’ representative organisations, which have done much to bring about the social Europe."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is true to say that this spring summit has not been a failure, but it did repeat certain errors of the past that I regard as worthy of criticism."
"Promising the creation of 10 million jobs was, after all, strongly reminiscent of the first Lisbon summit."
"The emphasis on youth was something else that tended towards the rhetorical, and, to judge by the French example, the young do not appear to have taken much notice of it."
"I regard the globalisation fund as a reward for those who reject reform; fostering structural change is what the structural and cohesion policies are there for."
"Mr Schulz is also right to say that the Member States would not pull their weight."
"At an energy summit held in Berlin yesterday, everything was up for discussion except the opening up of the electricity and gas markets."
"Not a lot is to be expected of the Member States on this front, and so it is all the more encouraging that the Commission is at last rejoining the fray and instituting proceedings against the Member States, not least the French, in respect of their protectionism on the energy markets."
"The necessary response, then, is not to do as in the past and make promises, but to make more competition possible, and the fact that the Commission is at last doing something about this gives cause for hope."
"I would like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe needs a new energy and transport policy."
"What I would say to Mr Schüssel is that it is yet to be seen whether opting for 20% more energy efficiency and 15% renewable energies amounts to a breakthrough."
"For my own part, I am convinced that the most important thing about this is that we need, in transport and energy, a new culture, so what do I mean by that?"
"If it is indeed efficiency that we want, we need to forge an alliance with artisans and banks in order, at last, to make headway with our stock of buildings."
"We need an alliance with the major cities in order to make our cities, once more, welcoming and pleasant places in which to live; we need less traffic and to be mobile while consuming less oil."
"The reason why this initiative does not, I think, do sufficient justice to this is that the Commission relies too much on big business rather than on an alliance with small and medium-sized businesses and the general public."
"I have three specific questions that I would like Chancellor Schüssel to answer."
"The first has to do with research into energy."
"How do you propose to explain to the Austrian public and to Austrian small and medium-sized businesses the fact that we, in the fifth research programme, will be spending, or intend to spend, five times as much on nuclear power than on renewables?"
"How, too, do you propose to carry on a debate about nuclear issues in Austria and Europe when Mr Barroso has deleted any reference to ‘risk’ as regards the atom from the Green Paper?"
"I have to tell him that an ideology-free debate is one in which we also discuss the risks associated with things nuclear."
"It is with you, Mr Schüssel, that responsibility rests for our having an objective debate, and you cannot simply retreat and shelter behind national independence."
"– Mr President, if we take the twin-track approach to the Lisbon Strategy – considering it once as part of the budget and again through the national plans – then it does indeed get me wondering whether the compromise for which we are currently striving in the context of the European budget will really be enough to make the necessary resources available."
"I say that it will not, any more than will the national budgets, if you care to take a look at those."
"The funds that are needed for research and development, for training and education, are quite simply not being raised as they should be."
"At your summit, you said that more needs to be done for the small and medium-sized business sector, and you were right to do so, but, if I want to do something for the small and medium-sized business sector, if I want to create jobs, then I have to do something to bring about an increase in public investment, and it is an unfortunate fact that that is not increasing, not in the Member States."
"I have to do something to build up domestic demand, and you cannot do that by cutting incomes, by trying to extend people’s working lifetimes, by substituting private insurance schemes for social security systems founded upon the principle of solidarity."
"That is precisely the wrong way to go about it."
"Instead, we need to replace the Lisbon Strategy with a strategy of European solidarity and sustainability."
"Just take a look at the results."
"The risk-of-poverty threshold has not changed; it stood at 16% in 2000, and that is the level it is at today."
"During the same period, long-term unemployment has risen from 3.9% to 4.1%."
"The percentage of people in work has risen from 63% to 64%, which represents a slight improvement."
"We are a very long way from what we undertook to achieve, and the reason for that is that the strategy is wrong."
"This Lisbon Strategy in its present form will get us nowhere."
"Mr President, today, we are looking back on the results of the spring summit, yet another meeting of Heads of Government that has borne no fruit whatsoever."
"The Netherlands has already made the suggestion that two European summits per annum for decision-making are quite sufficient;"
"I would argue in favour of abolishing these talking summits, because the promises made appear impossible to fulfil upon the return home."
"I only need to mention France in order to prove my point."
"French energy companies are carrying out foreign take-overs, but the borders remain closed for foreign take-overs in France, and now that the services directive is on hold, foreign workers are also barred."
"In that way, one step forward is accompanied by two steps back."
"In this context, the riots in France are a demonstration of how difficult it is to reform the social system."
"The Lisbon process is running aground in the protest of the electorate."
"We will need to drive home to protectionist France too, though, that the social system is untenable without reforms."
"The EU may no longer tolerate France’s braking effect."
"If a European summit of Heads of Government were to come to a decision to that effect and to enforce it, then its meeting would be wholly justified."
"Mr President, I have read through the conclusions of the March sitting of the European Council in detail, and I must say that I am very disappointed."
"They are superficial throughout and above all hypocritical."
"The European Council acknowledges in the conclusions the exceptional importance of creating a more favourable entrepreneurial environment and praises small and medium-sized enterprises as the backbone of the European economy, speaking of the need to support them and to support entrepreneurship generally, but unfortunately this is only a paper exercise."
"The European Council has missed a unique opportunity to proceed from words to actual deeds."
"I was expecting the politicians to find the courage to support the Commission’s original proposals regarding services in the internal market, especially the principle of country of origin, and that the Council would thus give clear signals that it really was thinking seriously about developing the entrepreneurial environment."
"That did not happen, however."
"The Council opted for the emasculated and populistic proposals of this Parliament and ended up doing nothing whatsoever for small and medium-sized enterprises apart from issuing words of encouragement."
"I cannot see this being the path to fulfilment of the Lisbon Strategy and greater competitiveness."
"– From my point of view, the challenges that Europe faces today were correctly identified by the European Council: globalisation, the demography question, key sectors of the European economy such as energy and services, research and development, innovation, education, jobs and growth."
"Yet what is the feeling that one is left with?"
"While on the one hand notable progress has been made in the field of energy – progress that six months ago would have seemed unthinkable – there have been other areas in which sadly we have not gone as far."
"Why is that?"
"It is because the Lisbon Strategy committed the cardinal sin of not giving the Commission the responsibility for implementing, and being the focal point for, this strategy."
"The Commission has now made an effort and this is why progress has been made."
"Much more must be done, however."
"The Member States must give the Commission that responsibility and the resources to facilitate this much-needed progress."
"In this regard, I must say that we wholeheartedly welcome the support given to the European Institute of Technology. After all, it makes no sense to have 25 European research policies that are not geared towards the key objective of the knowledge-based economy and that still lack the resources and the critical mass to be able to compete with other more developed economies."
"Consequently, if we wish to send out a clear message today that the Lisbon Strategy is alive and if we want it to be implemented quickly, we must give the Commission the resources to enable it to get the European Institute of Technology up and running, which to my mind would be a very important step."
"Mr President, the people of France will remember two things about the Council."
"The first is that when a Frenchman speaks English, the President leaves the room."
"The second is that when a journalist asks him if a promulgated law should be applied, the answer is ‘yes’ in Brussels and ‘no’ in Paris."
"‘You had better get used to this, no matter how hard you work’: that is what the people of France have taken away with them."
"Trouble is brewing in this country; in the space of ten months it has been subjected to three revolts: the first one manifested itself in votes cast at the ballot boxes and expressed a form of hostility towards capitalism; the second one manifested itself in the riots in our suburbs and expressed a form of revolt against discrimination; and the third one manifested itself in strikes and demonstrations and expressed a form of revolt against all the insecurities linked to employment."
"From that, I deduce – and forgive me for talking a little more about my country – that, for your next Council more than for this one, and irrespective of what you did there, there is an aspiration that needs to be fulfilled, namely mutual trust."
"Our fellow citizens felt that there was much more of an ‘every man for himself’ attitude during that period."
"France must take on its share of the responsibility for this, because it is no stranger to that kind of attitude, but it is not the only one."
"We therefore need confidence, and trust in each other as befits its Latin roots."
"The Commission and the Council must follow this path."
"Another aspect relates to protection because, in a way, our fellow citizens fear that Europe does not protect them enough."
"Good luck!"
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Mr President of the Commission, you are celebrating and patting yourselves on the back. You are very happy with the results of the spring summit."
"Do you believe that European citizens feel the same?"
"I do not think so, because the reform of the Lisbon Strategy which you are promoting sacrifices cohesion and the environment to a neo-liberal version of competitiveness."
"This is precisely what the famous term 'flexicurity' describes."
"After five years of failure, you are setting ambitious targets, with binding timetables for jobs, research, energy and growth; at the same time, the budget is characterised by extreme euro-stinginess and a lack of ambition."
"With what resources and what policies are you going to achieve these targets, when crucial sectors, such as the Structural Funds, the trans-European networks, consumer and health policy, research and education are suffering from drastic cutbacks in resources?"
"Do you believe that you will achieve the targets you have set?"
"My political group does not believe you will and that is why it disagrees with your policy."
"Mr President, the European establishment has a shocking habit of using acts of terrorism, natural disasters, political crises and economic shocks for its political purposes."
"People’s legitimate anger, their anxiety and their political commitment are exploited in order to carry on the fight for a European superstate."
"That is why we have often been forced, here in this Chamber, to listen to endless numbers of speeches inspired by terrorist acts in Madrid and London, the tsunami disaster in the Indian Ocean or the risks of war in the Middle East."
"The speakers, including the President himself, have often shamelessly used these tragic and fateful events to promote a hidden agenda: the fight for a European superstate."
"Now Europe’s energy supply is heading for a crisis, and it is the same old story."
"The 25 ladies and gentlemen of the European Council do not have a clue how energy technology and politics will look in ten years’ time."
"They should not, therefore, establish percentages for biofuels and renewable energy."
"The individual countries must themselves experiment and seek solutions in a free energy market."
"The EU’s task is to maintain a free energy market and coordinate investments in infrastructure."
"Mr President, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, has mentioned ageing and globalisation as two of our key challenges."
"It is important that we should put the former at the very top of the political agenda."
"The ageing of the population in Europe is, in fact, not so much a challenge as a life-threatening problem, not only in terms of keeping our social security systems, and therefore our economies, intact, but also, quite simple, of securing the continued existence of European peoples."
"Moreover, solutions are sometimes put forward that only make matters worse, in fact."
"Just think of the plea for fresh, large-scale immigration."
"The Commission has published a Green Paper in a bid to explore this route."
"Whilst this may serve the short-term interests of some companies or industries, you can certainly not count on public support for it."
"The problems are already incalculable as it is."
"If the EU wishes to alienate itself from the public even more, then it should go down this route."
"A real solution is to encourage young families to have more children, and to create a favourable climate for this."
"If that is not done, the Lisbon objectives are nothing but empty words."
"Mr President, given the great expectations during the weeks prior to the Spring Council, with regard to the possibility of creating a common energy policy, the Council’s conclusions in this field are, on the one hand, hopeful, but, on the other, disappointing."
"They are hopeful in the sense that, for the first time, a Council text includes a paragraph dedicated exclusively to the launch of the common energy policy, because it stresses issues on which the European Parliament has been insisting for a long time, such as the correct application of the existing directives, the need for the Member States to fulfil their commitments in the field of interconnections, the lack of investments in infrastructures and in research and development, and the need to complete the internal energy market: a series of proposals that we hope the Member States will comply with as soon as possible."
"Let us face facts, however."
"Once again, the Council has shown a lack of vision and ambition in the crucial field of energy."
"With the exception of a couple of issues, such as the need to speak with one voice on the world stage and the possible creation of a solidarity mechanism to deal with situations of crisis, the other measures are already provided for in various directives in force and in agreements from previous summits."
"Furthermore, we need a frank discussion amongst Heads of State or Government on the political obstacles that certain governments are placing in the way of the proper operation of the internal energy market."
"Conclusions advocating the creation of a single market cannot be signed when, at the same time, national champions are being proclaimed and a form of protectionism which seriously harms the process of integration is being implemented."
"I shall end, Mr President, by telling the Council that we are pleased with its proposal that the existing obligations should be complied with, but disappointed that it lacks the political courage to establish a genuine common energy policy, which this House and the European Commission are calling for and which the Union urgently needs, because its future depends on it."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I have three messages for you."
"I would like firstly to thank the European Council and Chancellor Schüssel in particular for supporting the Spanish Government at the beginning of the long process of overcoming terrorism following the ceasefire announced by the terrorist group ETA."
"Thank you very much."
"Secondly, I welcome the fact that the European Council has accepted the Hispano-Swedish initiative of a pact for gender equality, which is one of the most important areas of progress in Europe."
"Thirdly, I shall comment on the energy policy."
"At last we are beginning to talk about energy policy, but, rather than attacking protectionism, what we need to do is to create energy policy, and we must begin by creating what in English is known as a level playing field."
"There are currently two liberalised markets in Europe, which are the United Kingdom and Spain."
"What we need to do is to put an end to fortress walls and create European policy."
"As well as preaching to others, the Commission must do its duties."
"It would be interesting, for example, to know what the Commission thinks, from a European point of view, about the Baltic gas pipeline and European solidarity."
"Furthermore, having accepted Parliament’s views on the Directive on the liberalisation of services, the Commission should offer us a directive on services of general economic interest."
"Because we are not talking about a market, but about utilities and companies providing public services, and the Commission is obliged to do its duty."
"I would like to bring up two points: Europe has, and will continue to have, an urgent need for energy."
"However, due to pressure on the part of the European Union and because of a weak national government, Slovakia will have to shut down two units of the nuclear power station at Jaslovské Bohunice by 2008."
"Given the safety features of those units, they could very well remain in operation until at least 2015."
"Slovakia will be receiving only a fraction of the money needed for the shutdown of these units from EU funds."
"This year, two new automobile plants of Europe-wide significance are scheduled to come on stream in Slovakia."
"As a result, the transport system will be struggling to meet the needs associated with delivering supplies and shipping finished products."
"However, under the long-term financial perspective, the European Union is reducing the resources available for trans-European networks by EUR 20 billion."
"This will do nothing to further the trust of Slovakia’s citizens in EU policy."
"Mr President, I begin by welcoming the firm stand of the Council on the situation in Belarus and the sanctions that have been agreed."
"On the Lisbon Agenda, I welcome many of the Presidency conclusions but, sadly, Europe has yet to find an answer to its underlying economic malaise."
"Governments find it easy to sign declarations of intent but harder to put into practice what they profess."
"On the services directive, I admit I am unhappy with the Council compromise."
"I have always urged the British Government and the Council to go further in a liberalising direction, but my words have fallen on deaf ears."
"Mr Blair talks the talk; he says he is leading the way and that the rest of Europe is falling into line, but I think he deludes himself – and not for the first time."
"A truly liberalising services directive would be the most fundamental sign of Europe reforming, which it desperately needs to do now and not at some vague date in the future."
"The most disappointing aspect of the Council was, however, the fundamental failure of leaders to speak forcefully on the rising tide of protectionism."
"We expected to hear something – at least a memorandum – from Mr Berlusconi, as he seems to have spoken on every other subject recently, and from Mr Blair."
"But what happened?"
"The Council meeting could have made clear its determination to fight the protectionist threat to Europe’s prosperity and the functioning of the single market."
"It was the perfect time to seize the high ground and it failed to do so."
"Again, it is left to President Barroso to make the case."
"I congratulate him on his continuing determination on this issue."
"Last week in Florence he said that national governments were giving in to populist temptations."
"I agree."
"It is time to consider what action should be taken against those who seek to attack the basic rules of the single market."
"I also congratulate Mr Barroso on the action he took yesterday to clamp down on energy giants in Europe, which are using their industrial muscle to hinder competition and distort the market."
"This legal action against those who are trying to restrict an open European energy market will be welcomed by all those of us who believe in free markets and the completion of the single market."
"I should like to welcome a delegation of Father Christmases to the public gallery."
"It is slightly out of season – I hope you are going to behave yourselves!"
"At least you are wearing the right colours for this morning – red and white, just like me."
"Mr President, we have reached the mid-term stage of the Lisbon Strategy, with a conspicuous lack of success so far."
"The Union’s priority must now be innovation in its broadest sense, together with investment in knowledge."
"This will lead to economic growth and increased employment."
"It is therefore surprising that yet another Council is cutting expenditure on research and on educational programmes."
"In some cases the percentages of the cuts are actually in double figures."
"How can such decisions be justified?"
"How is the Union supposed to compete when its economic growth is barely 2% and average unemployment has reached 9%?"
"The European Union’s budget has been put on a strict diet, but if it becomes gradually slimmer it will not be able to cope with the needs of an expanding Union."
"In addition, an emaciated Europe will not be in a position to compete with the United States, China, and India, whose economies are robust."
"The compromise reached yesterday on the negotiations concerning the Financial Perspective is certainly welcome and awakens some slight hope that the Lisbon Strategy will not simply remain on paper but will become a priority aim."
"Paradoxically, however, it continues to appear at the end of the list of expenditure, and by that stage funds have usually run out."
"Mr President, I warmly welcome the firm stance adopted in the European Council’s statement on Belarus, and also the position Chancellor Schüssel presented to the House."
"The distinction made by the Council between the Belarusian authorities and Belarusian society is particularly significant."
"This important distinction was proposed by the European Parliament as the basis of the Union’s strategy towards Belarus."
"It is not enough, however, just to condemn the fraudulent elections and the use of force, and to call for those imprisoned to be released."
"More and more targeted sanctions are needed."
"The list of persons banned from entering the Union should be extended and bank accounts frozen."
"The European Union and the European Commission in particular are not doing enough for Belarus and they are reacting too slowly."
"The Union should be providing much stronger and more specific support to civil society in Belarus."
"Belarus should be treated in the same way as Ukraine was in its time."
"Firstly, we should call for the fraudulent elections to be held again."
"Secondly, a sizeable solidarity fund managed by non-governmental organisations should be set up to support Belarus."
"Thirdly, we should call for more than the token effort made to date to ensure that independent television and radio can actually be received in Belarus."
"Belarusians themselves should be employed to provide the information broadcast."
"Fourthly, the scope of certain Union programmes like the Erasmus student exchange programme should be broadened to include Belarus and its civil society."
"Fifthly, and this is my last point, the Union and its Member States should arrange stronger diplomatic representation in Minsk."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I have just two brief observations to make."
"Firstly, I am very glad that we succeeded yesterday evening in achieving agreement on the financial framework, so that we now have enough time to allow things to really take off in 2007, with all the programmes being implemented."
"We are very confident that you, Mr President of the Commission, will very soon approve and review what the Member States have come up with by way of structural policy, so that we do not waste time."
"Since we are talking about the summit, I have a second comment to make;"
"I do not believe that competitiveness can be decreed from on high; it has to grow from the bottom up."
"I would of course like to see all the things you, Mr President-in-Office, quite rightly set out this morning brought to life and implemented on a local basis."
"It is quite plain to me, when I see how, in Germany today, it still takes between seven and eight weeks to set a business up, because people are sent from pillar to post, that it is on the ground that things have to happen."
"I hope that the initiatives you have taken will help to achieve that, and I can tell Mr Schulz that people in Aachen, which is so close to the border, know perfectly well just how uncompetitive German legislation is even in North Rhine Westphalia."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, grateful though I am for the words of encouragement that have been spoken at the mid-point of the Austrian Presidency, we are not resting on our laurels – in any case, there are none – but want to carry on working hard alongside you."
"I would like to make a few brief comments, firstly, on the objectives: What would we like to see?"
"Should we actually be setting ourselves targets?"
"To that there is the inevitable criticism along the lines of ‘what about their implementation?’"
"Or are we not, then, to set ourselves targets?"
"I tend towards the view that, yes, we should be bold enough to set ourselves definite targets, targets that are capable of being reviewed, notwithstanding the risk of one or other country, or perhaps the whole European Union, failing to achieve what we have set ourselves 100%, but the ten million jobs – 2 million a year – is a realistic target."
"In 2005, we managed to create 2 million extra jobs in the European Union, and we can now take pride in the real chance we have now that the economic cycle is in a relatively healthy state and many European countries are beginning an upturn, and this is something we must not talk down."
"Yes, of course it will call for national commitment and for funding of infrastructure."
"In Austria, for example, we are making a very good job of this, and other countries will do likewise, but the goals are necessary."
"To those who have said that the European Council should be done away with altogether, I have to say that I really do think that is the wrong idea."
"What we have to do is invest more time and more energy, and that may even mean meeting more often – perhaps with fewer cannon and mortar effects and less media hype – but real work, hard work, is what is needed if we are to get anywhere."
"Now for my second topic: A number of speakers have described themselves as less than completely satisfied with the financial perspective, measuring it solely against what the Prodi Commission originally proposed."
"Now you are all experts; you know perfectly well that this proposal was not realistic."
"It cannot be said that we now have EUR 200 billion less than what was proposed then; if you compare that with what we had over the past seven years, there has been an increase of over 100 billion."
"There have, in particular, been enormous increases in those programmes that your honourable House regards as important."
"If you take only the example of research and development, provision is made in the budget for an increase in excess of 75% over the next seven-year period."
"The amount allocated to the trans-European networks has doubled; that available for lifelong learning has been increased by 50%, so now between 30 000 and 40 000 more young people virtually right across Europe, have the opportunity to learn."
"For the neighbourhood policy, 40% more has been made available; the foreign policy budget has been increased by 250%."
"There are two options open to us: either we send the people out there the message that all this is far too little – which they will actually believe, for you, Members of the European Parliament, enjoy a great deal of credibility in your electoral districts – or we can say that this is a great advance, bringing us closer to the targets we have set ourselves, and then they will take that seriously and say, yes, that is a significant step forward."
"I repeat: every single one of you knows that, and you are all aware of the position I am in, caught between those who have to pay up and those on the receiving end."
"All that has to be extracted from the national budgets, and you know that."
"The only solution is a new definition of what is meant by ‘own resources’; that is the only way to deal with the situation."
"Getting this Financial Perspective off the ground in the first place was a great achievement, and for it I would like to thank Mr Barroso, the President of your House and all the groups in it, and the negotiators."
"It was not easy, but we do now have the chance to get down to work straight away."
"I really do ask for general support, for people, wherever they are, want to hear that we are getting somewhere with things, and not just about the disputes that go on between the groups and between the institutions."
"Nobody out there is interested in the question as to whether EUR 500 million more could have been found somewhere or whether or not the Council was offering EUR 500 million too much."
"What matters to them is whether we can now get stuck into the job for the next seven years, in the people’s interest and in Europe’s."
"I am ready and willing to do so and I very much hope that we will work together on the constitution issue every bit as well, so that we may well not have a solution in place by June, but we will be able to map out a way whereby we will achieve the better legal basis that we all need."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that the key points have already been mentioned, but I should like to offer you a synopsis of my analysis of this debate, which, I note, is broadly supportive of the conclusions of the European Council."
"An honest assessment would certainly reveal that these results have overall been welcomed."
"It is obvious that not all of the honourable Members are entirely satisfied, because there are naturally differences of opinion."
"There can be no denying, however, that we have seen results in the energy sector, in SMEs, in research, in the employment objectives and overall in the new system of governance of the Lisbon Strategy. Consensus has also been achieved at European Council level as regards the services directive."
"As regards energy, I wish to underline that our work has certainly not finished at the European Council and that the results of yesterday's Commission meeting will show you that the Commission is determined to ensure that all of the principles of Community law are upheld: for example, compliance with the principles of the internal market and with competition rules."
"This is a vital prerequisite if we want to retain credibility, both within and outside the EU."
"As regards SMEs, a particularly important step was the encouragement by the Austrian Presidency and the Commission to reduce the red tape that hampers so many potentially job-creating initiatives by companies."
"As for research, for the first time all Member States were able to accept workable research and innovation objectives, and this is extremely important."
"Equally important was the broad support for the idea of the European Institute of Technology and for the Commission now having a mandate to put forward a proposal."
"The fact that employment objectives were set is also very positive."
"I should like to underline one new aspect that arose at this European Council to which Chancellor Schüssel did not allude, but which I feel is worthy of mention."
"To some extent we already work in team presidencies."
"Chancellor Schüssel, as President-in-Office of the Council, has taken every opportunity to introduce the debate to the Commission, and to the forthcoming Finnish, German, Portuguese and Slovene Presidencies."
"I believe this is important in terms of ensuring the continuity and sustainability of the Commission’s efforts."
"The Commission is also able to provide such continuity and consistency over time because, however good the Council presidencies may be, they change every six months."
"There needs to be constant effort, which can only happen if the Commission takes the lion’s share of the initiative and if Parliament provides constant support."
"These points were positive."
"Similarly welcome were the confirmation of the agreement in principle on the services directive, and the news we received last night, or I should say early this morning, on the financial perspective."
"I am totally convinced that if we achieve practical results, if we manage to resolve problems on a regular basis, we can take this Europe of projects forward, regain the confidence of our citizens and find a better environment for resolving some of the institutional issues that need to be resolved."
"I therefore feel that we can look forward more positively to the June European Council, which of course will not be able to resolve the constitutional question, but which will certainly be able to point the way forward towards defining Europe’s future."
"The Commission is working actively with the Council to this end and we hope to be able to make a worthwhile contribution."
"With this team spirit, this spirit of partnership, Europe can and must move ahead."
"– Mr President, I want to raise a point of order."
"Mr Farage does not appear to be in the Chamber."
"Might it not be that the United Kingdom Independence Party are seated up in the gallery?"
"I have been informed that the Father Christmases are from Denmark."
"The debate is closed."
"We expect a great deal – sometimes too much – of the European Councils."
"The one that was recently held at the end of March was mainly devoted to the economic aspects of European integration."
"Europe is faced with a major problem, the scale and urgency of which was demonstrated by the Russia-Ukraine crisis in January: the absence of a common energy policy."
"Several countries have worked particularly hard on this issue that is crucial to our countries’ independence, including France, which proposed a memorandum that was the subject of a broad consensus."
"The European Council launched an ambitious strategy promoting a secure, competitive and sustainable energy supply for Europe."
"This is a major step forward, to which we must now give concrete expression."
"The Spring European Council also decided to double the European research and innovation budgetary effort over the 2007/2013 period."
"This is essential for the competitiveness of our economies and therefore for Europe’s place in the world faced with the presence of developing countries."
"At the same time, the European Council made official the creation of a Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which was widely sought after by our fellow citizens."
"Europe is undoubtedly going through a difficult period, but that must certainly not overshadow the positive signals given by the implementation of instruments of economic progress and of solidarity."
"Making the European Union the most competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010 involves two priorities, as far as I can see: investing heavily in Research and Development and removing the constraints weighing on businesses, and particularly on the smallest ones."
"Despite the improved agreement obtained by the European Parliament, the European budget will not permit these huge investments to be made."
"The European Council’s appeal for the EIB to enhance its R[amp]D efforts is, in this context, an innovative and pragmatic solution, if EUR 30 billion actually can be harnessed in this way."
"This measure might not be enough to overcome the chronic deficit in European R[amp]D expenditure, and a great effort is still required if the objective of devoting 3% of GDP to R[amp]D is to be attained."
"It is crucial to involve the private sector in this effort, since we can clearly see that public budgets are not enough."
"We therefore need to make progress with taxation in order to encourage businesses to invest more readily in R[amp]D."
"This purposeful policy is what we are awaiting from the revised Lisbon Strategy, which needs to offer a stimulating, effective and, above all, simplified European regulatory framework for European businesses."
"We shall proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, I wish to raise a point of order on the basis of Rule 170(4) and Rule 150(3) of the Rules of Procedure."
"It concerns the calendar and the PPE-DE Group’s amendment to the calendar."
"On the basis of these Rules, I would like to postpone the vote on that amendment to the next part-session because I would like to reopen the political discussion about our working methods in this Parliament."
"As we all know, the fact that we have to travel between our work office and our actual seat here makes life somewhat difficult."
"I myself, especially this week, have found it incredibly difficult to get here and consequently I have missed a vote."
"Therefore some of the Members of this House, including myself, have drafted this motion to postpone the vote."
"We would also like to ask the Conference of Presidents to reopen the discussion about amendments to the calendar."
"Mr President, this week we have debated the issue of better regulation."
"One of the biggest obstacles to better regulation is our calendar of meetings."
"We have 12 weeks a year of plenary sittings here in Strasbourg."
"Frequently there is insufficient business for those plenaries, so we pad out the agenda."
"As a result of that, the committee meetings are constantly under pressure and those codecision committees are now unable to legislate effectively."
"We need to have a debate about how we organise our work."
"This calendar has been introduced without any such debate."
"We would like to postpone the vote on this calendar to the next plenary session, so that those of us who have tabled this motion can debate our working methods, that is to say, how we can improve regulation in the European Parliament and how we can better use the EUR 300 million it costs us to be here for the pursuit of better regulation."
"This is a huge use of taxpayers’ money which undermines the work of this Parliament."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if there is an alternative to Strasbourg, I am all in favour of discussing it; that is what I have always said, but using this as a way of doing so is absurd and unfair."
"It must surely be plain to see that for as long as the Council, unanimously, insists on Strasbourg, we shall have twelve part-sessions in this place, and whether Mr Titley understands English or German or French, he should simply take a look at the treaties, something that might also sometimes be a salutary exercise for Mr Blair’s Government."
"I therefore think that we should have another debate on Strasbourg, but not in this fashion."
"What we should do this week is vote on our calendar."
"By what, Mr Titley, do you justify your assertion that our orders of business here in Strasbourg are not full?"
"You should just try standing in for Mr Schulz in the Conference of Presidents and then you would know that what you claim is a bare-faced lie and bears no relation to the facts."
". Mr President, in the light of a declaration put on the record of this House last night by the Commission, during the plenary debate on the regulation on certain fluorinated gases, the text of which was not introduced during conciliation, and which compromises the spirit of the conciliation agreement and shows great disrespect and disregard for the clear will of Parliament and the Council, I should like to request a postponement of the vote on the two reports on fluorinated gases, at least until tomorrow."
"– Mr President, my group would very much welcome that as a way of enabling us to sort matters out by tomorrow, but if they are not, a further postponement will be necessary."
"We should, at any rate, be able to make good use of the time."
". Mr President, I requested the postponement of the vote on the two reports on fluorinated gases."
"They have been taken together all the way through and I believe it would be more consistent to keep them together."
". Mr President, I would like to say a few brief words to Parliament, because I am very surprised at the behaviour exhibited by the Chairman of our Committee when yesterday evening he sent everyone an email relating to the vote on my report."
"The report was unanimously adopted by the Committee, no one voted against it, and in my opinion this sort of attack by a Chairman against his own Committee is curious, to say the very least, if not extraordinary."
"Accordingly, I do hope that Parliament will understand what this is really about and that it will not accept the two amendments tabled by the Chairman."
"It would be a great mistake on Parliament’s part to adopt his Amendments 62 and 63, as they would undermine the notion of active remembrance which is contained in this programme."
"Mr President, this course of action is, I think, insulting to our Committee."
"– Mr President, I should like to clarify the following: I am a member of parliament and I have the right to table amendments in plenary."
"That is what I did."
"The recommendation and report by Mr Takkula are astounding, but what does our proposal with the two amendments add?"
"It adds totality."
"We cannot only talk of Nazism and Stalinism when, for forty years, Greece, Spain and Portugal had concentration camps in which thousands of people lived for twenty years."
"As committee chairman I followed due procedure, but as a member of parliament I have the right to table amendments."
"That concludes the vote."
"The explanations of vote will take place following the formal sitting."
"Mr President of the Republic of Malta, it is a great pleasure for me to welcome you to the European Parliament today and to offer you the opportunity to speak to its Members, who have been discussing your country at length over recent days."
"You are here today as a Head of State, but we are well aware of your long-standing commitment to European integration, as Prime Minister of your country, for many years — the years of Malta’s journey towards the Union."
"Almost three years ago you signed the Accession Treaty, which was the culmination of many years and great efforts leading to Malta becoming a member of the European Union."
"It is a very important sign of the consensus that exists today in Malta with regard to European integration the fact that last July, you, your country, your — Malta’s House of Representatives — ratified the Constitutional Treaty unanimously, and that you did so after others had rejected it, is a very important sign of the consensus that exists today in Malta with regard to European integration."
"In doing so, you sent a very clear message at a difficult time for the Union and you put an end to the political divisions that had characterised the debate on Europe in your country."
"Your presence here in this Chamber reminds us of something very important: European enlargement has been looking to the East for a long time and now Malta, in the South, is reminding us of our Mediterranean vocation and the need to reinforce our dialogue with the countries of the Mediterranean basin."
"Your country is at the crossroads of the Mediterranean and has always been at the centre of policies relating to Europe’s southern borders."
"Relations with the countries of the South today are the main geo-political challenge facing Europe and your country in particular, which is on the front line in this encounter; on the front line in terms of the arrival of many human beings who want to come to Europe, often risking their lives, because they see us as a new Eldorado, whose standard of living acts as a magnet to people suffering the most extreme forms of poverty."
"We are therefore aware that great numbers of asylum seekers and immigrants are currently reaching Malta’s shores."
"We have been discussing this issue here."
"We have listened to the report drawn up by a delegation from the European Parliament that has had the opportunity to visit the camps."
"They illustrate the most important challenge facing Europe in terms of defending and protecting human rights and building better relations with its neighbours in the South."
"In these special circumstances, Mr President, your visit is very welcome and Parliament therefore has a great interest in hearing what you have to say to us."
"Thank you for being here with us."
"You have the floor."
"Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, it is a pleasure as well as an honour for me to address your institution."
"As a representative of one of the countries that joined the European Union in 2004, I bring with me recent experience of the meaning of enlargement, both in terms of what a country goes through in preparing for membership of the European Union and in terms of the impact of membership on a new Member State."
"My country considers membership of the European Union as a natural return to our home in Europe, where we belong."
"We are proud to be part of the family of nations that forms the European Union, with all its spiritual, cultural and humanistic heritage."
"Our journey towards membership was not easy."
"We had a long and difficult debate leading up to the point, three years ago, when the Maltese people made a clear and sovereign decision in favour of membership by means of a referendum and then of a general election."
"This lively debate gave us the opportunity openly and freely to discuss the merits and dangers of membership, while we scrutinised the possible impact of membership not only in economic terms but also in political and social terms."
"In this sense, it was an exercise through which we brought Europe closer to the people, and it is an exercise with which we should continue."
"The preparations for membership were a burden on those countries that joined during the last enlargement."
"It is true that no enlargement on such a scale had ever previously taken place, and never before had candidate countries been asked to implement such huge reforms as part of their preparations for membership."
"I wish to congratulate all the new Member States of the European Union for having completed such a difficult process."
"I also want in the same way to congratulate the European Union itself on the way it acted as a hugely effective catalyst in encouraging those countries to adopt the reforms."
"We often speak of the pessimism that gripped Europe following the two referenda that took place last year and in which the European Constitutional Treaty was rejected."
"We fail, however, fully to recognise the European Union’s enormous success in absorbing the new countries so naturally."
"Not only was 2005 not an ‘annus horribilis’ for Europe, as some said it was."
"Rather, it was a great success for Europe, for it showed that Europe was capable of facing the challenge of the greatest enlargement in its history."
"We often forget now that enlargement actually took place less than two years ago."
"That does not mean that life is easy after enlargement."
"On the contrary, it is as difficult for the economy as much as for society to adjust to the reality of membership."
"That adjustment requires leaders to take difficult decisions, which are often unpopular."
"In fact, it is necessary for a country to take these decisions, whether or not it joins the European Union."
"Membership of the European Union simply makes these decisions more real and more exacting, as well as inevitable."
"What is certainly wrong is for us to blame Europe for reforms that are unpopular but that, in reality, are the result of decisions that every responsible government must take."
"It is a mistake for governments to blame Europe for these difficult decisions and then to take all the credit for the benefits."
"Mr President, I also wish to share my thoughts on a number of other issues with you."
"I shall start with a few reflections on the European Constitutional Treaty."
"We have to accept that there were shortcomings in the way that the Constitutional project was presented, even if the difficulties concerned were really more a matter of form than of substance."
"To new Member States, the Constitutional project seemed premature and unduly rushed, for example."
"The aspect of timing was a legitimate concern."
"Indeed, countries preparing themselves painfully for membership viewed the prospect of a change to the rules of the Treaty as one might a change to the rules of a race just when the finishing line is in sight."
"I know that the Constitutional Treaty was supposed to speed up decision-making by the Union of twenty-seven, but the citizens of some of the Member States clearly viewed it differently."
"The Union that they had grown up in was altered by the 1995 enlargement and even more by the 2004 one, and in the light of globalisation the Constitutional project appeared to entail never-ending change."
"In retrospect, therefore, we can see that we might have been wiser to have given this important project more time and waited not only until the ten new Member States had settled in but also until all twenty-five members had had time to adjust to the new realities of the European Union."
"Nevertheless, the issue remains of how to escape from the present impasse."
"It goes without saying that the wishes expressed by the people of the two countries that did not accept the Constitutional Treaty have to be respected, but the same could be said of the decisions of the fourteen countries that ratified it."
"In my country, for example, the Constitutional Treaty was adopted by our national Parliament unanimously, and thus our commitment to membership became a foregone conclusion and there was a clear-cut end to our divisions."
"Now is the time to engage in debate and to share our opinions about the possible scenarios we have before us."
"One scenario is to stick to the commitment made by the signatory Heads of State or Government to try to find a solution within the European Council if four-fifths of the Member States ratify the Constitutional Treaty and one or more Member States have difficulty doing so."
"This would make it necessary to continue with the ratification procedure."
"In that way, it would be possible for the agreed process to continue with a view to our deciding afterwards how to proceed."
"Another scenario could include using the first two sections of the Constitutional Treaty to draft a ‘European Charter’."
"This could offer Europeans a clear and concise document with which they could more easily identify. The other section of the Constitutional Treaty may be considered as having already to a large extent been ratified by the existing Treaties."
"Another scenario could include strengthening the protocol concerning the role of the national parliaments."
"Specifically, the latter’s consultative role in relation to the European project could be extended."
"Naturally, there are other options that could be considered, and this period of reflection exists to enable us to do just that."
"Let us not waste it."
"Mr President, I turn now to the subject of political leadership in Europe."
"We often speak of the lack of such leadership."
"This is not the result of a lack of initiatives, and definitely not of European initiatives."
"If anything, it may be the result of a lack of coherence between initiatives, for how can we expect to have political leadership if some of the initiatives do not hang together?"
"What sort of coherence do we have when, on the one hand, we insist on solidarity and, on the other, fail to make the necessary financial resources available?"
"What coherence do we have if, on the one hand, we remove borders and, on the other, create obstacles?"
"What coherence do we have if we call for a collective effort but then allow countries to face difficulties on their own?"
"I do not think that a lack of political leadership can be blamed on the Community’s individual institutions, whose initiatives and perseverance speak for themselves."
"Indeed, any lack of confidence in these institutions should be addressed."
"Being able to inspire confidence is not like having a particular talent."
"It is not something with which we are born, but something that we have to earn."
"We thus need to ask ourselves what we can do to win back people’s confidence in the European Union and its institutions."
"We can do this by once more developing a bond with the people, and in this connection I would praise the work of the Commission which, through Plan D, has taken on the difficult task of bridging the gap between the EU and its citizens."
"As an institution elected directly at a European level, the European Parliament is in an ideal position to support the work of the Commission."
"It is not more words that are needed in order to form close ties with our citizens."
"It is a question of listening more and, if Europe communicates more effectively, it will be in a better position to reflect the aspirations of Europeans and to produce results in all areas of concern to them."
"To strengthen confidence, we must not only communicate better but also be more efficient in the sectors to which the European Union is already committed."
"We can also build confidence by showing that the European Union is willing and able to engage in new common initiatives in sectors where we face new challenges that cannot be tackled by individual countries on their own."
"We have constantly to ensure that the European Union provides more and more value for its Member States and citizens."
"More importantly, however, we can increase confidence in the EU by showing that, when adopting policies, taking decisions and acting both internally and externally, the European Union permits the expression of reason."
"By this, I mean that it consistently reveals a sense of balance and justice in its political development, in its decision-making and also in its dealings with other countries around the world."
"In this regard, there is enough evidence to make me feel optimistic that the Union really can win back people’s confidence, as it is evidently prepared to be on the side of reason."
"Let me cite a few examples:"
"Because I come from Malta, I am also an observer of the way in which the European Union tries to find a balance between the interests of large countries and those of small ones."
"I have always been convinced that, for the European Union, what counts is not the size of the country you hail from, but the strength of your ideas and the clarity of your vision."
"Naturally, size also matters."
"The European Union is, however, unique in the way it develops a model for leadership that balances the interests of large and small countries and often combines these interests in a common interest."
"Due note should be taken of this particular value conferred by the Union."
"It is a virtue that makes Europe what it is: rich in diversity and fully respectful of its Members’ obvious differences."
"It may also explain why small countries feel strong ties to the European project and, specifically, to the Community method."
"The European Union increases the influence of small countries."
"It strengthens their identity and, especially, their linguistic identity, and it really opens up to them the wide horizons of the rest of Europe and the world."
"The European Parliament should also continue to develop this balance and to take account of the particular interests of the small states."
"The European Union cannot and should not be a directorate of large countries."
"The Services Directive is another example of how the European institutions stand out as the voice of reason."
"I praise the work of this Parliament in drafting a compromise on such an important initiative."
"The widespread approval enjoyed by the European Council is also a valid testimony to your work."
"Now that a functional compromise has been found, it is time for the legislative process to be concluded quickly so that Europeans might reap the real benefits of the internal services market."
"Similarly, the initiative in favour of a common energy policy to meet the huge challenge of obtaining a reliable energy supply is another desirable development in connection with which the Commission should be applauded and supported."
"It is such initiatives that show that Europe really deserves people’s confidence."
"However, there are other challenges to which Europe responded too slowly and in relation to which there is always an ever-increasing need for action at European level."
"In these sectors, we have to do more work to permit the expression of reason, to achieve a fair balance and thus to increase people’s confidence in Europe."
"I feel that the work of the European Commission on developing a maritime policy is of particular importance because it is aimed at creating an intrinsic maritime advantage for Europe as a main item on its agenda."
"It is not just because I come from an old maritime nation that I state without hesitation that Europe’s maritime heritage is not being utilised enough at European level."
"We need to adopt a holistic attitude."
"We should not let short-term interests in certain sectors deflect us from the progressive view we take of maritime issues as a whole."
"We should strive to lead the maritime world rather than try to create a privileged space within it."
"We should win the confidence of people not only within the Union but also outside it, showing also that we are capable of increasing their confidence in us through acting justly."
"Our Euro-Mediterranean policy is a clear example of this."
"The complexity of this region, which we share with our neighbours, and its intrinsic connection to the peace process in the Middle East require us, much more than ever before, to be the voice of reason."
"The recent incidents following the publication of certain cartoons unfortunately proved to be a step backwards in this regard."
"These events do, however, give us the opportunity to rebuild confidence even at this level."
"Another challenge comes from the obvious but inevitable consequences of globalisation."
"The answer to this challenge cannot be found in protectionism or in putting aside what has been attained so far."
"There has to be a fair balance between the inevitable consequences of free trade, on the one hand, and the affirmation of the main values of Europe, and not least our social model, on the other."
"It is true that it is not easy to find such a balance."
"However we cannot forget that it is Europe’s sense of balance and reason that distinguishes it from the other actors in the international arena."
"Another challenge, and one that is more visible on the human level, is the challenge of illegal immigration."
"Some days ago, a delegation from your institution visited my country as part of Parliament’s current efforts to visit countries within and outside Europe in order to examine the extent of the challenge of illegal immigration."
"This is a problem that, at the moment, places a heavy burden on the ability of a number of Member States, and not least of my own country, to cope with the seemingly endless influx of people coming mostly from sub-Saharan Africa."
"As your delegation was able to see in talking to immigrants and those seeking asylum, the problem is both real and urgent."
"On the one hand, the Mediterranean faces a humanitarian disaster in which hundreds of people die while trying to reach Europe, while thousands more live in uncertainty and in difficult conditions after having achieved their aim."
"At the same time, the countries receiving a heavy influx of immigrants see their capabilities and resources stretched beyond their limits."
"Clearly, this is not a problem for Malta alone or for any other country alone."
"It is a common challenge requiring a collective effort."
"However, I must emphasise that Malta’s problem is more acute because Malta is the most densely populated Member State."
"Europe urgently needs an immigration policy offering a more practical solution to this problem in all its complexity, a solution offering a typically European solidarity with the people involved in this drama and with the countries of origin, but also with those countries that constitute immigrants’ introduction to Europe and that do not have the means of addressing this problem on their own."
"I therefore thank the European Parliament and the members of the delegation that came to Malta for having placed this item on Parliament’s agenda and for having made our country’s call for urgent action heard."
"If we want to increase people’s confidence in us, we have to show that we are responding effectively to the interests of the people and, to do this, we need to acknowledge the mood of the people."
"Political leaders should not follow, but lead, the people."
"They should not, however, move forward with too much haste."
"Otherwise, they will leave the people behind and be cut off from the realities of the world."
"Here, too, a balance has to be found."
"There are a number of values that distinguish Europe from other continents and the European Union from other projects in the world aimed at regional integration."
"Europe is already distinguished by its full commitment to the values of peace, tolerance, human rights and solidarity."
"The European Union is becoming more and more conspicuous as the voice of reason among its neighbours and in the world."
"For Europe to be the voice of reason, we need to go beyond the bounds of national egoism and work together for our common good."
"We must continue to uphold this value in the action we take both among ourselves and with other countries."
"This is the Europe that people expect of us and the Europe that they are prepared to trust."
"Thank you."
"Thank you very much for your words, Mr President."
"I am sure that your presence here will have given all of the Members a better understanding of your country’s difficulties."
"Thank you for your words of praise for the European Parliament's work."
"I also hope that the alarm sounded by our Members on visiting your country has been heard by all of the people responsible and that both your government and the Union's institutions will do what they can effectively to ensure that the admission policy in Europe shows greater respect for the citizens of other countries who try to come to ours."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues have long supported attempts to ensure that the European Parliament has only one official seat, and that it should be Brussels."
"The cost to the taxpayer of the Strasbourg seat is estimated at around £150 million per annum."
"This is a gross waste of public funds."
"British taxpayers deserve to have value for money."
"We want to carry out our work on behalf of our constituents where it is most effective and cost efficient, namely in Brussels."
"The cost of having to maintain parliamentary operations in both Strasbourg and Brussels has now become indefensible, and we will continue to campaign to have Parliament sit only in Brussels in future."
"– Mr President, I voted in favour of the Roure report on the grounds that it constitutes a very positive initiative in favour of greater security."
"For the first time, the cooperation of liaison officers posted by Member States to serve in third countries is put on an institutional footing and specifically regulated."
"For the first time, too, the cooperation of liaison officers with Europol liaison officers and their coordination by Europol liaison officers in the third countries is assured."
"Moreover, Member States facing potential threats from states in which they have no liaison officers, can be supplied with early information through liaison officers of other Member States."
"The institutionalisation of the cooperation of liaison officers adds to security around the European Union and in its immediate neighbourhood."
"This is in the public interest and in the interest of security within the European Union."
". This proposal follows the assessment of Decision 170/2003, under which cooperation is stepped up between the Member States as regards the posting of liaison officers in third countries and international organisations."
"I endorse the idea of introducing the amendments needed to ensure that the current practice as regards the use of Europol liaison officers is covered and is legally binding."
"In this way, liaison officers from the Member States should establish and maintain direct contacts with the local authorities in the host State or the international organisation, with a view to facilitating and expediting the collection and exchange of information, which should in turn be passed on to Europol."
"The objective is to help establish a spirit of European cooperation between police authorities, in other words, a Community approach to tasks assigned to liaison officers and direct exchange of information between those officers and Europol central command. This will help raise the consistency and effectiveness of the tasks assigned to these officers, and prevent problems of lack of coordination, cooperation and even overlapping."
"I therefore support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and hope that agreement can be reached at first reading."
"Mr President, the tenor of the programme of the Takkula report perfectly mirrors official Europe’s arrogant, condescending attitude following the referendums in France and the Netherlands."
"The dim-witted French and Dutch had not got the message and had to be re-educated."
"The perfect representative of this arrogant elite is Commissioner Michel, who literally stated that the public is not always right and that in cases like these, the politicians should map out the route."
"The present ‘Citizens for Europe’ programme fits into this dubious communication and information strategy."
"By investing hundreds of millions of euros in all manner of meaningless, politically correct projects and organisations, the Commission wants to bring the citizens closer to the Union, or so it says."
"Ironically, the document also refers to Plan D that stands for democracy, dialogue and debate, but in the same month that the plan was presented, accession negotiations were opened with Turkey, although it was common knowledge that the majority of the people in Europe are opposed to this."
"This is exactly the kind of hypocrisy that is meeting with resistance from an increasing number of Europeans."
".I voted in favour of the report by my fellow Member, Mr Takkula, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 2007-2013 a programme to promote active European citizenship."
"It is crucial to highlight this original feature of European integration, which consists in providing Europeans with dual national and European citizenship."
"The Member States’ ability to harbour common ambitions at the same time as upholding our values is strictly dependent on the involvement of the people in European integration."
"We must therefore all work towards this, particularly the MEPs in contact with our colleagues from the national parliaments, who represent the national citizenship of those living in the Member States."
"European citizenship is the binding force that must be promoted everywhere, together with the pride of belonging to a project that is unique and special in the world: the integration of the European Union, which is not a nation but the creation, in peaceful circumstances and by democratic means, of a humanist civilisation."
". UKIP has voted against amendments 62 and 63 on the ‘Citizens for Europe programme’ because they believe that the proposed projects, for which they have every sympathy, should be organised and funded at national level."
"The Swedish Conservatives have today chosen to abstain in the vote on the Citizens for Europe report."
"The report emphasises constructive solutions such as the importance of disseminating knowledge about the victims of Nazism and Communism."
"It is also good that the EU institutions provide information about their activities and about the rights and duties attendant on European citizenship."
"We disapprove, however, of increasing the EU’s financial appropriations earmarked for shaping opinion with a view to developing a European identity."
"A European identity develops through meetings between people and through more thoroughgoing cooperation, not through public institutions’ efforts to shape opinion."
". I abstained from the final vote on this report because Amendments 62 and 63, to which I put my name, were not adopted."
"To my mind, this attempt to rewrite history is appalling."
"The victims of fascism and other dictatorial regimes that have been in power in Europe in the recent past must not be forgotten."
"To vote against Amendments 62 and 63 is a historical and political mistake."
"Given that the main objective of this new programme is to promote the values, conquests and cultural diversity of Europe, to bring EU citizens closer together, thereby strengthening the links that bind Europe’s citizens and institutions, and to promote cohesion between Europeans, one cannot omit the victims of fascism, or overlook the importance of the historical conquest of freedom and democracy, without which countries like Portugal would not have been able to form part of the European project."
"The promotion of citizenship entails much more than simply strengthening democracy and political and social integration in Europe, which the report claims to advocate. The promotion of citizenship entails encouraging the citizens to become involved in defining the policies that affect them directly and indirectly."
"This can be achieved, by means of the following: equal opportunities for men and women; promoting high-quality, inclusive state education; the right to work and to work with rights; the right to free, high-quality healthcare; the right to culture; access to the law; access to decent housing; and peace."
"We feel that people’s individual and collective identity is formed by their collective memory and that this must be brought to the fore, so that we can all be aware of where we come from and define where we want to go."
"We regret, however, that the adopted report will serve to contaminate European history and that the majority in Parliament has opted to contaminate the collective memory on which the identity of current and future generations will be based. For example, they rejected the proposals on supporting initiatives in honour of the victims of fascism …"
"We are not at all well disposed towards some of the amendments by the European Parliament’s Committee on Culture and Education."
"The report is based primarily on an attitude of apparent incomprehension faced with the low turnout in the 2004 European Parliament elections and the fact that the draft Constitution was voted down in referenda in France and the Netherlands."
"The ‘Citizens for Europe’ programme will not help to change the political situation."
"We are opposed to increasing this programme’s budget over and above the EUR 235 000 000 set aside for 2007–2013, as recommended in Amendment 36."
"The aforesaid sum is already too generous."
"The work in relation to local amateur sports clubs smacks of contempt for people."
"In the same way, we note that, important as it is for Europeans to preserve their memories of dictatorships and tragedies in their history, this should happen at national level."
"It is not something for Eurocrats in Brussels to become involved in."
"We have therefore voted against this report."
"I am well disposed towards the report to the extent that it is about EU citizens needing to become more aware of, and informed about, the EU and the opportunities they have to exercise influence."
"I also support the rapporteur’s view that the programme should be accessible to everyone and not just be addressed to well-educated and privileged groups."
"However, I am critical of the wordings that refer to the new Constitution and of the aspiration towards a common European citizenship."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues agree that there is widespread alienation towards European institutions on the part of the citizens of the EU."
"This was demonstrated by the 'No' votes in the French and Dutch referendums on the EU Constitution."
"It is also demonstrated by the low voter turnout at the 2004 European elections."
"We believe that the European institutions need to become more transparent and accountable to the electorate."
"They must also become more efficient and cost-effective."
"Parliament and the other institutions need to operate in a way that gains trust and respect."
"This report approaches those problems in fundamentally the wrong way."
"It will further undermine confidence in the EU with its call for a budget of nearly EUR 300 million of taxpayers' money to be spent on arbitrary projects that seek to impose an artificial European identity."
"We wish to make clear that British Conservatives are strongly in favour of solemn acts of remembrance and commemoration of the evils that Nazism and Stalinism inflicted on millions of people in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union."
"However, we believe that such acts are matters for individual Member States and their peoples."
". Europe's citizens feel very disillusioned and detached from the institutions and the process of European integration."
"The rejection of the Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands has brought this situation into even sharper relief."
"In this context, the Commission has put forward its ‘Citizens for Europe’ programme aimed at promoting European values and active European citizenship."
"The programme provides for the implementation of measures that will bring European citizens together in order to share and exchange experiences, opinions and values, to encourage debate and reflection on European citizenship, via cooperation between civil society organisations, to hold high-visibility events, to carry out studies and surveys, and to bolster other information and dissemination instruments."
"Broadly speaking, I endorse the amendments tabled to this report, especially as regards the title of the programme. The title ‘Europe for the citizens’ reinforces the idea that Europe should act as a means of meeting the citizens’ aspirations and not the other way around."
"– Through the 'Citizens for Europe' programme, the Commission and the European Parliament are unleashing a brainwashing campaign against the peoples of Europe in order to combat increased displeasure at and condemnation of its policy and the questioning of the EU itself."
"Its ideological arsenal rests on two pillars: on sanctifying capitalist barbarity, as the only way forward for the peoples, and on anti-communism, by reintroducing through the back door the 'memorandum' equating fascism with communism."
"With appropriations of EUR 235 million to pay for and pay off all manner of eulogists and propagandists of the European one-way street, it is mobilising the mechanisms constructed years ago and so-called NGOs to cultivate a positive climate and sow delusion in the people as to the character and policy of the EU."
"A similar mission is being given to the reconciled leaders of trades union, so that they can conceal beneath the title 'Citizens of Europe' the major and irreconcilable class differences between the capitalists and the working class."
"The MEPs of the Kommounistiko Komma Elladas voted against the report."
"As far as the amendment referring to the condemnation of Nazism and the dictatorships of Europe are concerned, we abstained from the vote, because it does not refer to the dictatorships of Spain, Portugal and Greece by name and is formulated such that socialist regimes could be interpreted as dictatorships."
". As we know, the EU is enduring a difficult time."
"Fresh challenges are appearing on various fronts; weak economic growth has had a social impact and has posed global challenges to which we have yet to find solutions."
"The biggest challenge we now face, however, is that of the citizens’ opinion of the European project."
"The increase in scepticism and the clear lack of satisfaction with the project of European integration is widening the gap between the citizens and the political decision-makers. We therefore need to rethink the way in which Europe’s democratic institutions communicate."
"I feel that this programme is an important tool in raising awareness of European values among all citizens. It features a range of citizens’ projects, support for the provision of information to European civil society, and the holding of high-visibility events and other events that will help to raise knowledge of the European memory."
"The European project is characterised by respect for diversity and cultural wealth. This is achieved by means of measures that deepen the cohesion between Europeans that is vital if we are to complete the internal market and achieve the sustainable growth and development of our societies."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report."
".I obviously support this report aimed at bringing the citizens and the European institutions closer together, which is something of an objective, if not a necessity in today’s Europe of ever-increasing scepticism."
"This report introduces new lines of thought in relation to communication, to citizens’ projects with a transnational dimension and, above all, to a duty of ‘active European remembrance’, which is a unifying initiative aimed at commemorating the victims of the mass deportations and exterminations carried out under the Nazi and Communist regimes."
"I voted against all attempts to water down the text, some Members having been keen to refer to other forms of totalitarianism in Europe."
"The atrocities committed by these two regimes, and suffered by the nations of Europe as a whole, are at the root of European integration, and it is crucially important that we do not trivialise them."
"Over and above this initiative, our role is to inform, to meet, to hold dialogues, to convince, to ensure that each citizen is aware of how Europe manages its daily affairs, to strengthen the feeling of belonging to Europe, to fight against any form of retreat into nationalism, to make Europe’s added value a reality and to point out the fact that the European idea represents the brightest idea of the 20th century."
"Let us remember that, at a time when some of us are beginning to have doubts, the rest of the world is dreaming of Europe."
".The ‘Citizens for Europe’ programme is nothing other than a propaganda tool designed to benefit the European Union."
"This report notes that the Constitutional Treaty was rejected in France and the Netherlands and that Europeans are sceptical about enlargement, meaning enlargement to include Turkey."
"Yet, far from drawing conclusions from this scathing disapproval, this report seeks to ‘re-educate’ the citizens!"
"An initiative such as town twinning, which has been proving its worth for a long time now, is shamelessly hijacked, while millions of euros will be poured into communication circles and communication actions."
"One amendment, Amendment 14, even encourages actions at Community level!"
"Referring to actions in the field of sport, the report points out, and I quote, ‘In this way, passive or even euro-sceptical citizens can be reached’."
"You actually intend to hunt down those Europeans who, unlike you, are not deluding themselves."
"The made-up expression “active” European values’, as promoted by this report, has no meaning whatsoever. A value is neither active nor passive, it is not a device that we can switch on and off, unless we do what you do, and behave like ideologues."
"– Thank you, Mr President."
"First of all, I wish to thank all those Members, amounting to 30% of Parliament, who, out of respect for my country, heard the speech given by the President of Malta."
"However, I am today standing up to explain the vote in relation to the report on the Cultural Capital of Europe."
"There was a misunderstanding yesterday."
"I was supposed to speak but, for some reason, was not given the opportunity to do so."
"In fact, what I wanted to say was that I abstained, as did my Maltese fellow Members from the Delegation of the Socialist Party, because, of the new Member States, our country was bottom of the list of countries that might be nominated and, of all the Member States including the two new countries set to join the Union, was next to the bottom of the same list."
"I think it unfair that Malta should have been allocated a position in which at least twelve years have to elapse before it can be nominated."
"Thank you."
"We voted in favour of the rapporteur’s amendments, which improve upon the Commission’s original proposal and which safeguard Portuguese interests. A case in point is the recasting of Article 13 awarding a European Capital of Culture to Portugal in 2012."
"It also simplifies the administrative procedures for selecting and monitoring ‘European Capitals of Culture’, and ensures that the appraisal is carried out according to the new, more inclusive criteria."
"As regards the programme, the only requirement is that it must be consistent with the Member State's domestic cultural strategy or policy."
"Accordingly, diversity and the particular characteristics of the cultural heritage of each EU Member State will, in our view, be brought to the fore and dialogue between the various cultures will be facilitated."
"We are well disposed towards the basic idea of the European Capital of Culture event."
"However, we see, at the same time, how the event would take on new dimensions in view of the organisation surrounding it and the EU’s commitments."
"The idea of the European Capital of Culture is a good one, so good in fact that it could be funded in many other ways, for example through local sponsorship."
"Financial resources from the European Union should not be necessary to this project’s survival."
"We are therefore voting against the report but are not opposed to the actual idea of the European Capital of Culture."
"Receiving the title 'European Capital of Culture' is meant to – and should – considerably improve a city’s image, but European Capital of Culture status should not primarily be about a year-long festival in the city and short-term marketing of local culture."
"Newcastle and Bilbao have shown that culture can also have a long-term effect."
"In times when budgets are being pared to the bone, the follow-up costs for new prestige projects are often neglected."
"The proposed Internet portal, as a tool for exchanging information and providing assistance, could be used to avoid problems in the organisation and implementation of the year of culture before they arise."
"It could, at a much earlier stage, avoid applicants unnecessarily spending millions on elaborate advertising campaigns without actually getting the grant in the end, or even, as in the case of the former capital of culture Weimar, having to close down the city museum because of major financial losses."
"In 2009, the title of Capital of Culture will go, once more, to an Austrian provincial capital – Linz."
"The preparations are already underway, and it remains to be seen whether they are being made with the necessary foresight."
"– The restructuring of the institution of the European Capital of Culture comes within more general efforts to integrate and homogenise the cultural fabric of each country, in the aim of creating a single support for 'European culture' which will contain a mixture of subculture, a folkloric presentation of national cultures and modern commercial constructs."
"My country's experience from Athens in 1985 and Thessaloniki in 1997 is miserable in the cultural and economic sector."
"Exorbitantly expensive, historically disconnected, superficial cultural programmes run by venture companies, agencies and sponsors on vulgar, commercial/profit-making criteria which overshadowed any enlightened exemptions."
"Mundane events, rich buffets and tasteless celebrations that marginalised or repulsed anything progressive in Greece or in neighbouring countries."
"That is the 'European cultural model', which also operates as a source of massive profit for various companies."
"The proposed amendment maintains the same character, transferring the cost to the Member States, strengthening supervision and control by the ΕU and calling on the people to pay at national level the businessmen and the cost of the EU policy to impose the European subculture and the 'values' of capitalist barbarity."
"We are voting against the report, calling on the workers and people of art and culture to rise up in opposition."
". Since it was set up in 1985, the ‘European Capital of Culture’ programme has helped to bring Europe’s citizens closer together, by highlighting the wealth, diversity and characteristics of Europe's cultural heritage."
"The programme’s huge success with the citizens has helped to strengthen the European dimension and socio-economic development in the selected cities."
"These benefits can increase exponentially if we take new measures, forming a basic methodology that will enable us to establish synergies that would otherwise not be possible."
"An example of this is the creation of a website with information on the cities awarded European capital of culture, the existing contact networks and exchange of experiences – a strategy that should be extended to all Community programmes."
"I should also like to say that, with its innovation and success, this programme was the inspiration behind proposals that I tabled, and that were adopted by Parliament, aimed at creating a European Destination of Excellence, which will also help promote Europe worldwide."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report."
"This decision does not involve any new costs but gives the new Member States and the enlargement countries the opportunity to choose Cultural Capitals."
"Cultural cooperation is something that can give people knowledge of, and respect for, each other and is something positive."
"The Commission’s power is limited, and it is countries and cities that are responsible for working things out."
"All this is encouraging, unlike the EU legislation that is forced on people and that limits their democratic opportunities for active participation."
"I therefore voted in favour of the proposal, despite its containing a certain amount of woolly Euronationalism."
"– Mr President, I am giving this explanation of vote on behalf of the delegation from the Austrian People's Party."
"We voted against the report because it calls for the currently applicable transitional periods for the free movement of workers to be abolished."
"We voted against this because we expect the accession treaty, which all countries – including the new Member States – signed, to be retained, including its transitional provisions to protect the Austrian labour market."
"This is quite justified, because statistics show that the number of workers from the new Member States has already doubled in the last two years."
"The delegation from the Austrian People's Party opposes the report because, both now and in the future, only Austria can and will decide how long the entry restrictions guaranteed under the accession treaty will be retained in the interests of the Austrian workforce – it could be for up to seven years."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the fact that Commission communication COM 2006 on the functioning of the transitional measures shows that the influx of workers from the EU-10 states into the states with open labour markets has not been at all great and, on the contrary, according to the experts, has had a positive effect by increasing output and improving the economy, and also in view of the fact that the transitional periods have clearly contributed to an increase in the numbers of illegal workers, I consider approval of the report by Mr Őry as a significant initiative which should help to open up labour markets fully in states throughout the European Union."
"Only in this way can we fulfil all of the freedoms set out in the Treaty establishing the European Community, and give a boost to the entire EU economy."
"I have therefore voted for the approval of this report."
"The free movement of people and access to labour markets constitute one of the pillars of European integration."
"Unless we uphold this principle in conformity with the basic values of the Community, we will not catch up with the United States, even if America were to come closer to us; nor will we succeed in slowing down the Asian juggernaut."
"I firmly believe that the concerns of some of the EU 15 countries are groundless, and it is deplorable that they do not accept the recommendations from a European Commission report that has been drafted in accordance with the accession treaties."
"On the other hand, we must praise the decisions taken by those countries that will be opening their labour markets during the European Year of Workers’ Mobility."
"For these reasons, the Öry report should be viewed not so much as a bogeyman, but more as a simple guide on how to achieve the gradual fulfilment of the revised Lisbon Strategy goals."
"It is an attempt to ensure equal rights for the old and new Member States in a united Europe."
"For this reason, I have voted in favour of the report."
"– Mr President, there were transitional provisions when Greece and Portugal joined the EU, too, to enable the labour markets to adapt to the new situation."
"It follows that this is not a way of branding the new Member States as second-class states."
"Moreover, the transitional provisions are also welcomed by the new Member States to the east, inasmuch as they also serve national interests there."
"In view of the high levels of unemployment, particularly in Austria and Germany, and of the increasing pressure on the low pay sector, freedom of movement for workers right now would be completely irresponsible."
"We are already having to deal with large numbers of people pretending to be self-employed, some of whom are evading taxes and social contributions."
"Until companies stop relocating to the low-tax economies in the east and trying to extricate themselves from tariff agreements, and until the market has adapted to the new situation or appropriate accompanying measures have been put in place, complete freedom of movement for workers would be irresponsible."
"That is why I voted against this report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the four European freedoms, that is to say the freedom of movement for goods, services, capital and above all persons, have always been among the things that people valued most highly about the European Union."
"It is therefore incomprehensible, unjust and discriminatory that people from eight new Member States, including the Czech Republic, still do not enjoy the same rights in this respect as citizens from the other EU states."
"The reasons for restricting this fundamental European freedom are entirely unfounded and nonsensical."
"The examples of the United Kingdom, Sweden and Ireland show that labour markets are not under any threat."
"I am pleased that other states are to open their labour markets as well, and I trust that they will be doing so very soon."
"We need a Union in which all citizens share the same rights and the same obligations and not a Union where some are equal and others more equal, as in George Orwell’s ."
"I have therefore voted in favour of Mr Őry’s report."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, along with other MEPs from the Civic Democratic Party I have backed the report from my colleague Mr Őry on the free movement of workers."
"We fully respect the right of individual Member State governments to decide on temporary restrictions in respect of the free movement of workers, within the context of the Accession Treaty."
"We also appreciate the decision of Great Britain, Ireland and Sweden not to make use of this right and we welcome the decision from the governments of Finland, Spain, the Netherlands and Portugal to end these restrictions."
"We are convinced that there are no objective reasons for restricting freedom of movement for workers within the European Union."
"The political reasons for restricting this freedom, however, appear just as compelling to the old Member States as the free movement of workers is important to the new Member States."
"We have therefore backed a call to all governments to scrap restrictions on the free movement of workers within the European Union."
". The vote on this report on the transitional arrangements restricting the free movement of workers on EU labour markets is indicative of the contradictions in Parliament."
"On the one hand, MEPs claim to defend the free movement of workers and to want to put an end to the unfair situation in which workers from the new Member States find themselves."
"Yet when this free movement might lead to equal rights, they vote against, which means that they only want freedom of movement when it leads to low salaries and the loss of rights."
"As such the proposals that we tabled were unfortunately rejected, which were as follows:"
"- believes it is crucial to put an end to the serious exploitation of workers in a number of EU countries arising from the illegal work to which many workers from new Member States and some older ones such as Portugal are subjected."
"- stresses the need for effective monitoring and constant action aimed at ending discrimination, unequal treatment and illegal work, and the need to promote equal rights of workers and to apply the same labour and social legislation to all persons working in a Member State, regardless of their EU country of origin."
"Hence our decision to abstain."
"We defend an efficient internal market and fully support the free movement of workers within the EU."
"This is one of the fundamental freedoms under the EC Treaty."
"The free movement of workers helps to create more jobs and to strengthen the EU’s competitiveness."
"We are proud that Sweden is one of the three countries not to have introduced any transitional rules."
"We regret that the Heads of State or Government decided to introduce transitional arrangements in the accession agreement with the ten new Member States."
"At the same time, we respect the fact that individual Member States choose to act on the basis of the opportunities provided by the accession agreement entered into."
"In the report, the European Parliament calls on the Member States to abolish the current transitional arrangements."
"We believe that this issue should be decided on by individual Member States at national level."
"We are thus opposed to the European Parliament shaping opinion with a view to influencing the Member States to take a particular line on this important issue."
"Nor do we believe that the EU should carry out information campaigns concerning the free movement of workers."
"We have every confidence that the respective national authorities can carry out this task satisfactorily."
"We also question the proposal to introduce a scheme for ‘the systematic monitoring of migration of workers within the EU’ and to provide the necessary funds for this purpose (paragraph 11)."
"We have chosen to vote against this report."
". From 1 May 2004, three ‘old’ Member States (Ireland, the UK and Sweden) opened up their labour markets without restrictions to nationals of the ‘new’ Member States."
"The other Member States of the EU-15 have opted to apply national restrictions under the transnational arrangements."
"In the UK, after the labour market was opened up, 60 000 job seekers arrived from the new Member States in 2004; the two sectors chiefly concerned were agriculture and fisheries."
"Given the high number of vacancies, the influx certainly did not increase unemployment in those two sectors."
"On the contrary, the immediate effect it had was of improving the profitability and competitiveness of the businesses concerned, raising their productivity and strengthening their financial position."
"In macroeconomic terms, the policy of opening up the labour market translates into a marked increase in the British growth rate."
"According to the expert reports available, migration of workers from the ten new Member States has helped to increase production and create new jobs and has substantially reduced the number of illegal workers."
"I welcome these positive benefits."
". Supplementing the free movement of capital with the free movement of labour is hailed as an act of solidarity."
"The reverse is true in practice, though."
"It reinforces exploitation and creates unnecessary conflict among workers from different Member States."
"Rushed implementation leads in the receiving countries to insufficient control of the application of minimum wages and collective labour agreements."
"Despite the restrictions that apply until 2011, employees from new Member States are already being used in order to force down labour costs."
"A study carried out by my party, the Socialist Party in the Netherlands, has shown that the influx of workers from new Member States has resulted in people being pushed aside in the labour market, unfair competition for small businesses, cheap labour being exploited, bad housing and working conditions and wages under EUR 3 per hour."
"Many Dutch lorry drivers have already been replaced by Polish drivers."
"According to a study which the Socialist Party carried out among contractors in the Hague region before, many building companies are also badly affected by unfair competition from Eastern European countries, against which the Dutch trade unions mounted a campaign in March."
"In the countries of origin, there is already a shortage of qualified employees in some sectors."
"As my party campaigns against such a neo-liberal free market, I will be voting against the Öry report."
". The report on the transitional arrangements restricting the free movement of workers on EU labour markets is a timely one, as it coincides with the publication of the Portuguese, Spanish and Finnish decision to scrap the barriers that have been in place since 1 May 2004."
"The free movement of workers is a core element of the EU, in that it represents what is generous about the Union and is indicative of the actual construction of a common area."
"There was a time when the inhabitants of Eastern Europe wanted to escape from their countries but were unable to do so."
"Nowadays there is certainly hope for a better future for those countries, and the expectations engendered by accession have led to a belief that their national economies can develop, as events have borne out."
"What is more, the countries that have removed restrictions, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden, have not witnessed major increases in their migratory flows in comparison with other Member States – some, mostly temporary, work permits have been granted – and have in fact confirmed that these immigrants have had a positive effect on their economies, as has been well documented."
".I am obviously, as a matter of principle, in favour of opening up labour markets in the EU-15 to workers from eight new Member States."
"In 2004, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden opened up their borders without restriction."
"Two years later, a Commission report is defending this political approach, with figures to support it: there are fewer migrants than anticipated and they are filling jobs left vacant in certain sectors."
"However, since we cannot allow ourselves to be naively optimistic, I am also in favour of the provisional measures taken in this area by the majority of the Member States."
"That is why I support the Belgian Federal Government’s decision to keep certain conditions of access to the job market until 2009 at the latest."
"These restrictions are limited in scope and do not apply to the independent professions, such as shopkeepers, craft workers and liberal professions, which have enjoyed total freedom of establishment ever since enlargement."
"First and foremost, these restrictions are limited in time, and deal with both the real situation on the ground and the sometimes unfair competition between European workers and employers."
"We must give the ‘unprepared’ Member States time to implement the registration and monitoring structures that are needed in order to enable workers to move freely outside of their countries of origin."
". We recently celebrated 20 years of Portugal’s accession to the European project."
"From the outset, Portuguese workers saw their freedom of movement restricted by barriers put up by Member States fearing disruption to their labour markets."
"History is repeating itself and workers from the eight new Member States from the east are now experiencing the same ordeals."
"I voted in favour of this report because it has been shown that, just as in 1986, migration from these countries has had positive effects on the economies of the Member States that have decided to open up their labour markets. Those countries have found that there are no longer any valid reasons for maintaining such restrictions to freedom of movement."
"It is precisely restrictions of this nature that foment illegal work and the exploitation of workers."
"Above all, this is a matter of solidarity towards the new Member States."
"The EU must not respond to the challenges of the world with the kind of nationalism and protectionism practised in some of its Member States."
"All European workers are needed to improve business competitiveness and thereby increase economic growth in the EU."
". I support the Öry report on the transitional regulation which restricts the free movement of workers in EU labour markets, and I do so because I share the view that it would be preferable if all Member States, including Belgium, were to abolish transitional measures."
"The three countries that have opened their borders have not been faced with a large-scale migration flow."
"Meanwhile, we have proof that transitional periods lead to considerably more moonlighting and feigned self-employment, which puts wages under pressure and causes employees to be faced with bad and unfair working conditions."
"The restriction of the free movement of employees from the new Member States is discriminatory, leads to exploitation and bears witness to short-term thinking that is out of touch with today’s reality."
"This report can ensure that by abolishing the transitional periods, social rights are no longer blocked and the road for a social and just Europe is cleared."
"What is crucial is that a European labour market is created where there is equal pay for equal work, that equal working conditions should apply and that all employees should be guaranteed equal access to social rights."
"At the same time, the social inspectorates must also be reinforced and cooperate transnationally."
". This report on the free movement of workers identifies the improved profitability and competitiveness of businesses in Ireland, Sweden and the UK – countries that have opened their labour markets."
"The British experience has shown that the UK was right to take the bold step of opening up its labour market."
"British growth and productivity rates have proven that fears about opening EU labour markets are unfounded."
"A single market cannot function properly whilst labour markets remain protected and sealed off."
"The UK has shown how free labour markets, coupled with proper social protection, can boost a prosperous economy."
"This has led to the longest period of sustained economic growth in living memory in the UK."
"The European Parliamentary Labour Party believes that European labour markets should be open, like the UK's, and should not fear tides of immigration."
"The next item is the statement by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the statement by the Commission on the situation in the Middle East following the elections in Israel."
". Mr President, I am speaking to you here in the European Parliament at a time which I believe to be critical to future peace in the Middle East, immediately after the creation of the new Palestinian Government and the elections in Israel."
"I would like to talk briefly about the current situation and draw a few conclusions in relation to the responsibilities the European Union should take on at this moment which could be absolutely crucial to future peace in the Middle East."
"I would like to begin with the situation in the occupied territories."
"As you know, Hamas has taken control of the government; it is not a coalition government, but a Hamas government, and unfortunately the programme presented by its Prime Minister, Ismail Haniya, is not acceptable to the international community. It does not give any clear indication that the Hamas government is prepared to respect the principles established by the European Union, and not just by us, but also by the Quartet and by the international community, in a very broad sense: to renounce violence as a means for resolving conflicts — and this conflict in particular — to recognise the State of Israel and to respect the previous agreements signed by the Palestinians and Israel."
"Mr President, I believe that those principles are minimum requirements if the political ideal that the European Union has always defended is to be realised."
"That ideal is no less than a negotiated solution leading to the creation of a viable Palestinian State living peacefully alongside Israel, within the framework of the principles of international law."
"It is clear, Mr President, that there can be no negotiation if the parties do not recognise each other, there can be no peaceful arrangement if the parties believe that arms can resolve the conflict and there can be no solution based on the principles of international law if the parties disregard the fundamental principle that agreements must be complied with."
"We believe that all of this has inescapable consequences as far as the European Union is concerned."
"We must wait and see what happens in the future, but for the moment it is impossible for Hamas to be seen as a valid interlocutor unless it changes its views."
"Mr President, please allow me to say a few words about the result of the Israeli elections."
"There is no question that this result can be interpreted in many different ways."
"It would not be appropriate for me to carry out a detailed analysis of the result of these elections, but I believe that a few comments may help us all to find formulae that allow us to carry out an analysis with a view to identifying different ways to work."
"I would like firstly to point out that, although there has been a clear winner, the Kadima party, it has not achieved the results it wanted, and that may have a certain impact on the negotiations on forming a coalition government, which is essential, although Mr Olmert has already chosen the Labour Party as the foundation for his coalition."
"Secondly, and I believe this to be important, I believe that we must take note of the fact that the election result shows a shift away from the strictly political towards the economic and social."
"I believe that that analysis can explain the result achieved by the Labour Party, and that achieved by the Pensioners' Party or those parties with a limited social or linguistic base, including the Shas party or the Israel Beitenu party, the party of the Russian-speaking community."
"Thirdly, and I believe this is perhaps the most worrying thing for all of us and for the peace process, I believe that the elections have demonstrated a consolidation of a desire for what I would call separation, perhaps illustrated by the completion of the wall and the absence of dialogue between the two peoples on defining Israel’s borders."
"We view this as an unsustainable situation."
"We have always argued that the final borders could only be established on the basis of a mutual agreement."
"We are therefore in favour of negotiation in order to resolve these problems, as we have always been."
"The inward-looking focus of the Israeli electorate has a parallel in Hamas’s desire to focus on Palestinian issues and to ignore an Israel whose right to exist it still rejects."
"And we cannot ignore the fact that all of this has consequences in terms of the possibility of applying what we have seen as the roadmap. Although these are difficult times for that roadmap, it must continue to be the reference point for seeking a definitive solution to the process."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, beyond the aspects relating to the Middle East peace process, the victory in Palestine of a movement such as Hamas, which is affiliated to the Muslim Brothers, in elections that were free and democratic, as acknowledged by the Union’s own observers, is a complete novelty."
"The European Union does not want the Hamas government to fail, and it must not want that, on principle."
"What we want is for that government, as well as respecting the principles of which it is well aware, which have been proposed by the international community, also to apply the principles of law, the rule of law and democratic alternation, and to preserve the pluralistic nature of Palestinian society."
"If it does so, we will be able to look at Hamas as a fully legitimate political body."
"Within this context, what position do I believe Europe should take?"
"I would like once again to stress something that is absolutely clear: a satisfactory solution to the conflict has been, is and will remain a fundamental priority for us, the Europeans."
"Now, more than ever, we must insist that only a negotiated solution can be stable and lasting."
"We must therefore continue to put pressure on both parties to commit to a negotiated solution based on the existence of two States."
"I believe that we should also reiterate today that the European Union believes that peace must be based on respect for the 1967 borders and that only territorial changes agreed by both parties will be acceptable."
"As you know, the European Union’s role over recent months has increased considerably; we now have two operations on the ground: a police operation and the important operation at the Rafah border crossing, which is still very much active."
"More than 200 000 people have crossed from Egypt to Gaza and from Gaza to Egypt since it was opened in November thanks to the presence of generous people from the European Union."
"Mr President, our fundamental objective is to get through the period ahead of us, which will remain a period of some uncertainty, in such a way that, when better conditions are in place for a negotiated peace – and I hope that will be soon – the European Union can continue to enjoy the trust of both parties and make an active contribution to achieving peace when that time comes."
"With regard to the fundamental parties in the conflict, our principles at the moment are clear and are as follows."
"With regard to Palestine, the European Union will continue to support President Abbas and the peace programme on the basis of which he was elected by an enormous, overwhelming, majority of Palestinian voters, and we must not forget that."
"Consistent with the Quartet’s statement of 30 March, the European Union is currently reviewing its programmes of aid to the Palestinian authorities."
"Until Hamas expresses unequivocally that it intends to respect the principles of the international community, we clearly will not be able to talk about ‘business as usual’."
"But I would also like to make it very clear that the European Union will maintain aid for the Palestinian people, and it must do this for at least two reasons: firstly, because it is a moral imperative, which the European Union must never renounce — it has not done so in the past, it is not doing so today, and it will not do so in the future — and, secondly, because the humanitarian crisis and instability in the occupied territories do not benefit anybody, including Israel itself."
"Ladies and gentlemen, another of the European Union’s fundamental objectives is to preserve the institutional structure of the Palestinian Authority."
"The European Union has invested a lot, has devoted resources and effort to the creation of that Authority and believes that it must be maintained, so that one day there may be a viable and democratic Palestinian State."
"With regard to Israel, Mr President, the European Union must continue to reject any unilateral measures that may jeopardise the two-State solution."
"In particular, the Union will be watching the development of the situation in East Jerusalem, in the Jordan Valley, where Israel is carrying out actions that are particularly damaging to the Palestinians, as well as the construction of the separation barrier."
"In accordance with international humanitarian law, Israel has a series of obligations as the occupying power."
"To facilitate the transit of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian population is fundamental, but beyond a strict interpretation of this obligation, Israel should also facilitate movement within the occupied territories in order to make economic sustainability possible, without compromising the security of Israelis, which nobody wants to see."
"In this context, I believe that it is urgent for the parties to apply the Agreement on Access and Movement, which was signed in November 2005 in Jerusalem, and I was present at is signature."
"That Agreement led to the opening of the Rafah border post – where the Union plays a role, as I have said – and other mechanisms for transit between Israel and the occupied territories."
"Israel – and allow me to stress what I am about to say as emphatically as possible, and I hope that everybody understands it, including our good friend, the future Prime Minister, Mr Olmert – must transfer the money that it collects through tariffs and taxes on behalf of the Palestinian Authority – and which does not belong to it – to that Authority."
"Israel cannot and must not hold on to this money."
"I would like to state as loudly and clearly as possible that we are prepared to work with both parties to ensure that those resources are used for good purposes and I believe that that will be possible, if there is sufficient will on both sides."
"Thirdly, I would like to say a few words about the international framework and the Union’s objectives."
"We must continue to work within the Quartet."
"Defending international legality requires the decisive support of the whole of the community of nations which are currently to a greater or lesser extent represented in the Quartet."
"We must also involve the Arab States, which can, and today must, do much more from economic and political points of view."
"In this regard, I would like to refer to the initiative of the Beirut peace plan, with a view to bringing Hamas closer to that plan as well, a plan that on other occasions has been called the ‘Arab peace plan’, since I believe that may offer certain possibilities in terms of progressing in that direction."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that at this point we must not forget that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict falls within the context of a serious crisis that affects the whole of the Middle East region."
"We must work on the peace process, bearing in mind the positive role that the States of the region can play, but also bearing in mind the negative role that certain States can play, and certain negative influences and negative repercussions, such as the situation in Iraq or the situation in Iran."
"Mr President, I shall draw to a close so that you do not have to ask me to stop."
"The results of the elections in the occupied territories and in Israel have undoubtedly created a new situation."
"I believe that the European Union must approach it on the basis of two principles which may apparently, but only apparently, seem contradictory: rigour and flexibility."
"Why rigour?"
