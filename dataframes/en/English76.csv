"In order to maintain the principles that have defined Europe's position since the Venice European Council of 1980, that is to say, respect for the rights of the Israeli and the Palestinian people, which must be consolidated in a negotiated solution, which leads — as I have said so many times and all of you have repeated — to the creation of an independent, sovereign and democratic Palestinian State living peacefully alongside Israel."
"And flexibility, in order to adapt to the development of a reality on the ground which is going to change, which can be changeable, and to support any solutions that may allow progress to be made towards peace."
"I would also like to address the Palestinian Government in a very direct way from this Chamber, which represents the heart of the European Union."
"Hamas cannot change its past, but it can and must change its future."
"I would like to say to the leaders of Hamas that if they decide that there is no place in that future for terror, for violence or for denying the reality of the State of Israel, the European Union will know how to respond appropriately, as it has always done."
". Mr President, I think Mr Solana has already covered nearly everything, but let me add a few comments because the Commission is facing a very difficult period of profound and rapid change in the Middle East."
"How we react and how the parties position themselves will have a determining influence on the prospects for moving towards what I hope will be a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"We have congratulated acting Prime Minister Olmert on Kadima’s election victory."
"This undoubtedly represents some shift in Israeli politics and we await with interest the outcome of the coalition negotiations currently taking place."
"That will take some time."
"Let me underline that we, as the European Union, stand ready to work with the next Israeli Government to promote security and peace, but for both Israelis and Palestinians alike."
"I am convinced that the majority of the population in both countries profoundly desires a peaceful and sustainable solution to the conflict."
"As for the European Union’s bilateral relationship with Israel, our sincere wish is to reinforce a strong, balanced relationship between us, reflected in our Association Agreement and in our ENP Action Plan."
"We want to continue the progress that already has been made in implementing the action plan in areas such as human rights, the protection of minorities, research and development, as well as economic integration."
"There has been much speculation about the impact these elections will have on the prospects for peace, which Mr Solana has just tried to outline."
"One might be tempted to believe that the election result broadly endorsed acting Prime Minister Olmert’s avowed intention to proceed with the establishment of permanent borders for Israel by 2010, following further disengagement from the occupied West Bank."
"The question for us is how this will be done."
"We strongly believe that Israel’s legitimate security concerns cannot be met – and I would like to reiterate this on behalf of the Commission – through unilateral action or decisions imposed by force."
"Only a negotiated settlement will be sustainable."
"The European Union would only support changes to the pre-1967 borders that were agreed by consensus between the parties."
"We support a two-state solution leading to a final and comprehensive settlement of the conflict, with Israel and a Palestinian state living side by side within secure and mutually recognised borders."
"I think it is important to say again and again that we should underline to our Israeli partners the importance of refraining from any action that may prejudice final status negotiations."
"The Commission expects the next Israeli Government to reaffirm its commitment to a negotiated solution by full implementation of the Quartet’s roadmap, and to show this in deeds as well as words."
"But as ever, we have to work with both sides."
"Just as we must be clear with the new Israeli Government, we also have to be very firm with the new Palestinian Government."
"There can be no compromise on the Quartet’s principles – Mr Solana has just outlined them, we have mentioned them in the Council statement, we have also mentioned them in the Quartet."
"We expect the new Palestinian Government – sworn in last week – to commit to the principles of non-violence, recognition of Israel and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including the roadmap, which then bind the Palestinian Authority to the fundamental principles of peace, democracy, respect for the rule of law and human rights."
"Of course, we have heard quite a number of comments, some of which go further; but we have also seen some very slight signs of possible solutions, possible changes."
"We are fully aware of the considerable economic and humanitarian needs of the Palestinians – and indeed we do not want to let them down – and of the need to break the vicious cycle of poverty and extremism."
"That is why the Commission has already mobilised over EUR 120 million to help meet the basic needs of the Palestinians and to stabilise the finances of the caretaker government, which has just left office."
"That is why we intend to continue to provide emergency humanitarian aid and assistance for basic human needs."
"But, and I must repeat this because it will be the basis for what can be done, unless the new government complies with the Quartet’s conditions, there can be no ‘business as usual’."
"Unless circumstances change, there will inevitably be an impact on assistance to the Palestinian Government, which the Commission is now reviewing in line with the Quartet statement."
"In this regard, we are just preparing the next Council, where we will try to come up with lines of approach; we will not have full solutions, but we will try to move in the right direction."
"So the onus is clearly on the Palestinian side, and on the new Israeli Government to act responsibly in fulfilling its obligations."
"I firmly believe that both sides, especially the population, are tired of the conflict and desperate for peace, but it is up to their leaders to show responsibility and statesmanship as we move forward."
"It is in their hands, and only in theirs, to put an end to the violence and despair that has blighted the lives of so many generations."
"We are ready to work both within the European institutions and with the international community to make this possible, even in the most difficult circumstances."
". Mr President, having heard the statements by the High Representative and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, I believe that the terms of the always complex equation of war and peace in the Middle East are very clear: a coalition government in Israel, following the 28 March elections — the Commissioner has made a statement in which she said that we must move ahead with the development of the association between the European Union and Israel — and a government of a single hue, Hamas, in the occupied territories."
"As Mr Solana has said, all of this comes within a context of positives and negatives."
"Positive; the entry into force of the European Union-Lebanon Association Agreement on 1 April — the next meeting of the association council will take place over the coming days."
"Negative; the situation in Iraq and in Iran, in relation to which we should really wait for the 30 day time limit that the United Nations Security has set for Iran to comply with the demands of the International Atomic Energy Agency to elapse."
"I believe that our political group has no option but decisively to support the Quartet’s decision to call upon the Hamas Government to renounce violence and to recognise the State of Israel, as well as the agreements signed by the Palestinian National Authority."
"Within this context I would like to put three questions to Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner."
"The first is whether, during the meeting of the Quartet on 30 March, they noted any dissent from Russia, in view of Hamas's visit to Moscow and the European Union’s position on the Belarus elections."
"Secondly, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, it is clear that the European Union must continue to provide humanitarian assistance, because the situation in the Gaza Strip is horrendous, and the number of people living in poverty has rocketed."
"But what does the European Commission intend to do in order to ensure that that humanitarian aid is not used for the purposes of terrorist activities?"
"Finally, Mr Solana, we all understand the need to support the Palestinian National Authority, but, in a context such as this, is the Palestinian National Authority still relevant, when it comes to working with a government that has not recognised the agreements previously signed by that authority?"
"I shall end, Mr President, by saying that, this morning, the President of Malta has said that the European Union’s voice must be the voice of reason, and I believe that both Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner have demonstrated very clearly that they are the voice of reason for the European Union, which must continue to work on this damaging Middle East conflict for the cause of non-violence, democracy, peace, harmony and reconciliation."
". Mr President, the agitation that had preceded the Palestinian and Israeli elections is subsiding, and the situation is clearer."
"We find ourselves faced with new parties, new actors and new difficulties, but perhaps also faced with hope."
"Both the Palestinians and the Israelis want an end to the conflict and feel the urgent need to fight against poverty."
"This equation is not bad after all, and if the European Union wants to play a part in it, then it must tackle three problems."
"Firstly, it must support Palestine financially, and that includes not only the basic needs, but also the public services that are on the verge of collapse."
"In Gaza, where 35% of workers are employed by the Palestinian Authority and where 75% of Palestinians live below the poverty line, famine is starting to become rife, employees are no longer being paid and, according to official sources, avian influenza could combine with human influenza and give rise to the dreaded pandemic."
"This support for the public services cannot, however, take the form of support for an unofficial presidential administration that would set itself up more or less as an opposition force."
"Secondly, the European Union must hold talks with Hamas, under certain conditions, certainly, but it must hold talks."
"Mr Carter had already as good as said this back in January, and Mr Clinton recently affirmed it."
"For all those who remember the many terrorist movements that have become respectable political parties, but also for all those who want peace and who respect the electoral choice of nearly half of the Palestinian population, it is vital that we begin talks and it is vital that we open negotiations."
"Hamas is abiding by its truce, and its Foreign Affairs Minister has just, to everyone’s surprise, I admit, half-opened a door by not excluding a two-State solution."
"Let us seize this opportunity."
"The idea of backtracking and of acknowledging the State of Israel on the basis of the 1967 borders is already, in itself, a negotiation, because it implies that Israel itself recognises this drawing from 1967."
"Thirdly, the European Union must obtain a guarantee from the Israeli Government that the unilateral disengagement plan is only a plan B and not a plan A. It is true that it is more difficult to negotiate peace than to ensure a reasonable level of security for oneself by unilateral and forceful means."
"If, however, the unilateral convergence plan turns into Israel’s secret programme, then that will mean not only the end of the road map and of any bilateral initiative, but also the end of any hopes of peace, and Europe will lose any credible influence it has in that part of the world."
"There you have three problems requiring solutions, but I have seen that you have already grasped the main lines of action in relation to this."
"Mr President, the Palestinian and Israeli electorates have indeed dealt us a complicated hand."
"Each electorate seems to have favoured a party that is determined to act unilaterally and declares that it will not recognise or negotiate with the other."
"I am fully aware that there is a very important distinction between denial of a state’s right to exist and refusal to recognise the legitimacy of a party that, until now, has not officially renounced the use of violence."
"So, the situation looks pretty bleak."
"But could it be that each electorate has given priority to internal concerns, to matters that influence their everyday lives?"
"Could it be that the Palestinians want an end to corruption, internal strife and administrative incompetence?"
"Could it be that the Israelis want better economic prospects, social protection and a more equitable system?"
"Could it be that each electorate voted in favour of what it saw as its own best interests, rather than against the other people?"
"If that is the case then there could be some hope."
"If Hamas recognises Israel, continues to observe the ceasefire and does not resume violence; and if Israel engages in easing the many restrictions, guarantees real rights of defence to the hundreds of Palestinians held in administrative detention, and refrains from holding people indefinitely in such detention, both the new Palestinian and the future Israeli Governments might find themselves somehow able to work together, if only to keep life going."
"I know it is a far cry from calls to revive the peace process, but maybe in the short term we can only hope for small steps in the right direction."
"We send our best wishes to both sides."
". Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Solana, ladies and gentlemen, it is difficult being intelligent at the same time as having a line of action and it is also difficult being faced with negotiating partners who, on both sides, only want to hear part of the truth."
"Thus, you have a Palestinian Government that wants unilaterally to define what constitutes Palestine and what must not constitute Israel, and an Israeli Government that wants unilaterally to define what constitutes Israel and what must not constitute the Palestinian State."
"Under these circumstances, I believe that we need to look at actual examples."
"Thus, if you take the problem of drinking water in that region – and Mrs de Keyser spoke about avian influenza – you cannot tackle the problem of drinking water or of avian influenza without negotiations being held between the Palestinian Government and the Israeli Government, because drinking water comes from the West Bank and goes to Israel."
"It is the same water."
"If the USD 230 million are not granted by the European Union, then there will be no drinking water either in Israel or in the West Bank."
"Who wins?"
"No one!"
"Let us consider some examples: avian influenza."
"If it affects Gaza, then it affects Israel."
"You cannot stop it any more than the unilateral withdrawal from Israel could."
"It is not possible."
"Not even Israel can do that."
"Circumstances therefore exist in which the European Union can force the governments to negotiate because their vital interests require this, and the environment is one such example."
"Secondly, as regards the road map, why not make a quintet out of a quartet?"
"Let us include the Arab League, let us take the Quartet together with the Arab League and let us enter into negotiations by saying, ‘the Arab League is present, so Mr Abbas and Israel will have to negotiate simultaneously with the Quartet and the Arab League’."
"There might be some intelligent human beings who ban one or two Palestinian representatives from the Arab League delegation, and that would not be a bad thing."
"Therefore, we can and we must be inventive, we must be intelligent and we must say things clearly."
"The wall is not just a security measure, it is a territorial conquest, it is unilateral and it runs counter to all of the European Union’s principles, just as the non-recognition of Israel ran counter to the European Union’s principles."
"They both run counter to the European Union’s principles and this requires an explanation."
"A wall built inside the 1967 borders is one thing; a wall as it stands today constitutes a territorial conquest, and that is something we cannot accept."
"To conclude, allow me to say one thing: we must be very clear with both sides and make them fully aware that our principles are our principles."
"In that way, we will be able to make them negotiate with each other."
"I have one final remark to make about Mr Abbas: it is true that he was elected, but I, for my part, come from a country in which a certain Mr Chirac was elected on the strength of 82% of the vote, a man who, despite everything, now has the support of a very small proportion of the French population."
". Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Solana, those with a sound knowledge of Israeli society assure us, in the wake of the elections, that the majority of the country’s population are now resolved to accept, willingly or not, the idea that the occupation of the Palestinian territories is, in every respect, a deadlock that needs to be broken."
"Unfortunately, the new Prime Minister is pursuing his predecessor’s strategy, namely unilateral separation on the basis of precluding the construction of a viable Palestinian State, on the one hand, and, for the time being, the oppression of the Palestinian people in an attempt to make them capitulate, on the other."
"This policy is irresponsible."
"Yesterday, the major Israeli daily, , quoted the United Nations in its headline ‘Gaza is on the brink of disaster’."
"In Nablus, in the West Bank, young people under the age of 30 are no longer allowed to leave their town!"
"Kalandia, in the heart of the Palestinian Territory, has just been turned into a border terminal!"
"East Jerusalem is surrounded!"
"What is the meaning, then, of the proposal to negotiate with the Head of the Palestinian Authority whom, I might add, people are making every effort to discredit, as was the case during the recent in Jericho?"
"In this context, it is almost moving to see new peace initiatives emerge from Palestinian and Israeli society, such as that of the combatants for peace, which is due to be officially launched on Monday."
"This initiative involves former officers of the Israeli army, who have joined forces with former combatants from Palestine and drawn from their respective experiences the common belief that the solution to the region’s problems can only be political and based on the relevant United Nations resolutions from 1967 onwards."
"We all pay tribute to the clear-sightedness and the courage of these women and men."
"What do they expect of the European Union, though?"
"Aid alone is not enough: every nation needs freedom just as much as it needs bread."
"The fact remains that, by causing the collapse of the last remnants of Palestine’s social, administrative and security structures, the withdrawal of aid, even on a partial and temporary basis, would rule out any hope of just peace for a long time yet."
"More generally, what political role should Europe now play?"
"Mr Solana just mentioned the Venice European Council in 1980, which is a good point of reference."
"A quarter of a century has, in fact, gone by since another key moment in the history of the Middle East, when we were able to assume our responsibilities."
"We had, at that time, officially recognised the PLO and adopted the ‘two peoples, two states’ principle."
"In my view, the current situation calls for a further strong act on the part of Europe."
"That act must be aimed at providing new and clear reference points leading to an outlook based on law and at restoring hope among the peace-keeping forces throughout the region."
"It was in this spirit that I proposed the idea of making our own institution act as a catalyst: it could decide to hold its Conference of Presidents in East Jerusalem with the aim of sending a real message of peace to all of the key figures there."
". Mr President, the power struggle between Hamas and al-Fatah in the Palestinian territories is coming to a head."
"The violent events in Gaza over the past weekend speak for themselves in this respect, and the simultaneous occupations of various Palestinian ministries on the West Bank give little indication of there being any public authority or law and order."
"How do the Council and the Commission think they can back out of their involvement that helps create this deep internal Palestinian division?"
"There is not exactly a serious spokesperson on the Palestinian side to match, under these circumstances, Mr Olmert, who has won a victory at the Israeli ballot box."
"There should in any case not be any doubt in our minds that Hamas, as a terror movement, has disqualified itself."
"Given the growing terror threat by infiltration of al-Qaeda cells in the Gaza Strip and by Iranian activities in close cooperation with Hezbollah in the south of Lebanon, this does not bode well for Israel’s safety."
"How do the Council and the Commission assess the explosiveness of these threats and what are the steps they consider taking against Egypt and Lebanon, both of which have, after all, signed association agreements with the European Union?"
"Mr President, following the resounding success of the terror movement Hamas in the Palestinian parliamentary elections, there was the risk that the Israeli electorate would react in an extreme manner, which they clearly did not, since it was the new Kadima party that won the elections."
"Now that most of Israel’s voters have decided in favour of furthering the peace process, the question is, of course, ‘what next?’"
"Irrespective of how the new Israeli government is made up, the Hamas problem is here to stay."
"Mr Solana says that it cannot be the intention that the new Palestinian Authority should fail."
"That is true to some extent, of course, because the Palestinian elections were conducted fairly and democratically."
"It is obvious, though, that the new Palestinian Authority should recognise Israel’s right to exist, observe all existing agreements, and refrain from using any violence."
"That is the EU’s official position and I can only hope that we do not move away from it."
"After all, the European Union is partly responsible for Hamas’ election victory."
"We were too lax when it came to providing support to this Palestinian Authority, which we continued doing to an almost unlimited extent, even if we were perfectly aware of the problem of endemic corruption, even if we knew about the problem of some Palestinian school books stirring up hatred, even if we could never fully remove the doubt that no European tax money was used to fund terrorist action."
"It follows that this whole new situation also presents the European Union with an opportunity to restore its own credibility."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, Mr High Representative, during the elections in both Palestine and Israel, it was still clear to me, despite the different outcomes, that the great majority of citizens on both sides are moderate, and that they want peace and an end to violence."
"It is important to reach an agreement that will stand up."
"It must therefore be a negotiated agreement, because only negotiated agreements accepted by both sides can stand up."
"It is important for us to contribute to this and, in particular, for the Quartet to have a greater presence in the region than previously, through their leaders, in order to provide the necessary security guarantees and encouragement."
"In this context, it is clear to me that Palestine must be a viable state, and that we will therefore have to continue to provide humanitarian aid."
"To what extent that can go through the autonomous authority remains to be seen."
"When I read on Xinhua that the new Palestinian Foreign Minister has said, 'I hope that our dream of having an independent state on the entire territory of historical Palestine will be realised one day, and I am sure that there is no room for the State of Israel on this land', in times like these, that is not a good statement to hear."
"Maybe that is a misquotation, but, if it is, in any event it needs to be corrected so that the process can carry on in the right direction."
"It is abundantly clear that the renunciation of violence and recognition of Israel's right to exist will continue to be two of the essential preconditions for good relations with a Palestinian government that wants our support – especially financial support."
"We need to understand how important this task is: there is a correlation between peace in the region and world peace."
"That is why we should help the new team to achieve a breakthrough in the new situation following the elections."
"Mr President, Mr Solana, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, what we need to do is achieve peace, a fair peace and two viable States, and Hamas is making certain peaceful statements, suggesting that it accepts the process and — though still indirectly, in my view — that it recognises Israel."
"As you know, its Minister of Foreign Affairs, alluding to peace based on a two State solution, addressed these words to Kofi Annan yesterday: ‘we look forward to live in peace and security […] side by side with our neighbours in this sacred part of the world.’"
"The Finance Minister has said that Hamas’s intention is to increase ties with the West and also to reach an accommodation with Israel."
"And I believe that the Prime Minister is recognising the Quartet when he says that: ‘Our government will be prepared to hold dialogue with the international quartet about the ways to end the conflict and install calm in the region."
"Our government will spare no effort to reach a just peace in the region’."
"I believe that it is the Union’s duty to take this new reality into account and to lead a strategy that puts an end to the current deadlock, for the sake of two peoples, of two viable States and a fair peace."
"Mr President, the result of the Israeli elections gave the answer of the people in Israel."
"All Knesset parties are committed to the peace process and the majority says yes to the convergence plan proposed by Mr Olmert, which sets out a two-state solution."
"Regarding the Middle East peace process, I would like to say that looking at the Palestinian elections we must remember that democracy is not just about a free ballot box and not simply about the process."
"We cannot define and approve ‘democracy’ as being a ‘terrorist government that was democratically elected’, as in the Palestinian case."
"Democracy is about EU values of peace and respect, not about wanting your neighbour to disappear from the world’s map as Mr al-Zahar, the new Palestinian Foreign Minister, put it this week."
"He said: ‘I dream of hanging up a huge map of the world which does not show Israel on it’."
"The EU must demand that the PA Government renounces violence, recognises the State of Israel and the relevant agreements and commits to the roadmap, otherwise the EU should not legitimise Hamas in any way."
"Now that it has no partner on the Palestinian side, Israel needs all our support to continue its commitment to the peace process."
"Mr President, a few days ago American diplomats were forbidden to make contact with officials in any Palestinian Government agency controlled by Hamas."
"At the same time, Canada suspended aid to the Palestinian Authority and President Bush stated that he would not agree to aid a Hamas-led government."
"However, one has to understand that Hamas was elected in a free and fair election."
"I welcome the recent statements made by Mr Haniyeh that his government would cooperate with Mr Abbas, which seems to transmit a softer image of Hamas."
"Yesterday the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the same statement."
"We must continue to endorse the Quartet’s statements that the new Palestinian Government needs to commit itself to the principles of non-violence, the recognition of Israel and the acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including the roadmap."
"We must never forget that suspending aid to the Palestinians would make it look as though we were directly punishing the Palestinian people for their choice, and subsequently we would increase their suffering."
"The European Parliament has to contribute to all possible efforts to restore peace, not only between Israel and Palestine, but also in the wider Middle East region."
"Mr President, you introduced Mr Solana as the High Representative of the European Union’s common foreign and security policy."
"Which common foreign and security policy is that?"
"Perhaps it was the one contained in the proposed European Constitution so roundly rejected by the French and Dutch in last year’s referendums, and which would be rejected by the British, if they were given the opportunity."
"The European Union’s common foreign and security policy has no legitimacy."
"Mr Solana has no legitimacy as the EU’s de facto foreign minister."
"Mr Solana speaks as though the European Union common foreign and security policy is an accomplished fact."
"Again and again the EU assumes illegitimately the role and characteristics of a political state."
"This is not a debate about how to solve the problems in the Middle East."
"This is a debate about how to further an illegitimate United States of Europe."
"Mr President, Mr Solana, coincidentally, elections have taken place recently in several unsettled parts of the world such as Belarus, Ukraine, Palestine and Israel."
"The European Union plays a key role in all those areas."
"This is to be welcomed, as the United States is no longer an objective player in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"Mr Solana, I believe you are charged with expressing the wishes of the Union as a whole and of all the political groups represented in this Chamber."
"Israel has itself experienced what it is to be a stateless nation."
"It created its state by force and should therefore set a good example by agreeing to the creation of the Palestinian State."
"Only then should it demand that Hamas recognise the state of Israel."
"– Mr President, I am very pleased with the statements by the High Representative and the Commissioner."
"By the way, you speak for the majority of this House and for the majority of Europe, and certain others need to accept that."
"I am also very pleased about the emphasis placed on the need for a negotiated solution."
"It is true that we need to negotiate, but that means that Hamas and Israel must also be prepared to do likewise."
"Thinking about Gaza, Israel did not negotiate there."
"Of course, we also need to explore the reasons why Hamas was elected."
"For years, another government, namely Fatah's, was undermined, partly by its own fault – through corruption and other circumstances, for example – but also due to Israel's refusal to accept it as a negotiating partner."
"Even following Mr Arafat's death, when Mr Abbas was President – and this was during the withdrawal from Gaza – it was not accepted."
"It therefore takes two to negotiate, and both sides need to be willing."
"Secondly, Israel's right to exist, in a peaceful climate and within reasonable borders, must obviously be recognised, but Israel must also accept, at least in principle, that the UN's resolution regarding its borders is right."
"It is quite clear that corrections will still need to be made – we all know that, if we are realistic – but if even the principle is not accepted, there will be difficulties."
"My third point is that we must do all we can to improve the situation in Gaza, including economically, so that Gaza is viable."
"The withdrawal of troops alone cannot guarantee that."
"Finally, we are deeply concerned at the developments in East Jerusalem."
"Even though we welcome Kadima and the reasonableness of its members, when it comes to East Jerusalem they do not yet have the sense to acknowledge both that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and that the Palestinians have a claim to East Jerusalem."
"That should continue to be a clear policy within the European Union."
"Mr President, coupled with the election of Hamas, the vote in Israel will have a defining influence on the prospects for peace in the Middle East."
"The Israeli election was widely regarded as a referendum on unilateral action to establish permanent borders."
"However, 25% of the vote clearly does not give Kadima such a mandate and, even if it could garner additional support in the Knesset, a unilateral withdrawal from the West Bank and the unilateral setting of borders not in accordance with the 1967 borders cannot be a solution."
"Only a peaceful, negotiated settlement can address the legitimate and long-standing concerns of the roadmap process."
"All parties must pursue a path of positive engagement, as set out by the Quartet, which includes talks with the new Palestinian Authority."
"It is no easy thing to expect the international community to engage with those yet to renounce violence, but until that time comes, we have no alternative if we wish to move forward."
"Give them an alternative to hopeless violence and a reason to rise to the challenge."
"Alternatively, make their situation worse and they will simply dig in more."
"If a constructive relationship with the EU and international pressure can bring Ariel Sharon from his early political career to the legacy he has given to Kadima, this surely proves that positive engagement can shift seemingly zero-sum mentalities."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after three days of rain in the occupied territories, this wall, which, as all of you have said, is illegal, caused a build-up of water that swept away the bodies of two dead brothers at Bi'ilin."
"Israeli soldiers prevented excavations to let out the water; the bombardment of northern Gaza has destroyed agricultural areas and killed civilians."
"Nablus and Hebron are surrounded and incursions are being made there."
"We have a great deal of responsibility, and we cannot keep on repeating the cliché about two peoples and two states."
"There are not two peoples and two states: there is one state and something in development, a territory that is being constantly torn apart, both by this illegal wall and by force."
"Kadima and the Labour Party might represent an opportunity."
"I am in favour of exploiting all opportunities, but not in silence: we have to ask, and ask forcefully."
"For two years now Hamas has declared and observed a ceasefire, and has halted its activities."
"Let us be extremely clear about this: for the last two years Hamas has not undertaken any activities, and must never do so again."
"Let us not, however – as we have since 1980 – keep on repeating the line about two peoples and two states, while all the while bearing witness to what is, quite simply, the theft of Palestinian land."
"We need to be active with regard to Hamas, but also with regard to Israel, so that it understands that the international community has meaning."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Hamas may well have put on sheep’s clothing, but beneath that sheep’s clothing the wolf can still sometimes be seen, if it is really true that, in the last few days, the Interior Minister, Said Siam, in moving away for the first time from a practice introduced by President Arafat to help secularise the country, has encouraged a visible sign of the Talibanisation of Palestine along Hamas lines, by allowing Palestinian policemen to grow their beards."
"This goes against the previous policy of the Palestinian police, and is a means of showing full respect for the teaching attributed to Mohammed, which says that in order to distinguish yourself from the infidels you should let your beard grow and clip your moustache."
"This is a process of Talibanisation, therefore, which is rather worrying at a time when, after the identification of a would-be Saudi suicide bomber, a genuine Al-Qaida presence has been found within the borders of the State of Israel."
"Taken overall, this situation looks extremely worrying."
"Nor can the statements made by Foreign Minister al-Zahar, widely publicised by the international press, in which he gave hope of an open-minded attitude towards recognising Israel, and therefore the policy of two States, be seen as particularly encouraging or reassuring, given that only a few days before this same individual issued an incredible statement saying that his dream would be to hang on the walls of his home a fine map of the world on which the State of Israel did not appear."
"The Talibanisation of Palestine is cause for concern."
"Europe must open its eyes to this very real danger."
"Mr President, faced with the government of Palestine being in the hands of the terrorist group Hamas and with its refusal to give up violence and to recognise Israel, it seems to me right and necessary that Israel should unilaterally make provision to define and defend its own borders."
"To do otherwise would be to fail in providing security for its citizens and that must be the prime concern of any government."
"I would therefore encourage Israel, whatever the international pressures, to be resolute and constant in this regard."
"No good ever comes from pandering to terrorists or their political apologists and I hope that Israel, the EU and Mr Solana will not waver in following such a line and that they will not waver in insisting that the only way forward is for Hamas to give up violence and recognise Israel."
"– Mr Solana, Commissioner, out of all of the topics discussed here, I have focused on the words of Mr Solana, describing the situation in the Palestinian territories and in Israel."
"We can derive two main facts from this description."
"While Palestinians are governed by Hamas, an organisation that is unwilling to accept the basic principles of international law, the situation in Israel is different."
"The elections there may yield a government that wants above all to address the social and economic issues that are viewed by all people living in democratic societies as the most important ones for the governments to resolve."
"This notwithstanding, the European Union faces a daunting challenge."
"The challenge is that, regardless of how we view Hamas – and I am sure that most of us view it as a terrorist organisation – you, in your capacity as our top representatives for external relations, must find a way of cooperating with the Hamas government."
"As we progress down this road, I would ask only that you do not lose sight of the fact that all EU funds given in support of the Palestinians should remain subject to the condition that the Palestinian government respects the existence of Israel."
"And I would also like to ask if you could find out from Mr Kofi Annan exactly what was said about the existence of Israel in the letter he received from the Palestinian foreign minister?"
"– Mr President, the results of the recent elections in Israel basically legalised the strategy of the unilateral imposition of the terms of any resolution to the Palestine problem."
"It is no coincidence that the political leadership in Israel makes more use of the word 'security' and far less use of the word 'peace', because peace requires negotiation and painful compromises."
"Security, on the other hand, is linked to a unilateral determination of the final status of the borders, with maintaining the occupation of East Jerusalem, with the settlements on the West Bank and with the Wall of Shame."
"I believe that Israel's strategic plan, strengthened by the new political situation in the Palestinian territories, is not creating conditions of peace."
"It is not creating a viable Palestinian state."
"On the contrary, it is helping to create a virtual state of unconnected areas without stable borders."
"The European Union is right to lay down terms and conditions for Hamas."
"However, we do not see the terms and conditions being laid down by the European Union for Israel, because Israel too is flouting the Oslo accords, because Israel too is flouting the terms of the roadmap."
"Today, both Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner broached the question of greater realism on the part of the European Union."
"We need to continue in the same reliable vein if we are to be an effective European Union."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the Israeli Labour Party on entering into government."
"They are socialists, they are our sister party and I welcome their manifesto commitment that ‘the occupation erodes the moral fibre of Israeli society’, along with Amir Peretz’s Herzliya speech in support of respect for international borders."
"Both provide very important commitments to the way forward."
"I thank both the Commissioner and the High Representative for restating this afternoon Europe’s commitment to a negotiated, not unilateral, solution."
"To the Commissioner, I repeat our private discussions that, whilst it is absolutely right for her to put conditions on European aid to the Palestinian Authority, I ask her to develop plans to avoid a humanitarian disaster in the Palestinian territories if Hamas does not move as quickly as we all hope."
"To Mr Solana, I ask him to consider how easy it was for the Rafah crossing – supposedly guaranteed by the EU – to be closed during the recent Israeli actions, together with the legality of Israel withholding customs payments to the Palestinian Authority, guaranteed under the Paris Agreement."
"These are legal obligations to which the European Union and the Quartet have a duty to seek compliance."
"Mr President, I would like to make a few brief points."
"First, on the three demands as outlined by Mr Solana, I support all three but I fear that they are incomplete."
"I think that we should not only demand Hamas’s respect for existing agreements, including the recognition of the State of Israel; we should also demand Hamas’s full respect of democratic decision-making in Palestinian politics, of which this was a result."
"We need to demand that Hamas does not touch the human rights of Palestinians."
"Our full support should go to the Palestinian women that were demonstrating for their rights recently on International Women’s Day."
"Mr Solana said that Hamas cannot change the past, but it can change the future."
"It was Ariel Sharon who once said that once you find yourself in power, your perspective on the world changes dramatically, and some world leaders have come out and described him as a man of peace."
"We cannot exclude the possibility that Hamas will rise to the occasion."
"I would not bet my last dime on it though."
"We therefore need a long-term strategy."
"It is my hope that the next time we see elections in Palestine, the Palestinian people will vote Hamas out and the only party that will be able to beat Hamas is al-Fatah."
"The young generation of al-Fatah, meaning anyone under 50 for that matter, is calling for internal reform, and I think it is right to do so."
"That generation has the potential to reconnect al-Fatah to the Palestinian street."
"I stand in full support of its goals and I call on all my colleagues to look for ways to invest in this reform movement."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by making some observations."
"Firstly, the demographic problem has been at the heart of the political debate; secondly, the Great Israel utopia is no more; thirdly, the social issue has been at the heart of the debate in Israel; and, fourthly, Hamas did not influence the elections in Israel."
"Unconsciously, the Israelis have once and for all acknowledged the existence of two States."
"It is now time for negotiation, but pressure must be brought to bear on Hamas so that it invalidates its Charter and finally recognises Israel as a valid negotiating partner."
"Otherwise, ladies and gentlemen, there will be a unilateral policy on both sides."
"Public opinion in the two countries is in favour of peace."
"Europe must take advantage of this situation because it now has a crucial role to fulfil."
"Europe has expectations riding on it and, as regards aid for the Palestinians, I repeat that Europe must continue to grant its aid, otherwise a disaster will ensue in Palestine."
". Firstly, I should like to thank the many speakers here for their total support for our attempts to continue the peace process."
"Even in this very difficult time we have to try to do everything we can."
"However, the primary responsibility rests with the two parties and we – the international community – have to support them in following this path."
"I reiterate that it has to be a negotiated – not a unilateral – solution and I think that has been made very clear."
"We all agree that it is important for Hamas to respect the three conditions; it has to renounce violence, recognise the existence of the State of Israel and stand by existing agreements made by former governments."
"It is also highly important that the international Quartet remain united."
"This will not always be easy, but we will try to stay united as much as we can."
"Secondly, humanitarian aid is absolutely necessary."
"In past analyses we have seen that more or less half of our aid has gone to the various possibilities for humanitarian aid, not through the Palestinian Authority."
"Therefore this aid will continue through the United Nations organisations and international organisations."
"We will find ways to do that through NGOs but we will also have to review our position and find some alternative mechanisms."
"We are working on this."
"However, since this is a very difficult question, we will have to see precisely what we can do."
"It also has to be made absolutely sure – and this is what we have to find out – that our aid will not go to the terrorists."
"Therefore, we have to find the right balance, which is not easy."
"Naturally, we also have to support Mahmoud Abbas."
"He is the interlocutor at present."
"The possibility is there, so we have to try to reinforce his office as much as we can, but again, please be patient as we are still working on the details."
"Russia has clearly stated that when it met Hamas, it kept within the framework of our Quartet statement of 30 June."
"The Russians said it was important to talk with Hamas in order to get it into the right line even before the government was formed."
"Unfortunately, we have heard that Hamas has not fulfilled all the conditions, although here and there a few first steps have been taken."
"Let me also say a few words on East Jerusalem."
"We are particularly concerned about settlement activities and the construction of the separation barrier in and around East Jerusalem, which endangers the contiguity of a future Palestinian State and also threatens to vastly complicate the final status negotiations."
"Any agreement on the city’s status must be negotiated by the two parties and should not be pre-empted by new factors on the ground, as I said before."
"Statements by the Council and by the Quartet have made that abundantly clear."
"We are ready to assist the parties as appropriate, if requested."
"The first step by Israel should be to end discrimination against Palestinians in the cities."
"There are quite a number of these factors."
"Concerning the separation barrier, the European Union has stated on numerous occasions that, while fully recognising the right of Israel to protect its citizens against terrorist attacks, it is particularly concerned by the route marked out for the separation barrier in the occupied West Bank, which significantly departs from the Green Line, unjustly confiscates Palestinian land and severely curtails movement and access."
"We again call on Israel to stop and to reverse the construction of the separation barrier inside the occupied Palestinian territories, including in and around East Jerusalem."
". Mr President, I would like to remind honourable Members of Parliament that something very important has taken place in these elections."
"The elections in both Palestine and Israel have created a new political class."
"The political parties that have dominated life in Israel and Palestine over the last 20 years have disappeared or have come very low in the polls."
"New parties have appeared that were created only months ago."
"New people have appeared as leaders."
"What does that mean?"
"It probably means many things, but at least for us it should mean something new, so far as the leadership is concerned."
"We have to invest some hope in this movement to see if we can take advantage of the situation to move the process forward."
"I have the impression and the deep conviction that the result of these elections is a profound change in the social structure of both societies."
"On the part of the Palestinians there is probably no desire to have a non-secular government."
"I would very much like to insist on that."
"I do not believe that the majority of people in Palestine voted for Hamas because they wanted a religious government at the head of the Palestinian Authority."
"I believe they voted against other things that are more closely related to the tyrannies of not doing things properly, of corruption, of a lack of proper organisation."
"We have to make the effort now to do our utmost to ensure that Palestine, which is probably the most secular part of the Middle East, does not revert to something that probably the majority of Palestinian people do not want."
"But at the same time there have to be people in government who are able to produce the results that the majority of people want: social services, no corruption, democracy, etc."
"It is the same in Jerusalem, the same in Israel."
"When you see that the Prime Minister is going to be Ehud Olmert and not Mr Sharon, it is really very impressive: what a profound change has taken place in such a short period of time."
"The person who led Kadima and Likud, the party that has been running affairs in Jerusalem for more than 20 years, is now suffering in hospital."
"There is a new party with a new leader whom nobody expected to be the leader today."
"Now, does it open possibilities?"
"Let me believe that it opens possibilities."
"Are we going to use those possibilities?"
"I like to think that, yes, we are going to take advantage of those possibilities."
"When I talk to Mr Olmert, as I do frequently, I keep telling him unilateralism is not possible."
"We have seen that already."
"It was not possible to disengage from Gaza unilaterally."
"In the end, they first had to call on the international community and then they had to call the Palestinian side, because it is impossible to unravel a situation which is so united and do it unilaterally."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit said that it is terrible that avian flu may spread from Israel to Palestine."
"There has been a statement today saying that we have to make sure that avian flu does not spread from one place to the other."
"The same person did not say that poverty cannot spread from one to the other; that suffering cannot spread from one to the other."
"Sometimes, it seems as though we are more concerned about the spread of avian flu and are not really concerned about the suffering, the misery and the tragedy that have existed there for years."
"The peoples are separated by a barrier, which may not stop avian flu but may stop people going from one place to the other."
"That is something really sad."
"We have to be able to do both things – to cooperate so that avian flu does not spread, and ensure that people can move, workers can move, and progress can be made, and I think that is much more important."
"In 1980 we said something very important, which has been upheld."
"Not long ago we said that we believe that the 1967 borders are the starting point for negotiations."
"I would like to repeat that today in this Parliament."
"We are ready to defend that; we are ready to accept changes to borders agreed by most people – by both parties."
"But we cannot imagine any other solution that does not take into consideration the premise that the negotiations have to start around the 1967 borders."
"I should also like to say that everybody has to be given the opportunity to change."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit has changed."
"I have changed."
"How many people in this chamber have changed?"
"And I think we have all changed for the better."
"Why do we not think that people can change for the better?"
"Now we have to give this opportunity, but we have to be very tough until the moment they change."
"We have to tell them that if they change they will have the opportunity to be part of the team."
"But, if they do not change, unfortunately they will not be part of it."
"As I said before, it is very difficult to change the past."
"Nobody can change his past, only lighten his memories, as many people do."
"In the future, yes, we can change."
"We have to act to create the conditions so that people can behave differently in future."
"I would like to see Hamas change and recognise Israel."
"It is impossible to negotiate if you do not recognise that the other has a right to exist."
"That has to be reciprocal too."
"It is impossible to negotiate if you do not want to negotiate and at the same time you want to have a pistol in your pocket."
"This is not negotiation."
"That is the type of message we have to get across."
"We also have to push for plurality in Palestinian society."
"It has been the most secular society and continues to be secular, not subject to an imposed religious society as has been represented in some Hamas statements."
"It is a very important point and we have to think about it for the first time."
"A group that belongs to the Muslim Brothers has arrived in power democratically."
"We have to think about this because it has happened in Palestine."
"It may happen in other places, and we have to think about how we are we going to deal with it."
"I should very much like these elements to be considered not only by think tanks, but also by political players in the European Union."
"I have hope in my heart and I would like you to have hope in your hearts."
"Together let us see whether we can fulfil the hopes that I am sure you have in your hearts."
"The debate is closed."
"I should like to welcome to our distinguished visitors’ gallery Mr Milinkevich, a candidate in the recent presidential elections in Belarus, and Mr Viacorka, head of the Belarusian National Front."
"They have been invited here by the President of the European Parliament as a sign of the European Parliament’s support for democracy and freedom in Belarus."
"Mr Milinkevich bravely led the presidential campaign under oppressive conditions created by a dictatorial government in Belarus, defending human rights, democracy and civil society and fighting for values which are also ours."
"What has actually happened with the elections?"
"In my opinion, what has actually happened is that they have changed the plan of Sharon and his successor Olmert into elections, in the interest of further disengagement from the West Bank area, thereby preserving the religious identity of Israel."
"Sharon’s legacy contains three tasks:"
"- the Palestinian side does not want to conclude a permanent treaty with Israel."
"Abu Mazen would be willing to do it, but is unable to;"
"HAMAS would be able to do it, but is unwilling,"
"- Israel should establish its borders unilaterally, de facto,"
"- the border should be established along the ‘dividing’ wall, including the large Jewish settlements in the West Bank."
"This would mean a painful and radical withdrawal of approximately 70 thousand settlers."
"If this step is taken, three separate cantons will be established, and we can be certain that this ‘something’ would lead to a failed state."
"This is where we, the EU, must make it clear to our Israeli friends that it is no longer in their interest to do this, because it will certainly lead to a further Palestinian revolt, and everybody knows what that means."
"The Arab League has an interesting position in this issue: They would envisage peace based on the 1967 borders of Israel."
"Perhaps we, too, should examine the negotiations on this basis, and see whether this is the road that leads to a secure peace in the future."
"I am more and more convinced that the safety of Israel does not depend on keeping the settlements, but on resolving the conflict."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the outcome of the most recent Israeli elections confirms that the road taken by Prime Minister Sharon towards a form of peace in the Middle East that is acceptable to both Palestinians and Israelis is the right one, partly because it is perhaps the only one possible."
"The problem now consists in seeing whether the new Palestinian Government will be able to continue along this road in spite of Hamas’ victory in the last legislative elections."
"The European Union must take steps to become the main actor in a peace process that has repeatedly seen the EU play a less than active part in the role of mediator, conferred on it via the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"Achieving a genuine form of peace in one of the most fragile areas of the global geopolitical landscape is possible only by means of genuine guarantees in terms of the security of the two countries and, therefore, by means of European political action that is not only capable of guaranteeing development and dialogue, but is also more resolute in condemning the terrorism and violence of those who, even today, want to wipe the State of Israel off the map."
"Powers under the Community institutions’ Common Foreign and Security Policy must live up to genuine expectations of enhanced negotiation for the purposes of ensuring that any dialogue is carried out properly and that the political and social rights of both populations are properly safeguarded."
"The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the elections in Belarus."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has frequently discussed the issue of Belarus – unfortunately, with very good reason."
"I would remind you that, immediately following the elections, you held a very serious and very convincing special debate on this matter, in which I also had the honour of participating."
"The Council, too, has, of necessity, had Belarus on its agenda for some time now, because the country gives considerable cause for concern."
"It is tragic, what the people of Belarus are now having to go through, and we must, today, express our solidarity with them."
"I know that you are doing that, as are the Council and, of course, the Commission."
"I should also like to join the President in welcoming Mr Milinkevich most warmly and to say how pleased I am that he is here for this debate."
"I hope that he will draw further courage from the support that all the institutions of the European Union lend to him, his supporters and the brave men and women of Belarus."
"I would remind you that the President of the European Council, Chancellor Schüssel, spoke of Mr Milinkevich during this morning's debate, saying 'we owe him all conceivable political and economic support wherever it is required'."
"I should like to emphasise that point here."
"Even before the elections, the Council was deeply concerned with the situation in Belarus and had clearly warned the government, in particular President Lukashenko, not to trample on human rights, to respect the people's right and freedom of assembly and their right to demonstrate; it also pointed out, when a minister quite unbelievably threatened to treat demonstrators as terrorists, that the European Union would not accept that."
"As we know, and as the OSCE/ODIHR observers established, the elections were not democratic."
"This is most unfortunate, as I remember that some here had expressed the hope that the elections might form a turning point."
"The European Union as a whole and the Council in particular can now essentially do two things: first, we must make it clear that we will not tolerate such behaviour."
"We therefore need to take specific action against those responsible for these events."
"The Council – and now the European Council too – has, in principle, decided to take appropriate action against those responsible for violations of human rights and of the rules of democracy in Belarus."
"The Council is now preparing a decision that will realise and implement this."
"A visa ban will be imposed on a number of people, including the president himself, as the European Council also specifically said in its declaration appended to the conclusions."
"The Council is also examining the possibility of further action, whereby it must always be ensured – and I know that you agree with this – that any action taken must not harm the population."
"We do not want to take any action that harms the people, and not those responsible."
"That is why the second thing that the European Union can and must do – and the Council has already discussed this, too – is take specific action to help the population."
"I am sure that Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner will make a detailed statement and list the specific measures that could be taken."
"The Member States also have a duty, and I would say this quite clearly to all the Member States: when it comes to giving young people the opportunity to study in our countries, and when it comes to assisting civil society, then, alongside the European Union – and the Commission is taking specific action here – we, the Member States, also have to take quite specific action."
"As Chancellor Schüssel said this morning, a group of states, including Austria, has already decided to provide special grants for young people from Belarus, in order to give them the opportunity to travel to our countries, to see how democratic countries work, to learn, and to take the message home that the European Union supports them and has not forgotten them."
"This message that we have not forgotten the people, that we want to help them and that we support them is also absolutely essential."
"Finally, we must not grow tired of calling on the government to set at liberty those who have been imprisoned."
"We must remind them that all that these people have done is to make use of one of their human rights, namely the right to demonstrate and to express their opinion freely."
"The Council will continue to do this."
"We will not leave the people of Belarus in the lurch and we will not rest until – as Mrs Plassnik said – Spring arrives in that country."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that it is a pleasure to see Mr Milinkevich here."
"We had a meeting this morning, so the day started well, and I heard directly what is in the hearts of the Belarusian people."
"Therefore, I think it was very important to have this discussion today, because we all have seen that the events in Minsk confirmed Mr Lukashenko’s determination to win this election come what may."
"I remember what Mr Milinkevich said to me today, that even if it seems that the elections were won by Mr Lukashenko, in reality the Belarusian people have won and Mr Lukashenko has started to lose the elections."
"This is very important for the future."
"Unfortunately, this was exactly what we had expected."
"However, what was less expected was the degree to which the pluralistic forces were able to get together."
"I express my admiration for their courage."
"We hope that we will be able to continue to give as much support to the democratic forces as we can."
"The OSCE/ODIHR official report concluded that the elections clearly failed to meet OSCE standards for democratic elections."
"This was due in particular to the arbitrary use of state power and widespread detention, a disregard for the basic rights of freedom of assembly, association and expression, and problems with early voting, counting and tabulation processes."
"It is clear that we all consider the elections to be fundamentally flawed."
"We particularly deplore the refusal to admit registered OSCE and EU parliamentary observers, including Members of the European Parliament."
"We have made this known."
"We utterly condemn the violent suppression of protests and the detention of peaceful protesters, including Mr Kozulin, former Polish Ambassador Mr Maszkiewicz, and all the other unknown students, craftsmen and workers who took to the streets to demonstrate."
"We fully support what the President-in-Office of the Council said – it is very important that we impose targeted sanctions that will not affect the population but will affect those responsible for the fraudulent elections."
"We must see what can be done."
"The Commission is involved in the preparations."
"For the future, we must continue our support for civil society."
"We must continue this strategy, because we want to stand by the people and work for their benefit."
"However, at the same time, we do not want to work with the government – or at least, we want to work as little as we can with it."
"In line with the Council conclusions, support for democratisation will continue through our different assistance tools."
"We also have been working particularly on the media front, because we know that it is highly important that people take their own decisions."
"The current TV and radio programmes supported by the EC make an important contribution to democratisation, but also to the EU’s visibility in Belarus, which we have discussed today."
"There is still much to be done – improvements must be made – but we must continue with those projects."
"I agree that we will have to see what we can do in looking for ways to support the students who were expelled from the universities."
"Perhaps not at the next Council, but in the near future, we will establish programmes and the Commission, together with the Council, will certainly support them."
"We have already been financing Vilnius University, because Minsk has been closed, and we have tried to give the young people a chance."
"People-to-people contacts are most important in order to enhance the possibility of working together."
"We must do everything against repression, on the one hand through declarations that we officially put out through the Council, and on the other hand by clearly speaking up in our meetings with the Russians, pointing out that we want a Belarus where human rights and the rule of law are respected."
". Mr President, it is indeed the case that today’s debate is in effect a continuation of the one held two weeks ago."
"I would remind the House that on that occasion we passed our test of solidarity with the Belarusians with flying colours."
"We reacted as was right and proper, condemning the repression and calling for those arrested and sentenced to be released."
"Most importantly, we supported the demonstrators who were exercising their rights as citizens in October Square."
"It is also significant that a fortnight ago the Commission, the Council and this House all spoke with one voice."
"We should continue to do so with regard to Belarus."
"The time for political statements is past, however, and it is now time for action."
"Our diagnosis is complete and the treatment must now begin."
"This means that the Council and the Commission must take a series of courageous decisions."
"I am delighted that both Mr Winkler and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner have already mentioned some of these, but I would like to raise a few other issues."
"Firstly, if we consider that the elections were undemocratic, it follows that Mr Lukashenko does not have a mandate to hold on to power for a third term."
"This in turn implies that we must send out a clear call for the Presidential elections to be repeated, as the Belarusian opposition has long been demanding."
"Secondly, the list of individuals banned from entering European Union territory should be extended considerably to include various categories of people responsible for violating human rights and freedoms."
"Consequently, the list must include not only representatives of the local, regional and national administrations but also university Vice-Chancellors responsible for expelling students who demonstrated, and editors responsible for propaganda in favour of the regime."
"Thirdly, visa policy on Belarusian citizens should be relaxed as soon as possible."
"This would enable us to implement our principle of not isolating Belarusian society whilst isolating the leadership."
"Belarusians need to be able to travel more easily and it is therefore essential for us to facilitate the visa process for them."
"Fourthly, we must make our voice heard at international organisations such as the UN and the OSCE, and call for the release of political prisoners."
"A Polish diplomat, Mr Maszkiewicz, is currently being held as a political prisoner in Minsk and I was glad the Commissioner mentioned him today."
"I trust the Council will act quickly to ensure he is released at the earliest opportunity."
"Fifthly, it is essential to put Belarus on the agenda for the next EU-Russia summit, because Russia is in a position to bring political and economic pressure to bear on Belarus and this could serve to relax the regime in that country."
"For its part, the Union can put pressure on Russia to encourage it to exert its influence on Belarus in such a way."
"The Council must ensure that the instruments at its disposal are used appropriately to this end."
"Lastly, if the monopoly on information is to be broken, we certainly need to support radio stations and future television stations broadcasting to Belarus."
"It is also important to act sensibly in this regard, however, and I therefore appeal for no more funds to be wasted supporting initiatives that do not reach the people of Belarus."
". Mr President, on behalf of my group, I too should like to extend a warm welcome to Mr Milinkevich, presidential candidate from Belarus, and, in fact, through him, to greet, and express my support to, the opposition and all dissidents in Belarus, particularly those who have been arrested and imprisoned."
"It was already said two weeks ago that we cannot accept the outcome of the elections as the outcome of a free and democratic process."
"Paraphrasing what the Commissioner said, I should like to add that Lukashenko did not win, but the people in Belarus were the losers."
"That is an important conclusion to draw."
"We also have to establish that Lukashenko cannot claim democratic legitimacy and that is why it is a good thing that the European Union has taken visible action."
"By imposing a visa ban on him, we have given him the message that, as far as we are concerned, the sooner he goes, the better, and he can certainly not count on our recognition."
"We do not want to see him, or talk to him again."
"That is the first point I wanted to make."
"I agree to the visa ban being extended to include other authorities and personalities in Belarus."
"We must think carefully about how we can take this as far as we can, and we are awaiting suggestions from the Commission and Council to this effect."
"We could also consider our options with regard to freezing assets in order to get to the governing elite in Belarus."
"It is important to establish here today that we must hold firm to all the conclusions we drew after the elections in Belarus."
"We must constantly follow the developments in that country."
"I was involved in Belarus for five years myself, as predecessor of Mr Klich and chairman of the delegation."
"Whilst the previous presidential elections were obviously rigged as well, attention for Belarus visibly dwindled after a couple of months."
"We owe it to each other, as an institution but also as Parliament, to continue to focus our attention on that country without any let-up."
"I was pleased with the Commissioner’s remark about the dialogue with Moscow."
"I would also like to hear from Mr Winkler what his opinion is of the way in which we can add this item to the agenda in meetings with Russia, because – as I have already said – the congratulations by Mr Putin to Lukashenko were delivered incredibly promptly again."
"It would be good, where further measures are concerned, to persuade the Commission and Council to think outside the box."
"What can we come up with, in addition to existing instruments, to promote contacts between people here and people there?"
"For example, it is for us MEPs very difficult to travel to Belarus."
"What specific, creative measures can we take in order to establish this human contact, the practical support for people in Belarus in one way or another?"
"I should like to finish off by saying that we must persevere and certainly not create the impression with Mr Milinkevich and his people that we will leave him in the lurch."
"We must persist and focus as much attention as we muster in this House."
". Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I have to say, with all due respect – for I realise that the Council is already using relatively strong language as it is – that the statements disappoint me to some extent."
"It is still unclear when, and in what way, the proposed sanctions and measures will actually be carried out by all Member States, including the Commission."
"Extending the visa ban on government representatives is, of course, wonderful, but what to do with judges, police officials involved in ill-treatment, and suchlike?"
"Will a visa ban be imposed on them too?"
"What happened to the idea of launching, simultaneously and with immediate effect, a flexible policy with regard to cheap visas for the ordinary Belarusian citizens and particularly for students?"
"Or to the idea of freezing foreign assets, better gearing the financial programmes to the specific situations, supporting the independent press and so on and so forth?"
"When and in what way will something be done about this?"
"Ultimately, fine words will not get us very far."
"It is wonderful when we express solidarity in words, but what we need is concrete action."
"What I was looking forward to hear were dates, statistics, timeframes and hard facts."
"Moreover, as Mr Wiersma pointed out a moment ago, Russia’s role remains underexposed."
"Mr Putin congratulated Lukashenko on his victory without as much as batting an eyelid."
"He is also the man who keeps the wheels of industry oiled with his cheap supplies of raw materials."
"At the end of April, we will know whether Mr Putin will continue to apply the bizarrely low gas prices to Belarus."
"Everything will depend on the interest which Russia pursues in Beltransgas, the Belarusian company."
"Economic gain is thus the objective."
"I would once again like to urge the Council and the Commission to spell out clearly to Mr Putin what the EU stands for."
"We must now crank up the pressure, not least in connection with the G8 energy summit to be held in St Petersburg in mid-July, but the Council is so far adopting an extremely cautious attitude."
"I would therefore ask the Council whether it is scared that taking a clear stand might conflict with other priorities, such as its own supply of energy?"
"– Mr President, I should like to start by warmly welcoming, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, our guests from Belarus, Mr Milinkevich and Mr Viachorka."
"Our group has the greatest respect for the achievements and the courage of the active opposition movement in Belarus."
"Despite threats of violence, you protested against the election fraud in peaceful demonstrations."
"We also believe that Mr Lukashenko no longer has any legal claim on power, and we admire the independence, calm and clarity with which you, Mr Milinkevich, dealt with the difficult situation in October Square and Kupala Park."
"Many congratulations on this achievement!"
"We saw in the television reports how the peaceful demonstrators were brutally detained by the police."
"For many of your supporters, arrest, imprisonment and expulsion from university were the results of simply exercising their right to free expression, a basic right that goes without saying in the countries of the European Union."
"However, we believe that they are the new power in the country and can bring democracy and economic recovery to Belarus."
"We hope that the spirit of freedom will stay alive in Belarus."
"Mr Winkler, thank you for taking on board many of our requests."
"When imposing the visa bans, though, please do not leave out those who detained the demonstrators in such a brutal way."
"They must go on the list."
"Please also remember – as others have already said – that Mr Putin supports Mr Lukashenko and that this fact must be a focus of discussions with Russia."
"Mr President, our political group believes that the election in Belarus was undemocratic."
"A variety of methods was used to prevent the opposition from operating as they might reasonably have expected to."
"The media is controlled by the Lukashenko regime."
"All this is made clear in our motion for a resolution."
"In this situation it is important for surrounding countries to have close contacts with democratic forces in Belarus, such as national movements and free trade unions."
"The people of Belarus must not be isolated."
"In spite of Lukashenko’s antidemocratic methods, there is still significant grass-roots support for him."
"This is partly due to the relative social equality and relatively high degree of social protection in the country."
"However, social protection, which is of course a good thing, can never excuse restrictions on democratic freedoms and rights."
". Mr President, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group I too would like to warmly welcome Mr Milinkevich and Mr Viacorka to the House today."
"It is my earnest hope that the day will come when you will be able to take your own seats in this Parliament, gentlemen."
"We know full well what to think about Mr Lukashenko’s dictatorship."
"Europe no longer has any doubts or concerns regarding a policy of isolation, confrontation with the leadership and at the same time, openness to the Belarusian people."
"Our noble plans will come to nothing, however, if we do not take on more political responsibility for the future of Belarus."
"If we delegate too much of the responsibility for the process of change to Russia, our efforts will be in vain."
"Democracy under Russian patronage is bound to be half-baked, just as it is in Russia itself."
"Too much Russian involvement in the process of change will impede essential geopolitical changes in the region."
"Political and economic stability cannot be achieved without changes of this nature and without genuine links between Belarus and Europe."
"Accordingly, not only do we need instruments to provide immediate aid to the opposition, but we also need a broad political plan for a new Belarus, and we need it now."
"Such a plan must allow for Belarus to take its rightful place in Europe."
"Mr President, it is worth remembering that strange though it may seem, the European Union and Poland do have a common border with Belarus."
"In addition, Europe, Poland and Belarus share a common history and I trust a common future too."
"This House has recently done a great deal to support the emerging Belarusian democracy."
"Mr Milinkevich and Mr Viacorka who are present amongst us today believe that the dictator’s end is nigh."
"We should not wait for future elections."
"Now is the time for us to help strike the against the system which is opposing democracy by force."
"Belarusians are an exceptionally peaceful and patient people."
"Democracy is developing amongst them only slowly, but when it does come about the European Union can be assured that Belarus will prove a trustworthy partner and guarantor of peace for many years to come."
"Mr President, I too would like to extend a warm welcome to Mr Milinkevich."
"It is not only a great honour to have him here in our midst, but also very important that he should be here, for this is not only a moment of fear and threat, but also a unique moment of hope."
"Mr Milinkevich spoke wise words on the 19th: the people of Belarus have lost their fear, and President Lukashenko is right to be fearful, for even the most armed dictator cannot stand up to the heroic courage of a people that will no longer be gagged."
"We in Europe should now send the right signals."
"That means that we must give priority to restricting the visa regime and freezing assets, and that we must also look into a different direction."
"We must offer opportunities to students and to those people who cannot remain in Belarus."
"We must ensure that they can study over here and be prepared here for a new and democratic Belarus."
"Could I also ask you to consider a sanction in the area of arms exports that will hit the Belarusian President where it hurts?"
"The President extracts much of his funds from the arms export. One to two billion annually, and a good deal of those funds serve to line the pockets of the President and his cronies."
"In terms of arms exports, it may be a good idea to persuade Europe and its allies to take tough sanctions, also with a view to preventing the President’s funds from growing any further, while this will not affect the people."
"There is little we can do to prevent the arms exports from Belarus."
"As chairman of this House’s delegation for relations with Russia, I should like to make one last observation."
"Every country is entitled to favour certain candidates or certain governments."
"That is also true of Russia, but what is unacceptable is that a member of the OSCE should simply ignore the conclusions of OSCE observers."
"The OSCE has stated that the elections are neither free nor fair, and Russia cannot respond by saying that they are fair and by simply congratulating President Lukashenko."
"It is therefore important that this should be added to the agenda of our meeting with Russia and also to that of the G8 summit."
"It is all well and good that President Putin should urge President Lukashenko to prevent violence, but it is not enough, not by a long shot."
"If Russia wishes to present itself as being a democratic country, then it must fall in with the community of values of Europe and uphold democracy and human rights."
"– Nobody here can doubt the undemocratic nature of Mr Lukashenko’s government."
"I too welcome Mr Milinkevich and join my colleagues in supporting the Belarus opposition."
"However, verbal support alone will not suffice, and therefore I think we should take other measures as well."
"Some measures can be taken by the Commission, some by the Council and some by us as Members of Parliament."
"These measures must include ways of raising awareness amongst the Belarus people, since an informed civil society is one that is better able to see through important changes."
"As an MEP from the Slovak Republic, a country that faced a similar situation over many long years in the past, I can certainly confirm that this is the case."
"I also believe that it is necessary to consider the question of visa requirements very carefully, as we will certainly not be raising the awareness of the Belarus people if we prevent them from travelling to EU countries and seeing a different picture to the one portrayed by Mr Lukashenko via his media."
"Mr President, the general opinion within the European Union is that we have only limited possibilities for exerting pressure on Mr Lukashenko’s regime, because the Union only plays a minor role in Belarusian politics and economics."
"This is not the case at all."
"In 2004 Belarus exported 10% less to the European Union than it did to Russia, but last year it already exported 12% more to the Union than it did to Russia."
"Clearly, the European Union is becoming an increasingly significant factor in the Belarusian economy."
"There are therefore good grounds for us to believe that we can really influence events in Belarus."
"Mr Klich has already mentioned specific ways in which we could exert our influence."
"I simply wish to make one point."
"Mr Lukashenko has taken action to make it difficult for Belarusians to travel out of the country."
"Additional charges have been imposed."
"It is not easy for young people to travel abroad and obstacles are even placed in the way of people wishing to leave the country to obtain medical treatment."
"In response, we need to do more than facilitation, and here I have in mind the criteria for granting visas."
"We need to go much further."
"We should reduce the financial resources threshold and the cost of visas."
"We could even go as far as introducing free visas."
"In conclusion, I would like to emphasise the need for us to change our approach."
"With regard to financial support for Belarus, a number of obstacles should be removed."
"I appeal to Mrs Ferrero-Waldner to enlighten us about the nature of the formal obstacles preventing us from acting in a flexible manner, if indeed there are any such obstacles."
"This House will help."
"I shall leave you with a maxim, ladies and gentlemen."
"As the English and Americans say, we should put our money where our mouth is."
"Mr President, as election means the presentation of alternatives, acknowledgement of them and afterwards a deliberate choice – the candidate who appears better is elected – it is not something for dictatorships."
"The procedure of voting in circumstances eliminating de facto any free choice should not be called an election."
"What happened recently in Belarus was only a vote, which, along with the counting of the votes, was in the hands of the government of the eternal incumbent."
"He was not given any democratic legitimacy."
"Who is Mr Lukashenko today?"
"He looks more and more like a governor appointed by the ruler of all Russia to undergo once more the well-known dishonest procedure of a fraudulent vote and to continue his experiences on the spot."
"We have to state here that the new post-Soviet tri-electoral military union of consolidated dictatorships in Moscow, Minsk and Tashkent is not the way to a better future for the three states and nations."
"We have seen the birth of a new democracy in Belarus as a European-linked, not Eurasian, country."
"Therefore, as Russia itself now prefers post-Soviet authoritarian nationalism to any ‘orange’ renovation there is a growing danger that Belarus will be forcibly merged with Putinist Russia, the basis for which was laid down in advance."
"All the world is to be warned about it."
"If we do not want Mr Milinkevich to disappear forever, as happened to leaders of the opposition in Belarus several years ago and as is going on in Chechnya every day, the resolution on Belarus sets out the right step, which is first to call on the UN to set up an international commission to investigate previous crimes of the terrorist regime in Belarus, so as to prevent new ones today."
"Vincuk Viacorka is here today, temporarily released from jail."
"But nobody knows what might happen there any day."
"– Our work in the immediate future must be characterised principally by persistence and insistence."
"The Minsk regime hopes that, in time, the Belarus story will fade in importance in the international media."
"They hope that Europeans will forget the agonies of this people, our brothers."
"This must not happen, and we, as the European Parliament, have a duty to keep the memory of these events alive and to be the conscience that acts as a reminder even to the other European institutions so that no one forgets the cry of these people."
"As I said during the last part-session, I am happy to note that attention is being given to my appeal to the effect that we should look after students sent away from their Universities because they took part in demonstrations and for whose education we have to provide in our country."
"Moreover, we should go further."
"I am also pleased that the proposal that assets be frozen has been accepted."
"This is one of the proposals made by the Delegation for Relations with Belarus a long time ago, and I am sure that a look at the action plan we put forward more than a year ago would reveal more proposals."
"Mr Milinkevich, we will never allow you to disappear."
"We are facing a complex situation after the presidential elections in Belarus."
"We must be aware of the fact that having won the election, Mr Lukashenko feels that his position is secure."
"In the following years, he will put even more effort into trying to consolidate his power."
"In this respect we should remember a very important factor: the Russian connections, the close cooperation between the Lukashenko regime and the Russian Federation, and the dependence of the Lukashenko regime – and Belarus – on the Russians in the economic and energy sector."
"Consequently, if the European Union is seeking an effective solution, one of the important things it should do is to include this topic in the agenda of the bilateral negotiations with Russia."
"International pressure must also be increased."
"In this respect, the NATO press release of 31 March deserves attention."
"Not only Mr Lukashenko, but all representatives of his administration, too, must be isolated to the greatest extent possible."
"The conditions of various grants must be made explicit and strictly checked, and we must consistently avoid becoming, even accidentally, participants or supporters of the success and consolidation of the Lukashenko regime."
"One of our priorities is to provide the Belarusian democratic forces led by Mr Alexander Milinkevich, as well as the civic organisations, not only with moral support, but also with well-considered, concrete financial assistance."
"Primarily, it is the Belarusian nation that needs to be woken up and informed – by television, radio, on the Internet and by other means – of the fact that this is not the face of true democracy, of a state founded on the rule of law."
"Inviting two representatives of the Belarus opposition, Mr Alexander Milinkevich and Mr Vincuk Viachorka, who had been imprisoned, was an excellent initiative; let the dictatorial regime know that we all give our full support to our two guests."
"I trust that you will all support the resolution proposal tabled before us."
"I support the position taken by Mr Winkler and Mrs Wallner and for my part would like to stress four points."
"Firstly, as the elections in Belarus were unfair, then legally Lukashenko is not the President and cannot be afforded this title in any European Parliament documents."
"Lukashenko should not be called President in this Chamber either."
"Secondly, in order to fight the indoctrination of the Belarusian people being carried out by media, which is controlled by Lukashenko, television programmes have to be broadcasted continuously from Lithuania, Poland and even Ukraine to the whole territory of Belarus, not just part of it."
"Television, not radio, has the greatest impact on people's consciousness."
"Thirdly, we must use all means possible to strengthen the united Belarusian opposition."
"And fourthly, we must constantly remind Russian President Putin that part of the reason why the Belarusian regime has not yet collapsed is that it is supported by Russia, and it is responsible for this."
"Mr President, 10 years ago a fine story by the Belarusian writer Vasil Bykov was published."
"It was entitled In this work the author describes – symbolically, of course – how Belarus identifies with European civilisation, espousing a similar system of values and thus rejecting ideologies based on hatred."
"On October Square, the Belarusian people demonstrated that they had recognised the blanket government propaganda spreading lies and fuelling untruths about Europe for what it was."
"For a couple of days, that square became freedom’s bridgehead from which appeals went out to the Belarusian people urging them to assert their national identity."
"In its efforts to rekindle national identity, the opposition was assisted by the creative talents of prominent figures from the world of Belarusian culture and literature."
"I could mention Vasil Bykov, Uladzimir Arlov and Slawomir Adamowicz."
"Even young people involved in contemporary pop culture lent their support."
"It is therefore incumbent on us to debunk the myth generally accepted in Europe according to which Belarusians have been Rusified to such an extent that they have no interest in regaining their separate identity based on their own particular culture, language and national symbols."
"What specific aid can the European Union provide for this purpose?"
"The EUR 2 million the Commission has allocated to the free media is but a drop in the ocean."
"It does not amount to much compared to the USD 60 million devoted this year alone by President Lukashenko to widespread propaganda, indoctrination and government media."
"In addition to support for the free media and independent journalists, funds are needed for other purposes, and I shall mention just a few of these."
"Aid should be provided for independent publishing houses publishing in the Belarusian language."
"I have in mind not only support for political and research publications but also for Belarusian literature."
"Scholarships should be made available for Belarusian researchers and for those engaged in the creative arts such as writers, poets and painters, so they can survive and continue their work."
"There must also be scholarships for the students expelled from centres of higher education and for students who do not wish to go into the government system and become totally indoctrinated, choosing instead to attend private centres of higher education in Belarus or apply to European ones."
"The only way to respond to regimes that imprison individuals simply for writing a poem is by providing extensive support for freedom of thought and creativity."
"In conclusion, and with regard to determining the methods and entities for awarding financial aid to free Belarus, I urge the Commissioner to include in the relevant decision-making bodies people with a good knowledge and understanding of Belarus, its circumstances, problems, and national identity which I mentioned earlier."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, this House has once again sent out a strong message, and your contributions have shown something that I regard as quite vital, and for which I am grateful, namely that you support and acknowledge the efforts of the Commission and the Council."
"It is important for the European Union to speak with one voice on this matter and to send the right signal."
"The Council and, I am sure, the Commission, too, will continue to work to this end."
"Mr Klich and others after him raised the issue of exerting influence on Russia."
"I would remind you that the declaration appended to the European Council's conclusions already explicitly states that we need to find ways of getting our international partners, and in particular Belarus' other neighbours, involved in this debate."
"There is absolutely no doubt that this matter obviously also needs to be raised with Russia, an important neighbour of Belarus."
"You can be assured that the Council will not avoid this subject in its dealings with Russia – we have just had a debate on human rights, and there will be other opportunities for this."
"We were also asked, hopefully rhetorically, whether we were afraid."
"All I can say to that is no, we are not afraid."
"We know full well what our values are, and we quite clearly stand up for them."
"Many of you pointed out that the relaxation of visa rules must apply specifically and concretely to those people who we want to receive here and show how western democracy works."
"That is, of course, inseparable from certain administrative issues."
"We are working on it – we want to invite the right people and give them the opportunity to come here."
"Conversely, it has also been demanded in the debate that we must put the right people, namely those responsible, on the visa ban list."
"The distinction between the visa ban that was already in place before the elections and the current situation is that, previously, only officials were affected, whereas we are now doing exactly what many of you called for: we want to target the politicians responsible."
"Somebody asked what the Council was going to do next week, on 10 April: we will, to be quite specific, adopt such a list, and then there will be no further barriers to implementation."
"The Council will also look into other possible sanctions and measures, in which connection we really must be very careful not to take any action that ultimately does the opposite of what we want to achieve."
"We must not put people at unnecessary risk through our actions."
"We want to protect them, including Mr Milinkevich, and we want to send a clear signal that we are on the side of the population and those people who are exercising their rights."
"You can therefore be assured that the Council will continue to work very seriously and vigorously and very specifically on those measures that are ultimately of use and that achieve the goal for which we are all aiming, namely democratisation and the inclusion of this country in the EU's neighbourhood programmes."
"That, at the end of the day, is what this is all about."
"We must tell the people, and show them, that it is to their advantage for the conditions to be met, so that this country too, just like Ukraine and other countries, can be included in the European neighbourhood programme."
"Another goal is for this country to join the Council of Europe, for it is the only one still not a member of it."
"That is not possible at the moment, because only countries that are willing and able to respect the human rights laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights can join the Council of Europe."
"The intention is that Belarus should, one day, be able to do that, and the Council will continue to work towards that goal."
". Mr President, I think the key message here was that we would like to be able to include Belarus in the Neighbourhood Policy."
"That is what we would like to do, with all the benefits for the population and the country."
"Let me answer a few of those specific matters brought up again in the discussion."
"Regarding Belarus, we are granting support to NGOs registered outside Belarus for activities benefiting Belarus through the EIDHR, the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, and that is not natural because, according to our rules, normally we can only work with NGOs inside the country, so we have tried to find a flexible solution."
"That flexibility will be continued over the coming years."
"An additional EUR 420 000 will soon be made available to NGOs located outside Belarus under the same instrument, and calls for proposals are there."
"Our future assistance tools that will replace the EIDHR and decentralised cooperation for the next period under the financial perspectives will allow for assistance to be granted outside Belarus."
"And we are currently finalising a proposal for our assistance strategy for the coming years."
"The media project was mentioned."
"It was very important to start with the media project that we financed."
"We financed five components of the media: TV, radio, the internet, support for the independent written press and the training of journalists over the next 24 months."
"We will have to continue with that. The daily radio broadcasts and the weekly TV programmes for Belarus started in February and immediately – I would say, two weeks after we had signed the contract – we tried to do everything to make the population of Belarus aware of that."
"Both the radio and TV components will keep providing independent, reliable and – we hope – very balanced information on Belarus, as well as on the EU, on the diversity of its 25 Member countries, and on our relations with Belarus."
"We, the Commission, will keep on developing synergies with other donors in the scope of this project, and radio programmes are now broadcast by a number of technical providers, via both FM and AM waves – I know that is another concern – and via the internet, which includes downloading options."
"On the question of visa facilitation, we know that this is something that has been requested."
"The general approach on visa facilitation that was adopted by the Council in December last year stated that, as opposed to readmission agreements, visa facilitation shall not be offered to third countries proactively."
"Despite this general common position, we are looking for possibilities to facilitate people-to-people contacts between the European Union and Belarus through measures waiving visa fees on an basis."
"It is not yet decided, but it is in the pipeline."
"In that respect, the existing and measures under preparation already provide for the appropriate for Member States to hopefully waiver visa fees for visitors from Belarus."
"Finally, on the question of students, we are very much inclined to facilitate access of Belarusian students to its universities."
"We fully share the view expressed by many of you that students have to be helped, not least because they have been the platform, the basis and the bulk of those who have protested peacefully after the elections, but also because the cementing of democracy will rest very much on their shoulders."
"Therefore we can facilitate access of the students to our universities, provided that all the Member States and the Commission pull their forces together and provided that we can find some sort of coordination between Member States and us, and I think the Commission would be ready to do that."
"This will also require financial efforts, which we are ready to consider."
"We have the Tempus and Erasmus programmes and, along with efforts made by the Member States, I think we can do a lot."
"Finally, on Russia, as Mr Winkler has already said, Russia is always clearly a topic in political dialogue because we speak about our common neighbours."
"These include the South Caucasus, Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus."
"President Barroso spoke with vigour on 17 March and reminded President Putin of our well-known position on democratisation but also warned that we would not accept violence on election day."
"There was no bloodshed during the elections on election day, but Russia needs to be convinced that leaders other than President Lukashenko would not threaten the special relationship with Belarus."
"You can be assured that we will try to go on working for you and with you on this issue."
"I have received six motions for resolutions(1) pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"( The European Union attaches great importance to respect for human rights and the creation of democracy the world over."
"It must, however, pay particular attention to events just beyond its borders."
"Once again, Europe’s last dictatorship has provided a painful reminder of its sinister nature."
"Fraudulent elections, persecution of political opponents, suppression of freedom of assembly and expression, such are the actions of the Belarusian regime."
"We support the Belarusian opposition because it is fighting for something we take for granted, namely democracy and freedom."
"It is also fighting for the nation's sovereignty, threatened by the dictator's sick ambitions that run counter to the interests of the nation."
"We support the opposition not because we share its political views but because of the aims it is struggling to achieve."
"We ought also to do everything in our power to make life difficult for the regime and for Mr Lukashenko."
"People who do not respect values that are important to us ought not to be able to benefit from their application."
"The dictator's supporters must realise they have no place in Europe."
"Europe is for those who respect freedom, democracy and the rule of law."
"Mr Milinkevich has said that the dictatorship will not last long and that change is in the air."
"I most earnestly hope that he will be proved right, for the sake of the Belarusian nation and for the whole of Europe."
"Let us hope that those who are fighting for freedom will draw strength from their optimism and succeed in overthrowing the tyrant."
"The next item is a statement by the Council and the Commission on the elections in Ukraine."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what a difference!"
"Just a few minutes ago we were discussing the so-called 'elections' in a country where it is clear – as the international observers concluded – that they were neither free, fair nor democratic."
"In contrast, we are now talking about a country where democratisation has made huge progress, and where the European Union has made a major contribution to that fact."
"The parliamentary elections in Ukraine on 26 March were at the opposite end of the democratic spectrum to those in Belarus."
"Apart from a few technical problems and shortcomings, they were free and fair, and gave the Ukrainian electorate the opportunity to cast their votes without hindrance, having been well informed by an active, open and fair election campaign observed by a free press."
"The international observers agreed with this."
"That is a great success for all of us – a success for Europe, for the European Union, for the OSCE and for the Council of Europe."
"We take pleasure in noting that these elections were indeed conducted under the conditions we like to see."
"The elections also showed that the people of Ukraine have assumed responsibility for democracy in their own country."
"That is a milestone in the process of consolidating a democracy that started with the 'Orange Revolution'."
"To me, the especially important thing is – and it is therefore convenient that the debates on Belarus and Ukraine have been held so close together – that the elections set a welcome new standard for elections throughout the region and are therefore an example for the region and for other countries in the Union."
"There were technical problems and shortcomings, but not to an extent that should cause us concern."
"We expect that the authorities will be able to solve these problems themselves, so that they will not reoccur at the next elections."
"Unlike in the case of Belarus, the European Union is now in a position to press on with its efforts to strengthen its partnership with Ukraine."
"This partnership is based on shared values that are expressed in the quality of the democracy and the reforms in Ukraine."
"In this respect, the elections represented an important step and opened the way to consultations on a new, broader agreement with Ukraine, superseding the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement."
"We are happy to support the new government in Ukraine in its efforts to push its reform agenda forward."
"We will make our own contribution to ensuring that the programme continues to live and work within the framework of the neighbourhood policy and the action plan, and that Ukraine continues to make progress democratically – in this respect the country has already come a long way – and also economically, socially and politically."
"We in the European Union want to help with that."
". Mr President, I will be even briefer, because the President-in-Office has already said it all."
"The elections were indeed free and fair, and we can really be delighted with that."
"President Yushchenko set himself that target, and he certainly achieved it."
"It now remains to be seen what sort of coalition will be created."
"The coalition negotiations are in progress, and they are not easy, but it is important that we make it clear now that we will be happy to work with any coalition that wants to continue to work with the European Union and move in our direction."
"It is very important for us to indicate right now that we will give Ukraine the option of a closer agreement, in which the issue of the WTO will play a particularly important role."
"Once Ukraine is a member of the WTO, we can have a free trade area, which is absolutely vital for further progress in Ukraine."
"That pretty much covers everything."
"It goes without saying, though, that we want to continue to work with Ukraine as it approaches the European Union, within the framework of the neighbourhood policy."
". Mr President, I was privileged to observe the 26 March Ukrainian parliamentary election on behalf of this House and the delegation from my political group, the PPE-DE Group."
"Those elections, in all our views, were held on the day in an exemplary fashion."
"I formed the view, personally, that in many ways the elections were superior in design to those in my own country, the United Kingdom."
"First of all Ukrainian officials demanded rigorous identity checks from all voters, something we do not do in Britain."
"Secondly, the polling stations had transparent plastic, sealed ballot boxes, which were watched by official observers, as they filled up throughout the day, and were counted on the spot."
"In my country the boxes are of black wood, no observers are allowed into the polling stations and our boxes are transported by officials, but with no observers, to a centralised counting point."
"Furthermore, Ukraine has no postal votes, which have been implicated in my country, the United Kingdom, as subject to fraud."
"The only minor problem we encountered, which reflected the large turnout of enthusiasm to participate in the election, was slight overcrowding in some polling stations."
"I also welcome the long-term observer and media monitoring reports, which stated clearly that the entire campaign was conducted in a spirit of transparency and fair access to the media, both by the government and by the opposition parties."
"I have always championed Ukraine as a modern European country that is entitled, in due course, under Article 49 of the Treaty, to apply for EU membership."
"That is still some way off, given the enlargement fatigue that has now set in and the fear of some Member States of offending Russia."
"That does not represent the views of either my group or this Parliament."
"Nevertheless, in the meantime, the European Union must collectively do more to recognise that Ukraine has demonstrated political maturity in fully respecting European norms of democracy, human rights and the rule of law."
"We must now reward that irreversible process."
"A new government is being formed in Kiev, but I am confident that whatever its composition, it will remain committed to European integration."
"That is why our resolution requests from the Council and the Commission that plans be made that go beyond the PCA formulation towards a free trade and visa-free travel area, particularly if Ukraine can shortly join the WTO."
"Ideally that should take the form of an association agreement, although the Commission – and I have to say as ENP rapporteur, I might agree with this – might logically argue for an ENP neighbourhood agreement instead in the first instance."
"Either way, Ukrainians must be brought closer to Europe, where they rightfully belong."
"It is now clear to all of us that the enduring legacy of the Orange Revolution, namely a lasting democracy and free media, is intact for all to see."
". Mr President, ‘together we are many, we will not be defeated’ – this was the slogan under which the people of Ukraine gained their freedom 18 months ago on Independence Square."
"They won their battle for a better country."
"On 26 March, those same people, in that same country, 18 months older and wiser, posed themselves the question as to how to win the peace."
"Seventy per cent of Ukrainians went to the polls confident that none of the votes would be falsified and wasted."
"That was the start of their battle for peace."
"I was privileged to lead the European Parliament’s representatives within the team of international observers."
"These observers concluded that the elections were free and fair."
"Ukrainian democracy passed its quality control test, thanks in part to the efforts of this House."
"I should like to thank the representatives of all the political groups who participated in the observation mission and spent time in Ukraine recently."
"We can rejoice in a job well done."
"As to the political situation in Ukraine following the elections, only five groups are represented in the Parliament."
"There was a ruthless purge of small and weak parties owing allegiance exclusively to their leaders."
"Mr Yanukovych and the Party of the Regions won, but they are not trumpeting their victory from the rooftops."
"The Orange Coalition led by Mrs Tymoshenko, Mr Yekhanurov and Mr Moroz gained over half the seats on the Supreme Council and will bear a heavy responsibility for past and future events in Ukraine."
"The geographical and political divide in that country has deepened, although there tends to be little difference between the programmes of the various parties."
"What of the future?"
"Ukraine needs a strong coalition and stable government."
"It is to be hoped that any future coalition and new Ukrainian Government will not be based on historical reminiscences of events on Independence Square, but on a courageous reforming programme."
"President Yushchenko has a particular role to play and duty to perform."
"In addition to holding the Orange Coalition together, he needs to bring Ukrainians together to tackle the most urgent issues, namely a national reform programme."
"The latter cannot be achieved by imposing the will of the majority on that of the minority."
"The only way forward is by reaching an understanding with that minority."
"Ukraine’s leaders must learn how to compromise and what cohabitation involves."
"They must also understand that it is incumbent on them to reach agreement on certain issues, despite their differences."
"The resolution before us reflects the consensus within the European Parliament on issues pertaining to Ukraine."
"It also places obligations on all those who committed to ensuring progress in Ukraine, including the Members of this House and the European institutions."
". – Having witnessed the previous Presidential elections and these most recent elections, I see welcome changes in Ukraine's democratisation process."
"Openness of the election campaign, the transparent organisation of the election process itself, voter activity and goodwill – these were the overall conclusions of all international observers and Ukrainians themselves."
"It is very important that the democracy process does not stop now."
"There are certain things which cause concern: pandering to national sentiments, the high level of corruption, barriers to foreign investment, the abundance of oligarchs on the election lists and the domination of personalities, not election manifestos – these things are all a legacy of the Soviet period."
"It is important that they do not get in the way of progressive processes."
"Here above all our moral support is needed."
"We need to share positive experiences as much as possible."
"Countries like Lithuania, which have come from the same Soviet camp, are especially suited to this role."
"Europe must increase opportunities for people’s cooperation in culture, education as well as simply cooperation between citizens."
"We have to help Ukraine rejoin the European family."
"A European Association Agreement would be a realistic way of lending a hand to Ukraine."
"– Mr President, what was the most important thing I noticed as an election observer in the Ukraine?"
"It was the total dedication with which many citizens exercised their right to vote freely, for which they had fought a year previously."
"It was almost shocking to come back to Germany after these elections and to see how unimportant this right now is to Germans, and how few people really value it."
"The conclusion I draw from this experience is that Europe can benefit enormously from this process in Ukraine."
"We cannot continue with the 'business as usual' attitude that has crept into the relationship between the European Union and Ukraine just one year after the Orange Revolution."
"I have the impression – and this is based partly on the writer Yuri Andrukhovych's stirring speech in Leipzig – that there is a risk that Kiev is losing hope in Europe."
"That must not be allowed to happen."
"Therefore, I would say to you, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, and to the Council: you must be more precise and more ambitious in the offers you make to Ukraine."
"You must not allow the statement by the former Commissioner for Enlargement, Mr Verheugen, that there would still be no place for Ukraine in the European Union even in 20 years time, to stand."
"Nobody in a position of responsibility in the European Union should make such dogmatic statements in public."
". I fully support what the previous speaker just said."
"I also urge the Commissioner to come up with a much stronger and more specific text concerning Ukraine’s future membership of the European Union."
"It is hard to find a more joyful, convincing and heartening example of democracy’s success in the brief history of Europe’s new era."
"In particular, the 70% of Ukrainians who exercised their right to vote, a right which was challenged and threatened all across that country only 18 months ago, demonstrated to us the importance of democracy."
"In the European Union we tend to treat democracy as something quite ordinary which does not need to be nurtured."
"I should like to say that I believe it is entirely appropriate for the speakers taking the floor in this debate not to comment on the result of the elections in Ukraine and on the outcome of the vote by the Ukrainian nation."
"When Members of this House became involved in the elections 18 months ago, it was not to support particular candidates."
"We were supporting the people of Ukraine as they asserted their right to express their will freely."
"This right was respected in the latest elections and the people of Ukraine went to the polls."
"They now need our support as they set off on their journey towards the European Union."
"Mr President, as stated by previous speakers, Ukraine is the European Union’s nearest neighbour and it has become a parliamentary democracy."
"Democracies take a long time to establish, however, and they need to be nurtured."
"A healthy free market economy is one of the key characteristics of a democracy, and it is here that the greatest challenge facing our eastern neighbours lies."
"Ukraine needs support and it needs to be assured that the Union will be open and welcoming towards it."
"This means that we must support not only the values we hold dear but also the interests we have in common with Ukraine."
"Firstly, Ukraine can support the Union’s energy policy."
"It has its own reserves of natural gas and the largest natural gas fields in Europe."
"Oil and gas from the Caspian Sea can be transported to Europe through Ukraine without involving any other countries."
"This requires joint investment in pipelines, assisted by the European Investment Bank, the Neighbourhood Policy and Trans-European networks."
"Secondly, as Europe gradually opens up its economy to Ukraine, its common market in goods will become considerably larger."
"Thirdly, Union investment in Ukraine could be particularly profitable because of Ukraine’s well-educated labour force and receptive market."
"Fourthly, unlike other European countries, Ukraine does not have demographic problems."
"Fifthly, an independent, democratic and full market Ukraine will stabilise the situation beyond Europe’s eastern border."
"It will also stimulate positive political and economic changes in neighbouring countries."
"Allow me to reiterate that we must be concerned not only with the key values we defend but also with our interests."
"It is important to promote them, and to enter into an Association Agreement with Ukraine as soon as possible."
"The principle of free visas for Ukrainian citizens should also be adopted at the earliest opportunity."
"Mr President, 15 months ago, Ukraine fought for democracy, while this time round, it fought a democratic battle, and there is a world of difference in that."
"It is a step forward, one that deserves our admiration and our greatest respect."
"The European Union plays a key role in this."
"That is exactly what the Commission’s delegation in Kiev is doing, and, I might add, doing it in an expert manner."
"This concrete aid from the Commission and the Member States must now be reinforced at bilateral level. Those ties must now be strengthened in an ambitious manner."
"There is some support for this, but not enough."
"Where the European Union was too cowardly to actually condemn Putin’s attitude of unfeeling cynicism towards Belarus, we must now send out a positive sign to the Ukrainians to demonstrate to the Ukrainian people that their choice in favour of democracy also leads to concrete improvements in their day-to-day lives."
"Mr President, I am sure the European Union does not regret its part in resolving the conflict in Ukraine several months ago."
"It was thanks to the European Union’s involvement that no blood was spilt in that country."
"It was also thanks to the European Union that democracy began to develop in Ukraine, albeit slowly."
"It is still there, however, and the recent elections have been a great success."
"The question now arising is: what next?"
"What more can we do to help Ukraine?"
"Mr Winkler has just assured us that there is a will to do so."
"I believe the Union must say quite clearly that Ukraine is entitled to join it."
"It is high time for it to make a statement to this effect, although obviously the Union will have to set challenging and demanding criteria, and we can expect it to be a long time before Ukraine is able to comply with them."
"Nonetheless, such a statement needs to be made, because only an offer of this nature will suffice to spur internal forces into action to develop democracy and the free market economy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I had the opportunity to observe the parliamentary elections in Ukraine, where the atmosphere was very different from the passions provoked during the presidential elections."
"This time elections were free and democratic, and the atmosphere was very similar to what we see in our own countries."
"The elections were not, however, free of technical shortcomings."
"Inaccuracies in the electoral rolls and the fact that the parliamentary elections were organised at the same time as various levels of local government elections made the voting process long and complicated."
"Ukraine also ought to introduce a limit on pre-election campaign expenditure by the political parties, to limit possible corruption and ensure fair competition."
"The comparatively low level of support from the people of Ukraine for the Orange Revolution forces can be explained by the fact that the pace of reform over the course of the year was insufficient."
"It is interesting, however, that contrary to Russia’s expectations pressure from Russia in connection with gas supplies and the blocking of exports from Ukraine directly fuelled support for the forces of democracy."
"These forces are the only ones that can ensure that reforms continue."
"On election night Yulia Timoshenko confirmed to us her willingness to form an orange coalition with the ‘Our Ukraine’ bloc, including the social democrats."
"The European Union, for its part, should state that Ukraine’s attempts to become integrated into Europe are being assessed."
"I would like to call on the Commission to provide Ukraine with all possible assistance to enable it to overcome its weak administrative capacity, fight corruption effectively and decrease the influence of the oligarchy in politics, to reform the legal system and thus reinforce democracy."
"It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Ukraine for the fact that the elections, which took place on 26 March, were democratic, free, fair and satisfied international democratic standards."
"This alone is a great victory for the people of Ukraine as they create a civil society, especially when one remembers the events of December 2004 which caused considerable concern and ended with democratic Presidential elections, and also the fact that over the past two years, Ukraine has achieved good results as it implements democratic reforms."
"Now we can only hope that the coalition, in which the majority of citizens placed their trust during the elections, will be able to come to an agreement and form a coalition government to continue the democratic and market reforms which have already begun, and will consolidate democracy."
"Soon after the elections Javier Solana stated that the EU intends to activate cooperation with Ukraine, to support political and economic reforms, which will guarantee the rule of law, and to consolidate market economy principles in the country, and I might also add, to support a more effective war on corruption and the shadow economy."
"The EU, like the USA, supports and will continue to support Ukraine's aim to become a WTO Member and is striving to accelerate the country's admission to this organisation."
"Ukraine must also carry out its own mission in the region."
"By this I mean the solution of the Moldova-Transnistrian problem and in this task Ukraine deserves the support of the European Union."
"According to the results of a sociological survey conducted last month in Ukraine, 42.9 per cent of Ukrainians support the country's membership in the EU, while US President Bush has stated that, and I quote, ‘the USA is prepared to support Ukraine during the process of integration into the EU and NATO’."
"And how will the European Union itself respond to this?"
"How will we respond to the expectations of the Ukrainian people and their elected representatives?"
"Are we, the European Parliament, ready to have a constructive debate on Ukraine's European integration, or simply the European perspective?"
"I believe that once again the future will depend on the Ukrainian people's political will and determination, on their efforts, as no matter how we look at it, Ukraine is in Europe."
"Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union states that all European countries have the right to become EU Members."
". Mr President, I would just like to respond to a few questions."
"Mr Tannock, I am deeply impressed by your report on the elections."
"I would not go so far as to compare Ukraine’s election law with the law of our countries, as different countries have different election laws, but the important thing is that the elections in Ukraine were indeed fair and democratic and I think that is very important."
"I was also very impressed by the election observers' report of the great enthusiasm."
"In order to keep up this enthusiasm, and the faith in the European Union, we – the European Union, that is – must now take specific steps."
"We are ready to do so."
"I absolutely agree that it is not sensible to talk about specific timetables, but to avoid stumbling we need to take one step at a time, and not try to run before we can walk."
"The next step is to develop greater cooperation."
"There is a specific need for this, and the Council will do so in cooperation with the Commission."
"We are doing this in order to help Ukraine to develop further and to implement the necessary reforms."
"When Mr Kaminski said that it was not up to us to assess the elections and the parties, he was quite right."
"However, we can note with satisfaction that those who advocate a closer relationship with the European Union won and have the majority."
"We should therefore hold out our hand to them."
". Mr President, I, too, will keep my comments brief."
"I should just like to assure you that we will certainly not let this become a matter of routine."
"I am sorry that Mrs Harms has already left, because I should have liked to have said that to her personally."
"It is precisely using this possibility of a deeper and stronger agreement that it will be achieved."
"When one looks at what it all involves – quite apart from increased political dialogue – it primarily comes down to cooperation in legal matters and in the particularly important fields of justice and internal affairs."
"Firstly, one thing that is particularly important to us, and which was mentioned during the debate, is the issue of energy policy, which, for all of us, is becoming an increasingly vital aspect of foreign policy."
"Then there is the free trade agreement, to which I referred earlier."
"There can therefore be no question of 'business as usual' in this field."
"Secondly, as the Commissioner responsible for this field, I always made my statements extremely precise, perhaps too precise for some."
"I should like to make this quite clear: as I have always said, the future cannot be prejudged."
"At the moment, however, we are working through the neighbourhood policy, which does not provide for membership."
"I cannot be any more precise."
"That does not mean, though, that we will not continue to work with Ukraine with great verve and enthusiasm, as the President-in-Office said."
"We are very pleased with these elections."
"They represent a huge step forwards, and I am delighted that so many of you observed them and share this opinion with us."
"Six motions for resolutions(1) to wind up the debate have been tabled under Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on measures to enhance road safety (SAFETY) and security measures in the transport sector, including the financing thereof (SECURITY)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my gratitude to you for having the topic of road safety on the order of business for today."
"As you know, making people in every European state even more aware of this issue than they already are is a particular concern of the Austrian Presidency, the intention being that this should lay another vital foundation stone for a common European road safety policy."
"It was this that led the Presidency to call the informal meeting in Bregenz in Austria on 2 and 3 March, the object being to devote two whole days, at European level, to road safety to the exclusion of all else."
"In the course of this meeting, and during numerous bilateral conversations, we succeeded in doing justice to the Austrian Presidency's slogan: ‘Crossing Borders in Road Safety – Creating a Trans-European Road Safety Culture’."
"I am, then, very grateful to the Commission for its presentation of the mid-term review of the European Road Safety Action Programme, which was discussed during the informal meeting of transport ministers on 2 and 3 March, which I have already mentioned, and most recently at the Council of Transport Ministers on 27 March in Brussels."
"It is at this point that I would like to make an advance announcement to the effect that the Austrian Presidency also intends that the formal Council of Ministers in Luxembourg on 9 June should adopt final conclusions on road safety."
"The European Road Safety Action Programme, which dates back to 2003 and aims to reduce by half the number of deaths in road traffic in the European Union by 2010, lays down EU-wide road safety targets for the period from 2003 to 2010, and includes 60 measures to be implemented across the EU, most of which are not legislative in character."
"This constitutes a consistent reiteration of the priority of road safety, which had already been laid down in the 2001 White Paper on Transport."
"Underpinning all these efforts towards road safety is the long-term determination that in future no more citizens of the EU should be killed or seriously injured in road accidents."
"A great deal of joint effort is still required if we are to progress further towards this goal."
"It is abundantly clear from the mid-term review of the EU Road Safety Action Programme, which Vice-President Barrot presented to the meeting I have already mentioned, that Europe may well be on the right road, but is still proceeding at too low a speed."
"Let me mention just two or three striking figures, which Mr Barrot has already put before us."
"The goal of having some 25 000 road traffic fatalities in 2010, lamentable though they would still be, might well be achieved if we were already making better progress."
"If we were to extrapolate from what we have achieved so far, we would end up with a figure of 32 500."
"We must step up all our efforts in order to achieve as far as possible the ambitious target we have set ourselves."
"A successful transport policy rests on three essential pillars – people, vehicles and infrastructure, and, in the course of the meeting to which I have referred, we were able to discuss all three of them in detail."
"What does give cause for concern – and this is something I particularly want to stress today – is the trend as regards the numbers of motorcycle and moped users killed."
"They constitute the only category of road users among whom the number of deaths is increasing rather than decreasing."
"If this trend is not stopped, there will, in 2010, be only half as many people killed on Europe’s roads, but one out of every three of them will be a motorcyclist, as against the present one in six."
"Passing on to infrastructure, Europe must be aware of its responsibility for making suitable instruments available to infrastructure operators, for only if it does so will we succeed in minimising the risk to those who travel on our European road networks."
"Where vehicles are concerned, it should be emphasised that modern e-safety technology can make a quite essential contribution to improving road safety. E-safety technology is intended to ensure an intelligent link between man and machine and to enable drivers to free themselves from routine actions."
"One of the things on which the informal Council in Bregenz (Austria) focussed was the subject of public awareness."
"In Bregenz we had a very brief and concentrated opportunity to study and compare our European colleagues’ activities in raising public awareness."
"The evaluation of the various campaign activities showed that targeted awareness campaigns can in fact achieve a great deal."
"We in Austria, too, have done a lot in this regard in the last few years, stirring people up, thinking or making people think and ultimately, and most importantly, getting people to change their behaviour in a way that makes for greater road safety and fewer road deaths, fewer people injured and seriously injured in road accidents."
"We also agreed that a joint European awareness campaign on the subject could bring synergy effects and greater effectiveness."
"On the basis of a poll, we found that the subjects of drunken driving and fatigue at the wheel should be tackled as a matter of priority."
"I am pleased to say that the Commission promised to provide assistance, chiefly of an organisational nature and of course within the rules that apply, and suggested that the High Level Group on Road Safety could be asked to develop a proposal to that effect."
"The Commission’s intention of also introducing a ‘European Road Safety Day’ is also fully in line with our common objectives for enhancing road safety."
"I am sure that an initiative of that kind will also help to create greater public awareness throughout Europe."
"My special thanks are due here to Vice-President and Commissioner Jacques Barrot for his particular commitment."
"Significant efforts have been made since 2001 to make Europe’s roads safer."
"A number of legislative measures have been taken in both the technical and regulatory fields, for example provisions governing seat belts, the digital tachograph, driving and rest periods, the driving licence or rules for professional lorry drivers."
"Initiatives such as CARS 21 or the European Road Safety Charter, which create awareness in European local authorities, regions, undertakings, associations etc., should also be mentioned here."
"Vice-President Barrot’s activities and initiatives, which include proposals already announced for daytime running lights, blind-spot mirrors and in the field of infrastructure, will help to make our roads safer at European level."
"May I say in conclusion that if the problems in some Member States with a high level of transit traffic are even greater than the European average, then we should start where the figures are not falling very much or where fatalities are in some cases still rising, for every death on Europe’s roads is one such death too many."
"I want to thank Parliament for the opportunity of speaking on this important topic of road safety today and I would like to say that we must not flag in our efforts to make Europe’s roads as safe as possible and thereby prevent much misery and grief."
". Mr President, Mr Gorbach, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the agenda concerns two issues: road safety and security measures in the transport sector."
"I should like to echo what Mr Gorbach said in his excellent speech and to thank him straightaway for his personal commitment to this great cause that is road safety."
"Thank you, Mr Gorbach, for having placed this major problem of road safety at the heart of the Austrian Presidency’s priorities."
"Just as I, myself, had to do when I gave an account, after five years, of our assessment on the basis of the programme that the European Union had set itself in 2002, we must note that the countries comprising today’s European Union saw 50 000 people die on the roads in 2001."
"The common objective proposed in 2001 and updated today is not to exceed the figure of 25 000 deaths in 2010."
"To save 25 000 lives!"
"What stage are we at with this?"
"In 2005, we still recorded 41 600 deaths."
"That corresponds to a reduction of 17.5% in four years."
"Considerable progress has been made in some Member States in particular, but it is not enough."
"As you said, Mr Gorbach, the number of deaths in the Union is in danger of increasing to 32 500 in the year 2010 if we do not take it upon ourselves to give new impetus to this road safety policy."
"Greater efforts are necessary, and the disparities between the Member States must be rectified."
"The Austrian Presidency has enabled us to make progress with an agreement on the European driving licence, for which I should like to express my gratitude once again."
"I would point out that this driving licence is accompanied by a licence for mopeds and a progressive licence for the most powerful motorcycles."
"That should enable us to reduce the number of motorcycle deaths, which is increasing at an alarming rate."
"Over and above this assessment and over and above the progress made during this Presidency, the Commission will present, in 2006, new initiatives to be included in the action plan that I will propose in the revised White Paper."
"Firstly, a proposal for a directive on the management of road safety in the trans-European network."
"It is not a question of us explaining how a road should be made safer, but of the European Union confirming, in each of the Member States, that a great deal of attention is paid to safety when a new road is built or an existing one is improved."
"Secondly, a proposal for a directive that will enable cross-border legal action to be taken in the most serious cases of a violation of the highway code: speeding, drink driving and driving without wearing a seat belt."
"It is not right that the perpetrator of a serious offence should escape punishment simply by crossing the border."
"Finally, as you said, Mr Gorbach, we are going to close a loophole in the current legislation regarding the blind-spot mirrors fitted to existing heavy goods vehicles."
"We are also endeavouring to make progress with the idea of a third ‘daytime’ running light."
"Some Member States already want the opportunity to request this extra equipment for cars."
"Together with my colleague, Mr Verheugen, we are now going to examine how this issue should be dealt with and what follow-up action should be taken in relation to the recommendations made by the CARS 21 group, which has listed a whole host of safety equipment that is likely to be very beneficial to the vehicles on Europe's roads."
"In concluding this first point, I should like to confirm that our assessment of the progress made in the field of road safety will continue on an annual basis."
"Mr Gorbach also mentioned the idea of a European Road Safety Day, as well as the launch of awareness campaigns, events that will all need to be carried out at European level."
"I can confirm to Parliament that we are working in conjunction with the Presidency on all of these matters."
"If you will allow me, I am now going to address the issue of the security of modes of transport, including the difficult subject of how they are financed."
"I know that this issue worries the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"Following the events of 11 September 2001, the Commission proposed a framework regulation designed to lay down common rules in the field of civil aviation security."
"The support of Parliament, together with that of the Council, was crucial to the successful conclusion of that legislative process."
"That regulation was accompanied by an interinstitutional declaration in which our three institutions reaffirmed their determination to enhance the quality of aviation security systems in the Community."
"Furthermore, it seemed necessary to prevent any distortion of internal and external competition."
"Finally, the three institutions noted the Commission’s intention to commission a study concerning the way in which the financing of security is divided up between public authorities and operators."
"The Commission committed itself to submitting to the European Parliament and the Council the results and the proposals that would emerge from this study."
"A similar position was taken when the regulation on the improvement of ships and ports security was adopted in 2004."
"The regulation recognised that the actual, uniform application of security measures raised important questions, which were always linked to financing."
"In that respect, the Commission also had to embark upon a study with a view to sending information to the European Parliament and to examining any proposals that would be worth presenting."
"The Commission put in place, from 2004, an inspection system that has helped significantly to enhance aviation security."
"To date, the Commission has carried out 69 inspections in all of the Member States."
"In the light of these inspections, the Commission proposed, at the end of 2005, the revision of Regulation 2320/2002, which is currently being looked into by the Committee on Transport and Tourism and for which you, Mr Costa, are the rapporteur."
"Together with this proposal for a revision, the Commission presented the first annual report on the implementation of the regulation currently in force, as well as the main results of the inspections."
"Furthermore, I would highlight the fact that the regulatory committee created by the framework regulation of 2002 has worked hard and has made it possible for eight implementing regulations to be adopted."
"The Commission has also launched two crucial studies, which have confirmed the importance of the issue of financing."
"As regards aviation, the study was brought to completion in 2004."
"The results were published on the Commission’s website."
"The study on the financing of maritime security will shortly be completed, and the results will be submitted to you as soon as they become available."
"As regards civil aviation security, the study carried out shows that the costs incurred within the Union, which consisted at that time of 15 Member States, fluctuated between EUR 2.5 billion and EUR 3.6 billion in 2002."
"We can regard this amount as a large figure at the same time as emphasising the fact that, in the field of intra-Community transport, the combination of airport and security charges and taxes represented 1% to 2% of the average price of flight tickets."
"This study also highlighted some differences in the methods of financing."
"There are major differences as regards the role of the State."
"The study also highlighted a certain lack of transparency as regards security taxes and charges."
"In that respect, I must explain to Parliament that I have decided to organise a meeting between all of the air traffic operators, which will be held tomorrow and the day after tomorrow."
"This meeting will mainly focus on airport taxes, but it will certainly reflect on these security problems and their associated cost."
"On the subject of maritime security, the preliminary results from the study also confirm that the costs are substantial, even though expenditure in the maritime sector is rather limited in relation to the total costs."
"The European Union has more than 1 200 seaports and around 3 700 port facilities, for which, according to this report, the average investment in security amounts to more than EUR 400 000, with running costs exceeding EUR 200 000 per year."
"As regards the security of ships, the average investment stands at EUR 100 000, with running costs of around EUR 25 000 per year."
"Those are the facts in relation to this complex problem. I recognise that it is a major problem, but I also have to admit that it is now difficult to say for certain that we can find a solution that can be imposed on everyone."
"That is why we must reflect together on these security problems and on the way in which they will be financed, and I am delighted to hear your contributions on this subject."
"This is a problem that will obviously have to be dealt with very rigorously in the future."
"That, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is what I wanted to say, and I should like to thank you and to thank the Austrian Presidency for allowing us to hold this debate on the two issues of road safety and security problems."
"Mr President, I agree with your question, and we ought to discuss in presidium how we can arrive at a sensible procedure while respecting all the constitutional rights of the institutions."
"It cannot be right for the Council and Commission together to speak for 25 minutes in a debate for which half an hour is allocated."
"When are they actually to debate with us?"
"If the two institutions want to debate among themselves, surely they can do that in the Council."
"I want to come back to the heart of the matter, however."
"Road safety is not the heart of the matter."
"Thank you for what you have said, Vice-Chancellor, I agree with you."
"The heart of the matter is the simple question: how can we pay for security measures in aviation?"
"This problem was raised with the Costa report."
"It is high time we discussed it."
"May I remind you that we as the European Parliament agreed in 2002 that the aviation security measures occasioned by terrorism should be paid for by the Member States."
"Counter-terrorism is a public function and paying for it is therefore also a public function."
"Then, because we were unable to agree, in the legislative process for the basic regulation in 2002 we settled for at least an interinstitutional agreement that the Commission should present a proposal for the public financing of such aviation security measures."
"Mr Vice-President, you know how much I respect you, but I do not expect you to submit studies, I expect you to present a clear report with clear legislative proposals."
"After four years you ought to be in a position – you might at least perhaps be kind enough to deal with that – to say when you will be coming forward with a definite proposal."
"There were rumours it would be in April."
"Now they are saying the end of the year."
"After four years that is no longer tolerable."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I also want to have a clear statement from you: if we are agreed that the additional measures after 2001 were counter-terrorism measures, do you also believe that these measures should be financed by the State?"
"Yes or no?"
"We believe they should be."
"."
"Mr President, sharing, as I do, Mr Jarzembowski’s view, I think that the topic of traffic safety deserves a debate of its own and that we are keen to enlarge on it on a different occasion."
"I would like to confine myself to the issue of funding safety."
"Since the attacks of 9/11, safety in the transport sector has become an important area of concern, for Europe as much as for anyone else, and with good reason."
"The port sector has been looked at, European legislation has changed safety at airports beyond all recognition, and I am glad to see that other measures are under way."
"If we want to adopt sound safety policy, though, we should not only draft common safety guidelines which, needless to say, should apply everywhere in the same way, we must also be clear about who will be footing the bill for all of this."
"We need common European rules for this, along with a level playing field, therefore."
"We cannot have a situation where in one Member State, all of the costs are passed on to the passengers, while in another Member State, most of the costs are borne by the state."
"A regulation in this respect is all the more urgent, because the costs involved in new safety measures continue to spiral out of all proportion."
"Accordingly, since 2001, Brussels airport has doubled its safety supplement which it charges each of its passengers."
"We have now also started to draft fresh legislation."
"As already stated, though, an interinstitutional declaration was drafted on this very topic as long ago as 2002. This was accompanied by the pledge that a solution for the problem of funding would be tabled shortly."
"The Commission promised to present a communication on a strategy to tackle this problem by the end of 2005."
"We are still waiting for this communication."
"A while ago, rumour had it that we could expect this by the end of April, which turned out incorrect."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner when we can expect this communication."
"Indeed, under these circumstances, it is difficult for us, as co-legislators, to do our jobs properly."
"We may be discussing the change to Regulation 2320, but we have no idea where we are headed in respect of an important component in the dossier."
"I accept that it is difficult, Commissioner, but you should present a number of ideas at the earliest opportunity, allowing us to hold a thorough debate."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my language, the word ‘’ covers the meaning of the two English words ‘safety’ and ‘security’."
"It seems to me, however, that today’s confusion cannot be ascribed purely to the linguistic factor."
"These two subjects are too important to be tackled together."
"I must admit, however, that when it comes to the ‘safety’ aspect of the word, it is thanks to the contribution of Parliament that fundamental progress has been made with regard to driving time and driving licences."
"I would like to make just one point: the greatest contribution we could probably make to road safety would be to make less people use the roads."
"Coming, though, to the ‘security’ sense of the word, and to its financing – which is a problem that concerns me directly, as rapporteur of this measure – I ask myself the following question: ‘Can we proceed with amending the regulation in accordance with the standards that define security without answering the question our citizens are asking, namely who will pay for it?’"
"This strikes me as the key point."
"It is rather difficult to answer ‘yes’, partly because we have also come to realise that security is a single issue, that there are not 25 types of security and that it is not possible for each Member State to establish its own security."
"If, however, a single security exists for all countries, then we cannot do anything other than define standard, potentially uniform, measures, and establish in a clear, transparent way how to pay for it."
"There could then also be additional measures, which are more stringent and apply only in particular countries. Even in this case, though, how can we guarantee that these independent measures do not interfere negatively with, and have repercussions on, the security of the other countries?"
"While we wait, reality moves on."
"What we have today is, in fact, a basic security financed through fares and extra ticket costs, and more or less cofinanced by the Member States according to the levels of security they wish to establish."
"This system must be regulated differently."
"I think that the Member States should at least pay for the surplus measures and that it is essential that there be clarity regarding the basic level of cofinance between operator or, better, user Member States."
"We must follow these principles at least in order to continue our work."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate goes back to a very serious question from the Committee on Transport and Tourism about the financing of present and future measures in the matter of security."
"That is what I want to comment about."
"Transport security could also have been discussed with the Titley report."
"So it is being discussed now, and we are talking primarily not only about the financing of additional measures in individual States, which are calling for more security at airports, but also – and this is serious – the overall system."
"We were promised a communication here that ought to have provided us with the basis for this debate."
"Now Parliament is being called upon to put forward proposals."
"I am sure we all agree that we want a good foundation on which to do that."
"We are not talking only about aviation."
"The tragic events in Madrid have given us cause to reflect that other traffic routes and modes of transport are faced with the same challenge."
"However, if we want fair competition between the different modes of transport, there must also be fair rules for the financing of security measures."
"Hence my question: when can we expect the study?"
"Does it include this aspect, and can we count on being able to make good plans for further action on the basis of that study?"
"– Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we can only put a positive image of Europe across to people if we have as many specific examples as possible to make clear that acting at European level brings people definite added value."
"More safety in the transport sector, especially on the roads, will benefit hundreds of millions of European citizens: more safety, fewer accidents, less human suffering."
"The mid-term review that has been mentioned several times shows that."
"But it also shows that we still have a great deal of work to do."
"If we look at it like that, it is important that renewed efforts are made."
"But it will also be particularly important that all projects and all measures are well organised."
"The proposed policy mix sounds sensible, but it will also cost money."
"In this connection, we must try to ensure that European money is used sensibly, appropriately and economically."
"It is of course also important that these scarce European resources ultimately end up with the people and do not drain away somewhere."
"When I say that, I am not at all thinking of embezzlement, fraud and the like, but am thinking of the fact that, in aviation in particular, most European airports and airport operators make a great deal of money."
"It is four years since we agreed on public cofinancing in the interinstitutional agreement, and if we now make money available – which will take some time – I am almost certain that people will not benefit from that money, but that we will get a new charge that will then probably be offset by refunding other charges."
"So if we take this route and use public money, we should ensure that people and air passengers will actually gain something tangible from it."
"Madam President, Vice-Chancellor, Vice-President of the Commission, I am now rather confused."
"Mrs Lichtenberger has already said that today’s subject – as the Committee on Transport and Tourism also intended – should be transport security and everything related to it."
"Now I listen to the Vice-Chancellor and there is not a word on transport security."
"In my opinion, that is no way to deal with this House."
"At least part of your speech should have dealt with this subject."
"After all, that is what Parliament wanted."
"I cannot understand why that did not happen, because I do not believe that 11 September passed you by unnoticed."
"The only reason is perhaps that the Council is not interested in the subject."
"But that would be the wrong approach."
"As regards the content, I of course agree with my fellow Members that counter-terrorism is clearly a state responsibility and clear lines must be drawn here."
"It must be clarified that in some countries the taxpayer pays for it, in other countries the airlines, in others the airports and passengers."
"That is why I want the Commission to take measures relatively quickly so that we can deal with this matter in practice and as legislators ensure that the situation is clear and there are no distortions of competition in this area."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will do my best to be brief."
"The Austrian Presidency plans to deal with the question of the financing of security measures in the next Council working group, which takes place tomorrow, 6 April, and in particular to discuss the way forward with this dossier, especially as the Commission has now announced that it will not be presenting its study on the matter until the end of 2006."
"In any case, close contact between Council Presidency, Commission and Parliament is essential in this matter, especially since we want to reach agreement with Parliament quickly."
"I will gladly discuss in detail all questions of financing as the Council Presidency sees them, but there is no time for that today."
"I have tried to report on road safety, on which the Council has focussed in the last few weeks and months, and to do so in close contact with the Commission, which has concentrated more on the financing of security in aviation, for example."
"How difficult this question of financing is is shown by the fact that there are also different views in the European Parliament, as is evident from the Costa report and also from what you said, Mr Jarzembowski."
"Of course I know as well as you do that we need clear rules, if only in order to have fair conditions of competition and for reasons of transparency."
"I also believe that this really is about fighting terrorism, and that must be a national function, because if it is passed on to the airlines, the responsibility will again lie with the passenger, and I do not believe that is where it belongs."
"The passenger has the right to adequate protection against threats, in one form or another."
"That is why my clear position is that all this is a national function, and we have to face up to that."
". Madam President, Mr Gorbach, ladies and gentlemen, contrary to what one of you said, I am well aware of the importance of both road safety and security problems."
"We are working on these issues, and I have listened very carefully to what has been said in this debate."
"I should like to point out that, in its communication on the repercussions of the 11 September attacks on the air transport sector, the Commission has already stressed that the public authorities should take responsibility for strengthening certain security measures put in place by the public authorities in the wake of those attacks, which were attacks on the whole of society and not solely on those involved in the transport sector."
"I believe I share Mr Costa’s view on this distinction, which will probably be one of the guiding principles of any future stance taken by the European institutions."
"As I said, Madam President, air transport safety studies have been carried out, and the findings of maritime transport studies will soon be made known to Parliament."
"What these studies reveal – and I quoted some figures earlier – is that the costs of security measures can be high even if they may seem insignificant in relation to the overall cost of transport."
"In spite of everything, they are, in absolute terms, costs, and I said just before in this Chamber that we shall certainly be bringing up this issue tomorrow and the day after tomorrow in this meeting between European transport companies and the airports."
"It is true that different Member States have different approaches to funding, that there is a certain lack of transparency and that we must try to assess and rectify any distortion of competition."
"Mr Jarzembowski, Mr El Khadhraoui and Mrs Lichtenberger, I note your impatience."
"I should like to point out that, while it awaits the findings of the maritime transport study, the Commission is drawing up a report, to be ready by the summer, which will respond to the interinstitutional statement on the regulation on implementing common rules in the field of civil aviation security, as well as to the regulation on enhancing ship and port facility security."
"Let me assure you that we will have completed this report by the beginning of the summer."
"I hope that I will be able to benefit from today’s debate, even though it has been too short to cover every aspect of the issue."
"I should like to thank Parliament for its commitment to this important matter and the Presidency for enabling us to raise this tricky but very important issue."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is questions to the Council (B6-0017/2006)."
"We will take the following questions to the Council."
"I must voice my deep concern at the persecution of Christians in China."
"In spite of the fact that the Chinese Constitution guarantees freedom of conscience and of religion, Chinese Christians are persecuted, imprisoned and tortured by the Communist authorities."
"Studies and reports by numerous human rights organisations show that, since 2001, persecution of Christians has become commonplace and has been carried out on a large scale."
"It is particularly widespread in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Hebei."
"The number of Christians in China is estimated to be as high as 70 million, which demonstrates most clearly the weight and extent of the problem."
"Tolerating such behaviour by the Chinese authorities or remaining indifferent towards human injustice and suffering because of religious beliefs is not acceptable in the 21st century."
"What steps does the Council intend to take to defend the freedoms of conscience and religion in China?"
"Will the issue of persecution be raised at ministerial level among EU and Chinese representatives?"
". Madam President, in reply to Mr Sonik’s question, I would like to begin by saying that the Council very much shares the honourable Member’s concern."
"That is also the reason why, several years ago now, the Council outlined a number of key areas in which the European Union is seeking to make progress in the dialogue process."
"These include in particular the unrestricted exercise – both in public and in private – of the freedom of religion and belief and respect for cultural rights and religious freedom in Tibet and Xinjiang."
"Religious freedom has therefore been clearly highlighted on the agenda at meetings between the EU and China, not only at dialogue meetings but also at higher levels."
"I can confirm from my own experience, both in my former work as a legal adviser who was also responsible for human rights and in my present position, that these subjects are in fact being raised at a great variety of levels."
"In line with this conclusion of the Council, the European Union has regularly raised not only the persecution of Christians, the restrictions on house churches and the distribution of Bibles in prisons, but also the persecution of Buddhists, Muslims and members of the Falun Gong movement, a subject that the EU brings up on many occasions."
"We have also made it clear that in our view these practices are in breach of China’s international obligations."
"Quite recently, freedom of religion was discussed in detail at the dialogues in September 2004 and October 2005, and the EU Troika has visited Tibet and Xinjang in connection with the dialogue."
"The EU has regularly called on China to comply with the recommendations of the UN special rapporteur and the UN committees relating to freedom of religion and belief."
"It has also continually raised specific cases and called on the Chinese authorities to investigate reports of torture and provide information on sentencing."
"The outcome of these talks up until now has been that while the EU has welcomed the opportunity to hold detailed talks with relevant ministers, authorities, etc, it found many of its concerns about restrictions of religious freedom in China confirmed."
"In 2005, China sent an official invitation to the UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, and the EU looks forward expectantly to the confirmation of a date for the visit."
"It has to be said that this invitation itself is a major step forward."
"The European Union will continue to press at all levels for genuine freedom of religion and belief in China, not least as part of the process of ratification and implementation of the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights."
"Thank you very much for a helpful reply."
"Mr Sonik also wished to establish whether the Council was satisfied with the response by the Chinese side, however."
"After all, this is not a new problem."
"It is good that it is on the agenda at Troika and High Level meetings, but Mr Sonik was obviously hoping that stronger pressure could be exerted on the Chinese side to ensure implementation of these provisions."
". I can tell the honourable Member quite plainly that we will never be satisfied until all international obligations are met."
"That is why we must repeatedly make inquiries and refer to individual cases."
"The situation is still not satisfactory."
"That is also the reason why we will continue to raise this question at all levels."
"If you are calling on us to apply more pressure, then I must ask you, honourable Member, what pressure the European Union is supposed to bring to bear on China."
"Political pressure, that is bringing forward questions and repeatedly reminding them of them?"
"Yes!"
"Other opportunities, where the European Union does not confront China directly – and I believe they are important – are international bodies, the United Nations, hitherto the Human Rights Commission."
"It will certainly continue to be a matter for the UN Human Rights Council."
"I have already mentioned that the UN special rapporteur has a particular role to play here."
"These are all levels and channels through which this question can be raised."
"We will only ultimately be satisfied when complete freedom of belief and religion has been achieved."
"– I listened very carefully to Mr Winkler’s answer, but among the points he raised there is one I should like to focus on, namely the fact that this persecution is not only against Catholics but also against other religions."
"I should like to ask whether the Council is aware of the Falun Gong report, according to which there is a death camp in the Sujiatun area of Liaoning province in which Falun Gong prisoners are massacred, and whether the Council intends to investigate this report of serious human rights violations in China."
". I have never said – because it would be incorrect – that our efforts are concerned only with Catholics or only with Christians."
"Freedom of religion is a human right that applies to all religions moving within the democratic framework."
"Falun Gong is a special case, especially because we know, as you mentioned, that degradation and torture are used."
"We are of course following this with great concern and are also raising it repeatedly."
"You mentioned the re-education camps."
"We have raised them as well, not only in connection with religious freedom but generally."
"The Chinese side has known for many years that re-education camps have long been a thorn in the flesh of the European Union, because they certainly do not meet the normal international standards of human rights."
"You can therefore be assured, honourable Member, that we are also seeking to end the suppression of the Falun Gong faith and its adherents."
"I thank the President-in-Office."
"Apart from representations which seem constantly to fall on deaf ears, is there not something more resolute that the EU could do specifically in the area of trade?"
"In trade agreements with China and other countries we always have human rights clauses, but we are so timid about the implementation of them that they might as well not be there."
"You ask what more we can do."
"Has the time not come to be more robust and to consider sanctions in trade, if that is necessary and is the only thing that will deliver implementation of human rights?"
"What is the point in having the clause if we do not act on it?"
". I do not agree with the honourable Member that our pleas fall on deaf ears."
"Progress has been made and continues to be made and we believe that the means we are using are improving the situation."
"I am hesitant to talk about sanctions because we have to use the means that promise most success."
"I believe that dialogue is the means of choice because I doubt very much whether we would achieve the desired result if we started speaking about trade sanctions."
"I think we are on the right track."
"We are making progress."
"We should continue on this track and eventually we will make even more progress."
"Believe me, we are bringing these questions up, not only through the Austrian Presidency, but through all Member States in their bilateral contacts, the European Union as a whole, the Council, and within the framework of the United Nations."
"It is very clear that in the end this is the best way to proceed."
"Greece has been rocked by a scandal involving mobile telephone tapping."
"Testimony given to the parliamentary committee of inquiry reveals that Ericsson, the company which supplied Vodafone with its operating software, had also installed with it non-activated listening software, which may also be supplied by other competing companies to corporate clients throughout Europe."
"The software which facilitated the eavesdropping activated the installed listening software and could be installed in any other company in Europe which has the same operating software."
"Given the importance of this case in terms of Member States' security and citizens' rights, can the Council say in what companies in Member States legal listening software has been installed and activated?"
"Will the Council investigate whether such illegal surveillance is also taking place in other Member States?"
"Does it intend to prohibit software suppliers from installing listening software in mobile telephony companies without the prior authorisation of national authorities and without informing subscribers?"
". Madam President, in response to Mr Papadimoulis’ question I must first of all say that the Council has never discussed the incidents he mentions."
"I must also point out that it is the Commission’s task to ensure compliance with the Treaties and the provisions enacted by the organs of the Union on the basis of those Treaties."
"If the Commission believes that a Member State has failed to comply with an obligation under Community law, it may of course refer the matter to the Court of Justice for a decision, and that is what it does."
"Madam President, I could now say something about the legal position."
"I assume the honourable Member is fully acquainted with the legal position and would therefore prefer not to list every single directive, but to mention just a few, such as the data protection directive, Directive 95/46, and a number of others, such as one which requires operators of publicly accessible electronic communications services to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to guarantee the security of their services."
"There are also a host of other Community rules."
"If those Community rules are not complied with, then the Commission has not only the right but also the duty to initiate appropriate measures, and it does so."
"– Madam President, the game of ping pong you played with the Commission and your hint that it should do more is interesting."
"However, the telephone tapping scandal which has shaken my country is a scandal which concerns the tapping of the telephones of the prime minister, ministers and senior officers in the armed forces."
"I am amazed that its obvious European dimension did not concern you in the Council."
"How can you be so sure, Minister, that your telephone calls are not being tapped?"
"Madam President, I believe in the rule of law."
"The regulations are clear."
"There are national and European authorities that monitor compliance with those regulations."
"Of course, none of us is immune to breaking the law."
"The important thing, however, is that the competent European authorities take appropriate action when Community law is broken."
"The Council has no powers here."
"If the Commission believes that the rules are not adequate, it and it alone has the right to propose that they be amended."
"That is how the European Union works, and we would be well advised to stick to these procedures, which are laid down in the Treaties."
"I would like to pose a more philosophical question."
"If the law were to be widened in such a way that it enabled the bugging of both Ministers and Presidents, as happened in Lithuania, and if this somehow ensured a greater war on corruption, crime and the abuse of power, would you still believe that such a path is risky and that we need to think more about citizens' rights?"
". I do not know whether that was a philosophical question."
"I am not a philosopher, I am a lawyer."
"I would answer your question like this. Infringements of civil rights must always be a matter of concern to us, not only abstractly, but quite specifically, whether it is the illegal tapping of telephone conversations or anything else."
"The rules that we have, both national and European rules, are there to prevent that."
"If they are unable to prevent it, we must draw the appropriate conclusions."
"That seems to me the logical answer to your question and to the question from the honourable Member from Greece."
"So far as I am aware and according to the most recent Commission report from last year, Greece has incidentally not yet notified any measures to implement the directive in question and the Commission has therefore taken it to the European Court of Justice, which only goes to prove that the system is working."
"Austria, too, is repeatedly accused of being in breach of the Treaties."
"We are given the opportunity to comment on that."
"That is how the system works and in my view that is how it ought to work."
"I share your belief in the rule of law, Mr Winkler."
"But I am sure you can still remember the unpleasant bugging scandal in the Justus Lipsius Building, where the offices of several delegations were bugged, in particular some from the present Council Presidency."
"When it was discovered where the bugging had originated, the whole matter fizzled out."
"Was there a final report on the matter and what measures have been taken to prevent this building being bugged?"
"To be honest, Mr Seeber, I do not know."
"I have no answer to your specific question as to how that matter was concluded, but I nevertheless believe that wrong remains wrong."
"The fact that something unlawful happened should not call the legal system itself into question."
"I cannot give you a definite answer on the incident."
"It also took place before the Austrian Presidency, and the Austrian Presidency did not therefore feel itself in any way called upon to take any particular steps in the matter."
"Besides, I assume that appropriate measures were and are being taken to prevent such incidents recurring."
"In his recent interview with the Austrian magazine Profil, the Turkish Prime Minister, Mr Erdogan, reaffirmed his government's refusal to ratify the additional customs union protocol, linking that issue once again with the adoption of the regulation on trade with the Turkish Cypriot community."
"At the same time, the newspaper Hürriyet has revealed the new national security philosophy adopted by Turkey's Council of Ministers following its approval by the National Security Council."
"According to this authoritative source, the Turkish political leadership now accepts as 'grounds for war' the exercise by Greece of its right, recognised under international law, to extend its territorial waters in the Aegean to 12 miles, while continuing to oppose the re-opening of the Theological School of Halki."
"Given that the above positions are a flagrant violation of the EU institutions' decisions and the obligations of Turkey as a candidate for accession, and in view of the army's continued intervention in politics, does the Council intend to take the unanimous decision required and instruct the Commission to launch accession negotiations during the Austrian Presidency by opening the initial chapters?"
". Madam President, in answer to Mr Beglitis’ question I can first of all say that the Council is of course very much aware of the questions he raises."
"The ratification and subsequent application of the protocol adapting the Ankara Agreement to take account of the accession of the 10 new EU Member States is also a priority, and indeed a short-term priority for the revised Accession Partnership agreed in January 2006."
"Moreover, the European Community and its Member States noted in their declaration of 21 September 2005 that the Union would be monitoring whether the additional protocol was being applied to all EU Member States without restriction and without discrimination and would make an assessment of the matter in 2006."
"As you know, the application of the protocol is a precondition for opening negotiations on the relevant chapters."
"If the protocol is not fully implemented, that will no doubt be detrimental to progress in the negotiations as a whole."
"The Council will be reviewing the progress made on these questions in the course of the year."
"Now so far as the unresolved border disputes are concerned, I should refer to the corresponding conclusions adopted by the European Council at its meeting in Helsinki in 1999 and at its meeting in Brussels in December 2004."
"There can of course be no doubt that if Turkey is seeking accession it must share the European Union’s values and objectives as enshrined in the Treaties."
"It must show undoubted commitment to good neighbourly relations and settle unresolved border disputes in accordance with the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations."
"These questions form part of the scope of the negotiations, are short-term priorities of the Accession Partnership and are systematically raised in political dialogue meetings with Turkey."
"So far as the reopening of the Theological School of Halki is concerned, this is a demand that the Union continues to raise forcefully with Turkey."
"Freedom of religion generally, of which we have already spoken today, is one of the areas in which further progress must be made as a matter of urgency and where concrete measures must now be taken."
"The enactment of a law that will deal with all the difficulties of non-Muslim religious minorities and religious communities in accordance with current European standards is one of the Accession Partnership’s short-term priorities."
"I met with the president of the Turkish constitutional court only two days ago and I also raised this question then."
"She assured me that the constitutional court has taken measures concerning the legal personality of religious communities and their ability to acquire property and that those measures have actually obtained or will obtain legal force."
"It is certainly a matter that we regularly raise."
"In the light of this, the Council can assure the honourable Member that we are continuing to pursue these questions in the ongoing reform process in Turkey and in so doing will take full account of the conclusions of the December 2004 European Council, the negotiating framework for Turkey and the revised Accession Partnership."
"The extent to which progress is made in the reforms and Turkey complies with its Treaty obligations will naturally affect the negotiation process."
"As things stand at present, however, I cannot of course anticipate the conclusions the Council will reach in its further deliberations on these questions."
"– Thank you, Minister, for your reply, but we must be honest here, because I fear that the European Union is still sending contradictory messages to Turkey."
"On the one hand, we are saying that the application of the Protocol is a short-term obligation on the part of Turkey, over the next one or two years. On the other hand, we are saying that the application of the Protocol is a condition for the commencement of negotiations on the relevant chapters on customs union."
"I ask you, Minister: if Turkey is ready or willing to open the chapter of the negotiations on customs union in five years' time, what will the European Union do?"
"Will we give it an escape route?"
"Secondly, you did not reply to my question on the role of the army in political life in Turkey."
"This is a political criterion and we can see today that the army continues to play a leading role in the Turkish political system."
". I do not agree that we as the Council of the European Union are sending contradictory signals."
"There is a clear procedure that is moving forward."
"Everything will be examined in due course and the various points will have to be satisfied as stipulated."
"Besides, the Council is constantly deliberating and will have to reach a conclusion."
"There is not always unanimity there."
"But signals are only sent out when there is a consensus."
"I do believe that the Council is proceeding consistently and logically over the progress of negotiations and seeking compliance with obligations and will continue to do so; as I have made very clear, these are obligations that must be met."
"– Madam President, I should like to ask you how the Presidency is dealing with the grievances being expressed by Turkey and efforts to negotiate the completion of customs union in relation to the Cyprus problem."
"Have you replied clearly?"
"As far as the Chalki School is concerned, how long is it expected to wait and be patient?"
". It is not a question of whether we are satisfied with an answer or not."
"It is a question of whether obligations are satisfied."
"These obligations must be satisfied."
"As I have already said in my answer to the original question, progress in the negotiations will very much depend on the extent to which these obligations are satisfied and not on the nature of the declarations."
"Whether an obligation has been satisfied or not does not depend on the answer given."
"So far as the Theological School of Halki is concerned, that is a demand we raise regularly."
"This question, too, naturally affects the progress of negotiations on fundamental rights and liberties, which are dealt with in a chapter of their own."
"On 20 March 2006, a military court in Lebanon opened the trial in a case taken out by the military prosecutor against the lawyer and human rights activist, Dr Muhamad Mugraby, on the grounds of statements made by him to the European Parliament on 4 November 2003."
"It is the view of ex-Commissioner Patten and of the relevant EP figures that the information provided by Mr Mugraby was important, pertinent and in no way libellous."
"On the same day, the Council met the Lebanese Prime Minister to discuss matters related to the EU-Lebanon cooperation agreement."
"Can the Council confirm that at that meeting it reaffirmed that this trial is contrary to the human rights clause in that agreement?"
"What guarantees can the Council give that the persecution of this Lebanese lawyer and human rights activist will cease?"
"Madam President, in answer to this question I can say first of all that the Muhamad Mugraby’s case was not raised during the meeting of the foreign ministers with Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora that took place as part of the Council session of 20 March; I was present at that meeting in person."
"Mr Siniora’s visit to Brussels, which was very brief, was an opportunity to stress the European Union’s support for the independence, sovereignty and democracy of Lebanon at an important juncture in that country’s history."
"That meeting, with all the foreign ministers present, was not the right occasion to raise Dr Mugraby’s case."
"That does not mean, however, that the Council is not pursuing Dr Mugraby’s case closely."
"It has already raised it with the Lebanese government on several occasions; one such occasion was an approach to the Lebanese authorities on 22 December expressing the European Union’s concern about the charges brought against Mr Mugraby."
"I also want to make it very clear here that the Council is convinced that it is unacceptable for a person to be prosecuted for peacefully exercising his right to freely express his opinion, especially before an institution of the European Union like the European Parliament."
"We will therefore continue to pursue this case closely."
". – I am genuinely dismayed that this was not addressed in the meeting with the Prime Minister, and should like to ask the Council if it deems this Beirut Military Tribunal an anti-Europe process?"
"The accusation levelled at Dr Mugraby is that he answered a question put to him by the European Parliament, something that undermines the functioning of the institutions and our ability to put questions to people who are ready to work with us."
"I therefore wish to ask the Council if it does not view this as sufficiently serious to apply the human rights clauses that form part of the agreements with Lebanon."
". I entirely agree that this is a very serious case."
"If this case was raised at a relatively brief meeting like a lunch, that does not mean we do not take the case seriously."
"As you know, the European Union is about to begin negotiations with the Lebanese government on an action plan as part of the European neighbourhood policy, in which we shall of course be raising human rights and democracy as main priorities, as is usual with such action plans."
"This action plan will also mention the necessity of building an independent and impartial judiciary."
"It will be a useful instrument for supporting the government in tackling important and necessary reforms in these areas."
"You mentioned the association agreement that came into force on 1 April; that means we now have an additional new instrument available to develop and intensify the human rights dialogue with the Lebanese government."
"– I truly wish to congratulate my honourable friend, Mr Casaca, on his question, but I should like to add that, over the last year, numerous distinguished journalists and numerous distinguished intellectuals who were left-wing fighters in Lebanon have been murdered."
"It is not merely a question of our starting now to cooperate with Lebanon as the European Union."
"It is not merely a question of the application of UN Security Council resolutions to Syria."
"I believe that the Council and the Presidency should exert pressure on Lebanon and the new government in Lebanon to respect human rights and I believe that the Presidency should take a stand on this."
". I can answer this question very briefly."
"I fully agree with the honourable Member."
"It is not only – it is also – about the question of the fulfilment of obligations in connection with the initiatives and activities with regard to Syria, as we know them within the United Nations."
"So far as the European Union is concerned, it is quite specifically about the fulfilment of human rights obligations."
"It is being raised, we are taking it seriously."
"We now have the necessary means to be able to raise these questions in all seriousness and with all urgency, and that we will do."
"In a letter to the US Administration, 400 intellectuals, including seven Nobel Prize winners, have condemned the massive and systematic violations of human rights being carried out in the name of the 'war on terror'."
"They call, in particular, for the closure of the Guantanamo base and other arbitrary detention centres and an end to kidnapping and torture with the complicity of governments of EU Member States and others which have allowed CIA secret prisons and flights to operate."
"Does the Council condemn the attempts by the USA to prevent this matter concerning the flagrant violation of human dignity being put before the UN Human Rights Council?"
"Does it agree with the demand for the closure of the Guantanamo base?"
". Madam President, may I perhaps begin by saying – because it is something in which I take a very personal interest – that the Council constantly argues for the unconditional preservation of all international standards of human rights and of humanitarian international law in the context – and particularly in the context – of the fight against terrorism."
"The Council has also expressed this in legislative acts and programmes, as for example the framework decision of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism and the EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy of 1 December 2005."
"The foreign ministers discussed the question of the camp in Guantánamo during their dinner on the occasion of the 22/23 March European Council in Brussels, noting among other things that Guantánamo remains a cause for serious concern."
"They noted that the Heads of Government of some of the United States’ close allies have called for Guantánamo to be closed and that those calls were right and came at the right time."
"Some EU ministers also pointed out that they had already voiced their concern at meetings with the US Secretary of State in Brussels."
"I should also point out that the Council President, Foreign Minister Plassnik, stated publicly on 22 March that EU Member States and US allies had already called for Guantánamo to be closed on a number of occasions."
"She went on to say: ‘Those calls were good and important, but they were not enough.’"
"On the principle that no one can be above the law, the EU has for some time been conducting a purposeful legal dialogue with the United States with the aim of ensuring that humanitarian international law and human rights are applied in the fight against terrorism."
"We assume – and I quote again – ‘that Guantánamo will soon be a thing of the past’."
"This was said in recognition of the fact that terrorism must be fought in a manner that is credible and consistent with human rights and that we have to insist on that, especially as the European Union, which is offering possible solutions."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, sometimes you speak plainly, such as this morning when, in the name – so you said – of the violation of human rights, you are taking measures against Belarus, and sometimes you speak in riddles."
"We question directly and there are two questions:"
"First question: are the United States of America endeavouring to prevent the question of the closure of Guantanamo from being raised at the UN Human Rights Council?"
"Do you agree it should be raised or do you disagree?"
"Second question, to which I would like you to reply clearly, because you replied to me indirectly: do you now agree that the Guantanamo base should be closed and, if you do agree, what measures will you take, as the Council, against the United States of America in order to persuade it to close the Guantanamo base?"
". I would like to make it absolutely clear that we in the Council are certainly not applying double standards."
"Human rights violations are raised whenever they occur."
"The question of the compatibility of Guantánamo with the relevant provisions of international law and of humanitarian law in particular has been raised with the United States."
"I have also quoted what the President of the Council said when she voiced the hope that Guantánamo will soon be a thing of the past."
"We as the Council of the European Union have also supported the efforts of the UN special rapporteur on torture, Mr Novak, to prevent arbitrary arrest and inhuman treatment."
"We certainly do bring this question up with US representatives, including and starting with the President, and with the Secretary of State."
"It is certainly not true that we are trying to ignore the matter."
"Last week the US Supreme Court started a case against the military commissions, looking into the matter. Of course, they violate international fair trial standards, are not independent of the executive and evidence is withheld from the defence."
"They apparently admit to statements under torture, and there are no independent appeals."
"Can the President-in-Office of the Council state categorically that it is opposed to these military tribunals?"
"Again, please answer very specifically whether you are going to put pressure on the United States Government to shut down Guantánamo Bay."
"That is the answer we need."
". Firstly, we cannot and should not comment on the national judiciary system if there are legal remedies available nationally that take care of this question."
"You mentioned the Supreme Court."
"The Supreme Court and other courts in the United States have repeatedly dealt with the question of the legality of a number of things that have happened in connection with the camp."
"I believe that the legal system of the United States is quite well equipped to deal with this question."
"I say categorically that we hope that the camp in Guantánamo will soon be a matter of the past."
"Are there many, if any, Member States which would say in the Council that they oppose more stringent condemnation of the Guantánamo camp?"
"Which Member States oppose taking more concrete action on the issue?"
". In the discussions that took place at the Foreign Ministers’ dinner on the occasion of the European Council, nobody opposed anything."
"It was quite clear that this was everybody’s common position."
"Therefore, there is no question of anybody opposing anything because what I have said is clearly the position of all Member States."
"As they are on the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:"
"Bearing in mind the European Court decision on compensation to airline passengers (10 January 2006), what action is the Council considering to ensure consumers actually get the protection and rights that this legislation intends?"
"Can the European Council state if it intends to bring forward any new measures to enhance the rights of passengers travelling on European airlines?"
". Madam President, with regard to these questions, but in particular to Mr Evans’ question, the Council can confirm that it has noted the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of 10 January 2006 in the case of v ."
"The Council welcomes the fact that the Court of Justice found that examination of the questions referred by the national court for a preliminary ruling revealed no factor of such a kind as to affect the validity of Articles 5, 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 295/91."
"May I also point out that Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council gives passengers certain rights if they are denied boarding or flights are cancelled or delayed."
"Article 16 of the Regulation (‘Infringements’) requires every Member State to designate a body to be responsible for the enforcement of the Regulation on its territory."
"Where appropriate, that body takes the necessary measures to ensure that the rights of passengers are respected."
"It also stipulates that passengers may complain to any such designated body about an alleged infringement of the Regulation and, finally, Article 16, paragraph 3, provides that the sanctions laid down by the Member States for infringements of the Regulation must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive."
"It is therefore primarily up to the Member States and the national bodies responsible for implementation to ensure that passengers actually enjoy the rights granted them by the Regulation when they make a complaint."
"Furthermore, under Article 211 of the EC Treaty it is the Commission’s responsibility to ensure that the provisions of the Regulation are actually applied."
"The Council is monitoring the application of the Regulation attentively."
"In particular, it will be carefully examining the report on the operation and results of the Regulation, which, under Article 17, the Commission is required to submit by 1 January 2007."
"In connection with Mr Ryan’s question in particular, the Council would point out that, together with the European Parliament, it issued the above Regulation on assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding under the codecision procedure in 2004."
"I would also like to mention that the Council, also under the codecision procedure with Parliament, will shortly be adopting a Regulation on the rights of passengers with disabilities and with restricted mobility."
"It should finally be pointed out that the European Commission has the right of initiative to propose legislative acts to strengthen the rights of air passengers and that no new proposals have been presented."
"The Council does not therefore intend to adopt further legislative acts in this field in the near future."
". With enormous respect to the President-in-Office, I have to say that answer was very inadequate, because all he did was repeat the European Court of Justice ruling, of which I am fully aware."
"We have had this, but still airlines are avoiding payment."
"I have a file full of casework on airlines which are not paying compensation that people are clearly entitled to."
"You said the Council is looking closely at this, but that does not help."
"As I asked in the question, what is the Council doing or what action is it considering to ensure that the decision is enforced and that consumers are helped and receive the rights to which they are clearly entitled, as proven by the ECJ ruling?"
". – I should like to reiterate that that is a matter for the Member States."
"The Council can only point out during Council meetings that these provisions, which are indeed unambiguous and clear, are to be properly monitored and that Member States are to insist that they are observed."
"We cannot do more, and I am sorry, but we shall stick to this, as the legal situation is clear."
"The simple fact is that the Member State concerned bears responsibility in each specific case and should indeed exercise this responsibility."
"– Madam President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, being frequent flyers, we are all familiar with the situation at airports, with complaints sometimes only being channelled to the waste-paper basket, and consumers often facing the problem of how to assert themselves."
"Would it be possible to establish an arbitration service or ombudsman to deal with such complaints properly?"
"– If cases such as this start to occur more and more often, this would certainly be one possible way of solving this matter to the satisfaction of passengers, or consumers."
"I would point out to the honourable Member, however, that this, too, is a matter for the Member State concerned."
"I can only promise the honourable Member that I will have the Council discuss this and make it aware that this option exists for the eventuality that these complaints take on a dimension such as to necessitate action."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, like Mr Rübig, I wish to draw attention to something that happens to each of us nearly every day."
"A large European airport, in Frankfurt, hands out a leaflet on request that explains the Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament."
"A careful reading of this text, which comprises roughly 10 to 15 A4 pages in total, each three-quarters full, reveals that the passenger has no rights."
"Is the Council ready and willing to join with Parliament to approach the Commission and make it aware that it is actually responsible for ensuring compliance with this legislation?"
". – Compliance with passengers’ rights is very important to me, as is cooperation with Parliament, and so I shall answer the honourable Member’s question with a clear ‘yes’."
"I am pleased that the previous speaker had information given to him."
"When my flight was cancelled by Air France on Sunday night at Gatwick airport, there were no instructions, no rights given to us at all."
"I understand that it is a question for Member States, but can you please use your good offices to try and ask the Member States to make sure that legislation is complied with."
"At the moment it is not."
"If passengers are not even given any information about compensation, what can they do?"
". – I can only repeat to the honourable Member what I have already said in reply to the supplementary question, which is that it goes without saying that I am ready and willing to make my good offices – to use your words – available to make the Member States aware that these things are important and must be taken seriously."
"I shall discuss this matter within the Council."
"As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:"
"The political agreement reached by the Council Summit in December 2005 concerning the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 reduced the Commission's original proposal for funding of the Trans-European Transport Networks from € 20 billion to € 7 billion."
"Given the importance of the Trans-European Networks for the Lisbon strategy and the operation of the internal market, does the Council believe that it is possible, with the amount of € 7 billion, to implement the thirty priority projects scheduled for the near future?"
"Does it share the view that this significant cut by two thirds of the original provision will hold back the transport sector more broadly defined, particularly since some of these projects are already encountering problems, and how does it intend to deal with this matter during the current six months?"
"Does it intend to seek a solution in the revision and/or suspension of some of the priority programmes?"
"What is the Presidency's view of the development prospects and construction schedule for the European Magistrale high-speed railway line from Paris to Budapest via Strasbourg, including its principal branch-line from Munich through the Brenner Base Tunnel to Rome and also, in particular, as regards the German and Austrian stretches of the two lines?"
"Attaining the goals of the Lisbon Strategy will not be possible without efficient European transport networks."
"The 1994 Essen summit and subsequently Commission decisions 1692/96/EC(1) and 884/2004/EC(2) and the report of the high-level group chaired by Karel Van Miert laid down Community guidelines for the TEN-T and identified 30 priority projects."
"It is a matter of great concern that the project Railway axis 23 Gdansk-Warsaw-Brno/Bratislava-Venice, which is of strategic importance for the social and economic development of central Europe, has been omitted from the Commission proposal appointing coordinators for 6 of the 30 trans-European network transport projects."
"Will the Austrian Presidency give priority importance to this project linking countries on the Baltic with central Europe?"
"What progress has been made in implementing this project?"
"How will it be financed?"
". – Madam President, I should like to give the following reply to the questions regarding the TEN, the trans-European networks."
"As regards the requested funding, the Commission has made a start, following the agreement reached at the December European Council, on assessing the prospects for Community financial aid within the new framework."
"When this assessment has been completed, the Council will resume its discussions without delay, so that agreement can be reached as soon as possible on the definitive adoption of the proposal by the end of this year."
"As regards the field of transport in general, it must be emphasised that Community financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport networks is intended for cofinancing projects that are often carried out within the framework of cooperation between national, public and also private authorities in the Member States."
"The Community financial aid has the potential to, as it were, leverage funding from public and private authorities at national level and promote coordination between various national measures, particularly with regard to cross-border sections."
"However, responsibility for implementing the projects remains with the Member States concerned – and also the participating actors, of course."
"If the implementation of a project of common interest is considerably delayed, the Commission may, pursuant to Decision No 1692/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network, consult the Member States concerned and adopt suitable measures, with due regard to the division of competences."
"As regards the re-examination of the list of priority projects set out in the Decision, the Commission may, by virtue of its right of initiative, present legislative proposals within the framework of the report on the implementation of the guidelines that it has to present every two years."
"On the subject of the funding for the TEN budget heading in the Financial Perspective for 2007–2013, I should like to make the general point, as regards the funding of TEN projects from resources for the trans-European networks in this period, that I have already advocated – when I appeared on behalf of the Presidency in Parliament’s Committee on Transport and Tourism on 25 January – that the resources for the trans-European networks be increased still further in the Financial Perspective if possible."
"Accordingly, I have also made the decision-makers and negotiators aware of the importance and urgency involved and pointed out that it is not possible to disregard mobility and sustainability – for which the extension of the trans-European networks is an essential precondition – when announcing growth strategies and job creation at European level."
"I was pleased to note that a compromise was reached at yesterday’s trialogue."
"It is to be hoped that, by making use of all possible scope, we can now at least moderate the reduction of the TEN resources for the 2007–2013 period."
"As President of the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council, I myself have constantly pointed out the importance of realising the TEN priority projects and, as I have already mentioned, have also made the responsible parties to the negotiations aware of this and applied pressure where this was possible and helpful."
"I am pleased that agreement has been reached, at least for the time being, and hope, as I say, that we are now able to tackle at least the most important projects as a result."
"– Mr President, thank you very much for the information which you have given us, both today and in the Committee on Transport and Tourism of the European Parliament."
"My question is clear: given the need for the development of the trans-European networks and for the completion of the single market for mobility and everything you spoke of, can these objectives be achieved with EUR 7 billion?"
"If the targets are so necessary and there is such a shortfall, what does the Council intend to propose so that we can bridge the gap, over and beyond the general plea for cooperation between the public and private sectors?"
"Similarly, of the increased sum of around EUR 500 million, what percentage corresponds to energy and what percentage corresponds to transport?"
". – A total of EUR 7.3 billion has been allocated to transport."
"The honourable Member very rightly mentions that, in order to realise the priority trans-European networks, we also have to implement, rather than just think about, innovative funding models."
"I am thinking here of participation by private financiers and investors."
"There is no other way."
"In addition, there is no doubt that we shall have to establish priorities and, after a few years, shall be able to determine that the projects that are ready for construction the quickest are also likely to have the best chances of being realised."
"For this reason, it will be the overriding task of those with relevant responsibility in the Councils to ensure that those priority trans-European networks that have been identified as important to employment and economic development have the necessary, relevant approval and are thus ready for construction."
". – Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my question related specifically to the time frame for the European Magistrale from Paris to Vienna via Strasbourg and Munich and the branch line to Rome through the Brenner Base Tunnel."
"I should like to ask the President-in-Office about the overall project, but in particular the connections from Munich to Vienna and Rome."
". – In response to the question by Mr Posselt, I should like to say that the Council Presidency is of the opinion that the extension of the two railway axes – axis No 17: Paris – Strasbourg – Stuttgart – Vienna – Bratislava, and axis No 1: Berlin – Munich – Verona – Palermo – is vital to counteract congestion on the roads, particularly by heavy goods vehicles."
"These are large-scale projects that aim to create a balance between the various modes of transport and to contribute towards a sustainable transport system in the EU."
"In addition, these cross-border projects improve economic integration in the internal market."
"Since the honourable Member has specifically enquired about the timescales, I can say that the construction of the two axes is expected to be completed in 2015."
"However, the final decision on these large cross-border projects and their swift implementation naturally depends on the Financial Perspective for 2007–2013 and partly – as I have already mentioned – on the necessity of finding private funding."
"Once there is agreement on the necessary budget, a long-term implementation plan is required for the completion of these ambitious projects."
"By way of conclusion, I should like to emphasise that it is my firm personal conviction, particularly as regards the North–South transit route of axis No 1: Berlin – Munich – Verona – Palermo, that the first sod will have been turned by the end of this year and we shall be able to begin."
"I myself turned the first sod for the heart of the project, the Brenner Base Tunnel, and, over the last three-and-a-half years, together with my fellow Minister Mr Lunardi, I have done my utmost to bring this project to where it is now."
"I believe that a concerted effort is appropriate and necessary in respect of these two important axes."
"I did not receive a reply to my specific question concerning the Gdańsk-Vienna axis."
"This is a particularly important section, because in terms of links between the new Central European Member States and the old Member States of the Union, it is clearly a key part of the transport network."
"Two other links are at the planning stage."
"I refer to the Paris-Vienna route and the priority line, which will run from Antwerp to Helsinki via Warsaw."
"No provision has been made for the essential section I enquired about, however, hence my question to the Deputy Chancellor."
". – I shall gladly discuss oral question H-0237/06 by Mr Jałowiecki, too."
"As the honourable Member is no doubt aware, Parliament and the Council have adopted the Decision on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network."
"This assumes that the work on railway axis No 23 – the said Gdansk – Warsaw – Brno/Bratislava – Vienna axis – will be completed in the 2010–2015 period."
"The Council Presidency is of the opinion that this railway axis is of paramount importance, as it contributes towards the establishment of commercial enterprises along the axis and promotes a shift to alternative modes of long-distance transport, but is also intended to take account of the mobility requirements of those making regional journeys."
"In July of last year – 2005, that is – six European coordinators were appointed to advance the realisation of five priority transport axes and the introduction of the European Rail Traffic Management System."
"Railway axis No 23 is not one of these initial priority projects, but at this stage the Presidency cannot anticipate a decision on which transport axes will be classified as priority projects in future and whether a second group of European coordinators will be used – my apologies for this."
"The transport projects of railway axis No 23 form part of the National Reform Programmes (NRP) of the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia; preliminary economic studies have already been conducted, and the design studies and environmental impact assessments have begun."
"I should like to add that large-scale investment in the Vienna–Venice section, which was also mentioned in this question, is planned in Austria."
"I would also reiterate that, as has been mentioned a number of times already today, a final decision on railway axis No 23 also depends on agreement on the Financial Perspective for 2007–2013, and on the mobilisation of private capital."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the European Magistrale affects us all greatly, as it runs right through Strasbourg, the capital of Europe."
"Does the President-in-Office believe that the coordinator appointed will have the opportunity of reporting to the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council at regular intervals on the progress made with coordination?"
". – Mr Rübig, I think that it is a good idea for the coordinator responsible, who must of course be well informed, to justify himself and be accountable to this House, too, to the responsible, interested MEPs."
"I shall be glad to take up and pass on this suggestion."
"The Commission has proposed the nomination of six coordinators for six out of the thirty projects."
"In seems that in an Orwellian way, these are the more equal animals among the TEN-T projects."
"When is the Commission going to put forward the second phase for the next most privileged priority projects?"
"When are you going to do it in the Council?"
". – It is like I have already said."
"There is a total of thirty priority TEN projects, and these are ranked, with coordinators appointed for the most important six."
"Experience will show delays here and there, however, and then the ranking will have to be reviewed."
"That is why I have emphasised that the ranking system is good and important."
"The High-Level Group under Mr van Miert has done excellent work on this."
"We shall have to show flexibility, however, as the routes are important not only for economic growth and employment, but also for the implementation of the principle stated in various white and green papers, namely that of shifting freight transport from the roads to the railways."
"We need to provide intact projects for this, too."
"I am convinced that we cannot fight too hard, together, to secure the relevant resources for this, including beyond the coming period."
"I have great confidence here in the innovative potential and approaches, mentioned earlier, of making use of private funds, too, so that projects can be implemented more quickly than would otherwise have been possible, not only in the interests of the economy and of job creation, but also, in particular, of the environment and the people living along many transit routes."
"I am very much obliged to the Vice Chancellor for first raising the subject of the Financial Perspective."
"Indeed, we have tonight agreed to provide EUR 500 million more direct funding for the TEN projects and an additional EUR 500 million to obtain EIB loans."
"He has therefore ended up with EUR 7.3 billion."
"My question to the Vice Chancellor relates to one of the projects vital to Europe and to Austria, the Brenner Base Tunnel."
"Can he tell us how he sees the progress that has been made on this TEN project, since this project is so vital to the EU?"
". – Mr Karas, I shall be very happy to do so."
"The situation with the Brenner Base Tunnel, the heart of the Berlin–Palermo transit route, is as follows."
"The Commission has promised to cofinance the pilot tunnel to the tune of 50% – a large sum."
"The investment volume for this pilot tunnel amounts to approximately EUR 450 million."
"We are currently in phase 2, the preparatory stage, and, in the summer of this year, we shall start boring this pilot tunnel and do our utmost to implement phase 3 – the phase of constructing the Brenner Base Tunnel itself – in no more than two-and-a-half to three years, so as to guarantee its completion by 2015 at the latest, as envisaged by the international treaty between Italy and Austria."
"As I have always said, if we are ambitious in our pursuit of these objectives, it is quite possible to save a couple of years, so that, in the best-case scenario, the heart of this transit route – the Brenner Base Tunnel – could be completed in 2013."
"I should also like to emphasise here, however, that, if the countries concerned are in agreement and the Commission gives them maximum support – as Vice-President Barrot, who has also been enquiring about the situation on site, has just done – there will be progress to match."
"I am also relying heavily on the Commission and the EU for the remaining cofinancing."
"– Madam President, there was a question by me to which I was expecting an answer and I thought there would be enough time for us to reach it but, unfortunately, numerous honourable Members intervened on one specific question and mine could not be examined."
"As you see, I have been waiting here for one and a half hours but, unfortunately, we are going for a written answer."
"Mrs President, on a point of order, every single month I find myself left out of Question Time, even though I am in the first 12 or 13 questions."
"To take three questions together and only get through ten questions is really a reflection on this House."
"Something has to be done about this."
"I am sent here by people to ask questions."
"There are 700 of us."
"To get through that few questions is really quite an appalling reflection on the House and the system."
"I would ask that this be communicated to the Bureau because something needs to be done about it."
"I am really sorry."
"I have noted what you have said, but the mere fact that other debates overrun means that we frequently have the problem of a reduction in the time for Question Time."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"– The next item is the statement by the Commission on World Health Day."
". Mr President, the global shortage of doctors, nurses and other health professionals has reached a crisis point in many parts of the world."
"Ageing populations in Europe, the United States and most wealthy countries, combined with increasingly sophisticated medical treatments that require specialised staff, mean that demand for health workers in the developed world is outstripping supply."
"Indeed, the demand for health workers is not only outstripping our internal capacity to produce doctors and nurses: it is placing a huge strain on the international market for health workers."
"However, the shortage of health workers in rich nations does not even begin to approach the severe shortages being experienced in many parts of Africa, where the lack of health workers can often mean the difference between life and death."
"With less than one health worker per 1000 people in Africa, compared to over 10 health workers per 1000 people in Europe, it is hardly surprising that the shocking and unacceptable death toll of children and their mothers continues."
"More than one in five children die before their fifth birthday and more than one in a hundred mothers die as a result of complications of pregnancy in many African countries."
"Progress towards the Millennium Development Goals in Africa is unacceptably slow, with progress reversal in some countries as a consequence of HIV/Aids."
"The burden of caring for the sick falls on families and communities who have few resources to cope with this significant burden."
"The World Health Report for 2006 focuses international attention on the health worker shortage, and is very much welcomed."
"It puts a spotlight on a crisis that has been evolving over many years, but that now represents probably the most significant barrier to progressing towards the health-related Millennium Development Goals – reducing maternal and child mortality and controlling communicable diseases such as HIV/Aids, TB and malaria."
"Without doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other health workers, it will be impossible to improve healthcare, or to meet our commitments to increase access to essential services."
"The causes of this crisis are complex."
"There has been chronic under-investment in health services in developing countries for many years, including under-investment in training of health workers."
"Many countries in Africa are still trying to run their health services on a budget of less than EUR 10 per capita – that is much less than the minimum of EUR 30 recognised as necessary for providing essential services."
"But the problem is not just lack of investment in Africa."
"Many countries in Europe and elsewhere have underinvested and inadequately planned for health worker training to meet the needs of ageing populations."
"The rich world can attract health workers from other countries; the consequences for poor countries is that they train health workers who leave the country, effectively providing a perverse subsidy to health services in developed countries, by shouldering the burden of training costs."
"Training more health workers worldwide is only part of the solution."
"Many health workers who are trained do not want to work in the poorest and most remote areas where needs are greatest."
"There is a pattern of internal migration from rural to urban areas, and from the public to the private sector, and from poor countries to richer neighbouring countries and then to the richer, developed world."
"However, it is difficult to blame the individual, once you have seen the conditions under which they have to work."
"We need to better understand the motivations of health workers, and to create incentive systems that encourage them to work where there is the greatest need."
"The ‘push’ factors of poor working conditions, low salaries – which are paid irregularly, lack of drugs and equipment and lack of career prospects all contribute to the migration of health workers."
"Indeed, it is surprising that, given these poor conditions, you still get a hard core of dedicated health workers in many African countries who continue to do a remarkable job in very difficult circumstances."
"It is important not to lose sight of the achievement and the increasable contribution of many health workers who continue to serve their people, despite the challenges of their jobs and working environment."
"The ‘pull’ factors for migration – better salaries in rich countries, better working conditions and greater security, which are sometimes coupled with aggressive recruitment practices by private recruitment agencies – also play a significant role in increasing health worker mobility."
"These issues have all been described in the communication from the Commission to Parliament on the EU strategy of action to address the crisis in human resources for health in developing countries."
"If we are to overcome the crisis, developing solutions must begin in the countries most affected and must support strengthening of their planning and financing of health worker training, support and finance, and improved terms of conditions of services."
"It is essential that country action be supported by regional and global action, sharing knowledge and best practice, sharing training resources and changing international recruitment policies to make them more ethical."
"It is important that we look closely at our own health worker training programmes and increase our own production capacity, to make us more self-sufficient."
"The Commission has been leading and coordinating the development of a coherent European response."
"The communication on human resources for health has been debated and strong conclusions are due to be adopted by the Council."
"EU Member States have agreed a Statement of Commitment, which is being announced for World Health Day."
"That should demonstrate to the rest of the world that Europe takes this issue seriously and will support a significant response to the crisis."
". Mr President, I endorse every word that the Commissioner has said tonight as we commemorate this year’s World Health Day with the WHO’s chosen theme of the appalling shortage of health workers."
"In Europe we have three doctors per 1000 people and, as she has said, we are still short of health professionals."
"In Africa they have under five doctors per 100 000 people."
"In Europe it is our fault and in Africa it is also too often our fault."
"And why is it our fault?"
"Because the developed countries take 63 000 doctors and nurses a year from developing countries and return just 1300 to those countries."
"That is an unethical, immoral imbalance."
"In Europe we must do much more to recruit and retain health professionals through training, through pay, through working conditions, through research facilities and so on, but with developing countries we must do so much more and above all we must stop this recruitment rape of their skills."
"Sub-Saharan Africa has some 750 000 health workers for 682 million people."
"Europe has 15 times higher a ratio."
"Sub-Saharan Africa is short of one million health workers."
"Ghana has only 1500 doctors for its population of 20 million."
"Two-thirds of the young doctors in that country leave the country within three years of graduation, and yet Africa bears 25% of the world’s health and disease burden, and has only 0.6% of the world’s health professionals."
"In the United Kingdom, my country, two thirds of new doctors and 40% of new nurses come from abroad."
"That is something of which we must be ashamed and we must pledge ourselves to show our guilt by stopping the recruitment rape and by ensuring that we can sustain, with the people of Africa, the health services and the health professionals they so desperately need."
". Mr President, Commissioner, on this World Health Day, I am happy to contemplate the European contribution towards the achievement of the Millennium Objectives."
"No fewer than three out of these eight objectives are about health care, about the fight against diseases such as AIDS and malaria, about reducing child mortality and the mortality of mothers during pregnancy or childbirth."
"The world, particularly Africa, is still lagging behind in a spectacular fashion."
"Every year, worldwide, more than one million children die of malaria, six million children under the age of five die of a lack of food or qualitatively imbalanced nutrition, and two to three million children die of diseases which could have been prevented by vaccination."
"In 2005, one woman died every minute of complications during pregnancy and childbirth."
"Time after time, the Commission and the Member Sates promise to grant high priority to health care in the developing countries."
"Despite all these fine promises, they fail to deliver and to incorporate them in the annual spending plan."
"Not even 5% of the EU’s budget for development cooperation is spent annually on basic health care, which is completely at odds with the promise and wish of this House to spend 20% of the EU’s aid budget on basic education and basic health care. Put your money where your mouth is."
"Moreover, when we grant budgetary support, we must be much tougher with regard to the spending criteria."
"There should be no budgetary support for those countries that do not qualify on account of bad governance."
"Where budgetary support is given, it has to target specific sectors, in other words, explicitly home in on health care or education."
"It must also be clear beyond any doubt that the money is actually spent on health care, which causes it was spent on, and what the results are, whereby a specific percentage accounts for monitoring expenses by a civic watchdog group."
"We owe this to the European taxpayer and the people and parliaments of the receiving countries."
"Spending, should, in fact, not only be done via European programmes, but can often be done more effectively by joining forces with organisations such as the World Health Organisation, UNAIDS, UNFPA and via global initiatives such as Global Fund."
"Europe should guarantee the funding of projects for sexual and reproductive health care which, on account of policy by the US President to block resources for these projects, are short of funds."
"This is in stark contrast to the 12 billion which the US is investing in an absurd campaign which promotes no sex before marriage and fidelity to the partner."
"The US Congress concluded today that this campaign causes confusion and hampers existing campaigns."
"Many women and girls have died as a result of this outrageous policy."
"We in Europe cannot, and indeed should not, put up with this."
"I hope that my fellow Members of the other parties in this House will not side with Bush, but rather with the millions of women and girls."
"In addition to spending that should be increased, we should also approach health care in developing countries in a structural and integral manner."
"Access to a basic service such as health care is of the essence for the poorest of the poor, but this access is often inadequate due to a lack of expertise and infrastructure at source."
"That is why we should invest in logistics and social infrastructure, in the transfer of knowledge and training local staff, and also in basic education, with a view to imparting basic knowledge in the areas of hygiene, healthy drinking water and healthy food."
"Not until such time as a basic structure is in place can poverty-related illnesses and other unnecessary causes of mortality be eliminated in a truly structural manner."
"In our resolution, we are right to focus on the shortage of health workers, often caused by brain drain, a phenomenon whereby highly trained doctors and nurses decide to work elsewhere in the world."
"We must prevent this brain drain by actively concluding agreements between sectors and countries, by promoting circular migration, whereby people return to their home countries following a short spell abroad, by training and transferring knowledge and by creating better working conditions."
"Finally, in many countries, corruption and bad governance prevent a large share of the money that is spent on health care from ending up with the poorest of the poor."
"Studies have shown that in a country such as Chad, only 1% of government funds that are spent on health care actually arrive at their destination."
"This brings me to my own report on corruption and development cooperation which will be discussed during tomorrow’s plenary."
"Good governance and the fight against corruption are of the essence if we want to achieve the Millennium Objectives."
"Both donor and receiving countries should make an all-out effort to bring this about in the next few years."
"In this plenum, I cannot emphasise enough the importance of the Millennium Objectives, particularly in respect of health care and education."
"It is now really vital to double the budget that is spent on these."
"By doing this, you are doubling the chance of developing the poorest of the poor of this world, helping them escape poverty and become healthy."
"Make poverty history!"
". Mr President, I welcome the Commissioner’s summary of the complex aspects of this problem."
"World Health Day is a good moment for taking stock."
"We have the Millennium Development Goals and many statements of good intent by governments and parliaments around the world, but unfortunately there is still a huge gap between the rhetoric and the reality on the ground."
"In too many places people are still dying simply because of the absence of basic medical facilities that could have saved their lives at very little cost."
"I will mention just one place: the equatorial region of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the population is suffering a catastrophic death rate, not because of famine or even because of ongoing violence and insecurity, as is the case in the east of Congo, but simply because medical facilities are non-existent in that beautiful but inaccessible forest area."
"We need to take a hard look at Commission spending on health and ask why such a low percentage of the EDF budget is earmarked for the health sector, as Mr van den Berg has just pointed out."
"That is despite the fact that Parliament has asked for one fifth of overall development funds to go to basic healthcare and basic education."
"I want to turn to the issue of health workers."
"It is not just a question of inadequate funding: it is an area where European Member States are actively undermining the health services of developing countries by poaching their trained medical staff."
"Member States may have signed up to commitments not to actively recruit health workers from the poorest nations, but in practice they are finding ways round those promises."
"For example, the UK has the National Health Service code on recruitment of health workers, but it only applies to workers recruited by the NHS directly."
"The Code does not apply to nurses recruited by private agencies."
"Often the agency jobs are lower-skilled jobs, so those nurses do not even have the advantage of gaining specialist skills while they are in Europe."
"The result is devastating."
"In Swaziland there are about 3000 nurses and Swaziland is training about 100 per year."
"However, up to 80 nurses per year are leaving for the UK alone."
"That is on top of the huge number of Swazi nurses who are dying of Aids: 300 died of Aids in 2003-2004."
"Member States must close the loopholes in their codes on health worker recruitment and put in place effective health workforce planning so that they are no longer tempted to poach trained personnel from the very countries where better healthcare is so desperately needed."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if one has the opportunity to analyse the often transitory nature or the effectiveness of these world days devoted to some great cause or other, the conclusion is that it is an opportunity for us, on the one hand, to shed some light on a dramatic situation and on the shortage of healthcare personnel in the South, an issue to which we normally pay scant attention, and on the other hand table some proposals to implement in the short, medium or long term."
"Hence the need to incorporate these health objectives into the framework of the multiannual financial programming, which would make it possible to increase the predictability of EU funds, which is so lacking at present, and to give more practical support to national strategies for increasing the number of healthcare personnel."
"One must not forget, however, that this problem that we are discussing today is not just another stroke of bad luck due to pure chance."
"This shortage of healthcare personnel is in fact the result of so-called ‘structural adjustment' programmes which have been brutally pursued by the international financial institutions and which have led to the collapse of public healthcare and education services in a good many countries."
"There is therefore ‘a fair bit’ of hypocrisy in stating in 2006 a determination to increase healthcare personnel over the next few years, while macroeconomic financial policies pursued elsewhere have had a detrimental effect on those same human resources for over ten years."
"Nevertheless we welcome this awareness, however late it was in arriving, of the pressing need to invest in human resources, without which no development policy, however virtuous, can be implemented."
"This is why, as far as we are concerned, the EU’s action in this area should be focused on three areas."
"Firstly, as has already been mentioned, the amount earmarked for health issues within the framework of official development aid, which currently stands at around 5%."
"This is woefully inadequate, and the prospects are not all that encouraging; at least 20% is needed, not least to cover salary costs for training and for all manner of issues already mentioned."
"Secondly, putting an end to the budgetary restriction measures imposed by the international financial institutions."
"In cases such as these, the EU needs to bring its influence to bear, especially as regards the salary ceiling and civil service recruitment."
"Lastly, a code of ethics which would help to remedy the scandal of the two-tier recruitment, in the North, in terms of status and salary."
"Such recruitment, which happens in a fair number of our countries, must be combated, and the country of origin principle must be scrapped."
"To conclude, we trust that these generous statements of intent will actually be followed up, thanks to the very firm commitment of the EU institutions and of Parliament in particular, and thanks to the campaign started by the NGOs and European civil society."
". – Access to healthcare is recognised as a fundamental human right."
"Yet large sections of the population are still not guaranteed this access."
"The UN’s Millennium Development Goals include reducing by two thirds the mortality rate among children under five, reducing by three quarters the maternal mortality rate, halting and beginning to reverse the spread of AIDS and halting and beginning to reverse the incidence of malaria and other major diseases."
"The time has come to prevent the deaths of many millions of children and women due to a lack of primary healthcare, mother and child health, sexual and reproductive health, water and sanitation infrastructure, and education, including education in the field of health."
"For this to happen, there needs to be greater solidarity between the most developed countries."
"We therefore feel it is vitally important to provide active support for training doctors in developing countries and access to medical training for students from rural and remote regions."
"In this regard, I wish to highlight the remarkable example of Cuba in training, free of charge, thousands of doctors and other healthcare personnel to work in Africa and Latin America."
"It is similarly crucial to deliver access to high-quality, free, public healthcare services for all throughout the EU, which is not the case as things stand, due to the macroeconomic approach of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"In some countries there have been serious backward steps, as is the case in Portugal at the moment, and this is exacerbating poverty and social exclusion."
"We have therefore tabled a number of amendments to the joint resolution, which will hopefully be adopted."
"On this World Health Day, what is needed, Commissioner, is for this debate to be followed up by action."
". Mr President, in the EU we have an expanding need for well-trained committed doctors, nurses, therapists and technicians."
"Population-ageing, increases in the incidence of disease and increases in the treatments for them mean a greater demand for workers in the health sector."
"But we should not just consider our need for healthcare, but the needs of those who deliver it."
"Their first need is to be safe."
"We must do everything to protect them from diseases and accidents, especially needle-stick and exposure injuries."
"It is almost a tradition to overwork doctors and nurses, but tired, stressed staff are far more prone to dangers."
"Vaccines have a part to play in protecting healthcare workers, but we must, in mandating immunisations for our healthcare workers, acknowledge and compensate those who have suffered debilitating adverse reactions."
"In Ireland we have seriously restricted, and still restrict, the number of young Irish people who train for medicine, nursing, pharmacology and the therapies."
"When we – as we inevitably do – experience shortfalls in services, we solve the problem by hiring people from other countries."
"We can now afford to do this and these excellent professionals are a boost to our health service."
"Our hospitals and our health services are staffed by health workers from India, the Philippines, South Africa and many other countries."
"I have been told by some of them that they see working in an EU country as a great opportunity, but I wonder if we ever give a thought to those left behind, especially to the sick."
"Healthcare migration is certainly to our benefit, but as lives are saved in developed countries, they are lost in less developed countries."
"A Zambian Government official described to me the difficulty Zambia has in retaining doctors."
"Its government sends promising students to the EU to train, but once the training is complete they either do not return or when they do they find that their highly technical training relates very poorly to work in settings with little equipment and few drugs."
"They leave in frustration."
"We must address this problem urgently."
"This brings me to my last point."
"I would like to ask what competence Members think we have to condemn another sovereign nation because its country refuses to fund projects it disagrees with. I am referring to the US-Mexico City policy of requiring that NGOs agree, as a condition of receiving US funds, that they should neither perform nor promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations."
"In condemning the way the US is spending its foreign aid, Amendment 5 presumes a mandate that this House and this Union simply do not have."
"Every year on 7 April, we commemorate World Health Day."
"This year, it will be devoted to health workers, who will form the focus of the commemorations for the next decade."
"Even though the world’s problems include a shortage of medical staff in developing countries, as well as malaria and HIV, we in the EU are also facing major problems in the healthcare sector, particularly in the new part of the European Union."
"Following accession to the EU, the ten new Member States have been experiencing a ‘brain drain’ in the form of a massive migration of doctors and nurses to Western Europe."
"As a result, there is a shortage of doctors in the new Member States."
"We have chiefly lost young multilingual people, who have decided to work in the western part of the European Union, attracted there by better conditions."
"The chances of them coming back are extremely slim."
"Sadly, as we observe World Health Day, a major strike was announced in one of the largest hospitals in Slovakia, and more hospitals are joining in one by one."
"The motivation for this strike arises from the intolerable working conditions which our doctors and nurses have to endure."
"A doctor in Slovakia is paid anywhere between EUR 350 to EUR 500 a month, while a nurse brings home EUR 250 to 300 EUR."
"Under these circumstances, it comes as something of a surprise that our highly qualified personnel are willing to remain in their home country at all."
"They receive EUR 2 per hour for night shift work, which is truly shameful."
"We must therefore see to it that these people get adequate pay."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome those who have taken this initiative, and there are many involved in the decision-making chain, and it therefore seems to me to be exceptional."
"I would like to talk about two issues in particular; firstly, the problem of training in the place of origin."
"I believe that one of Europe’s problems is that we have not drawn up any strategy on the policy of aid relating to health, and in particular training."
"On the one hand, I believe that we in Europe have been implementing a very self-centred policy of in the majority of universities and nursing schools, in order to guarantee employment for our students, without taking account of the fact that the prospects and needs of Europe were going to exceed our capacity to provide care; that is why doctors and nurses from other countries are needed."
"This is clearly leading to the drain that is being talked about so often today."
"At the same time, however, I believe that, in the development aid strategy, universities should be created alongside hospitals."
"The investment policy must not be restricted to roads, but must also consider hospitals and human resources training."
"Furthermore, there must be a specific programme which offers results."
"Furthermore, there is one issue that is of great concern to me, because I have seen it first-hand: the difficulties in the distribution of medicines and the corruption that exists in their distribution."
"We are aware of the difficulties faced by hospitals on the ground, in Cameroon and in other countries, in carrying their work and accessing medicines, and that frequently the people distributing medicines for combating AIDS, which are being sent free of charge, are adding additional costs to them."
"Within this context, I believe that, in its programmes, Europe must allocate more money to training, but at the same time control the distribution of aid much more effectively and prevent that corruption, which is a permanent obstacle, thereby putting to an end to the frustration of the people treating the sick."
"Mr President, it is an interesting statistic that there are more nurses from Malawi living in Manchester, in the United Kingdom, than there are living in Malawi; and there are more doctors from Ethiopia living in Chicago than there are in Ethiopia."
"There is an estimated global shortage of 820 000 doctors, nurses and other health workers."
"Obviously human resources are a central part of all human healthcare systems, but the reality is that the recruitment of health professionals and the scourge of HIV/Aids are continuing to prolong the crisis already afflicting very fragile healthcare systems in developing countries."
"Many leave developing countries – as you said, Commissioner – because in developing countries they earn low wages, have poor working conditions, little prospect of advancement and a lack of training."
"In addition they have the pressure of dealing with high numbers of patients with HIV/Aids and other very difficult diseases."
"This brain drain is the major obstacle to providing quality care in Africa."
"Countries are losing the most qualified and experienced nurses."
"Last year Kenya lost 3000 graduate nurses to other countries, mostly to the United States and the United Kingdom."
"There is a net flow of skills away from Africa, where individuals make decisions to go where they can earn and where they can take their careers forward."
"Many women that I have met across the United Kingdom working in elderly care centres, etc., are doing so because they want to earn money in order to send money back to care for their children in the countries where they come from."
"A consequence is that that the losing nations do not have that skill space that they need to educate their young people and develop their own economies."
"We in the European Union have to look at ways to compensate those countries that are being so drained of the skills that they need."
"I welcome the Commission’s urgent attention to the crisis."
"We hope that we will see strategies – and that is the next step – that can deal with the root causes of the problem we are talking about this evening."
"That problem is that in spite of the terrible burden of disease there, Africa only has 0.6% of the world’s registered healthcare workers."
"How can that be acceptable when the healthcare and disease pressures are so enormous there?"
"I am concerned by Commissioner Frattini’s recent proposal to promote the recruitment of highly educated immigrants, including the creation of a ‘green card’ for researchers, engineers and doctors."
"Parliament must call for an active end to the recruitment of health workers."
"It rightly calls for the European Union to press for a global code of conduct on ethical recruitment."
"Commissioner, would you subscribe to the view that this is something that the Commission should do in order to try to deal with this crisis, which is what this evening’s debate is all about?"
"The other side of the coin is that in Europe we have an ageing population and we have declining birth rates."
"We are therefore trying to suck in the health workers from other countries in order to deal with our own problems."
"Raising wages to levels comparable with the industrialised world is very difficult for developing countries, but funding must be targeted at the health system and efforts must be made to decentralise healthcare and to support regional development."
"I also believe – and no-one else has mentioned this, but it is in the resolution – that tele-medicine is a very important way of dealing with this issue."
"I was recently in Mauritania and saw how, in a very small hospital in a desert area of that country, health workers were making contact with French doctors in order to have some consultation on diagnoses for patients."
"That is something we could also look at investing in, in a more serious way than we do currently."
"With regard to nurse practitioners, nurses should be given more status in developing countries than they now have."
"That is very important, as it is to look at what countries such as Uganda are doing, which is to decentralise the health service and take it out of the main cities, into the rural areas."
"If we are actually going to deliver on the Millennium Development Goals we have a huge task."
"In relation to health, it is a major task and we need to make a contribution."
"In relation to the financial perspectives we are now discussing, we really do not have the options to deliver on the debates and on the commitments that you have discussed this evening."
"Mr President, good health is invaluable and it is thus not surprising that in the developed world we invest so much in healthcare and we expect to receive the best treatment whenever the need arises."
"But to have an effective healthcare system in operation, we need healthcare workers, people who are well trained, committed, and who are devoted to the care of their fellow human beings."
"The healthcare workers are the backbone of our health systems and to them we owe more than words can express."
"However, the case with the developing world regarding health is, unfortunately, completely and shamefully different."
"There, good health is mostly the exception rather than the rule."
"Allow me to give you some figures in order to illustrate the point."
"One index figure that can be used to assess health provision in a country is, as has already been mentioned, the infant mortality rate."
"That is a measure of how many infants die per 1000 live births."
"The infant mortality rate in a country like Sweden, Germany or France – in fact most EU States – is around five deaths per 1000 live births."
"The corresponding figure in countries like Mozambique, Sierra Leone and Liberia is about 140 deaths per 1000 live births, and in Angola it is about 200 deaths per 1000 live births."
"In other words, the chance of an infant dying in Angola is about 4000% more than it is in an EU country."
"A premature or ill baby in Angola has a next to nil chance of surviving."
"In many Third World countries basic healthcare is almost totally lacking and the few brave health workers who find themselves in those countries have to battle against all the odds to save life and limb."
"They have to cope with lack of infrastructure, lack of equipment, lack of medicines and a lack of understanding of hygiene by the population."
"Very often they are persecuted, arrested, tortured or murdered when caught up in local wars or social uprisings."
"In these areas, to be a health worker should be regarded as being a hero."
"These people deserve not just our admiration and respect but our active support, and we must do our utmost to provide them with all the help they need."
"We owe it to them and we owe it to our conscience."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the motto of World Health Day is ‘Working together for health’; yet, unfortunately, not much of this cooperation remains."
"Cooperation primarily means ‘brain drain’."
"We have heard dramatic, affecting figures today; figures that should make us feel ashamed, as they make it clear that Europe is faced with a crisis in the health sector that it is not tackling at the roots – here in Europe – but is trying to solve by means of the brain drain from these countries."
"The main health issue in Europe is the fight against lifestyle-related diseases, which are attributable to nutritional and environmental factors; whereas the situation in developing countries is that people are dying of diseases that are actually curable, for example in childbirth – women are developing fistulas as a result of giving birth – or that, as has just been reiterated, there is quite simply a lack of paediatric vaccines and the most essential measures are not being taken."
"At the same time, we know that demographic developments will only intensify the problem."
"As a result of our ageing society, there is a lack of people going into the caring professions."
"That is why I also believe that the EU needs to show foresight in taking action at long last to counter this dramatic development."
"The financial resources have already been mentioned."
"We have spoken a good deal about African countries today, but I have the impression that, particularly in development policy, resources are being poured into other countries."
"We have heard today that the Commission does not have a strategy – the example of the green card has just been given again."
"The Commissioner has presented us with fine words today, but her colleagues in other fields of competence often do the opposite or pursue policies that support this very development instead of tackling it and contributing towards a solution."
"The Commission has also been silent on the subject of the disputes over patents for AIDS drugs in Africa."
"The EU should have been vocal in condemning pharmaceutical giants who look on as people die an agonising death as a result of patents."
"I hope that the Commissioner’s words are followed by action."
"What we need is not fine words because World Health Day is approaching, but a strategy, a real solution to the problem."
"I hope that we have made a start here this evening and that this has been a new departure."
"After all, we were all in agreement on the objective: that what we need is real action to tackle the problem."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ‘Working together for health’ is a lovely motto for World Health Day, as long as it is also taken seriously by all those making speeches, producing press releases or conveying messages on the occasion of 7 April."
"In this respect, I should like to endorse the previous speaker’s words."
"This is all the more applicable when it comes to health workers, to whom World Health Day 2007 is devoted."
"In my view, therefore, Parliament also needs to address the problem that ‘Working together for health’ and the improvement of working conditions for health workers in the EU are not really being taken seriously."
"The reverse is true."
"I should like to make just four remarks, therefore."
"The first is that the debate on the Working Time Directive and on health-care reforms has worsened, and is continuing to worsen, the working conditions for health workers."
"I should like to remind the House of the dispute on the recognition of on-call duty as working time that is still ongoing, and of the strike by German hospital staff that has been going on for weeks and is paralysing many hospitals in Germany and thus also seriously impairing care for the people."
"The access of millions of people to health services is being restricted or complicated, and is by no means being improved or safeguarded."
"My second remark is that, despite the enlargement of the EU and the growing health problems, the health and consumer protection appropriations in the budget adopted by the European Council in December 2005 have been cut in comparison with the present period."
"My third remark is that, even though the Spring Summit of the Heads of State or Government on the Lisbon Strategy is being held just a few days before the annual World Health Day, health issues play only a secondary role there."
"What is at issue is greater competitiveness, greater strain and stress for the individual; which, of course, are known to be detrimental to the health of the majority of the population."
"I should like to take the liberty of making a fourth remark at this juncture."
"The day before yesterday, the Commission opened the public consultation on the creation of a European defence equipment market."
"This makes clear the real political importance of today’s debate on World Health Day."
"Arms are a direct route to the destruction of health."
"In this context, however, I should also like to draw attention to the growing importance of military aspects in development policy, whose principal purpose is actually supposed to be the improvement of public health in poor countries."
"From my point of view, there is enough cause – and also material – here for a discussion aiming at improving the health of people living in the EU and boosting the EU’s contribution to improving global health."
"In this connection, I should also like to make an explicit plea for a study of the alternative world health report, which pleads, in particular, for the extension, qualitative improvement and democratisation of the public-health field."
"It describes health workers as the lifeblood of health care."
"The matter of primary importance is not cost, capital or dubious productivity, therefore, but the qualified, responsible commitment of health workers, because their personalities, their professional and social competence, and also their opinions and suggestions should count."
"For this reason, I propose a public consultation of health workers, asking them the following questions."
"In your opinion, what is the most common cause of illness, or particularly detrimental to public health?"
"What is the thing that most hinders you from making maximum use of your know-how for the benefit of public health?"
"In your opinion, what needs to be changed about the political framework to enable you to work better and improve public health?"
"From your perspective, what should the EU do to boost its contribution to global health, to overcoming HIV/AIDS and epidemics, and to combating the effects on health of hunger, shortages of drinking water and environmental degradation?"
"Mr President, the slogan for this year’s World Health Day is ‘Working Together for Health’."
"As we are all aware, health is a multifaceted issue."
"I could refer to the medical and social dimensions involved, but its political dimension is particularly significant."
"Health is therefore not simply an issue for individual human beings."
"The health of each and every one of its citizens should be a top priority for every state."
"It is unacceptable to reduce financial resources, thus depriving millions of people of essential medical care and worsening the situation of the poorest and most vulnerable social groups."
"In particular, it is also unacceptable to deprive those who cannot stand up for themselves of the care they need, or to drastically cut such care."
"I have in mind unborn children, the elderly and the seriously ill."
"Simply launching one appeal after another and celebrating World Health Days is not enough."
"Health workers need to be properly trained."
"For these individuals, devotion to the health sector is both a service and a calling."
"Without them, it is impossible to guarantee effective health care, and now I am not referring exclusively to the poorer countries."
"Against the background of contemporary globalisation and rampant liberalism, it is especially important to bring ethical and moral principles to bear on medicine and heath care, thus enabling each individual to be treated with dignity and respect, and his or her health to be promoted."
"Essentially, the underlying problem afflicting contemporary health care is a world vision governed by a materialistic approach to life."
"This means that financial, business and economic interests have free rein, to the detriment of the life and health of human beings."
"The huge economic divide between the new Member States and the older ones, where salaries are exponentially higher and working conditions are outstanding, has resulted in the emigration of well-qualified medical workers."
"In Poland at least the conditions for professional training and development are quite favourable, but likely remuneration is unattractive, hence the brain drain."
"I am concerned about the nature of a potential proposal on the introduction of an ethical recruitment code."
"I wonder what kind of criteria would be laid down in such a code so as to make it easier or harder for workers to emigrate."
"I very much hope any such criteria would not be content-related, so that poor countries do not lose even more outstanding specialists."
"Mr President, as has been brought to our attention today, European health services are in a most unsatisfactory state, but things are far worse in Africa."
"One of the key issues to be dealt with concerning Africa is ensuring that AIDS victims benefit from generic medicines."
"The latter are certainly much cheaper, but they are still too expensive for Africans."
"Mr Bowis raised another important issue relating to Africa, namely encouraging individuals trained in Europe to return to their home countries where they are sorely needed."
"What needs to be done in Europe is to increase the mobility of both patients and medical services."
"In Poland, for example, it is hard for nurses to find a job paying more than EUR 250 a month, whilst in Belgium hospital wards are being closed due to a shortage of nurses."
"In addition to mobility, it is important to harmonise recognition of medical and paramedical qualifications."
"In general, Europe lacks a common health strategy and policy."
"Finally, I would like to mention the issue of additional investment in research programmes, for instance those working on cancer."
"It is shameful that such programmes have to be funded by events on television."
"The money ought to be coming instead from national budgets or perhaps European programmes."
"We proved capable of mobilising ourselves to respond to the sudden threat of avian influenza, but we do not seem able to overcome deadly diseases that have been with us for a very long time."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the right to health is a universal value."
"Extraordinary progress has been made over the past 50 years."
"At the same time, however, costs have not stopped rising, yet we have a great deal of trouble admitting that prevention costs much less than cure."
"We are experiencing an actual health crisis due to a lack of foresight and in particular due to a purely accounts-based approach to health policy."
"The right to health is a universal value, as I said."
"It is not only Europe that is affected; the entire world is, too, with developing countries the hardest hit."
"The consequence of the well-documented shortage in the training of medical staff – doctors, nurses, and so forth – in the EU is that Member States turn to doctors from developing countries, thereby exacerbating the shortage in those countries."
"I should like to make three main points."
"Firstly, it is necessary to train health workers in developing countries and to channel every effort into ensuring that they stay. For this to happen, there needs to be better planning of medical systems in Europe and the United States."
"Secondly, over several decades there have been some terrible pandemics in the world."
"Developing countries are the most vulnerable because they have neither the resources for information and awareness raising, nor sufficient medicines to stem diseases such as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. This is purely down to a lack of personnel."
"Thirdly, I would have liked our resolution to be more precise on certain key points, for example the availability of medicines."
"Here too, in my view, the lack of personnel is crucial in that no one is there to act as a focal point."
"I therefore welcome the measures taken by some European businesses, which, in a show of solidarity with the people of these countries, distribute essential medicines or vaccines."
"Given that we are aware of the difficulty of carrying out such distribution in countries where there is a shortage of infrastructure and qualified personnel and where there is sometimes a complete lack of political will, the inescapable conclusion is that the EU must do all it can to support these measures and in fact must go further."
"Sadly, the Commission’s proposals are woefully inadequate, and things are not about to improve on the back of the famous agreement on the financial perspective."
"Who is bearing the brunt of this?"
"The most serious aspect of this is that the main victims of our shortcomings are vulnerable people, including women and children."
"– Mr President, the day after tomorrow, 7 April, is World Health Day, which this year is devoted to health workers."
"This is a good opportunity to call for fair, good working conditions for these workers and draw attention to the existing shortage of such workers."
"When we talk of fair, good working conditions, we are not just talking about developing countries, of course, although we focus special attention on these, but also about Europe, and the forthcoming discussion on the Working Time Directive, in particular – which has already been mentioned today – will reveal how seriously Europe and this Parliament take fair working conditions for people in this field and the importance accorded to high-quality public and health services."
"The shortage of health workers is a global phenomenon, and has numerous causes: the Commission points this out and so does the resolution that we shall be adopting tomorrow."
"It has also been discussed in great detail how developing countries, in particular – African countries being the worst example – suffer as a result of the brain drain: of rich countries’ recruitment measures."
"In my opinion, an important point as regards the shortage of health workers is being obscured."
"Many countries are saving on public spending, and consequently important posts are lacking in the health and social services sector, too – either lying vacant or not being created in the first place."
"Many preach the virtues of the slimline, almost anorexic state, but they do not mention its impact on the functioning of the health system."
"I hope that Amendment 6 will be adopted by a majority tomorrow, so that we have a comprehensive analysis of the shortage of health workers in the various countries of this earth."
"Health services in developing countries have also suffered as a result of the drastic budget cuts in the social sector arising from macroeconomic reforms such as structural adjustment programmes."
"The international financial institutions need to reconsider policies such as continuously putting emphasis on the privatisation of public-sector activities in developing countries."
"Amendment 7 reveals another key reason for the shortage of health workers and for inadequate health spending by developing countries, African countries in particular."
"I certainly do not wish to play down the reasons such as corruption or the lack of political will that have been given, but it is also true that these countries’ external debts significantly reduce their scope for adequate spending in the social sector and on health."
"Three of the eight Millennium Development Goals relate to health: reducing child mortality, improving maternal health and tackling HIV/AIDS."
"The international community, including the EU, must ensure that sufficient financial resources are available for tackling HIV/AIDS."
"We know that only some of the financial commitments entered into at the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development have in fact been honoured."
"We also know that the proportions of the HIV/AIDS pandemic are far greater than was assumed at that time."
"It is important to provide sufficient resources for promoting reproductive health, which is also the reason for my appeal for majority support from the House for Amendment 5."
"In addition, Mrs Hall has already pointed out how this HIV/AIDS pandemic is neutralising the investments of many African countries."
"Mr President, World Health Day reminds us that access to health is the single most desirable goal that all humans wish to reach."
"Yet the range of challenges to global health today is wide and the prospects of achieving the international goals are daunting."
"Annually four million children die before they are one month old."
"Another four million children die from diarrhoea or pneumonia."
"Malaria is responsible for at least another million child deaths, and in total more than ten million children die every year as a result of conditions for which we have effective interventions."
"These problems are outrageous in the context of global wealth in the 21st century."
"Yet there are new challenges to health associated with the accelerated globalisation of the markets, such as SARS and avian flu."
"In many countries HIV/Aids has already begun to destroy the modest progress made since the 1980s and is today threatening the survival of entire societies."
"The world’s response, while impressive relative to other areas, is far from that which is required."
"But not all is bleak."
"The world has also witnessed unprecedented progress in science and knowledge and today we know how to address the great majority of the world’s disease burden."
"Many of the solutions are cheap and low-tech."
"Even greater, therefore, is the responsibility upon us, the imperative to focus on how these interventions can be delivered to those who need them."
"Health is at the very heart of the Millennium Development Goals and it must be recognised by all that health is central to development and to the fight to reduce poverty, as well as an important measure of human wellbeing."
"The clear message coming out of 2005 and the Millennium Development Goals is that of health systems."
"We will only start to make real progress when we finally get serious about health systems."
"Without the basic systemic capacities in place in all countries, it will not be possible to do what politically has already been agreed upon: to scale up disease prevention and controlled programmes for reducing child and maternal mortality and roll back HIV/Aids, TB and malaria."
"Central to each and every health system are the people working in it and for it; having the right workers with the right skills in the right place doing the right things is fundamental to being able to address the full range of health challenges in a country."
"However, these elements also include health stewardship – the range of functions carried out by governments as they seek to achieve health objectives, sustainable health financing, efficient and effective health service delivery and the application of health knowledge, technology and infrastructure."
"While the lack of health workers is of particular urgency, the overall task is to improve all these aspects simultaneously."
"According to a saying – also used in my country – ‘money can buy everything except good health'."
"At the same time, we know fully well that, unfortunately, health is often a matter of money."
"This is certainly true of public health."
"This is the problem we are facing, when the World Health Day this year draws our attention to the shortage of health workers throughout the world."
"According to WHO, the shortage is caused by the fact that the training, remuneration, working conditions and management systems of health workers have been underfinanced for several decades."
"Moreover, due to demographic changes, there will probably be an increasing demand for doctors in Europe."
"The absolute lack of money is only one part of the problem faced by public health."
"The other is the lack of appreciation for health workers in society and the lack of prestige of the profession."
"The number of those training to be doctors and nurses is constantly decreasing, because their average remuneration and social perception are not proportional with the difficulties and importance of their vocation."
"Therefore, appreciation for public health must be restored as soon as possible."
"The migration of health workers is already a considerable problem."
"A part of the shortage of doctors in England is supplemented with doctors from Hungary, where the shortage is supplemented by doctors and nurses arriving from Romania;"
"Romania is trying to replace them with doctors and nurses from the Republic of Moldova."
"And the long list could be continued."
"It is obvious that the concerns are more serious in developing countries, but there is much to be done in Europe, too."
"Another aspect of the concerns experienced in the area of remuneration is the widespread gratuity system in certain Member States."
"This is both legally and morally unacceptable, it is humiliating both for patients and doctors, and it also creates further inequalities in the public healthcare system."
"Therefore this should be eliminated as soon as possible."
"Overall, we must provide more money and create more appreciation and clearer conditions to ensure that our public health standards throughout Europe do not deteriorate in the coming years, but on the contrary, they improve."
"I hope that the World Health Day will draw our attention even more to this important area, and will bring the solution closer."
"– Mr President, I shall focus on three points, because a great deal has been said with which I agree."
"The first point is that we need to concentrate our attention today, as we debate World Health Day, on prevention."
"Prevention and investing large amounts in prevention is very important, because it allows the incidence of disease to be limited and, by extension, the cost of treatment and hospital care to be reduced, with obvious beneficial results both for citizens and for the public purse."
"Improving the health of the population without doubt boosts progress, fortifies citizens by safeguarding a longer, better and more productive life and is the precondition to economic prosperity."
"Second point: I should like us to focus our attention on those who have given us innovative treatments, innovative medication, inoculations and, in general, the knowledge to combat diseases and those who work with the sick – doctors, nurses and all health workers – and we must apply ourselves in this sector, to see where the gaps are, so that we can have adequacy in this sector."
"Of course, we will also need to use new knowledge and technologies, such as telemedicine, which is important if we are to offer a modern service."
"Finally, the third point is the inequalities which exist today in the sector of the supply of health services."
"Even within the European Union there are inequalities and, of course, there are inequalities on the planet at the moment; we have deaths, we have a high incidence of disease and I think that the European Union should apply itself to this issue and invest money in this sector, because no one can be happy in the middle of unhappiness."
"With these three points, and agreeing with everything said by my honourable friends, I too should like to pay homage to the people who work with the sick and offer these excellent services."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this year, World Health Day is devoted to health workers."
"There are 35 million health workers worldwide, approximately 4 million of whom are in Germany, and well in excess of 12 million in the EU."
"These figures alone show that the South of our planet has far from satisfactory provision."
"There is a clear divide between the developed and the developing world as regards people’s chances of receiving health-care services."
"In the short term, it would be entirely appropriate to provide twice or several times as many resources as emergency assistance."
"What is indispensable, however, is an increase in human resources – in both Europe and the developing world."
"Given the short time available, I should like to discuss just the conditions in Europe."
"The previous speakers have already commented on the developing world, and they have my full support."
"I should like to select four European issues."
"Firstly, the ageing of our society brings with it new challenges, new illnesses, new treatment procedures and a growing need for nursing and care that we are already losing the ability to fully cover."
"Secondly, an improvement in the skills and quality of the health professions in Europe is needed if we are to meet the excellence criteria we set ourselves."
"A dramatic increase in the training figures in all fields of the health service is needed if we are to meet these demands."
"Thirdly, we need to enhance our cooperation within the Union."
"Although health policy plays a subordinate role, positive intervention is called for on our part."
"Health policy must not be reduced to monetary aspects – even if these words are sure to make the ears of my colleagues in Berlin burn."
"Fourthly, we need to preserve the health of health workers by means of reasonable working hours and workloads and reduce cases of exhaustion."
"In this connection, I would appeal to the Commission to adopt Parliament’s position on the Working Time Directive."
"Mr President, the theme of World Health Day, which takes place the day after tomorrow, is employees in the healthcare sector."
"This year’s subject is very pertinent, since we are facing the threat of a worldwide pandemic."
"The problems associated with availability of healthcare staff and working conditions affect both the developing and the industrialised countries."
"Focusing attention on the status of healthcare staff is the right way to get to grips with the causes of health problems and to try and prevent them."
"Investing in preventive work is always the best option as far as both people and the economy are concerned."
"It makes sense to invest resources in everyday structures that support people’s health, and not just in corrective work."
"We need the political will to recognise the needs of healthcare staff and address them."
"Educated doctors and nurses save human lives."
"Unless their professional skills are appreciated and given support, the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, for example, will not be achieved."
"That appreciation must also be reflected in pay and working conditions."
"The skills of healthcare personnel staff are being especially put to the test with new threats to health such as bird flu."
"Healthcare professionals must in all circumstances be sure that their working conditions are not needlessly exposed to infection."
"A possible global pandemic would also mean that staff would be confronted with difficult ethical questions."
"Even though it may be a basic premise that everyone is vaccinated and receives the drugs they need, there may come a situation where, for example, part of a vaccination batch is missing."
"Questions of healthcare prioritisation call for fundamental ethical debate as a basis on which to work."
"With the threat of pandemics, the developing countries are in a particularly difficult situation, as malaria and HIV are already causing untold havoc."
"I strongly agree with the calls in the resolution to improve the focus for development cooperation so that it is used for human and social development."
"On the occasion of the World Health Day, please allow me to call your attention to another significant day, the International Roma Day, celebrated on 8 April."
"I would like to talk about the Roma."
"The Roma population is young: they have a high birth rate and a high mortality rate."
"The life expectancy of the European Roma is ten years shorter than that of the majority populations."
"The number of Roma patients is several times higher than the average number of majority population patients: the number of TB patients is ten times higher, the number of patients with tumorous diseases is four times higher, iron deficiency and blood system disorders are ten times higher, the number of cerebrovascular disorders is six times higher, the number of patients suffering from essential hypertension is four times higher, and the number of patients with heart disease is fifteen times higher today in Europe."
"Unfortunately, although these data have been taken from a Hungarian report, they reflect the general picture across Europe."
"One of the many reasons for the life expectancy of Roma being ten years shorter than that of the non-Roma is the discrimination experienced in the public health system."
"And this is where I need to mention the issue that many of you have already brought up today: the training provided for health workers."
"Are they sufficiently trained to treat their patients without any discrimination?"
"(Unfortunately, we cannot talk much today about Roma patients and doctors."
"I would have gladly joined in this topic, too, but unfortunately I cannot do it.)"
"We celebrate the International Roma Day on 8 April all over the world, and in connection with this we accepted a resolution in the European Parliament last year, in which we called attention to the worrying health situation of the Roma."
"In the year that has passed, neither the European Commission nor the Member State governments have taken any corrective measures in the public health sector, or in order to eliminate the unemployment affecting the Roma or their exclusion from the economic, housing and education sector."
"We are asking the European Commission to release a Green Paper as soon as possible on the intolerable situation of the Roma, in order to eliminate their exclusion from public health, and to ensure that the extremely poor quality healthcare services provided to them are brought up to European standards."
"Mr President, this is perhaps one of the most important debates we have had in this House."
"I am sorry that because of the late hour there are not more people here to listen to the appalling statistics of deaths of young children, of mothers – needless deaths from illnesses that we could cure so easily."
"I want to thank the Commission and my colleagues for highlighting the terrible ills that face us in the world and for trying to raise awareness of the appalling vista that lies ahead."
"I come from Ireland, a country from which not so long ago we were exporting nurses because there were no jobs for them."
"Today, sadly, we are now importing people into the health-care sector in large numbers because we have such a shortage of skills."
"We are not thinking about the countries we are robbing of their people, because our motives are selfish: we need to look after our own."
"Yet, even when we take in people from outside, we see in our accident and emergency departments, on a daily basis, people who in many respects are in Third World conditions, lying on trolleys in unacceptable conditions."
"So the problems are first-hand and they are all-pervasive."
"I was in Malawi last year."
"I witnessed what one of my colleagues has already spoken about: the lack of nurses – who are now in Manchester – and the appalling effects this is having in that country."
"It is hard to know what the answers are, but perhaps we should look at the job of the health-care workers and value what they do more than we do at the moment – in terms also of respecting and rewarding them."
"It was asked how we can compensate the developing world for having taken their best."
"There is a huge moral question about how we reject the rest, but take the best."
"We must not do nothing."
"We are moving on to a debate on avian influenza and market support measures."
"Heaven help us if we have a human pandemic and see how stretched our health-care services will be worldwide."
"I should like to read out what the World Health Organization wants us to do on Friday, the day we are talking about: ‘raise awareness of this chronic problem’ – the crisis concerning health-care workers – ‘and to build support to ensure that health workers will be working where they are needed, when they are needed, with the right skills to provide the highest attainable level of health for people everywhere’."
"I hope we achieve this."
". Mr President, I am very impressed by the passionate contributions on this very important issue."
"The process that the Commission is leading to develop an EU response to the human resources crisis demonstrates the strength of greater European coordination."
"The collective commitment of Member States and of the Commission is likely to have a much greater impact than the Commission or Member States working alone."
"The response to the human resources crisis reflects the principle set out in ."
"It is the Member States’ commitment to increase the overall levels of development assistance, moving towards the target of 0.7% of GNI as ODA, that will provide the increasing budget for accelerated progress."
"But it is the coordinated efforts of the European Community that will ensure that the increased resources are more efficiently spent, providing coordinated, coherent backing for country-led and developed plans."
"We believe that better coordinated and more coherent implementation of our common European policy, reflecting the commitments made in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, provides the best means for a drastic increase in human and social development spending."
"That needs to be prioritised by the Member States and reflected in our common policy."
"That is why the Commission has proposed a package of concrete measures on aid effectiveness."
"The package will allow the European Union to deliver more, faster and better aid."
"At the Paris aid effectiveness meeting, the European Union made a commitment to increase the proportion of aid it provides as budget support."
"That commitment includes the potential to increase funding for both general and sector budget support, complemented, if necessary, by project-type funding."
"Delegations making programming decisions for the 10th EDF therefore have a choice of aid instruments with which to respond to nationally defined priorities."
"There is considerable scope for the national decision-making and country programming processes to focus increased effort on the health or social sectors through sector budget support, if that is prioritised at country level."
"I should just like to answer some of the more specific questions that have been raised."
"On the question of a code of conduct, I can confirm that the Commission is willing to consider how to develop and implement a European code of conduct for the ethical recruitment of health workers."
"On the question of tailored medicine, which was raised by two Members, we are currently supporting a study on the potential of trying to make better use of the available efforts as part of our partnership with the African Union."
"Corruption is indeed a problem for development and particularly damaging for the delivery of key social services, such as health."
"As you know, we agreed on the need to address that problem through a whole range of measures."
"Tomorrow we will have plenty of time to have a more in-depth discussion, when we discuss Mr van den Berg’s excellent report on the issue."
"Several Members have mentioned the question of the proportion of development funds that is allocated to human and social development."
"Most Commission financing is allocated through country programming."
"Currently, over 20% of the Commission’s development budget is allocated to social infrastructure."
"In addition, general budget support financing includes linkage to progress measured against health indicators and is therefore a mechanism for supporting and reinforcing country-level prioritisation of the Millennium Development Goals."
"The Commission will be increasing the proportion of development assistance given as budget support and will seek to increase the link between budget support and progress towards the Millennium Development Goals."
"The decision on the proportion of financing allocated by countries to human and social development is ultimately a question for national governments."
"The Commission will continue in its policy dialogue with governments to emphasise the importance of human and social development for economic growth and for poverty reduction."
"– To wind up the debate, I have received six motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 103(2)(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the proposal for a Council regulation amending regulations (EEC) No 2771/75 and (EEC) No 2777/75, as regards the application of exceptional market support measures (avian sector) (COM(2006)0153 – C6-0111/2006 – 2006/0055(CNS))."
". Mr President, in recent weeks and months we have been accustomed to frequent press coverage of new outbreaks of avian influenza."
"The latest outbreak was confirmed today in a turkey farm in Saxony."
"We have been able to follow the disease’s development on maps as we have seen it spreading from one country to another."
"We are all affected either directly or indirectly."
"We – and in particular the poultry sector – are faced with a real crisis situation, which requires a swift response."
"That is why we are here tonight."
"I would therefore, first of all, like to thank the European Parliament for having accepted the Commission’s request for urgent procedure."
"I am especially grateful to the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Joseph Daul, as well as to the rest of the committee for their rapid contribution and opinion on the Commission proposal."
"That is a clear testimony that when there is a need for us to act fast, we can do so."
"The many cases of avian influenza in the European Union have not left us unaffected."
"Even though mainly wild birds have been the victims of avian flu, it has already had a strong negative impact on European consumption of poultry in many Member States."
"The impact on prices has varied from country to country, but in general prices have been under pressure and have in some cases fallen significantly."
"As a result, the poultry meat market faces an exceptionally serious situation and many in the poultry sector are in severe difficulties."
"We have already acted."
"Since the beginning of the crisis last autumn, the Commission has made use of export refunds in order to support the market."
"But the effects of those measures have been limited, not least as we have been faced with import restrictions on our exports into many third countries."
"It is clear that we cannot handle the poultry meat crisis effectively on the basis of export refunds alone."
"Member States have also announced or taken initiatives with regard to the possibility of using state aid."
"There is a broad range of support possibilities via state aid, such as rescue and restructuring aid for farmers running into difficulties."
"Those rules are designed to give quick, effective support to those in the sector who are really in need."
"We will, in the light of the crisis, examine any proposal as quickly as possible, taking into account both the need for rapid help and the need to avoid distortion of competition."
"However, we also need to consider alternative measures at EU level."
"And therefore we have found ourselves hampered by the existing legislation."
"Our current CMO provides for measures that would allow special market support in cases where veterinary restrictions have been imposed."
"The current scope of our CMO, however, does not allow the Commission to act in response to a crisis that is sparked by a lack of consumer confidence."
"And that is exactly the situation we are in today."
"Therefore the existing legal framework has to be changed in order to provide the legal basis for new market support measures for the sector."
"We are therefore proposing to extend the existing exceptional market support as laid down in Article 14 of the CMO in order to include support measures in cases where serious market disturbances are caused by consumer reaction to public health or animal health risks."
"Our proposal also entails a sharing of the financial burden between Member States and the Community budget and would only be introduced upon a request from the Member States."
"We are now taking a first step."
"We are filling the legal gap."
"Once our proposal is finally adopted, Member States will have to submit their proposals for practical steps that will fit their specific situation."
"We believe that will allow the best possible flexibility, and therefore the most efficient response to the current crisis and to future similar situations, if they were to arise."
"There is no time to waste."
"Thanks to the European Parliament’s constructive stance and the rapid procedure it has chosen via which to consider this proposal, we should now be able to ensure a final adoption in the Council in the coming weeks."
"This will be an important step towards delivering those measures that our poultry sector is so desperately asking for."
". Mr President, tonight we are talking about exceptional market measures for a very successful industry in the EU."
"We have some five billion chickens in the EU."
"It is an industry that is not subsidised by the common agricultural policy."
"We are, as the Commissioner said, facing a reduction in consumer confidence with regard to chicken meat."
"In some Member States we have seen that consumption drop up to 70%."
"There is no doubt that we need to promote how safe chicken meat is, especially when properly cooked."
"In the EU we have put together very good measures to help stamp out the disease when it comes into Europe."
"At the end of the day, we really need to reduce production and sort out the demand for chicken meat."
"One of the benefits of the poultry industry is that the time from when you start to incubate an egg to the time the chicken is ready to eat can be as little as nine weeks."
"Therefore it is possible to take production out."
"I do not believe that export refunds are the answer to this crisis."
"The problem is that if you put a lot of extra chicken meat on to the world market – which is already saturated – and if you are not careful about using public funds to subsidise it, you may find that meat comes back to the European market."
"I believe the way forward is to reduce the supply and then try to increase demand to get the industry back on its feet."
"It is not only the poultry sector that suffers but also the cereal sector, because five billion chickens eat an awful lot of wheat."
"At the end of the day I agree with you, Commissioner, that 50% co-financing between Member States and the Commission must be the way forward."
"I believe that will be the way forward for a lot of agriculture in the future."
"– Mr President, I should like to start by emphasising that the way in which the Commission dealt with bird 'flu was methodical, controlled and efficient."
"Unfortunately, however, the lack of information for consumers, the communications policy and the role of the media and the lack of direct national measures, especially control measures, have helped consumers to lose their confidence which, in numerous cases, will probably take a long time to recover."
"The repercussions to date in Europe are a 35% reduction in sales of poultry and eggs, with significant differences from one Member State to another."
"In Greece, consumption has dropped by 65% over the last ten months and stocks of 20 000 tonnes have accumulated, while in France, the biggest poultry producer, there are stocks of 25 000 tonnes."
"The intervention measures by the Commission and the national governments must be immediate and the market crisis must be addressed with the most effective economic and social measures for poultry farms and incubators."
"The results of the bird crisis, as my honourable friend Mr Parish said, are also important for the cereal sector."
"That is why, in addition to amending Article 14 of the regulations on the operating regime of the poultry and egg market, we propose:"
"- firstly, 50% financing of emergency measures linked directly to sanitary and veterinary measures;"
"- secondly, 100% financing from Community resources in cases in which the fall in consumption is due to the blow to consumer confidence;"
"- thirdly, promoting market measures, such as granting aid for warehouses, for a period required to stabilise the market and"
"- finally, aid for the withdrawal of stocks and compensation for the destruction of eggs and poultry."
"These measures will balance out market supply and demand."
"I would highlight in particular the Commission's point that permissible state aid also needed and needs to be given, at national level, to domestic poultry farmers and to poultry farms as small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Community and national aid must be given at once."
"It is already overdue, with the result that many undertakings face closure."
"There will be many social problems in Greece, because they employ 15 000 people."
"Mr President, Commissioner, if I may make a joke, if governments and the Commission delay in taking effective measures and interventions, bird 'flu will turn into worker 'flu."
". – In a number of countries, production has been significantly affected, and in some cases has already stopped altogether; thousands of tonnes of poultry has been stored in refrigerators, which is expensive and there is no market for its consumption."
"Poultry producers are therefore enduring difficult times."
"There are countries in which poultry and egg production have suffered enormously, even though there have not been any cases of avian influenza."
"It is therefore essential that support be provided for producers and that Community financing for compensating market measures be set at 100%, as was the case for swine fever and BSE, given the seriousness of the socio-economic situation in a number of countries and the difficulty of guaranteeing cofinancing."
"We have also proposed funding for the removal of poultry while the market is inactive, in order to offset the costs of refrigeration."
"A long-term information campaign must also be launched throughout the EU in order to regain consumer confidence."
"It strikes me that this could also be a funding proposal for the Union itself."
". Mr President, I am somewhat bemused by the European Union’s approach to the bird flu scare."
"The EU has, it seems to me, made a mountain out of a molehill."
"There is no evidence whatever to suggest that bird flu has mutated and can be passed between human beings."
"In fact there is very little evidence that it can even be caught from birds unless there is considerable direct contact with the remains of dead birds."
"Despite that, in Britain there have been lurid headlines about 320 000 possible deaths and bodies being disposed of in mass graves."
"This very day, a full-scale bird flu outbreak rehearsal, involving several hundred people, has started in the county of Norfolk, with the dramatic title of ‘Operation Hawthorn’."
"The theatrical way in which the matter is being handled is creating an atmosphere of hysteria, and the EU has played its part in that by holding well-publicised, international summits to discuss the bird flu crisis."
"It now wants to set aside EUR 5 million over the next five years for exceptional market support measures to deal with the alleged crisis."
"There is even what appears to be an open-ended commitment for more funds in 2011."
"It seems to me that the EU and some national governments are guilty of creating a massive public scare that has severely damaged the poultry industry, with little or no justification."
"Forgive me for being cynical, but it also appears to be a handy way for the EU to promote itself as a caring organisation."
"Whatever we are actually dealing with here is a virulent outbreak of public hysteria, generated by a highly contagious burst of over-the-top publicity from the national governments and the European Union."
"In short, everyone needs to stop flapping around like headless chickens and start examining this matter with a degree of objectivity."
"If we are going to allocate those large sums of money, they should be used for the production of educational literature that can be disseminated to the public."
"That material should let the public know that there is actually no risk from properly cooked poultry and that it is perfectly safe to buy it in supermarkets and to eat it in restaurants."
"Let us stop making a crisis out of a drama."
". Mr President, from the medical point of view we seem to be winning the war against avian influenza, because very few outbreaks of the disease have occurred and only isolated cases involving human beings have been reported."
"Where the media are concerned, however, the issue has been dealt with in a most unsatisfactory manner."
"No reliable and objective information on the threat of an epidemic was made available, nor was information provided on how to protect oneself in the case of an epidemic."
"The mass media made headline news out of every dead swan found."
"Avian influenza is being presented as a further horseman of the Apocalypse."
"The information reaching the man in the street is anecdotal, disorganised and often inappropriate."
"Action by the veterinary services tends to run counter to common sense."
"Slaughtering entire flocks of domestic birds seems to be done for show, just for the sake of being seen to be doing something."
"It hardly makes sense, when millions of wild birds can spread the disease unhindered."
"In addition, there have been many cases of thoughtless cruelty."
"We have all seen on our television screens live birds rammed head downwards into sacks that were then handled as if they were sacks of potatoes."
"Furthermore, unfounded information was put about according to which avian influenza could also be transmitted to humans by cats."
"This led to a number of instances of negative treatment of the latter."
"In view of this situation, it is hardly surprising that the market in poultry is in the grip of panic and threatened by disaster."
"It is therefore entirely appropriate to act in support of the market."
"This move deserves our full support, and I have in mind also the amendments aimed at increasing the degree of support."
"In particular, I would like to draw attention to the amendment tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group aimed at increasing the level of support in the new Member States where farmers and breeders are in a particularly difficult situation, as they are only in receipt of partial direct payments."
"The best way to support the poultry sector is to provide reliable information and calm the market down."
"It is best for this to be done by the European Commission, because the latter probably inspires greater confidence than national authorities in crisis situations of this nature. The Commission should disseminate clear information on how the disease spreads."
"In particular, it should state categorically that consumption of poultry meat does not represent a health risk."
"The media should also be asked to exercise restraint and avoid creating panic."
"There are lessons to be learnt from this crisis."
"Should similar situations arise in the future, reliable information must be made available to the citizens at a much earlier stage."
"– Mr President, to try and save time, I shall be very quick this evening."
"I should simply like to thank the Commission for acting so quickly last week on the Council’s proposal."
"Parliament demonstrated that it was also effective and, if all the institutions put their minds to it, it is clear that we can make the right decisions in eight days to respond to natural disasters, and come to the aid of the victims."
"Furthermore, I agree with my fellow members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and we have already spoken a great deal about avian influenza."
"We have for once acted quickly, and it cannot be said that it is because of Europe that the breeders will have to wait to receive compensation."
"Mr President, I was gazing at Mr Daul, who has spoken very well and in a short space of time;"
"I wish I could do the same thing."
"In any event, Commissioner, I also wished to congratulate the Commission on its rapid reaction to the problems being suffered by the poultry and egg market."
"It is also the case that we have reacted with the urgency asked of us so that these two Regulations could be amended and the Commission would be provided with the legal basis to act."
"As you have pointed out, however, Mrs Fischer Boel, this crisis is not currently being caused by the outbreak of an epidemic, which has not appeared in the majority of Member States, and for the time being there are no restrictions on the movement of poultry within the Union, but rather, as you pointed out quite rightly, it is due to a loss of consumer confidence and the resulting fall in consumption."
"In this regard, Commissioner, we are in a complex situation that has only just begun, but which is very similar to the two market crises suffered by beef following the outbreak of BSE."
"And on both occasions, Commissioner, market support measures were taken at Community level and funded at 100%."
"My group has therefore presented two amendments to the Commission’s proposal in this regard."
"We accept the 50% co-funding of health measures, but we would ask that measures to support the market in view of the crisis caused by a loss of consumer confidence be of a Community nature and therefore be 100% funded from the European budget."
"Commissioner, as I have said, we believe that this co-funding mechanism — contributions from Member States for measures that have always been of an exclusively Community nature — would set a serious precedent within the CAP and could jeopardise the principle of the single market."
"Mr President, the European Union has a wealth of experience in overcoming crisis situations."
"It has applied exceptional measures to support the market on a number of occasions in the past, notably in connection with mad cow disease and foot and mouth disease."
"It has now fallen to us to face up to avian influenza."
"The importance of poultry as part of the food sector must not be underestimated."
"It is essential to introduce exceptional measures."
"All that remains to be decided is the scope of the aid and the size of the funds."
"Practice has varied to date."
"The Community has covered a varying percentage of the losses incurred by Member States, usually between 50% to 100%."
"The regulation before us today also provides for significant support to the poultry sector."
"Unofficial discussions indicate that the proposal for the Community to refund 50% of the costs borne by the Member States is strongly supported."
"Unfortunately, however, equal does not mean fair, especially as the old Member States are in receipt of 100% of direct payments for farming whereas the new Member States are receiving barely 30%."
"That is why I believe a principle should be adopted whereby Member States receiving 100% of farm payments receive a 50% refund of the costs incurred, and countries not in receipt of full payments that are funding farming from their own budgets should receive at least 75%."
"We need to be consistent."
"Either we just talk about a Europe of solidarity or we get down to creating it."
"If we are to create a Europe of solidarity, it must manifest itself in social and economic terms."
"As a rule, people show what they are made of in difficult, dramatic and catastrophic situations."
"It is often said that a person’s worth is best assessed in terms of the extent to which he or she is prepared to share with others."
"It therefore follows that the Union of nations and states will be judged according to the extent to which it guarantees fair distribution of cost and income and also in terms of the degree of solidarity and justice it demonstrates."
"Mr President, we have been hearing about avian influenza amongst wild birds on an almost daily basis recently."
"This is indeed a disease that mainly affects wild animals, but can it be restricted exclusively to wild birds?"
"There is no clear answer to this question, but we do know that the disease occurs amongst farmed poultry."
"The poultry sector has very specific characteristics."
"Within the European Union, it operates on market principles, and consequently there are only limited opportunities for supporting it."
"A way of providing aid for the poultry sector in crisis situations must therefore be found."
"This aid should be awarded in such a way that it does not infringe market principles and is only implemented in exceptional situations, when the market is in crisis."
"A broader approach is called for, encompassing consideration of the special characteristics of farming and the need for intervention in certain agricultural markets in specific situations when intervention and outside aid are patently necessary."
"I believe this is a good learning opportunity for us."
"We need to find a way of providing special support instruments within the common agricultural policy, in order to help this sector."
"– Mr President, I should also like to welcome the measures proposed this evening, which will hopefully be carried in tomorrow’s vote."
"Action had to be taken on account of the fact that, in some countries, this crisis is affecting a great many farmers, not to mention the sector itself and all those working therein."
"I should also like to say a few words about the manner in which the measures are to be taken, specifically those concerning market management."
"In this regard, as has already been mentioned by my group just now, I hope, as regards cofinancing, we will be giving priority to 100% European funding."
"Furthermore, it strikes me that the time has come for Europe to reflect on the manner in which we apply the precautionary principle when it comes to all health problems, or any other problems that may affect our individual countries and the continent as a whole."
"I believe in fact that unless Europe applies the precautionary principle, there is a major risk that, due to a succession of problems, and the fact that not all States have all the information or deal with information in the most appropriate fashion, as has been the case in recent months, there will be crises affecting entire sectors, both industrial and agricultural."
"We then ask farming and the WTO, in this case the poultry sector, to come along and compensate for the impact that is not down to the structures or to the farming sector, but, rather, to panic, as has rightly been mentioned, with specific examples, this evening."
"I therefore believe that we need a Europe-wide policy to address crisis situations and ensure that measures are taken at European level and are applicable across the board."
"This particular crisis is an example that should set a precedent for the future."
"It should lead us to reflect on both agriculture, and, more importantly, on other sectors such as public health, with the aim of henceforth applying the precautionary principle at European level."
"Mr President, it is good that we are doing something to assist the poultry industry."
"Unfortunately we have had other experiences of loss of consumer confidence in other food products."
"In Ireland we have had no cases or reports of wild birds or others with avian flu, but we have suffered a fall in consumption of up to 20%."
"Europe has been accused of making a mountain out of a molehill but the truth is that we are in a very difficult position."
"I sympathise with the Commission."
"How do we keep avian flu highlighted so that we do not have a human pandemic and so that we spot the problem in wild birds, while at the same time trying to avoid scaring consumers?"
"It is an extremely difficult balance."
"I believe that Members of this House can play a role in communicating effectively and without panic what is happening throughout the European Union and why we are taking action."
"There is a huge gap in consumer knowledge."
"The trouble is that we have large quantities of poultry meat in storage."
"Export refunds may not be the answer because markets are closing down to us."
"We need to manage the stocks."
"While they are there, they are a huge problem."
"I feel that removing hatch eggs is part of the solution, but I would worry that you could go too far."
"Let us hope that this crisis is just for the short term, rather than the long term, and that we rebuild confidence and consumption."
"I believe that is what we are all trying to do."
"However, the poultry sector throughout the European Union is pleased that the EU is responding."
"Part of that response has to be accurate, clear, panic-free information to consumers."
"Mr President, I was delighted to endorse the Commission initiative on exceptional support measures for the poultry and egg sector, and I am sure many other Members felt likewise."
"Swift and decisive action is needed."
"Even though Europe had been preparing for the advent of avian influenza for some time, we did not manage to stop panic spreading."
"Initially, only wild birds were affected, and when the first cases of infection amongst farmed birds were confirmed, the demand for poultry went into free fall."
"In some countries it went down by as much as 70%."
"Sales and exports were reduced, and certain countries imposed import restrictions, banning the import of Community poultry."
"This widespread panic is being fuelled by the media, which often fail to provide reliable information."
"Instead of informing and reassuring the public, they simply aggravate the situation."
"Avian influenza itself does not represent a serious danger to breeders."
"The main problem is the media and the panic arising as a result of the lack of cohesive information on the subject from the European Union."
"I welcome the fact that the Commission has proposed exceptional market support measures for the avian sector to deal with the loss of consumer confidence in this sector."
"Nonetheless, the proposal to cofinance 50% of the costs may have a negative impact on competition within the European Union and amount to a step towards renationalisation of the common agricultural policy."
"We should also remember that diseases know no borders, which means that a highly virulent strain of avian influenza can easily spread across them and become a problem for the Community as a whole, not just for an individual country."
"One hundred per cent support should be guaranteed in such circumstances."
"That is the only way to win this battle."
"Partial financing will achieve nothing."
"Decisive action at European level is called for."
"The House will recall that 100% finance was made available in the case of BSE."
"Why is the Commission not proposing similar terms in the case of avian influenza?"
"It is worth adding that the Commission proposal under discussion is simply a set of temporary measures that can only be in place for a limited period."
"They do not guarantee the stability of the markets in exceptional situations in the long term."
"A new cohesive insurance system is therefore needed, as has been repeatedly stated in the House."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for being here tonight and in particular I would like to express my great satisfaction with the speed with which the Commission has dealt with this issue, which I believe to be important for everybody, for consumers and producers, in the European Union."
"I am delighted that account has been taken of the fall in prices and also the fall in consumption that we are seeing in the European Union."
"I am delighted, because consumers are losing confidence in the face of the possibility of being infected with a disease that we all know cannot be caught in this way."
"Nevertheless, loss of confidence can lead them to stop consuming products such as eggs or chicken, and that would be very bad news, of course."
"I believe that we must distinguish between veterinary measures and market measures."
"You are proposing a market measure which, for the first time, you are deciding should be co-funded."
"Well, in this regard I cannot congratulate you: I believe 50% to be insufficient."
"In 1997, in the case of BSE, you will remember that 100% was paid."
"The same happened in the case of foot-and-mouth disease."
"This is therefore the first example of co-funding of market measures which, as my fellow Member has said, could lead to imbalances in the market, distortions of competition, a concealed renationalisation of the common agricultural policy, and this could lead to very bad results for everybody, including those who are sceptical about the common agricultural policy, because renationalisation would lead to much more of the protectionism which they believe is already too much."
"I believe that those who are sceptical about the current common agricultural policy should consider this."
"I therefore believe that it should not be co-funded and we have presented an amendment which I hope this House will support tomorrow."
"It will depend on the governments whether or not this subsidy is requested."
"If it is 50%, in many cases certain governments would take a long time to do so."
"It seems to me that the fundamental problem is that there is no money, either to finance emergency measures or to fund the common agricultural policy, because, essentially what we have is a terrible agreement, and in the future it will be very much worse, in view of the approaching financial perspective."
"There is not enough money?"
"Then the governments, in the Council, must provide it."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the loss of revenue incurred by operators in the poultry sector, due to the loss of public confidence, could reach 50% to 60%."
"Against this backdrop, the Commission has proposed changes to the regulations as regards the application of exceptional market support measures."
"Such measures are expected by operators who have suffered as a result of an emotional reaction on the part of consumers, and I commend the Commission on acting swiftly."
"Yet to seek to increase the volume of exports to address the current shortfall in internal consumption runs counter to the principle of food sovereignty."
"In this regard, is it reasonable to advocate, as some Member States have done, the destruction of healthy poultry stocks in order to regulate supply?"
"Such a move would only benefit the large companies that have relocated to Brazil."
"This is the signal they need to restock the European market."
"What is needed is to activate a safeguard clause to block imports of industrial poultry from outside Europe, especially as it appears that the more industrialised the sector, the more intense the avian influenza virus; in Asia, Laos, where there are no industrial holdings, has been spared, in contrast with neighbouring countries such as Vietnam and Thailand."
"I wish to emphasise that the necessary precautionary measures that we are rightly taking in our countries will have a greater effect on traditional farms, which are more concerned with producing high-quality poultry, than on industrial farms, which benefit from additional support."
"An example of this is the segregation measures, which are restrictive for small free-range poultry holdings."
"Lastly, mindful of previous crises that have seriously affected the agricultural world, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy in 1997 and dioxin in 1999 – not forgetting that these problems were entirely different from avian influenza – would it not be opportune to set up a special commission, this time pre-emptively, tasked with detecting the causes of crises, in order to prevent them rather than trying to cure them?"
"Mr President, I should like to endorse what Mr Daul, the chairman of our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, had to say, and warmly congratulate the Commissioner on the speed with which she has come up not only with an action plan, but also with unorthodox proposals to tackle the problem that is currently afflicting the poultry industry."
"She has understood very well that Europe must pull out all the stops in order to face up to this crisis."
"Indeed, the spreading of bird flu by migratory birds and the threat of the virus for people show that society has every reason to bring this disease to a standstill and ensure that the poultry sector does not go under."
"It is, in fact, too crazy for words that, despite the threat to public health and the uncertain spread via birds living in the wild, vaccination against bird flu to protect man and animal is still a taboo subject."
"The much-heard argument that vaccination leads to sales problems has almost turned into a self-fulfilling prophecy, because as long as Europe, as a prosperous market community, hides behind this argument, worldwide vaccination will itself continue to be treated like an contagious disease."
"Turning to the proposal itself, I would like to say that so far, market measures have always been taken, and funded, by the European Commission, with good reason, because in that way, the common market was strengthened and distortion of competition prevented."
"The Commission now proposes to cofinance up to a level of 50%."
"I have to say, also on behalf of my party, the CDA, that the Commission in this matter, given its limited financial scope, has probably gone for the best option by plumping for cofinancing."
"Nevertheless, I should like to call on the Commission to make firm pledges so as to avoid distortion of competition among Member States."
"The CDA would also like to see this regulation help the countries that use vaccinations and experience market losses as a result cushion the consequences, and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has tabled an amendment to that effect, to which, I hope, this House will give its unanimous backing."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the Commissioner on her stamina."
"All evening, she has been listening to a persistent misunderstanding under which the Members of this House labour."
"The European Union is not an insurance company."
"Where entrepreneurs run risks, they should take out insurance, and that they can do."
"When France was plagued by FMD, the French Government provided a soft, low-interest loan and the cattle farming industry subsequently paid for the damage it had suffered by means of a disaster fund they had set up themselves, and that is how things should be done."
"The European Union cannot be held responsible for all damage suffered by a sector, in whatever industry."
"If a sound insurance system in poultry farming is lacking, we will have no choice but to take action."
"That is the European Union’s only option."
"What action, though, can it take?"
"It cannot push up export subsidies, because that would be a scandal."
"It would be unacceptable to pass on our problem to the developing world. It would also distort the world market and is at odds with negotiations and agreements within the WTO."
"What can be done is to encourage Member States, in the event of an outbreak of a crisis, to grant poultry farmers soft loans of the kind I have referred to."
"Looking at the measure that the Commission is advocating, I can, to some degree, see where they are coming from, but I think that we must first call for a sound insurance system to be in place for the poultry farmers themselves, because then entrepreneurs will be shouldering their own responsibility, and that is something in which they can take real pride."
"The Commission acted correctly, wisely and in good time."
"We have an excellent Commissioner."
"While you are Commissioner, European agriculture is in good hands."
"Poultry consumption has fallen by thirty percent in the European Union, but in Hungary it has only fallen by fifteen percent, because the government has taken firm steps to gain the trust of consumers."
"I fully agree with the proposal of the Commission."
"The Commission has accepted an excellent plan for market measures."
"I believe that marketing and regaining the trust of consumers, referred to by several Members of this House, including Mr Daul, Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, are at least as important."
"Therefore, I fully support the report, and I agree that we must help European poultry farmers."
"I also agree with the issue of cofinancing, because we, the new Member States, have already experienced cofinancing: we cofinance direct payments at a rate of thirty percent each year, and I think it is fair to apply cofinancing in this issue, as well."
"Therefore I fully support the efforts made by Mrs Fischer Boel, and I would like to express my thanks again, on behalf of the European and Hungarian poultry farmers."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by sincerely thanking you for the very broad support that we have had for this change in the CMO."
"I shall now make some comments on the 23 amendments."
"In Amendments 1, 2 and 22 you asked for a list of the different support measures to be put into the Council regulation."
"As I have said previously, it is important to give a certain flexibility to the Member States."
"They should decide themselves which tools they want to use."
"I do not want to bind their hands, but I have clearly said that it is important that we try to address the problems upstream."
"But ultimately I leave it to the Member States."
"Some of the measures stated in your various amendments are going in the same direction."
"However, I should just like to mention one of them concerning the financing of an information campaign; this in fact belongs to a completely different legal framework."
"Therefore, I believe that some of the other measures proposed deserve to be looked into further."
"Once again, I must underline that the purpose of this change of regulation is to try to fill in the legal gap that we have experienced and then allow the Member States to suggest the different possibilities that they consider to be the most efficient for them."
"Therefore, while I have some sympathy for some of the measures you have proposed, I cannot accept or introduce them into the regulation as has been suggested."
"Some of you mentioned co-financing, which is proposed in 11 of your amendments."
"We have had the possibility of discussing this issue on several occasions when we amended our regulation on exceptional market measures."
"The Commission considers that co-financing on market support measures is an important way to ensure that Member States assume their share of the responsibility for the handling of different crises linked to health issues."
"We use this type of co-financing in relation to our veterinary measures, and we have had more than ten years’ experience in the co-financing of related exceptional market measures."
"It is not the time for changing this approach and I am therefore not in a position to accept those amendments."
"On the information campaign you asked for in Amendments 1, 2, 16, 17 and 22, it is not the kind of measure that fits into this proposal."
"However, there is a Council regulation on internal promotion for European agricultural products, and I have asked my services to prepare an amendment to the existing Commission regulation so that generic promotion of poultry meat would be eligible for European funding."
"It would be a waste of money to start a promotion campaign at this stage, but I can assure you that when the time is right, then all the legal aspects will be settled so that we can act immediately."
"On Amendments 8, 9 and 23, I do not think it necessary to exclude certain measures on animal welfare grounds."
"The slaughter of animals is not a priority in the intended measures and the Commission will propose action in line with the different animal welfare standards."
"Nor can I support Amendment 7 on export refunds."
"The Commission uses the export refund instrument in a prudent way, taking into account our different responsibilities within our international commitments regarding this instrument."
"On soft loans, I do not exclude at this stage any potential national proposal, provided that it does not destroy or distort competition."
"That is quite clear, and I can promise – as is already the case – that I will act as quickly as possible on any proposal put on my desk from the different Member States."
"On vaccination, Member States that decide on a vaccination policy should examine carefully the possible consequences that such a step might have on their international trade."
"Trade problems created by vaccination cannot, in my view, justify the use of exceptional market support measures based on the new Article 14."
"Let me turn to Article 14 in the existing Council legislative text, which was the subject of a question: Member States shall ensure that where producers contribute to the expenditure borne by Member States, this does not result in distortion of competition between producers in different Member States."
"I would like simply to underline that this was the wording we put into the discussion we had last year on co-financing."
"Finally, on procedure: the European Union’s swift handling of this proposal is another sign of its credibility as a valuable partner in tackling the problems that might arise within the agricultural sector."
"Once again, it has been a great pleasure for me to do business with you."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report by Mr Cornillet on behalf of the Committee on Development on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2005 [2005/2104(INI)] (A6-0063/2006)."
". Mr President, the report on the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2005 is actually included on the agenda."
"I will not go back over the detail of the report and will merely refer to two sessions, that in Bamako in April 2005 and that in Edinburgh in November 2005, without forgetting the next session, which will be held in Vienna in June 2006."
"I should like to point out in this Chamber just how worthwhile it is, as was the case this year, for sessions organised in Europe to be held in the country holding the Presidency."
"It does, in fact, seem extremely logical to maintain and to perpetuate this system, which was adopted two years ago."
"I should also like to highlight the very solid contribution of our colleagues from the ACP countries, and we must congratulate them on that."
"We simultaneously conducted six joint missions, and allow me for the first - but not the last - time to emphasise the adjective ‘joint’."
"It is essential, in fact, that both the Permanent Assembly and the missions share a joint vision of matters."
"To do the opposite would make no sense at all."
"I should also like to point out that an increasing number of horizontal votes between the ACP countries and the EU representation have been held."
"In my opinion, the practice of separating houses must be drawn on as little as possible without it being necessarily removed from our Rules of Procedure."
"That being said, it is true that the objective, in the long term, would be to hold an increasing number of votes that make it possible to secure an ACP-EU majority."
"Furthermore, it appears that our colleagues from the ACP countries are less involved in what we might call an ‘intellectual’ capacity."
"By that I mean that we are in agreement with them on the fact that what was an expense for us – namely, in actual fact, the EU expenditure that consists of the ACP budget – is revenue for them."
"The need for parliamentary control at these two levels is, moreover, becoming increasingly clear to them."
"To this end, we, for our part, have requested the budgetisation of the EDF in order to guarantee parliamentary control regarding the use of this Community expenditure but, at the same time, the parliaments of the ACP countries also need to submit to parliamentary control what they consider to be revenue."
"That is a joint battle that we will have to fight if the vital need for parliamentary control is to be recognised."
"As for the future of the ACP, I welcome the amendment made to the Cotonou Agreement."
"The budget for the tenth EDF now amounts to EUR 22.682 billion."
"We have already complained in this Chamber about this sum, which does not live up to our expectations of EUR 24 billion."
"The Austrian Presidency has already responded to us."
"I have no doubt that my fellow Members will shortly take the floor on this subject in order to request a realignment."
"It is not a matter of endlessly repeating the same questions, but we are awaiting more forceful responses than the ones we have been given."
"The EDF surplus also poses a problem."
"To date, it stands at almost EUR 11 billion, which naturally raises questions about the procedure and the ambition of the projects dealt with, because it is unforgivable that EUR 11 billion should not have been spent in countries that have such glaringly obvious needs."
"What does the future hold for the EDF?"
"If we fulfil our political commitments in 2010 and if we succeed in devoting 0.56% of our GDP to development aid, then the European Union will grant an additional EUR 50 billion per year to this budget, even though it had made the political commitment to devote only half of that amount, or EUR 25 billion, to Africa."
"It is quite clear that if this policy is complied with, the additional aid that is available will actually correspond to one annual EDF budget."
"Nevertheless, if the way in which we spend that budget were to be examined, it would only raise questions."
"Furthermore, I wonder about the proportion of the aid to developing countries that will be managed by the European Union and that will be in the region of 20%."
"In that case, even if my choice of term is a little strong, the EDF will be reduced to the status of a minor instrument of aid."
"The problem of its budgetisation, which is absolutely crucial and needs to be done as soon as possible, thus becomes even more acute, as does that of its ‘fungibility’, meaning the possibility of granting very ambitious regional projects, such as rail infrastructure, a place in the European Union’s general system for action."
"That is what would make it possible to ensure coordination between the member countries and the European Union."
"The EDF can become that coordination lever, and the Joint Parliamentary Assembly can become an element of specific control, in the knowledge that all of the least developed countries in the world are members of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"Finally, there is above all the problem of understanding European Union policy."
"What I was describing just now as Community expenditure earmarked for development aid is provided by our taxpayers."
"As such, action must be clear because it is no good the populists grabbing hold of the figures that I have announced to you and crying out: ‘What on earth are you doing with all of that money?’"
"We therefore need this matter to be viewed and understood from a political perspective."
". Mr President, the rapporteur has produced an excellent report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"He has summarised very well all the recent developments of the Assembly."
"It is indeed becoming an increasingly strong parliamentary pillar of ACP-EU cooperation."
"The establishment of the standing committees and the joint drafting of reports by the ACP and the EU members of the Assembly have led to more frequent and more intense contacts between parliamentarians."
"The Assembly has become a mature forum, where issues of concern to ACP and EU parliamentarians are addressed in an open debate where broad consensus on many development issues is emerging and where votes by separate houses have become a rare exception."
"This framework has allowed the Assembly to discuss and reach agreement on a broad variety of issues ranging from governance over finance to trade questions."
"The resolution calls on the Assembly to organise meetings between EU and ACP Members of Parliament at regional or sub-regional level to strengthen regional integration and foster cooperation between national parliaments."
"The Commission is ready to make its contribution to the success of such arrangements."
"In conclusion, I would like to stress that the Commission shares your view on the Assembly’s role as a model for cooperation."
"My colleague Mr Michel has participated in all the Assemblies held since he took office."
"Commissioner Michel also looks forward to attending the next Assembly which will be held in Vienna in June this year."
". – Mr President, let me start by extending warm thanks to Mr Cornillet for his comprehensive report on our activities over the past year, in many of which I have of course participated as first European Vice-President of the Assembly."
"I would also, at the outset, like to thank equally warmly our two co-presidents – the European co-president Mrs Kinnock, who is with us today, and, in her absence Sharon Hay-Webster, for their great dedication over the past year, which has been exemplary, and we look forward to their continuing with their work."
"The primary object of the Parliamentary Assembly is to reinforce the parliamentary dimension of the Cotonou Agreement."
"The many things that we do together are intended to help our counterparts gain influence in their own countries and gain the same self-confidence that we have gained over the years in our dealings with our governments and the executive."
"Our shared experiences, and our journeys together to various places, have led us to shared conclusions, for example as regards the reform of the market organisation for sugar."
"It is good that the Commissioner for Agriculture is present with us today, since she knows the figures inside out and knows what we in Europe are doing to lessen the impact of reform of the market organisation for sugar and how little, in comparison with that, is available for the countries concerned."
"It is apparent from that that our reform directly impacts on these countries, two of which – Guyana and Jamaica – I have myself visited."
"In Guyana, we can – without intending to – contribute to the destabilisation of a whole country if we do not lessen the impact of our reform by making adequate compensation available to that country."
"There is another important aspect that I would like to highlight."
"We call on the Commission to set aside an appropriate proportion of European development funding for the political education of parliamentarians and other persons in positions of leadership, enabling the development in these countries of the sort of political culture that will strengthen responsible governance in the long term."
"In conclusion, I would like to mention the official contact that we established with the Pan-African Parliament at the end of last year, when I was able, on behalf of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, to confer with Sharon Hay-Webster, and I have since become the chairman of this delegation."
"It is important that we should foster an awareness in Africa that the continent shares a common destiny and of the important role there that Parliament can play in this respect."
". Mr President, the report by my fellow Member, Mr Cornillet, illustrates the quality of the work done by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2005."
"The JPA is a permanent forum for political dialogue that tends to become an instrument of prevention, of conflict resolution and of support for the democratic process."
"The role of the JPA is therefore very precious in the context of the Cotonou Agreements."
"It is a unique tool for dialogue between the North and the South."
"In the future, it must work more effectively, particularly in terms of dealing with major crisis situations, such as the one in Darfur, provided that it is given the resources to do so."
"This aspect is above all the responsibility of the European Union, which must attach political priority to this partnership with the ACP countries, by respecting its commitments in the negotiations under way on the sum of the tenth EDF and by finally refraining from taking back with the one hand what it gives with the other, as illustrated by the sugar reform."
"By finally giving the JPA the political respect that it deserves, let us thus definitively enforce what is laid down in the Cotonou Agreement, that is to say that the Assembly shall meet in Europe in the country of the EU Presidency."
"Let us not welcome our ACP partners in a half-hearted fashion, as that would be a downright poor political signal for us to give."
"However, it is also the responsibility of the JPA itself."
"It must make progress with its reform and its working methods, and the next development could result in regional conferences being held."
"This objective could be set by the beginning of 2007."
"Finally, we, as members of the JPA, also have a political responsibility, by abstaining, for example, from voting in separate houses, which is not only the negation of the JPA’s joint character, but also the means used all too often these days for the purposes of thwarting the outcome of a vote."
"I find all of that in the Cornillet report and I therefore believe that, as far as we are concerned, it constitutes a road map for 2006."
". Mr President, how to help the countries of Africa and other parts of the developing world is a key factor in ensuring a more prosperous and therefore a more stable world."
"What Africa needs in particular is respect for the rule of law, respect for contract law and the protection of private property."
"Under those circumstances there will be economic development and prosperity."
"This is very hard to achieve when many of the governments are socialist or quasi-socialist or simply kleptocracies."
"The story of international aid to these countries is sadly one of waste, embezzlement and corruption."
"If the EU really wants to help these countries, it should not help consolidate corrupt systems through more aid."
"What it should do is embrace free trade and lower the trade barriers and tariffs – in fact remove trade barriers and tariffs that are holding back the economic development of these countries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Cotonou Agreement of 2000 had the good intention of giving the ACP countries help from the EU in getting out of the gutter."
"Even though, today, its continuation is probably a foregone conclusion, there are still a number of things wrong with it, and I shall sum some of them up."
"There are still, among the ACP countries, six dictatorships, namely Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Sudan, Swaziland, Cuba and Eritrea."
"It is a matter of fact that these countries’ dictators constitute an obstacle to their economic development."
"The Joint Parliamentary Assembly, and its Political Affairs Committee in particular, must make it a priority to bring real democracy to these countries."
"At the same time, the ACP countries also include a number of countries in which religious practices still prevail over the rule of law."
"The humanitarian tragedy in Darfur is a direct consequence of this, among other things."
"In some of them, women’s rights count for nothing and the mutilation of women – despite what has already been done to counteract it – is still a daily occurrence."
"It was the Cotonou Agreement that first acknowledged that corruption was an obstacle to development."
"It is still going on; it has not yet been stamped out, and constitutes a serious obstacle to the alleviation of the needs of the least well-off in these countries."
"Let me close by quoting the Indian Nobel economics prizewinner Amartya Sen: ‘never yet has famine occurred in a democratic country’."
"It follows, then, that, in addition to the principle of ‘aid for trade’, we also have to consider the idea of ‘aid for democracy’."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I think that it is with satisfaction that we can look back on the past year and on the Bamako and Edinburgh agreements reached by the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"Good reports have been adopted, and the capacity for tackling burdensome tasks has been further enhanced along with the quality of political dialogue."
"That is important if we want to help build up political stability, which is what we accomplish by strengthening the parliaments."
"At the end of the day, though, what matters in development cooperation in the ACP countries is the concept of ownership, and it is that that we will take as the starting point for our work."
"It is still the countries themselves that bear primary responsibility for their own development."
"Through dialogue in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, we hope to further promote good governance, democracy and the protection of human rights, and I might add that I am also happy with the appointment this week – to which reference has already been made – of this House’s delegation to the Pan-African Parliament, which can be an additional instrument."
"Today, I want to ask that particular attention be given to two projects that have been running over the past year, and will continue next year, namely the economic partnership agreements and the reform of the sugar market, both of which will have a great deal of impact on both Europe and the ACP countries."
"We must see to it that both continue to help put the ACP countries in a stronger economic position, and in that respect good consultation with them will be of crucial importance and must involve their parliaments too."
"This House treats cooperation between the ACP countries and the EU as being of particular importance, since it involves a Joint Parliamentary Assembly consisting of 77 members of this House and 77 members of the ACP countries’ parliaments."
"We debate together and adopt resolutions together in what is a unique and valuable arrangement."
"What is needed for peace and political and economic stability in these countries is not just financial investment on our part, but also investment in contacts devoted to deliberation and dialogue, in order to get to know one another better and understand one another better."
"In that we cannot invest enough."
"I look forward to the 11th meeting in Vienna in June this year, and I hope that it will be a successful one."
"I thank the rapporteur for his outstanding report and for the pleasure of working with him."
"Mr President, I thank Mr Cornillet for his excellent and wide-ranging report, which covered all the points raised in the debate this morning."
"Anyone looking at our Joint Parliamentary Assembly over a number of years, as I certainly have for around 12 years, has seen a very heartening increase in confidence, maturity and, indeed, in engaging on issues related to trade and to political dialogue, to which we attach great importance."
"Someone said that everything in Africa was terrible and things were not improving."
"I do not think that we can make that case."
"There are limitations, but we are there, working behind the Cotonou Partnership Agreement with parliamentarians in a unique way."
"There is no other North-South parliamentary assembly such as ours that has this opportunity to press on governance, democracy and human rights, and that is what we do."
"On the EDF, briefly, we are concerned and we had a debate at the part-session in Brussels a few weeks ago."
"Many of us are concerned about the situation of the overseas countries and territories in relation to the EDF."
"We are concerned that allowance has not been made for the entry of East Timor into the ACP-EU relationship, and we have a number of other concerns."
"We are always puzzled about the 3% or 4% administration costs."
"I do not know why the Commission needs to put money in to pay itself for the job it is doing."
"I find that rather odd."
"Let me turn briefly to sugar, with which the Commissioner has been directly involved."
"At the weekend I am going to Africa – Swaziland – and Mauritius to look again at the issues related to sugar there."
"The Commissioner must be aware that the figures we now have on the budget line, going from EUR 130 million up to EUR 170 million by 2013, are far short of what the Commissioner and others had promised, which was EUR 190 million."
"My own government talked about EUR 230 million."
"They are going to get EUR 1.1 billion at the end of 2013 and it is back-loaded."
"How can that be sensible?"
"We urge the Commissioner to look at this and to try to make this more workable."
"Stop this back-loading and increase the amounts on the budget line for these countries."
"The issue is not just about employment in sugar, as the Commissioner must know – because we made enough fuss about it in Europe – but also about the other developments that depend on and grow around that source of employment."
"Thousands and thousands of livelihoods are at stake in those 18 Sugar Protocol countries."
"You can rely on us in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly to keep raising this issue."
"We have work in progress."
"Our committees are working well and I think that we can fairly say that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly can only grow in strength in future years."
"We will continue to fight on EDF, trade and other concerns and priorities that we share with our fellow Joint Parliamentary Assembly parliamentarians."
"Mr President, there are many things in the report by the ACP delegation which in my capacity as Member I should draw positive attention to."
"I am not therefore talking now about the situation concerning the ACP countries so much as the work of the delegation."
"Firstly I am grateful to the Bureau of the European Parliament for its decision to authorise the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly to be held in Edinburgh."
"The meeting was a success, and Great Britain, the country holding the presidency at the time, and the City of Edinburgh deserve praise for organising the event so well."
"I hope that it will be possible to organise the JPA in the country holding the presidency in future as well, because the place where the meetings are held brings true added value, as does the fact that the meetings are held by rotation in the EU-ACP countries."
"It was also excellent that representatives of the ACP and the EU were able to participate in the informal council of ministers for development cooperation organised by the UK Presidency in October."
"Hopefully the practice will also continue when my country, Finland, takes over the presidency in July."
"The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has an important role in implementing the political dialogue provided for by Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement."
"The objective is to strengthen democracy, good governance and the human rights situation."
"It is just a slight nuisance that our meetings always partly coincide with Committee Week."
"For me it has meant that I have never been able to be continuously present at a meeting."
"I do not know whether other Members share the same opinion, but I would think that it would be easier to get away during the week when Parliament’s groups hold their meetings."
"It would perhaps be worth testing this option."
"I am also happy that standing committees have been set up."
"They have made for better upstream cooperation between the European Parliament and the ACP members."
"I realised how viable the system was when I myself produced a report."
"– I should first like to commend Mr Cornillet for his report, and the joint chairman of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly for her hard work and commitment in the work of the Assembly."
"I should also like to draw attention to the conclusions of the Women’s Forum that took place at the fringe of the Assembly during the final session in Edinburgh in November."
"The discussion touched upon the issue of the trafficking of women and girls from developing countries and the poorest parts of Europe to the wealthiest areas of Western Europe."
"Some 600 000 to 800 000 women are trafficked every year across international borders, which corresponds to more than the entire population of some ACP countries, for example Cape Verde, Djibouti and the Comoros Islands."
"The Women’s Forum established a bridge between countries of origin and destination."
"The debate was lively, with strong participation from the contingent from the ACP countries."
"In the final conclusions, the participants called on the Joint Parliamentary Assembly to draw up a report to identify the measures needed to combat this scourge in all ACP countries, including European, African and Caribbean countries."
"It should be noted that the Forum was arranged for the fringe of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and that resources are not made available for it."
"I therefore call on Parliament’s services and the Conference of Presidents to consider harnessing funding for such a positive, results-focused organisation."
"On a more general level, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly last year discussed the situation in Darfur and West Africa, but did not address the breakdown in the rule of law and the electoral process, and the serious violations of human rights in countries of key, symbolic significance such as Ethiopia, where the African Union has its headquarters."
"There have, however, been important developments in the fight against impunity in Africa; for example, the dictator Charles Taylor has been arrested and brought to justice."
"Other dictators such as Hissène Habré, and former Ethiopian dictator Mengistu, currently being harboured by ACP countries like Zimbabwe and Senegal, must also be brought to justice."
"These are further cases in which the Assembly can play a key role in ending impunity in Africa."
"On this issue, I must say that it would be most useful if the debates were more genuine."
"Sometimes, there are ACP countries acting more as the ambassadors of their governments and less as critics of the situation in their countries."
"I feel that as MEPs we have a duty to find ways of supporting our counterparts from ACP countries who are determined to tell the truth and to encourage them to take action to bring about change and better governance in their countries."
"Mr President, I think we see the ACP relationship as maturing well, which may sound like the description of a long-term mistress, but it is true that we know each other, we understand each other, sometimes we excite each other, sometimes we see each other’s blemishes, but we grow to value each other’s qualities."
"My message to the ACP is that we still wish on principle that ACP delegates should only be from among members of parliament and not ambassadors, and preferably from government and opposition parties, which would better reflect the balance of the European Parliament’s delegation."
"I am not sure whether one day we will have the EP meeting the AP – the African Parliament, including, of course, the Caribbean and Pacific – but certainly we must play our part in sustaining and developing that African Parliament concept."
"My message to the European Parliament is that REACH has shown us how intimately the work of each of us affects that of the other."
"We had valuable discussions in Bamako and in Edinburgh and this Parliament, I am sure, will take the ACP views into account."
"Often, however, we legislate for all the right reasons in the European Parliament yet we have not heard the worries of the ACP, because we have not listened."
"That is why I say to the Commissioner that the ACP is not just for our good friend Mr Michel: it is for all the Commissioners in the College."
"I am very pleased that this House overruled the Presidency of Parliament on the question of where the last JPA should be sited in the European Union."
"It was right for us to site it in the country holding the Presidency, just as we rotate our meetings in the JPA in the ACP countries."
"That gives ACP members an opportunity to see different aspects of different policies in Europe, for example the malaria vaccine research in Edinburgh."
"In the same way, we learned much from seeing the desertification of the Niger; or the implementation of the vaccine fund on the ground in Mali, where we could see the people who are most affected actually benefiting from the work being done."
"The flu pandemic threat and the avian flu pandemic reality show just how important it is that we continue to work closely together – Europe and the countries of the ACP – for our mutual benefit."
"– Mr President, I too would like to add my voice to the congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Cornillet, who, in his report, has given a really very good overview of the good work done by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"Many speakers have mentioned the women’s forum that takes place at every meeting of the Joint Assembly, and I would like to do likewise, for the in-depth discussion of the political and economic problems specific to women in the ACP countries is very helpful, not only to the women’s forum itself, but also to the Assembly’s ensuing plenary debates."
"I need do no more than remind the House of the exciting debate on genital mutilation that took place in Bamako in Mali – itself a country in which this practice is not yet proscribed by law – when the discussion went on for hours and we even managed to get it carried on the radio."
"I would now like to share with you some thoughts on the work done by the committees, which has had the effect of markedly improving the work of the ACP-EU Assembly, in that fewer amendments are tabled in the plenary, and the higher degree of trust established between MEPs and the representatives of the ACP countries means that compromises are achieved more often."
"I would, though, like to reiterate something that has already been said, namely that it is important to give thought to the scheduling of the European meetings of the committees, which are held in Brussels."
"It is sometimes a real shame that we should have to take part in votes in our own specialist committees, which can go on for hours, and are thereby prevented from taking part in the exciting and important debates in the ACP-EU committees, which is sometimes – wrongly – taken as an indication of a lack of interest."
". Mr President, I agree with the speakers that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly has become an accepted, respected forum for dialogue."
"The resolutions adopted by this Assembly sometimes even launch debates that go beyond that forum."
"Mr Bowis mentioned the resolution on REACH, adopted here in November last year, which has led to a much more focused discussion about the impact of REACH on the developing countries."
"The next Joint Parliamentary Assembly also promises to be interesting."
"It will deal with such important issues as the role of regional integration in the promotion of peace and security, the problematic issue of energy in the ACP countries and the social and environmental aspects of fisheries in developing countries."
"I know from my colleague, Mr Michel, that he is very much looking forward to attending those meetings."
"On the sugar issue, I am indeed familiar with the issue of funding for the Sugar Protocol countries."
"We have had this discussion before."
"I should just like to reiterate that EUR 40 million is available in 2006."
"What is more important is that we do not forget that the impact of the price drop agreed within the European Union will not have an effect on the ACP countries until 2008."
"They have another two years to try to adapt their production with the money available from the European Union."
"You know that considerable funds will be available from 2007 until 2013."
"In the European Union we have shown that we also have a responsibility towards those countries that will be affected by internal legislation concerning the need – that I am quite sure everybody feels – to adapt our agricultural policy to a more global trade."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has done some great work in deepening our ties with ACP countries and affords them a crucial link to our deliberations, particularly as we come to finally address our trade policies, which all too often hinder rather than help development."
"Scotland has been at the forefront of calls for change in 2005, with the Make Poverty History march in Edinburgh, the G8 summit in Gleneagles in the summer, and of course we were delighted to host the ACP-EU meeting in Edinburgh."
"What we now need to see is our Member State governments putting our fine words into action, and making development policy not just a matter of doling out aid but of working with developing countries in fair trade, to all our betterment."
"The next item is the report by Mr van den Berg on behalf of the Committee on Development on aid effectiveness and corruption in developing countries [2005/2141(INI)] (A6-0048/2006)."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased that we are, in this House today, having a serious debate on a matter that is not always easy to discuss in the context of a debate on development cooperation."
"Quantitatively speaking, Europe is the world’s greatest donor, but there has been a growing global awareness over recent years of the truth that the way aid is targeted is at least as important as the quantity of it."
"Last year’s Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness forms an important benchmark for action on this front and the Commission has recently responded to it by means of a package of measures on the effectiveness of aid which we will shortly be discussing in the Committee on Development Cooperation."
"My own-initiative report, on which we are to vote today, makes a few serious recommendations as to how to make aid more effective."
"The effectiveness of aid is dependent to a large degree on good governance, free from corruption, for not only is it the case that aid money is raked off, but corruption is also a hindrance to development and has a disproportionate effect on the poorest members of society."
"It makes access to essential services, such as basic education and health care, more difficult and sometimes impossible."
"Corruption is an enormous problem on a worldwide scale."
"Estimates by the World Bank suggest that in any one year, over USD 1 billion – that is, 1 000 billion in our terms – is paid in bribes."
"In Africa, the world’s poorest continent, the amount estimated as being lost – USD 148 billion – is more or less equivalent to 25% of the continent’s GDP, and corruption is present at every level of society and nearly everyone is affected by it: politicians, civil servants, the media, multinational enterprises and the international donor community."
"Responsibility for good governance and effective aid is shared by the donor community and the developing countries themselves; ‘it takes two to tango’."
"My proposals therefore deal with what we – the European Union, the Commission and the Member States – can do in practical terms, preferably together with the international community as a whole."
"My principal proposal is for the drawing up of a blacklist of corrupt regimes, which should receive no further loans from banks or other financial institutions."
"Those who do lend money to governments on such a list would be exposing themselves to the risk of debt and would be unable to ask the international community to bail them out."
"This would prevent the people from becoming the ultimate victims of the likes of Marcos, Kabila, Abacha or any of their successors."
"I then propose that a small percentage – 0.5% – of the amount paid out directly to a country’s government be required to be paid as budget support to civil society watchdogs."
"Such groups, belonging to organised civil society, are engaged in the public monitoring of the government’s income and expenditure in terms of the development goals."
"There also needs to be support – paid out of the same amount – for national parliaments, enabling them to better discharge their monitoring function together with the watchdogs."
"Another proposal is that businesses found to have been involved in corruption in respect of projects in developing countries should thereafter be excluded from European tenders."
"Here too, I propose the compilation of a blacklist of such businesses."
"Those who can show that there has been improvement, through, for example, changes in management, would get a second chance and could be removed from the list."
"Finally, all Member States of the EU must delay no longer in ratifying the UN’s anti-corruption treaty, which dates back to 2003."
"At present, only two of them have done so: France and Hungary."
"That state of affairs must change."
"This treaty is the first international agreement to use international law as a means of combating corruption, by, for example, preventing and penalising money-laundering, promptly freezing financial assets held in banks overseas, and seizing those assets where corruption is proven."
"Such are some of the proposals I have put forward in my report."
"They represent, of course, only a couple of steps that Europe can take in addressing the enormous problem that corruption presents to society, but let us – the Commission, Parliament and the Member States – make them a priority, so that we no longer merely point the finger at the developing countries, but also own up to our own wrongdoing."
"I will be interested to hear how the Commission responds to these practical proposals, for, remember: ‘it takes two to tango’."
". Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report."
"The Commission is particularly keen on ensuring that the aid it manages serves the objectives of combating and ultimately eradicating poverty, and in that respect the power management of financial resources is crucial."
"Hence the decision to make governance in general a horizontal and central theme in the programming of the tenth EDF, because combating corruption can only be successful when embedded in a broader agenda of capacity building."
"In this context we share the view of the rapporteur, Mr van den Berg, on the importance and scale of the problem."
"Corruption is indeed a major obstacle to development."
"It hits the poorest in developing countries the hardest."
"It is responsible for political instability and the violation of human rights, and it reduces the level of resources available for development funding."
"Secondly, we agree that corruption is a very complex phenomenon which needs to be addressed through a whole range of different measures."
"International agreements are important, and the report notes that the UN Convention on Corruption still has to be ratified by several of our Member States."
"We need to work with private-sector organisations, and we need civil society watchdogs."
"In our assistance programmes we have various measures to support good governance, such as reforms of the legal system, support for Supreme Audit Institutions, assistance for civil society, and support for national parliaments, which was the subject of a debate at the recent ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"We already support civil society watchdogs, for instance Transparency International chapters in some countries."
"Thirdly, on budget support, Mr van den Berg pays particular attention to that, and rightly so, not because it is especially prone to corruption, but because it is part of the solution."
"Its big advantage is that it directly addresses a major source of corruption in many countries, namely the weak management of public finances."
"Our budget support goes only to those countries which are clearly committed to reforming their public finance system and, by strengthening sensitive areas like public procurement, it makes an important contribution to the fight against corruption."
"Project-type assistance, on the other hand, is heavily based on public procurement but cannot address weaknesses in the system."
"You are aware of the special report by the Court of Auditors on public finance management in the framework of budget support in ACP countries, which supports the approach adopted by the Commission."
"I also want to highlight the importance of the harmonisation agenda, which was the focus of the Paris Forum on Aid Effectiveness held in March this year and emphasises the importance of strengthening beneficiary country systems of financial management and control, which is precisely one of the things that we are doing."
"One note of caution, however: budget support is not earmarked for a specific sector, but specific sectoral reform measures and targets can establish the conditions for the funds which are, of course, paid into the general budget."
"Fourthly, the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness also underlines the importance of improving the transparency of public procurement procedures in our partner countries."
"Those procedures are often a source of corruption."
"My last point concerns our colleagues in the field."
"One of the key objectives of the devolution process is to ensure that aid is more closely supervised in the field and to make the most of the detailed local knowledge of our ‘in-country’ staff."
"Delegations can check that aid is properly used."
"Moreover, for some kinds of contract we now require external audits before we make the final payment, and a comprehensive system for programming external audits was introduced in 2003, covering audits to be launched both by headquarters and by delegations."
"In summary, we share much of Mr van den Berg’s analysis."
"We think more attention could be paid to public procurement issues, and we think some of the detailed measures proposed need to be reviewed and discussed further."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating my colleague Mr van den Berg on an excellent and valuable report."
"There is no doubt that overcoming corruption in the allocation of development aid is one of the main obstacles that we face in achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"While concern mounts over a deficiency in funding for MDGs, we must ensure that the aid is being provided to developing countries and is being allocated efficiently."
"With increasing levels of aid, there is growing concern that politicians and officials will misuse money intended for the world’s poor."
"As Mr van den Berg said, corruption is widespread, affecting every sector and bureaucracy."
"We must remember, however, that it is by no means solely a problem for developing countries."
"There is a common argument that aid should not be channelled through government."
"However, we are increasing budget support and I am pleased to hear what the Commissioner has said about strengthening institutions to eliminate corruption through budget support and the reform of the public sector."
"Massive restructuring of civil service and public financial management is necessary."
"Often these reforms are the sole responsibility of a few select civil servants."
"Civil servants in developing countries, who live on low, public sector wages, are struggling to keep their families out of poverty."
"They are subject to bribes and often have to moonlight in order to supplement their incomes."
"How can we expect people to implement the necessary reforms if they are not paid accordingly?"
"I suggest to the Commissioner that we recognise and acknowledge about 200 civil servants in each developing country as the key players in the decision-making process and include them in budget support."
"Why do we not follow Singapore’s example and give these civil servants extra supplementary incomes, comparable to our standards, so that they are not tempted to take bribes to keep their families in the style to which they have become accustomed?"
"We also need to deregulate."
"Regulation is the mother of corruption."
"The power of the paper impels people to get permissions, and permissions are sought and bought by corruption."
"If we deregulate as much as possible in the developing countries, we will have a chance to address this problem."
"After all, regulation was used as a colonial instrument: the power of the paper, as opposed to the soldier in the village, to enact the imperial master’s wishes."
"When independence came, these countries kept those controls in place."
"They did not deregulate the imperial controls and, because of that, corruption has become endemic because regulation has been piled on regulation."
"We need to get the national parliaments in developing countries empowered with thorough investigative capacities to look at corruption in those administrations."
"We are on the right track."
"I congratulate Mr van den Berg on an excellent report and I am very pleased to hear what the Commissioner has said."
". – Mr President, I should first like to commend Mr van den Berg on his excellent, timely and important report."
"The EU, and its Member States, contributes over half of public aid to development, overall."
"Following the decisions taken by the 2005 Spring European Council and the Gleneagles G8 Summit, international aid is set to increase substantially over the next ten years."
"In this context, if we are to properly accomplish the Millennium Goals, appropriate transparency mechanisms must be brought in to ensure that development aid actually reaches the people on the ground it is designed to help."
"As the van den Berg report says, the appropriate management of development aid is essential to the good governance of the recipient countries."
"I should like to turn to the example of Ethiopia, where despite the fact that it is the largest recipient of external aid, which accounts for almost 25% of the country's public budget, there have nevertheless been serious breakdowns in the rule of law, democracy and human rights."
"Pursuant to Articles 96 and 97 of the revised Cotonou Agreement, serious cases of corruption can lead to political consultations."
"The EU should not hold back from using this tool."
"Naturally, in the medium and long term, it is crucial to foster a dynamic civil society with a free, balanced press."
"This is the only way in which the citizens of developing countries will be able to expose corrupt governments and to free themselves from them."
"On a more practical level, the EU must bring pressure to bear on the parliaments and governments of developing countries to step up control over military spending."
"Shadow and parallel budgets are in themselves a form of corruption, directly affecting internal, regional and even global security."
"The lack of transparency in this area is a clear example of the link between corruption, bankrupt countries and security."
"In other words, when we speak of corruption, we also speak of war and peace, and as such the problem is not confined to developing countries, given that our own EU and western governments more often than not have a part to play in this."
"The G8 countries, for example, are responsible for more than 80% of world arms exports."
"I welcome the efforts made by EU Member States towards ensuring the compatibility of arms exports from the Union with the technical and economic capacity of importing countries under the EU’s Code of Conduct on Arms Exports."
"It is vital to guarantee that money for development is not diverted towards arms."
"Unfortunately, we are still awaiting detailed reports from the Member States on the implementation of the rules of this code."
"In this murky area of arms, corruption and violence, Europe has a responsibility to guarantee that the arms sold by European companies and by European governments reach their legal recipients, and only them, and do not fall into the hands of criminals, militias and repressive governments."
"The partial implementation by Member States, including my country, of the 2003 European Council common position on arms brokering means that there remain legal loopholes in this area in Europe. Unless we start being tougher on arms control within our own borders, it will be difficult to combat corruption in this area in developing countries."
". Mr President, many congratulations to Mr van den Berg for his excellent report."
"The scourge of corruption is neither new nor rare."
"It has accompanied human activity since ancient times and is widespread amongst both the developing and the developed countries – the only difference being that in the developed countries, it is practised more professionally and more elegantly and is thus more difficult to recognise."
"So, with corruption being so common and extensive, how effective have attempts made at international level to curb it actually been?"
"Not very, I am afraid."
"The estimated amount of USD 1 trillion paid in bribes today is not less than the corresponding amount in previous years; in fact, it is more."
"The reason is simple: corruption cannot be controlled by signing conventions and declarations alone, but only by the strict implementation of such conventions and declarations by concerned."
"To that effect, we in the developed world must set a good example."
"While passing judgment on corruption in the developing world, let us look at ourselves."
"Also, let us consider critically our own state of affairs and let us analyse ourselves by asking some simple questions."
"How free from corruption is a system that allows United States Government officials at the highest level – names like Cheney and Rumsfeld come to mind – allegedly to be involved and have a personal interest in companies awarded multi-million contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan?"
"How corruption-free is it to have the wife of the Prime Minister of Britain, Mrs Blair, working for a large law firm and taking up highly politically sensitive cases, which directly involve and are affected by political decisions taken by her husband?"
"Should not the Roman proverb that Caesar’s wife must not only be honest but must also be seen to be honest apply here?"
"How free from corruption is a system that allows United Nations officials and other related persons, including the son of the United Nations Secretary-General, to be accused of involvement in oil-for-aid scandals?"
"Closer to home, how corruption-free can the system be seen to be when Members, or their close relatives, of the European Parliament and other EU institutions, involved in making legislation, are at the same time members of boards of companies, or are stakeholders in companies which stand to make huge profits from such legislation?"
"Is a simple declaration of interest really good enough?"
"Lastly, may I draw your attention to two amendments by Mr Kristovskis, concerning recital N and paragraph 22."
"These amendments correct a mistake that was made in the original report in recital N, in which Cyprus was omitted from the list of EU Member States that have not yet ratified the 1997 OECD Convention."
"In fact, Cyprus has repeatedly attempted to participate in the OECD, but Turkey, for political reasons unrelated to the subject, blocked such participation."
"By voting positively for these two amendments, we will make it possible for Malta, Lithuania, Latvia and Cyprus to ratify the OECD Convention."
"Mr President, I too should like to thank Mr van den Berg for his excellent report. He is going to be showered with praise as a result, which is something at least."
"It is clear that the fight against corruption is absolutely crucial, in terms not only of the effectiveness of European aid, but also of its credibility."
"How can we really convince our fellow citizens or the Member States to give more if corruption remains endemic?"
"This is also the condition of the viability of a constitutional State and of an economy."
"This is therefore a crucial battle that we must fight to the end, one that has become somewhat more complex with the advent of economic globalisation, due to the ease with which capital can be moved and also due to the new budgetary aid process at EU level."
"The rapporteur does a good job of highlighting all of the questions posed by this new budgetary aid system with regard to the fight against corruption, as well as the heightened problem, in the present context, resulting from the increased pressure put on raw materials and, in particular, on scarce oil supplies."
"There is therefore also reason to fear both a resurgence of attempts at corruption for the purposes of gaining access to the last remaining fossil fuel reserves and an increase in conflicts linked to the trade and traffic in weapons."
"Weapons and oil are in fact the two large sectors, in the macroeconomy, in which a high level of corruption is developing."
"The rapporteur therefore rightly emphasises two issues: transparency and responsibility."
"Transparency, in actual fact, is a crucial element if one is to have a precise and clear idea of the budgets that are used."
"In this field, we must be far more enthusiastic in our support of a number of initiatives, such as ‘Publish What You Pay’ or the initiative of the extractive industries, which nevertheless have the disadvantage of being based solely on voluntary participation."
"We need to make progress in this area of legislation rather than merely to rely on the good will of economic or political actors to publish, if they so wish, the funds or loans that they give to the governments concerned."
"The budgetisation of the revenue from oil and mining is also a crucial aspect of budgetary transparency but, as far as the European Union is concerned, this must be a requirement so that budgetary aid cannot be granted to a government that does not clearly publish the profits that it makes from the oil, mining or forestry industries."
"Public opinion cannot understand why the European Union continues helping countries that should, by rights, have a sizeable budget and one that is able to finance the smooth running of a State."
"Finally, the report points out that a government’s military expenditure must also be published."
"The role of national parliaments and of civil society simply must be strengthened, in financial terms too, by means of increased support enabling both parliaments and civil society to play their role in this area."
"My final point concerns transparency with regard to the various donors."
"The governments of these countries are also helped by towns, regions or States, at all levels, and we lack a database that would indicate what is really paid by a given country to a given State, region or town."
"We do not have access to that information today, and that also fuels corruption."
"To conclude, I therefore believe that we need to put matters in order, as has been said, and that corruption cases, too, form part of the current issues facing the European Union."
"The issue of exercising power and of funding political life is as relevant in the North as it is in the South."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Mr van den Berg made an excellent speech."
"There is no doubt that rooting out corruption is a key objective if we want to ensure the effectiveness of aid, and Mr van den Berg has outlined the instruments needed to make that possible: transparency, participation and responsibility."
"The role of parliaments and civil society is crucial, and more transparent procedures and the circulation of information are vital."
"Furthermore, it is requested that all of the social actors become more involved in the process of defining anti-poverty strategies, which still attract little participation, even at national level."
"Finally, specific funding is necessary in order to monitor the cooperation measures."
"I believe that it is impossible to talk about corruption in developing countries without looking at the other side of the coin: to what extent are we, as developed countries, responsible for their corruption and what benefit do we derive from it?"
"Mr Matsakis gave some very precise examples; this in no way means easing the pressure on the actual corruption of many leaders and governments of developing countries and, at times, of NGOs too."
"The fight against corruption in recipient countries must also be extended to corrupting companies belonging to industrialised countries, and the fight against ‘corrupt corruptors’ should be conducted as part of an effective and transparent partnership."
"The institutions of donor countries located in recipient countries must commit themselves to fighting the phenomenon on the ground, by singling out corrupting companies and banishing them to whichever country they belong, as Mr van den Berg also said, and they must have the courage to act even when corruption is lurking in our own institutions on the ground."
"In addition to being a moral matter, the cost of corruption is a cost that everyone must bear, including European taxpayers."
"Untying aid is another crucial aspect of the relationship between corruption and aid effectiveness."
"Untied aid – which is necessary for ethical reasons – guarantees greater transparency in relation to procedures and to the awarding and management of tenders, and would also increase the value of aid."
"The figures are quite clear: tied aid causes an average increase in the cost of goods and services of between 15% and 30%, rising to as much as 40% for food aid."
"It would be helpful if we could also come up with an appropriate definition of ODA."
"I believe that official development aid, which is often swollen by massive sums for debt cancellation, for peace keeping, peace enforcing and conflict prevention efforts, for repatriating immigrants and for controlling borders, must not be changed."
"In this kind of scenario, budget aid can become an important support channel to the poorest, most heavily indebted countries, for the purposes of eradicating poverty and of attaining the Millennium Development Goals."
"Nevertheless, I believe that it is crucial – as, moreover, it is claimed in the tripartite document on the European consensus on development policy – that the governments of the Member States and the European institutions try to coordinate themselves and harmonise their own policies, including within international financial institutions, with a view to becoming not only the leading donors in the world, but also the most responsible of donors and the most incisive when it comes to drafting policies that put an end to the spiralling external debt in the South of the world, thus helping to eradicate poverty and, if I may be so bold, to eliminate a little injustice, too, and perhaps even wars."
"Mr President, international solidarity and, through it, the ability to help people in developing countries are very close to my heart."
"I believe that aid is an important tool in this fight for a better world."
"The EU’s aid policy is in itself very poor."
"However, it is undermined by other policy areas too."
"Firstly, the EU conducts an agricultural policy in which absurd subsidies are given to relatively rich farmers."
"This, together with the duties that the EU imposes on agricultural products from poor countries, leads to a situation in which agricultural policy actively militates against aid."
"Secondly, the EU’s trade policy leads to poor countries being deprived of the ability to enter our market with their competitive products."
"A topical and instructive example of this type of damaging protectionism is the EU’s recent imposition of duties on shoes from, for example, Vietnam."
"Thirdly and lastly, I believe that development cooperation should take place at Member State level."
"If aid is to be as effective as possible, it is, of course, always crucially important that efforts be coordinated."
"This coordination should, however, take place at UN level where donors from all over the world, and not only from the EU, work together in order to bring about effective aid which, as a matter of actual fact, leads to a reduction in poverty."
"This process really would lead to the world’s poor countries being given a better deal, an outcome that should be the main purpose of aid."
". Mr President, I very much welcome Mr van den Berg’s report on aid effectiveness and corruption in developing countries and I would like to congratulate him on it."
"Corruption is the single biggest obstacle to the delivery of aid to the poor."
"We have to ask why the EU continues to channel aid to corrupt regimes."
"How can we stand by and watch starvation in many African countries, while the leaders are laden with the trappings of exceptional wealth?"
"The EU must take a firm stance against governments that are exercising blatantly corrupt methods of governance."
"There is a need for more transparency."
"The EU is the world’s largest donor of aid."
"The EU has a responsibility to monitor and approve the implementation of this aid."
"More aid must be channelled directly into specific projects rather than a handover to recipient national coffers, so it is absolutely clear where the money is being spent."
"The establishment of civil society watchdogs in developing countries must be seriously looked at and I call on the Commission to give the appropriate percentage of budget aid for such watchdogs."
"Education and training needs to be improved and the number of women in higher level education needs to be increased in order to afford them the opportunity to become more involved in politics."
"Anyone who has visited Africa knows the important role that women play."
"They could play a far more important role if they were allowed to, so this needs to be looked at and encouraged."
"A major question facing development countries is the illicit acquisition of public funds by government officials who store them in offshore accounts."
"I call on the financial institutions that hold these stolen funds to freeze them or confiscate them."
"They know where this money is coming from."
"If I lodge EUR 10 000 in my bank account in Ireland, the bank manager is obliged to ask me where the money came from."
"In these countries they put millions in and nobody asks them anything."
"I call for corrupt regimes or individuals to be blacklisted, to prevent them from borrowing large sums of money from wealthy countries."
"Only when they have made a noteworthy move towards democracy should they be removed from the list."
"We also have to examine ourselves."
"Take the case of Kenya and the Anglo Leasing scandal."
"Mr John Githongo, who is the anti-corruption tsar, had to leave the country because of what he found and he has asked that British citizens be examined concerning this scandal."
"People in Europe are involved in scams and bogus companies that are lending and giving money to Africa and they have to be stopped."
"A number of years ago there was a campaign in all European countries."
"In Ireland we brought in legislation that meant that people involved in sexual offences in Third World countries could be charged in their home country."
"The same kind of legislation could be introduced in Europe with regard to corruption so that anybody in Europe involved in corruption or bribing officials in Africa or any other Third World country could and should be charged under legislation in their home country."
"That is the sort of thing we have to look at if we are going to get rid of corruption."
"We cannot just blame African people."
"We have got to look at ourselves and how we are involved in schemes of this sort."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nearly all the ACP countries are to be found near the bottom of the latest edition of the ‘Corruption Perception Index’, that much-used yardstick produced by Transparency International, and we should not be surprised by that."
"What really is disappointing is where the ACP countries stood on the index and stand now, for there has been scarcely any improvement over the past five years."
"This is a fine report, and makes clear that the rooting out of corruption could result in a significant increase in Africa’s gross domestic product."
"When one considers the fact that corruption primarily affects the poorest, it follows that, for many Africans, it makes the difference between life and death, and so it is a matter of life and death that the fight against corruption be pursued with adequate resources, rather than assuming that only a few prominent personalities are engaged in it, and that the fight against corruption is therefore of secondary importance."
"What is equally important is that direct budget support be handled with care, for there is a risk of the EU writing out blank cheques to foreign bodies over which it has no control."
"Let us prioritise the giving of aid to NGO projects that are not only capable of producing tangible results, but which can be required to guarantee them and also to apply quality standards"
"– Mr President, I join with the previous speakers in expressing appreciation of Mr van den Berg and his outstanding report, which makes clear in how many and varied ways conditions can play their part in making our aid less effective while corrupt structures flourish."
"It is of course mainly those who sit by the fleshpots in these countries who are criminally active, but it very rapidly becomes apparent that embezzled funds have to be deposited somewhere, and that is where we in Europe come into the picture very quickly."
"It is often our banks that offer dictators accounts where they can stash their money, and it is often European businesses that collude with structures in their countries to the eventual detriment of the people who live there."
"Let us then see to it that we check carefully to see where budget aid goes;"
"I have my doubts as to whether we in the EU really can give budget aid to 28 countries, as to whether the structures in them are such that we do that with any confidence."
"Let us use the legal means available to us to investigate banks in order to find where the dirty money has gone, and, for the good of the people who live in these countries, let us make sure it goes back there."
"Let us amend our legislation to prevent businesses from deducting bribes from tax as operating expenditure, and let us publicly name and shame those in Europe who do that, for naming and shaming is a good way of draining the swamp of corruption."
"Let us also use Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement to take action against notoriously corrupt regimes."
"I want to underline what Mrs Gomes had to say on this subject."
"I would like to see all these people – and their spouses too – barred for good from getting visas to come to Europe on shopping trips, spending the money they stole from their own people."
"– Mr President, the effectiveness of aid and the fight against corruption runs like a scarlet thread through many debates, but particularly through those we have had since yesterday evening."
"Today's order of business features Mr van den Berg’s report on the effectiveness of aid and on combating corruption in developing countries, and I too would like to join in the congratulations and gratitude to him that have been expressed; his report and what he said by way of introduction to it show very well the need for corruption to be fought and prevented for hampering development any longer."
"At a time when we need to get it into our heads that a significant increase in spending on development cooperation is needed, serious talking needs to be done about fighting corruption, so that corruption can no longer serve as an easy excuse."
"Corruption, as a phenomenon, is both global and complex; it is not only in the developing countries that the causes of its occurrence there are to be sought."
"The OECD’s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials is an important means of addressing the connections between corruption on our own countries and corruption in the developing world."
"I believe that we – that is, the European Union – must do everything possible to get Latvia, Lithuania and Malta – which are EU Member States – to ratify this convention as soon as possible."
"I would like to say something else about direct budgetary support."
"There is an increasing tendency in the European Union to opt for direct budgetary support rather than projects, and, basically understandable though that is, there are very many doubts about this, which have indeed been aired today."
"There are doubts as to whether we have at our disposal sufficient capacity and sufficient personnel to guarantee the comprehensive monitoring that will be necessary."
"– Mr President, I too wish to congratulate Mr van den Berg on his report, which sees him picking up one of the hottest of hot potatoes in the field of development cooperation."
"Just how necessary it is that action be taken to deal with this is spelled out by the African Union’s estimates according to which corruption robs the African national economies of some USD 150 billion per annum, amounting to one-quarter of their gross domestic product."
"I would like to start with the very same aspect to which Mr Gahler referred – the highlighting of the need for action on our part even when it hurts us the most."
"Bribes to the tune of a billion are paid every year – by whom?"
"Who is it that regards the payment of this sort of money as an investment and remits it to closely-guarded accounts in the expectation of even greater profits?"
"Important though it is to urge our partners to combat corruption and support them in doing so, our primary task should be to take off the field those in our own countries who are capable of paying such massive sums in bribes in the first place and using them to ruin Africa and other parts of the world."
"I want to explicitly highlight Article 15 of the UN Convention against Corruption, according to which the Member States of the European Union must make bribery a criminal offence."
"In my own country, Germany, it was until recently the case that bribes could be set off against tax, and people can still not be punished for paying them."
"We in this House should sweep away this foul-smelling filth from in front of our own front doors first."
"Like you, like everyone on the Development Committee, I support the ‘publish what you pay’ campaign and would go as far as to demand that multinational companies be compelled to make public information on the payments they make to governments."
"Among the others who profit from bribery and to whose activities we must put a stop are those banks that offer their services in completing such transactions and can rejoice in accounts full to overflowing with bribes."
"This cannot be permitted within the EU, and so we should call on the EU and its Member States to cut off the channels for slush money outside its borders as well."
"When we have criminalised bribery here at home, when our own standard of living is no longer financed even in part by the profits of corruption, when we no longer sing the praises of our banking houses for making profits from the management of corruption and when we equip our investigating agencies with the wherewithal to chase after those who pay bribes – then will we be able to stand tall before our partners and bid them make the same contribution towards combating corruption."
"Mr President, Mr van den Berg’s report certainly gets my backing."
"Corruption prevents aid from being as effective as it might be, so it is desirable that it should continue to be tackled, and this report offers concrete and rational instruments for reinforcing the machinery of control, resulting in an improved legal framework for combating corruption."
"The legal framework is not, however, the only factor."
"Rejection of corruption as a social phenomenon has just as much to do with the values that prevail in a society."
"It is, then, civil society organisations, and religious leaders in particular, who need to be challenged as to their role in promoting good governance and in fighting corruption."
"What is needed is for this debate to become more than merely theoretical."
"In any case, both countries and aid organisations that give aid must be able to have confidence that their money is being used efficiently and for its intended purpose."
"An expert whose opinion I sought about the van den Berg report told me, the day before yesterday, that it was an outstanding one, and that he hoped the Dutch Government would adopt it without amendment."
"I could give Mr van den Berg no better compliment."
"Mr President, the World Bank estimates that USD 1 billion is spent each year on bribes throughout the world."
"The African Union estimates that corruption costs the African economy over 25% of its GDP on an annual basis."
"When debating corruption in developing countries, however, we should not forget about the shameful practice, used until recently by countries such as the United States, Denmark or Germany, of allowing companies to use bribes and then permitting these sums to be listed as tax deductible expenses."
"This practice was also used in Central and Eastern European countries, including Poland."
"Corruption is a serious threat to development."
"In order to understand the problem and to find an effective solution, it is imperative to take decisive action, such as creating a black list which would prevent banks providing funding, in the form of loans, to corrupt governments or their representatives."
"Mr President, last night the word ‘corruption’ was mentioned several times in our debate on World Health Day 2006."
"This morning we are debating the scale and extent of it."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report."
"Some Members have mentioned the global problem of corruption."
"I think we are deluding ourselves if we say that it is just a problem for the developing world."
"I would suggest that they have learned from the developed world: much to our shame, we have taught them some tricks."
"We therefore owe it to them and to ourselves to clean up our own act."
"I would support my colleague, Mr Ryan, who said that the banks and the financial institutions need to be looked at in this entire process, because if there were no home to put the money into perhaps they might not be so corrupt."
"This morning I spoke to some aid agencies that have long experience in this area."
"Their key message to us is that we must build up the capacity within the systems and the civil service of the developing world, and then build that into all our aid programmes."
"They also said that this is a long-term process and we will not get results overnight."
"I think a big part of our crackdown on the corrupt is to take them out within the developed world first and then perhaps assist the rooting-out of corruption in the developing world."
"Whatever we do, we must not penalise those who most need our aid, money and assistance."
"I always feel when we talk about tackling corruption that it is they who will again suffer."
"That is the one message."
"Let us build it into our programmes, but let us ensure that we keep up our aid work, that it gets to the right people and that they do not suffer."
"Mr President, in his opening remarks Mr van den Berg – and indeed others – picked up on the huge amounts of money we are talking about."
"In this Parliament we have to be realistic about what we can do."
"The report looks at some of the aspects where we can make a difference."
"I would like to concentrate on the role of parliaments."
"The European Parliament has well-established links with parliaments in many of the countries around the world, the countries with which we are concerned. Sometimes parliaments are the problem."
"I accept that."
"But in others, as the previous speaker has mentioned, national parliaments can be excluded; they can be bypassed in the process and corrupt officials can get hold of the aid without the involvement of government."
"Therefore, I believe we should do more to support democratically elected governments and help them to reinforce the mechanisms in their countries for distributing the aid and making sure that the money donated is widely used."
"Mr Ryan referred to a very interesting point in the report: that there is evidence that corruption falls as the proportion of parliamentary seats held by women rises."
"We can encourage that."
"We can do more in democracies to make sure that more and more women are elected."
"I was very proud to be part of the European Parliament’s delegation to Afghanistan to support their first parliamentary elections."
"There we saw women voting to elect other women."
"The more we can do to help women and parliaments to develop, the better."
"Corruption is the by-product of a weak system of government, but also arises from the absence of definite values."
"It is therefore of great practical importance that a society should possess an ethical framework and good practices in order to solve this problem."
"Weak moral principles promote both self-serving transactions and the concealment of those transactions."
"Those who provide aid are tempted to believe that their money is used for the correct purpose."
"Those who receive aid often succeed in making us believe that is the case."
"The corruption that accompanies the granting of aid is especially drastic because the actual people who are in distress suffer doubly."
"They not only lose the material assistance they should have received, but they are also robbed of the hope to improve their lives and of the hope for solidarity."
"Therefore it is our obligation to consistently expose and, even more importantly, prevent corruption and the gullibility that accompanies it."
"It is the opinion of the Court of Auditors that the European Commission’s aid programmes do not sufficiently take into consideration the risks of corruption."
"I would like to offer two examples."
"Firstly, European Union aid to the Palestinian Self-Government."
"Today we must admit that one of the main reasons the extremist Hamas movement came to power was the previous administration’s deeply rooted corruption."
"Secondly, the Commission sends humanitarian aid to Chechnya."
"What has been done to determine whether those funds actually reach the local inhabitants who suffer from official corruption?"
"Finally, I would like to emphasise a couple of important points in this very good report."
"Member States must ratify the UN anti-corruption convention."
"Secondly, budget support should only be provided to governments which are clearly striving to raise standards for the administration of public finances."
"I am glad the representative supports that course."
"A certain percentage of the aid granted should be allocated to supporting organisations that monitor civil society."
"And last of all, the main problem, which is to put pressure on countries housing financial centres to freeze and repatriate illegal funds deposited there by corrupt rulers."
"This is a very difficult requirement, but its implementation is a test that will demonstrate whether or not we are serious about preventing corruption."
"– Mr President, the fight against corruption is indeed a fight for peace and democracy, a fight against poverty and a fight to consolidate civil society in developing countries; relations between democracy and economic development in the developing countries have proven this and Amartya Sen, an important intellectual and winner of the Nobel prize in economic sciences, has confirmed it in his work better than anyone else."
"It is truly amazing that, often both in the international community and in the European Union, the question of combating corruption has been a taboo."
"That is because political expediencies, the Member States' interest in exerting their influence and international customer relations were more important."
"The implementation of the Millennium Development Goals has been assessed as a failure."
"However, no one spoke about what the role of corruption was in that failure."
"I believe that the international community should set a new development goal: democratic governance and combating corruption."
"To close, I should like to add that the European Union, and especially the European Commission, must lay down strict conditionality mechanisms in the new development strategy formulated for Africa."
"The European Union needs to collaborate with the UN, with international financing organisations and with non-governmental organisations, so that we can jointly combat this phenomenon, by putting the emphasis on consolidating civil society and independent media."
"Mr President, according to World Bank estimates, USD 1 billion is spent each year on bribes."
"Imagine how many excellent initiatives could be funded with that amount of money."
"Every year USD 1 billion could be spent and used to help those who really need aid."
"Corruption restricts the access of the poor to goods."
"It decreases the effectiveness of public services and, most of all, leads citizens to lose confidence in centres of power."
"The European Union, as the largest donor of aid to developing countries, should play a particularly active role in ensuring the transparency of aid programmes funded from the Community budget."
"It is therefore not enough to create an international ‘black list’ of corrupt governments."
"Politicians, civil servants, NGOs, international corporations and the media should all become involved in the fight against corruption."
"It is only by coordinating the activities of international donors that aid can be spent more effectively, thus preventing misspending or the appropriation of aid money by corrupt civil servants."
"This is why the report drafted by Mr Van den Berg is so important and so timely."
"I would like to congratulate him on an excellent text."
". Mr President, I welcome the debate that we have had here today."
"I think it is important to underline that the problem of fraud can never be considered as solved."
"Constant vigilance at all levels and in all circumstances is needed in the high-risk field of external actions."
"These actions are carried out in poorly governed States, where countervailing powers and capacities at the level of civil society are lacking."
"As corruption cannot be isolated within the governance agenda, the Commission’s approach in preventing and fighting it is twofold."
"It consists of mainstreaming good governance practices in all EU-funded programmes and projects on the one hand, and in the implementation of specific programme interventions on the other hand."
"Country strategy papers and national indicative programmes between the European Union and beneficiary countries generally include specific interventions in the fields of rule of law, democratisation, public administration reform, public finance management and reinforcement of civil society."
"I shall now make a few comments on some of the questions that have been raised today."
"On the discussion on companies, we must make sure that companies do not benefit from corruption."
"We must do the best we can."
"We can exclude companies from participation in our tenders if they have been found guilty of fraud or corruption."
"We can also suspend a project that has been financed if we discover fraud or corruption at some stage."
"We once used that option on a project in Zimbabwe."
"On support for national parliaments, the Commission sees the strengthening of the national parliaments’ supervisory role as an important means of trying to improve the overall effectiveness and impact of our development effort in these countries."
"For instance, through the EDF and the budget line for South Africa, the capacities of national parliaments of some 11 ACP countries have been strengthened to a total amount of EUR 35 million since 2000."
"On the subject of watchdogs, it is true that we work with private sector organisations."
"We would be worse off if we did not have these watchdogs."
"Several Members raised the issue of transparency, and it is a key issue."
"That is why we support several programmes in the field of budget supervisory functions."
"The promotion of efficient and transparent budgeting and public spending is at the heart of our budget support programmes."
"Finally, through its permanent dialogue with the partner governments and the various regions, the Commission encourages the broadest possible participation of institutions at various levels, particularly at parliamentary level."
"I have noted the view on the positive influence of the participation of women."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly, at 12 noon."
"Mr President, I note that we finished 20 minutes early today."
"Perhaps I could make the suggestion that in future the President be given, or have at his disposal, the option to continue the debate on a catch-the-eye basis if we finish so early, so that we can make more efficient use of Parliament’s time."
"I will be happy to pass on the suggestion you just made."
"That could indeed be an efficient way of using our working time."
"The next item is voting time."
". Mr President, yesterday, in the light of a unilateral declaration put on the record by the Commission during Tuesday night’s plenary debate on the regulation on certain fluorinated gases, the text of which was not introduced during conciliation and which compromises the spirit of the conciliation agreement and shows great disrespect and disregard for the clear will of Parliament and Council, I requested a postponement of the vote on the two reports on fluorinated gases, at least until today, to allow time to explore with colleagues in all political groups the serious implications for us as legislators of what we consider to have been an abuse of Parliament because of an internal turf war between two DGs within the Commission."
"The Commission’s role as Guardian of the Treaty and initiator of legislation is fully respected by this House and does not need to be constantly reiterated."
"Likewise, we as legislators demand full respect from all sections and services within the Commission for our role."
"Hours spent discussing better regulation and relations between the Commission and the European Parliament come to nothing if they are disregarded in this House by the Commission and Commission spokespersons."
"I would like to put on record a letter written yesterday by Professor Trakatellis, Chairman of the Conciliation Committee, and by me as rapporteur to President Barroso:"
"‘We are writing to express our disappointment about the content of the Declaration on the final text of the Fluorinated Gas Regulation made unilaterally by the Commission in the course of the European Parliament plenary session of 4 April 2006."
"‘As you are aware, the Regulation is an important step towards the achievement of the objectives set out in the Kyoto Protocol and in line with the European Climate Change Action Programme."
"We fear that the Commission’s Declaration was an attempt to compromise the difficult political agreement reached between the European Parliament and Council and with the support of the Commission."
"‘On 31 January both the European Parliament and the Council demonstrated a clear will to find a political solution to the problem of national measures, already adopted by some Member States, to reduce F-gas emissions."
"The Declaration was made at the last minute and cannot be considered a positive step in the process of adoption of Community legislation."
"We sincerely hope that the Commission will consider carefully its next steps, not only from a purely legal point of view, but also in accordance with the spirit of the agreement reached in Conciliation.’"
"The letter is signed by my colleague Professor Trakatellis and me."
"I was assured personally last night by Commissioner Verheugen, the Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry and Vice-President of the Commission, that – and I quote him with his permission: ‘If the new regulation enters into force, I will propose to the Commission to withdraw the infringement procedures against Austria and Denmark.’"
"In good faith, I would request Commissioner Kyprianou, who is in the House today representing the Commission, to respond on behalf of the Commission to the serious concerns that have been generated by the text of Tuesday night’s declaration."
"– As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important matter."
"We are now awaiting a statement from the Commission – that is to say, from Commissioner Kyprianou – and then we can decide how to proceed."
". Mr President, I note the points raised by Mrs Doyle."
"On behalf of the Commission, I would like to reassure the House that the Commission undertakes to evaluate the pending infringement procedures with regard to the use of f-gases in Denmark and Austria, taking into account the spirit in which the final agreement was reached during conciliation."
"This vote can therefore take place today."
"As I see that the rapporteur is happy with the statements by Commissioners Verheugen and Kyprianou, we can now proceed to the vote."
"We now come to the elections in Belarus, or White Russia."
"With the House’s permission, I beg leave to extend a warm welcome to the candidate who took part in this election and fought for democracy in Belarus, Mr Milinkevich, who is seated in the gallery. A very warm welcome to you!"
"As you can see, Mr Milinkevich, we all, from whatever party, want to see democracy in our Belarussian neighbour, and that is what we wish for it."
"We wish you all the best at home."
"There was an agreement on Tuesday night by all the political groups to change one word in paragraph 8 from ‘integration’ to ‘perspective’, which brings it into line with the ENP Report, for which I was the rapporteur, and with Mr Brok’s report on enlargement."
"Mysteriously, the sessional services, not realising perhaps the sensitivity of this, decided of their own volition to put the word ‘aspirations’ instead, without any consultation with the political groups."
"Can we amend the joint text to the agreed word ‘perspective’?"
"Mr President, I will be very brief."
"We have just adopted resolutions on the elections in Belarus and Ukraine."
"I think that our Parliament should include on its agenda a resolution on the presidential election in France, because the last election in 2002 led to pressure on public opinion and to violent demonstrations."
"That concludes the vote."
". Under the rules currently in force, residence permits issued by Switzerland and Liechtenstein cannot be recognised for the purposes of transit into, or short-term stay in, the Schengen area."
"This means that third-country nationals obliged to have a visa to enter Schengen territory, even though they have such a residence permit, must apply for a visa."
"Given the seasonal mobility of migrant workers and their families, especially at holiday periods – around half a million people from Switzerland in 2003 – consulates in some Member States are hugely overloaded, while these people themselves are faced with lengthy waits and burdensome formalities."
"I therefore support the creation of a simplified regime for the transit of these people, firstly, because they do not present any risk of illegal immigration or threat to security, as they were subject to control by the Swiss and Liechtenstein authorities when the residence permits were authorised."
"I also support it on the grounds of reciprocity, given that since 2000 there has been similar exemption by these countries for holders of residence permits issued by EU Member States."
". I wish, by means of this statement of vote, to give my support to this proposal, which I believe makes it possible to bring about a substantial improvement in this process."
"The consequence of the current situation is that there is an enormous amount of work to be done by the Member States’ consulates in Switzerland and in Liechtenstein, and costs are incurred by third-country nationals."
"This is an unsatisfactory state of affairs and must be changed."
"When issuing residence permits, both Switzerland and Liechtenstein carry out exact examinations and inquiries, paying careful attention to security."
"I would also like to point out that both Switzerland and Liechtenstein apply in every case the same high-quality security standards as the other States, which belong to the EU."
"It is important to me that this statement of vote should be supportive of Switzerland and of those in it who are working towards its accession to the European Union."
"Were Switzerland to join the EU, that would be something I would very much welcome, since Switzerland is a byword for high standards and has distinguished itself, , by a transport policy that many Member States should take as an example of how these things are to be done."
"We observe that those countries that have robust animal protection legislation in order to guarantee good conditions for animals, to reduce the risk of infection spreading and thus also to reduce the risk of damage to people’s health have not been hit by reduced sales of chicken meat."
"We wish therefore, in the situation that has arisen, to emphasise the need to strengthen animal protection and food safety so that food producers will legitimately be able to earn the confidence of consumers."
"The EU should therefore take action to bring about this state of affairs."
"We do not, however, wish, in this emergency situation, to bring about a scenario in which, for fear of being hit financially, breeders hide infection or otherwise increase the risk of infection spreading."
"In the situation that has arisen we are, therefore, in favour of its being possible to provide financial compensation to affected breeders."
". We are disappointed at the rejection of our proposals, which advocated that all Community financing for compensating market measures should be set at 100%, as was the case for swine fever and BSE, given the seriousness of the socio-economic situation in some countries and the difficulty of guaranteeing cofinancing."
"We did, however, vote in favour of the amendments, because they propose support for producers and, although they propose 50% Community cofinancing for restrictions on free circulation that may arise from the implementation of measures aimed at fighting the spread of animal diseases, they do propose 100% Community funding for serious market disturbances directly related to a loss of consumer confidence in light of risks to public or animal health."
"Accordingly, a fundamental part of what we were proposing has been safeguarded, and we therefore expect the Commission and the Council to endorse Parliament's decision."
"We are voting against the European Parliament’s amendments."
"We believe that it is too early to adopt a position on how badly the poultry meat industry would be hit by an avian flu pandemic."
"It is typical of this Parliament that, as soon as something unexpected happens, there are calls for financial aid with a view to maintaining stocks, for financial compensation following the destruction of foodstuffs and for the funding of information campaigns designed to win back consumer confidence."
"We see no reason at this time for meeting these demands."
"For how long should the planned economy be allowed to continue within the food industry?"
"Consumers cannot manage without eating and, if they cannot eat poultry, other sectors of the food industry will benefit instead."
"We believe that the market is perfectly capable of adjusting to the current situation."
"The poultry sector will have less reason to take preventative measures if it is given promises of compensation in advance."
"– Mr President, speaking on behalf of the delegation of the Austrian People’s Party, I should like to make a statement of vote in relation to the Doyle report."
"The Austrian delegation's support for it is expressly subject to the condition enunciated by Mrs Doyle and given on the basis of Commissioner Kyprianou’s statement."
"We denounce in the strongest terms the unilateral statement made by the Commission once the compromise was reached between the Council and Parliament, and, in the light of the statements made today, we presume that, as a consequence of the new legislation, a halt will be called to the infringement proceedings against Denmark and Austria."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what I will say on the subject of the Doyle report is that it is very important to all of us that the Kyoto targets be achieved."
". I voted in favour of the Doyle report on the joint text for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases, as it establishes a legal framework for such gases with high emission levels, some of which are more harmful than CO2, and could remain in the atmosphere within 50 000 years."
"In order to meet the Kyoto objectives and to protect the environment, this regulation will guarantee recycling, the regeneration or destruction of equipment that uses fluorinated gases, and better information for European consumers on the global warming potential of these gases."
". The agreement reached in the Conciliation Committee is highly satisfactory and offers major improvements as regards gas emissions into the atmosphere."
"The double legal basis laid down is appropriate for this kind of regulation, as it allows certain Member States to maintain tighter environmental legislation without upsetting the balance of the internal market in Europe."
"Containing emissions and leaks strikes me as the right way of meeting the aim of reducing fluorinated gas emissions into the atmosphere."
"The obligation to report the certification of personnel responsible to the Commission every year and the policy of recovery for recycling or recovery of equipment are measures that I warmly welcome."
"I therefore agree with the decision taken by the Conciliation Committee."
"On behalf of the SPÖ delegation and as their representative on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I would like to state that Austria and Denmark have imposed overall bans on the utilisation of fluorinated greenhouse gases."
"This legislation must ensure the possibility of stricter regulations being retained."
"The draft produced by the Conciliation Committee provides that Member States may retain stricter national requirements until the end of 2012."
"This step is possible under Article 95(10) of the Treaty and ensures that Austria and Denmark can retain their stricter measures on a temporary basis."
"It also means that the scientific evidence pursuant to Article 94(4) need not be provided."
"Any restrictive interpretation of the safeguard clause must be rejected, since the Member States’ discretion must in no way be impaired."
". A new recycling facility opened in Cork in January."
"I passed it on Saturday evening and noticed an already impressive stack of refrigerators that had accumulated in less than ten weeks."
"These mountains of ageing refrigerators, and in warmer climates air conditioners, are rusting in every population centre in the EU."
"Strong fluorinated greenhouse gases legislation is long overdue to rectify the past and protect our climate into the future."
"I congratulate all parties in this process in reaching agreement to protect stricter laws in countries like Denmark, and in issues of labelling."
"Though I note that the Commission had second thoughts, I feel we must hold it to its word."
"I look forward to the day when the EU will be compliant with its Kyoto obligation on f-gases."
". The agreement reached in the Conciliation Committee is a satisfactory one and offers significant improvements as regards gas emissions into the atmosphere."
"Restricting the use of HFC-134a and other gases with high greenhouse effect in new vehicles launched onto the market since 2011 and the extension to cover all vehicles as from 2017 are measures that will bring about a significant reduction in emissions."
"As the alternatives to this gas are still at the development stage, the permission to use HFC-152a is appropriate, on the proviso that this is part of a gradual elimination."
"I therefore agree with the decision taken by the Conciliation Committee."
"– Mr President, again and again, we are shocked by reports of tragedies involving refugees and by the accounts given by the victims of unscrupulous gangs of traffickers."
"Many people have nothing left to lose other than their lives, and even those they very often lose as they journey towards the Europe that they regard as a land of milk and honey."
"Even if they reach their destination, they are obliged to work endlessly to pay off their debts to the traffickers, under intolerable conditions, and as, among other things, prostitutes."
"The only way we will break this vicious circle is by a restrictive common immigration policy."
"For that, we do of course still need refugee camps outside Europe, since our own camps in Europe are often full to overflowing, with serious violence breaking out between inmates of different cultures."
"For that reason among others, and also in order to rob refugees of the illusion that they can enter the EU illegally, I have voted against this resolution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is certainly a positive development that Parliament has given its verdict on the subject of Malta’s immigration centres and, what is more, only a few days after the visit by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, in which I was able to take part as a delegate."
"The resolution adopted, which is the product of the invaluable contribution of all the groups, exposes the seriousness of the situation for the refugees living in inhuman conditions, with virtually no basic sanitation or personal care."
"The resolution, however, makes it quite clear that Europe is highly responsible for what happens in Malta."
"It goes without saying that the delegation’s visits to reception centres throughout Europe are not intended for the purposes of rating centres as good or bad."
"However, the situation in Malta, although a far cry from that of Lampedusa in terms of the occupants’ living conditions, does call to mind that Italian island in terms of its size and reception capacity."
"I therefore urge the Council to adopt a clear and strong position so that, in line, of course, with the principle of solidarity, we arrive as quickly as possible at a common and fair immigration policy aimed at preventing the costs of these waves of illegal immigrants from burdening only the budgets of a few States on the periphery of southern Europe, which are totally unable to support themselves financially."
"The June List is opposed to a single common European policy on asylum and refugees."
"We do not therefore believe that this is an issue for the European Parliament."
"We believe that the Member States themselves should be free to decide what forms their immigration and asylum policies should take, as long as they are in accordance with current international law."
"Human rights should not be infringed."
"We defend a humane policy on refugees and are opposed to asylum seekers being placed in detention camps."
"We are voting against the resolution in its entirety."
"The plenary discussion in the presence of Alexander Milinkevich has provided an expression of the European Parliament’s solidarity with the Belarus people in their struggle against totalitarianism, for freedom and a new tomorrow."
"In its resolution, the European Parliament speaks in no uncertain terms of the presidential elections having been manipulated."
"It sounds an alarm bell over the dictator’s armed suppression of a peaceful demonstration by the Belarus people."
"These people have stopped being afraid, even though they do not know what awaits them."
"The European Parliament’s attention is focused on the arrested opposition leaders and we are demanding their immediate release."
"The resolution acknowledges the immense enthusiasm of the young people who have now been thrown out of universities."
"It is these young people who need a helping hand, as they will be shaping the future of their country."
"Slovakia has already joined those countries that have pledged to help such students, and they will now be able to complete their studies in Slovakia."
"In voting for this resolution, it was my wish also to focus attention on the need for new elections in Belarus as soon as possible."
"Although Lukashenko has won the elections by rigging the vote, he has not beaten his opponents."
"The isolation of Lukashenko as a person will lead to his defeat."
"In conclusion, I would like to express my conviction that the request I made in the plenary of the European Parliament – that we should light a candle at 4 p.m. on the 16th day of every month in a show of solidarity with the Belarus people – will be heeded, and that everybody will be happy to do this."
"I believe that the flame of solidarity will never be extinguished in the European Parliament."
"Mr President, point 2 of the resolution required us to vote on two separate issues."
"I had no problem adopting and supporting the first, but the second was problematic and I abstained."
"In my opinion, the Belarus elections were not free, but the results were not falsified."
"On the other hand, the US presidential elections that preceded this – that is, not the most recent ones but the ones before – were free, but in that case the results were falsified."
"Parliament took no stand on that."
"I hope that Parliament will also take a stand on the presidential elections in the oil-producing countries of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, and other countries which are not free and where the results have been falsified."
"Ukraine had an Orange Revolution but life there remained grey."
"Moscow had a White Revolution and the result is clear to see: a fall of 10 years in life expectancy, a declining population, crime, destruction of the healthcare systems and pillaging of the country's assets for the benefit of the oligarchs."
"Just one more push and the crimes of liberalism will equal the crimes of communism."
"We must not deprive Belarus of all the delights generated by the market."
"Belarusians too are entitled to the freedom of the media/military/political oligarchy, with its entourage of unemployment, passive euthanasia of the elderly, cultural degradation, economic stagnation, brutal individualism and social isolation."
"It is quite understandable that the European Parliament is delighted with the media-political democracy of the magnates Messrs Berlusconi, Bouygues, Lagardère and Murdoch."
"Belarus too has a right to national liberal destitution and to degenerate, media-led democracy."
". I represented my group in the negotiations on the compromise resolution on Belarus."
"My advice to co-sign this resolution was not taken up in the end, and nor, in my opinion, was the wording of some sections of it ideal."
"It remains of the essence, though, that the re-election of President Lukashenko, brought about by intimidation and deception, should not be recognised by the outside world; that opposition movements and publications deserve external support and that students who flee the country must be offered the option of studying in their own language."
"I have upheld that position in this House before, as I have in demonstrations outside it."
"Unfortunately, my group appears unable to give its unanimous backing to a resolution to this effect."
"Those opposed to this resolution are probably right for the time being when they say that workers and retired people in Belarus enjoy a higher level of social security than do their counterparts in any other former Soviet republics."
"That will only be the case, though, for as long as Russia thinks it can absorb that country by supplying it with cheap oil."
"This social security does not justify dictatorships or election frauds."
"My party, the Socialist Party, detests dictatorship."
"Socialism only has a future as a democratic movement, in open competition with other opinions, and certainly not as a dictatorship."
"I stand by my support for the resolution."
". – The Kommounistiko Komma Elladas is voting against the joint motion for a resolution by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and expresses its solidarity with the people of Belarus."
"It is blatant intervention in the internal affairs of an independent country, it infringes every concept of international law and it is equivalent to a declaration of war against a people standing up against imperialist barbarity."
"The European Parliament, elected by 30% of the citizens of the ΕU, is trying to give lessons in democracy to a people of whom 93% participated in the elections and 80% of whom elected the President."
"The European Council is prohibiting entry to the elected President Lukashenko, the European Parliament is taking under its wing and lavishly financing Milinkevich, who is making out that he represents the people but who, despite the bundle of money which he received, mustered up a 'surprising' 6% in the elections and 2 000 paid 'demonstrators' in the 'impressive demonstrations'."
"The rabid reactions of the political representatives of imperialism are understandable, because abundant financing and interventions failed to create 'orange', 'pink' or 'green and yellow revolutions'."
"Following the proud response of the people of Belarus, they are trying with terrorism, slander and fascist-type sanctions to isolate the country and its people."
"The workers and the grass-roots movement need to condemn the imperialist plans and stand side by side in their struggle and their right to decide on their future and choose their own destiny."
"The Left Party’s delegation to the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left firmly repudiates the Lukashenko regime and its crimes in violation of democratic and human rights."
"We believe that the presidential election in Belarus infringed a number of fundamental principles underpinning democratic and fair elections."
"We are therefore voting in favour of the resolution."
"That does not mean that we support every single bit of wording in the resolution."
"What, however, is crucial to us is to protest against the infringements of democratic and human rights in Belarus."
". Mr President, the situation in Belarus becomes graver by the day, and we must continue to keep a close eye on developments there."
"While it is the sovereign right of countries to run themselves as they see fit, that presupposes that there is a fair and free society, and in Belarus this is clearly not the case."
"It is fitting that today we express our concern and continued support for democracy and dialogue in Belarus, and we must consider stronger action in the future if the repression continues."
"The parliamentary elections in Ukraine have become a major milestone following the consolidation that began with the Orange Revolution."
"During the elections, the Ukrainians have shown that they cherish the freedom they gained in taking to the streets."
"They clearly confirmed their desire to become part of the European Union, on the basis of sharing its fundamental principles and criteria."
"It is commendable that the European Parliament has not confined itself to merely supporting the Orange Revolution but that it is also constantly monitoring developments in Ukraine through its observers."
"Parliamentary democracy must not be taken for granted."
"It must be gradually established and must be looked after."
"As an immediate neighbour, Slovakia has a vested interest in Ukraine’s success."
"Slovakia will be helping Ukraine to get to where it belongs, that is, within the fold of EU Member States."
"Naturally, this will not happen overnight, and the European Union should therefore offer a form of partnership that would develop Ukraine’s European perspective."
"The joint resolution demonstrates that the European Parliament is politically mature, capable of reaching political agreement based on a broad consensus, and sending a clear signal to the Ukrainian people."
"I have therefore voted in favour of the resolution."
". I will vote for this resolution."
"On Boxing Day 2004 I was in Kiev as one of Parliament’s observers for the re-run presidential elections that saw the Orange revolution sweep all before it."
"But its promise has not been properly fulfilled as former allies fall out and corruption is found within the ranks of those promising to sweep it away."
"I can only hope that these new elections teach all of Ukraine’s politicians the lessons that must be learnt if Ukraine is to join Europe’s democratic nations in going forward in partnership."
"– It insultingly disdains and does not recognise the results of the elections in Belarus, but considers 'democratic' the elections in Ukraine, which were held in a climate of violence and forgery, targeted specifically at the communist party of Ukraine."
"The 'international observers' and the representatives of the EU and imperialism failed to see the murders of two communist party cadres, the attacks on its offices, the writing off of 200 000 voters in the Lugansk region who did not vote and the forgeries in the Crimea."
"Of course, this was not because the reports on the 'validity and democracy of the elections' were written before the elections."
"The ΕU and the European Parliament consider countries subjugated to imperialism and occupying governments, such as Iraq and Afghanistan, and the political forces that sell off the interests of their workers and countries to capital to be democratic."
"That is why they welcome the results in Ukraine, even if their chosen representative went under."
"'Operation democracy' being promoted by the USA and the EU through their transnational and international organisations is basically the imposition of capitalism and the attaching of countries to the imperialist chariot."
"The political forces which support, consent to and tolerate this policy are complicit and jointly responsible towards the people."
". Mr President, the Orange Revolution was a time of so much hope, yet it is clear that the transition to a functioning democracy remains a painful one for Ukraine."
"We in this House must play our part, as we did in the Orange Revolution itself, though today we must continue to support the forces of progress and democracy within the Ukraine."
"The EU is in the best position to play honest broker, adviser and even friend to the Ukrainians; we must continue our engagement with this process and I am pleased to support this resolution today."
". This resolution raises the very serious problem that the developed world is siphoning off the educated elites of the developing world, particularly in the medical sector."
"Indeed, we are witnessing an absolutely appalling situation."
"In my country, France, a lack of foresight as to the healthcare needs of an ageing population, uninspiring career prospects and the application of the 35-hour week in public hospitals have led to a major shortage of staff."
"But a continues to limit access to these professions, and we recruit doctors and nurses from abroad."
"At the same time, people in the developing countries do not have access to healthcare, and we spend large amounts of money on sending humanitarian missions, often to restricted areas."
"It is completely crazy, particularly given that access to healthcare is now one of the reasons for mass illegal immigration: the French island of Mayotte, which is being overwhelmed, is a perfect example of this."
"I should like to take this opportunity to denounce the immigration law 'chosen' by Mr Sarkozy, which will organise this siphoning off of elites on a grand scale, further compromising the development of the countries from which these elites come, and automatically aggravating emigration, while a bankrupt education system has given up on training a generation condemned to unemployment or dead-end jobs."
"The global fight against diseases and poverty is a very important issue demanding large-scale international commitment."
"We are, however, of the view that the issue should not be handled within the framework of EU cooperation."
"We believe that the fight against ill health should be conducted by individual EU Member States and within the framework of the World Health Organisation (WHO)."
"The June List seeks limited EU cooperation within this area and would prefer to see aid policy renationalised."
"We are also opposed to the EU having influence on, and extending its powers in relation to, issues already dealt with by other international organisations."
"We are therefore voting against this resolution."
"The report discusses a crucial issue in relation to EU aid, namely its ineffectiveness."
"The June List’s position is that aid should not be provided by the EU but by each Member State."
"Just as the rapporteur points out, EU aid is ineffective."
"At the same time as relatively large amounts are invested in conducting a development policy organised by the EU, new EU barriers to trade are added to existing ones, making it impossible for the world’s poor countries to enter the EU market with their products."
"Moreover, the EU’s common policy on trade and agriculture is very harmful because, with its duties and subsidies, it renders developing countries’ agricultural products uncompetitive."
"If the report had been about aid at Member State level, we should naturally have voted in favour of it, because inefficiency and corruption are two great obstacles to constructive and effective development cooperation."
"What, however, we are concerned with in this case is aid organised by the EU, which is why we have voted against the report in its entirety."
". I welcome this report on aid effectiveness and corruption in developing countries."
"Corruption is a by-product of weak governance."
"As corruption often involves an important role for the state, it is sometimes defined as the abuse of public power for private benefit."
"Weak institutions and administrations with limited accountability often allow for the misuse of public goods by politicians or public officials."
"I believe that increasing the role of parliaments is vital to the advancement of reforms in public finance management and that there should be instituting or reinforcing mechanisms within parliament for bringing government to account."
". Mr President, I would add my voice of congratulation to our Rapporteur on this report, which deals with an issue that is crucial to the aid agenda, yet it is often glossed over."
"The extent to which aid and development funding, so well meant, encourages corruption is often very disturbing, and to ensure value for money for our taxpayers and the citizens of the recipient countries, we must continue to look into this."
"I wholeheartedly endorse the recommendations in this report and am happy to support it today."
"That concludes the statements of vote."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in the South-East of Turkey."
". Mr President, the Commission is concerned about the events occurring in the south-east of Turkey and about the outbursts of violence and terrorist attacks that have spread to other cities in the country."
"We are closely following the situation."
"According to the information available to the Commission, an outburst of violence started on 28 March, in the south-eastern city of Diyarbakir following the funeral of PKK members."
"May I remind honourable Members that the PKK is included in the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations."
"The first victims were reported on 29 March in Diyarbakir and other fatalities were reported in the following days throughout the region."
"Over the weekend, riots also spread to Istanbul, where a Molotov cocktail was thrown into a crowded city bus."
"Three civilians were killed."
"Since then other fatalities have been reported, including among the security forces."
"Let me be clear, the European Union unequivocally condemns terrorism."
"The PKK is a terrorist organisation."
"We are deeply concerned about its recent activities in Turkey."
"We feel that we are victims of these terrorist acts."
"But at the same time, we deeply deplore human casualties and call on the Turkish authorities to shed light on those events, through a comprehensive investigation, and to make sure that the security forces show the necessary strength in face of the demonstrators."
"The people in the south-east of Turkey do not need violence and confrontation; they need peace, stability and prosperity."
"We urge the Turkish Government to address in a comprehensive manner – and not only from the security point of view – the problems of this region and of its people, who are for the most part of Kurdish origin."
"The Turkish Government should take action with a view to enhancing and ensuring economic, social and cultural opportunities for all Turkish citizens."
"In this respect, we look forward to the follow-up of Prime Minister Erdogan’s speech in August 2005."
"The Commission recalls and stresses that under the Copenhagen political criteria, Turkey must ensure cultural diversity and promote the cultural rights of all its citizens as set out in the revised Accession Partnership adopted by the Council in January 2006."
"It is also important that Turkey facilitates the return of internally displaced people to their original settlements, ensures fair compensation for those who have suffered loss and damage as a result of the security situation, and addresses the abolition of the village guard system."
"We will continue to monitor the situation in the south-east."
"We will raise these issues with the Turkish authorities as part of our regular monitoring of the political criteria."
"I am looking forward to a very interesting debate."
". Mr President, the situation we are discussing here this afternoon is tragic, because recent events have been very bad for Turkey and for the Kurdish citizens of Turkey."
"Let us be clear, the PPK is a terrorist organisation and there is never an excuse for terrorism."
"I am saying as a parliamentarian that the national parliament of the Netherlands fought hard to get the PKK on the terrorist list."
"There can never be an excuse."
"However, at the same time, we must ask ourselves whether all the people who are protesting really support violence."
"Many analysts have drawn a completely different conclusion."
"They say that most Kurdish people do not want violence, they just want to have a prosperous future – with economic, social and cultural developments – within the state of Turkey."
"Now, more than ever, we need to invest in those people."
"In Parliament’s report adopted at the end of 2004, we pressed for the development of the south east and for more cultural rights for the Kurdish people."
"It must be said that Prime Minister Erdogan has made impressive speeches since that time."
"However, at this difficult time these words must be followed more than ever by deeds."
"We must invest socially and economically so that people and their families have a prosperous future, so that they do not want violence for their children."
"We have to invest in more cultural freedom."
"If Turkish television and radio provided more air time for Kurdish programmes, then Roj TV in Denmark will not be that important any more."
"Indeed, the village guard system should be abolished and displaced people should be helped to return to their home regions."
"Now is the time for wisdom instead of big words."
"It is time the Turkish Government tried to find interlocutors who are modest and want peace."
"I name Mr Baydemir and Mr Türk, the co-leader of the DTP."
"These people must continue to speak out against violence; but if they continue to do so, let the Turkish Government cooperate with them instead of a Minister of the Interior threatening to bring them to justice."
"I think cooperation is the way; wisdom is the way."
"Let us ensure that Kurdish citizens feel at home in one Turkish state."
"That is the only solution."
"."
"Mr President, Turkey is close to the heart of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and so it is heartrending to see that country plagued by violence."
"The PSE Group is calling for an end to the escalation of violence, and we welcome Prime Minister Erdogan’s indication of his intention to turn the tide of violence by bringing about more democratic and economic reforms."
"By doing this, he has extended a hand to the Kurdish community, which, though, has yet to accept this gesture."
"The PSE Group would also draw your attention to the appeal made by the Mayor of Diyarbakir to those Kurds who use violence, to abandon this strategy, because my group emphatically denounces excessive violence."
"If the violence stops, the tanks can, and indeed must, leave the streets of the towns and villages in the south-east."
"Tanks in the streets are not what people in Europe want to see when they consider the possibility of Turkey joining the European Union."
"I would like to stress that everyone in Turkey, including the Kurds, stands to benefit if Turkey’s progress down the road to EU membership is uninterrupted."
"Indeed, the protection of, and respect for, human rights of everyone in Turkey is a for EU membership."
"We must not allow agitators to sabotage the negotiations before they have got well and truly underway."
"It is unfortunate that the current violence interrupts a period of , because some progress had already been made, for example, by the Turkish Government making Kurdish television possible."
"The agreements that were in place before the recent outbreak of violence must be further developed and, above all, implemented."
"That which has been committed to paper must be translated into reality."
"I should like to finish off with a few words for the victims, for it is right that they should be remembered and mourned."
"There must be no more of them."
"I urge you to turn this difficult moment in Turkey into an opportunity for renewed solidarity in that country, which is desperately needed on the long and difficult road to EU membership."
". Mr President, clearly there is an unholy alliance – though an unacknowledged and unintended alliance – between the Turkish security forces, the PKK and the European opponents of Turkey’s accession."
"They are all doing their bit in their own way to impede Turkey’s progress towards the European Union."
"The Turkish police and army are not serving the interests of the Turkish Government in their excessive use of force against protestors in Diyarbakir and other towns. The deep state is not under the democratic control of that government."
"The fact is the military has a vested interest in the prolongation of the violence, because that enhances its power, its importance and its resources."
"The PKK does employ terrorist methods, and it has no doubt provoked and stirred up some of the recent violence, but its aims of achieving recognition of the cultural, linguistic and political identity of the Kurdish people are shared by many Kurds who do not espouse violence."
"To that extent, the PKK are seen as freedom fighters."
"The challenge, one where the Turkish authorities are failing, is to separate the die-hard opponents of violence and those who want to pursue a democratic route to a political solution."
"A very hopeful development over the last few days has been the very moderate calls by people like Ahmed Türk and Osman Baydemir, the major of Diyarbakir, for an end to the violence and for political discussions."
"I somewhat regret that the Commission did not say anything about encouraging the Turkish Government to go down this route: not only of social and economic progress, which clearly is needed, not only of the recognition of linguistic and cultural rights, but of actually talking about political dialogue and a political solution in the Kurdish region in south-east Turkey in the construction of the Turkish State."
"The Commission seems to baulk at giving the Turkish Government that encouragement."
"We all need to rally round and encourage Prime Minister Erdogan to carry on where he seemed to start last August but where he has stalled, no doubt because of the army."
"We all need to help him get the political dialogue for a solution going."
". Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his speech."
"I would like to express, on behalf of my Group, our great concern about the situation in Turkey that we have seen in the media."
"Over the past week at least 15 people have lost their lives in clashes between demonstrators and Turkish security forces in the south-east and in terrorist attacks in Istanbul."
"We strongly condemn the disproportionate use of force by police forces in Diyarbakir and Kiziltepe."
"But at the same time, we vehemently denounce the provocations by the PKK, whose leaders deliberately stir up violence and riots."
"After three municipal buses in Istanbul were burnt without any casualties, two young sisters were killed on Sunday evening when a bus was attacked."
"The majority of the Kurds, who wish to build a decent life in the towns or to return to their villages, should not be hostage to cynical leadership associated with the military wing of the PKK which wants to escalate the conflict, as well as some people in the ‘deep state’ in Turkey."
"In the light of the recent events we have the feeling that some of our colleagues in the European Parliament were not telling the whole story in the e-mails that were circulated recently."
"They give the impression of a black and white situation in which no Turk wants to grant more rights to the Kurds and every Kurd is an oppressed victim."
"That is why I believe it is important that we draw attention to the debate that is currently going on in civil society in Turkey, amongst intellectuals of Turkish and Kurdish origin."
"Let me point out what they have said: first, Kurdish identity in Turkey must finally be officially recognised by the Turkish state; second, the policy for assimilating Kurds has been a complete failure; third, the Turkish state has to make sure that it gets back the trust of the Kurds and every citizen of Turkey; fourth, there cannot be any peaceful solution that insists that the PKK is the official negotiation partner of the state, because that will not happen."
"I finish by quoting a former mayor of Diyarbakir, who has just pointed out: ‘If we are going to have real peace here, the PKK has to adjust itself to the new world situation."
"The Turkish state is becoming more democratic."
"The PKK needs to do the same."
"It should give up the idea of armed struggle and open respectful dialogue with Kurds who think differently."
"It also needs to renovate its leadership."
"This organisation was formed with a Cold War mentality."
"It needs to evolve’."
"– Mr President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, and in particular of my colleague Mr Agnoletto, I would like to express my horror at the violent clashes in South-Eastern Turkey."
"For over a week, we have been seeing horrifying pictures, and getting horrifying reports, from a country with which the EU commenced accession negotiations in October 2005, to which, at that time, my group colleagues and I consented."
"Although, since commencing accession talks with the EU, the Turkish Government has initiated a reform process, it is not one that will be sufficient to resolve the country’s social and political problems and conflicts."
"Where these are concerned, there is one thing that should be clear to Turkey and to all of us, and that is that Turkey’s democratic deficits were and are closely tied up with the Kurdish question."
"For as long as Turkey tries to resolve this problem by military means, suppressing the civilian population and suppressing the free expression of opinions and ideas, there will be no peace in the land and hence no basis for a democratic state."
"The chasm running through its society must not be allowed to become even deeper, to the point of becoming unbridgeable."
"The Turkish Head of State, Mr Erdogan, has described the murders of women and children as necessary interventions to deal with the instruments of terrorism."
"To date, 15 people have lost their lives, including three children, the youngest of whom was aged only three."
"Of the 278 persons detained in Diyarbakir, 91 are under the age of 18."
"If the Turkish security forces continue to shoot at civilians in Diyarbakir, Batman, Mardin and in many other Kurdish cities, and if the death toll rises still higher, then this chasm will become wider and the prospect of a peaceful solution more distant."
"It is now high time for the Commission and the Council to use all the means at their disposal to bring pressure on Turkey to end the violence."
"The possibility needs to be discussed of the accession negotiations being suspended if the Turkish Government and the Turkish army continue to disregard democratic principles and violate human rights."
"I call for an delegation to be sent to Turkey to get to the bottom of what is going on there."
"I appeal to all those involved in the conflict to cease forthwith from violence, and I call on the Turkish Government to accept the Kurds’ lawfully elected representatives as negotiating partners and to drop the latest charges against them."
"It cannot – it must not – be tolerated any longer that 20 million Kurds should be denied their political and cultural rights and a say in how their society is shaped."
"– Mr President, it is with regret that we observe the outbreaks of violence in south-east Turkey and with disgust that we see soldiers and innocent civilians being murdered in Turkey."
"Nonetheless, this must not lead us to conclude that this is the only problem in Turkey: there is a major problem in connection with the rights of Kurds, which is something we should not sweep under the carpet in today's debate."
"Turkey has chosen its prospects."
"It has chosen European prospects and, thanks to these prospects, we have seen some progress over recent years on the question of the human rights of the Kurds, whose existence was barely recognised a few years ago."
"However, Turkey must continue on this course."
"The recent uncontrolled interventions by the army must not deprive the Kurds of the rights which they must have if Turkey is to become a member of the European Union, by which I mean the rights enjoyed by the citizens of European states."
"Prime Minister Erdogan announced recently that Turkey would not step away from its objective of democracy and development and that it would introduce greater freedoms, more democracy, social assistance, rights and justice."
"This announcement is all well and good, but it needs to be more than just an announcement; it needs to be put into practice."
"Measures are needed on three levels: firstly rights are needed; secondly, economic and social policy is needed and, thirdly, the army, which has uncontrolled powers, needs to be restricted."
"If these measures are introduced, Turkey will have taken its European prospects seriously and if Turkey honours its commitments in both this area and in all the other areas stipulated by the European Union, this will be to the benefit both of the Kurds and of all the citizens of Turkey."
"Turkey should not therefore hesitate: Mr Erdogan's words must go hand in hand with action from now on."
"– Mr President, we are extremely concerned about the revival of violence and the acts of terrorism by the Turkish army and the PKK."
"I believe that the message to come out of our debate today must be a message of condemnation of the acts of terrorism against innocent civilians in Istanbul and other towns and of the military violence by the Turkish forces of repression against the Kurdish population."
"The powers pushing for war and for the army to stay in power at all costs are responsible for the situation in south-east Turkey."
"The powers that be and the army in Turkey find in the action of the PKK a convenient pretext for continuing to intervene in political life and trying to define the terms of the resolution to the Kurdish problem."
"On the other hand, the PKK is taking advantage of the serious economic and social problems of under-development and poverty to feed with its actions the cycle of violence and bloodshed."
"It is a fact, and it would be a political mistake for us to underestimate it, that Turkey's European prospects paved the way for reforms by the Erdogan government."
"However, reforms are still at an early stage, are incomplete and are driven by the historic fear of the Turkish people against the Kurdish people."
"We must support consistently and decisively the cultural, linguistic and education rights of the Kurdish community; we must support political rights; we must call for the electoral law prohibiting the democratic representation of the Kurdish community in the political life of Turkey to be amended."
"The Turkish political leadership and the Erdogan government are responsible for proceeding with courage and decisiveness to complete the reforms and for the smooth political, economic and social integration of the Kurdish people."
"A strategy of peaceful resolution depends on dialogue between the two sides."
"It presupposes the renunciation, by both sides, of the philosophy of military conflict and of the solution."
"The Kurdish problem will be resolved not on terms of suppression and violence, but on terms of democratic dialogue, development and the flourishing of the rights of the Kurdish people."
"The European Union has its political responsibility for formulating an integrated strategy for the Kurdish problem in Turkey:"
"- it must remain a constant and consistent supporter of its European prospects, while at the same time controlling, without concessions and expediencies, the honouring of obligations by Turkey;"
"- it must confirm its support for the territorial integrity and unity of the Turkish state and condemn the objectives of secession in the dead-end strategy of the PKK;"
"- it must take initiatives to start democratic dialogue on a political solution to the Kurdish problem and on the safeguarding of the role and rights of the Kurdish community in the institutions and society of Turkey."
"Finally, the European Union, in cooperation with Turkish and Kurdish agencies, must help to formulate and implement economic and social reconstruction programmes to combat poverty and under-development, support the institutions and civil society and support the democratic moderate political forces in the area of south-east Turkey."
"Mr President, the situation in south-east Turkey is indeed extremely worrying but should not surprise anyone."
"Violence and gross abuse of human rights, largely by the Turkish State, have been practised on and off in that region for decades and they will continue to occur for many years to come unless the Turkish Government recognises that the Kurdish problem will not go away simply by giving the army generals a free hand to deal with it in the only way they know how: by brute force."
"The Turkish Government must understand that the millions of Kurdish people living in the region must have their human rights fully respected."
"They must have the right to use their own language, Kurdish, and to uphold their traditions and culture."
"Furthermore, the Turkish Government must accept that the Kurdish people are entitled to a degree of autonomy."
"If such an eventuality were to be negotiated, it would not adversely affect the wellbeing of the Turkish people; through the establishment of long-lasting stability, it would bring peace and prosperity to the whole of Turkey."
"In addition, the Turkish Government must take the brave step of acceding to the recent request by Kurdistan Democratic Party leader Masood Barzani to accept the federal structure of Iraq and to declare a general amnesty for PKK militants."
"Mr Erdogan’s Government has given signs of aspiring to achieve drastic democratic reforms in Turkey."
"We know that such reforms are greatly resisted by the deeply entrenched military establishment."
"The Turkish people must understand that those who resist change are in fact the real enemies of Turkey."
"Mr Erdogan is fighting a difficult battle, full of danger, with the army generals."
"We must encourage and support him because, if the generals win, Turkey’s progress towards democratisation will be halted, as will its progress towards EU accession, and the country will sink once again into the backwardness of military totalitarian control."
"Mr President, I declare an interest in this debate as patron of the Peace in Kurdistan campaign and a board member of the EU-Turkey Civic Commission."
"I endorse utterly my group colleague Mr Özdemir’s remarks about dialogue and how this process is not black and white."
"All sides have their shortcomings and we in this House must continue to encourage where necessary, and criticise where necessary."
"We must also, I stress, keep an eye to our own integrity and ensure that legitimate concerns about the painfully slow progress of the peace process within Kurdistan and Turkey as a whole does not become a cipher for those within this House and within the EU who are more anti-Turkish EU membership than they are pro-democracy."
"The Copenhagen criteria constitute the roadmap."
"The Copenhagen criteria on recognition of cultural, historic and political rights are clear, they are already laid down."
"We in this House must keep our own hands clean."
"The EU as a champion of dialogue and democracy must ensure that we always remember our own principles and our own role as honest, impartial broker, able to help and criticise where necessary."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ever since the European Union opened accession negotiations with Turkey, we have received reports of violence and serious human rights violations on a weekly basis, and that is a fact."
"You yourself gave us a list, but I would like to bring to your attention the brutal murder of the elderly parents of the Kurdish Institute’s chairman in Brussels, although the other victims should not, of course, be forgotten."
"Commissioner Rehn’s first response was to affirm his faith in the Turkish Government, an attitude that I find somewhat strange given that there is increasing evidence of those selfsame authorities playing an active role in this."
"I do not know whether you have seen the report of the IHD human rights organisation about the killing of Mr and Mrs Ferho, or the judicial inquiry into the bomb attack in Şemdinli."
"They both point in the direction of the Turkish army."
"When a few weeks ago, a public prosecutor wanted to investigate the direct involvement of the army’s second-in-command – who is also expected to become Chief of Staff – the army immediately vetoed the idea."
"These, then, are the authorities in whom the European Commission has blind faith."
"I have to say, Commissioner, that these incidents do make it painfully clear that Turkey is in no way striving towards a peaceful solution to the conflict with the Kurds."
"Turkey simply refuses to recognise that the Turkish Kurds possess cultural and democratic rights of self-determination."
"A country that denies 15 million citizens all political and cultural rights is not what I would call a democracy."
"Nor, as I see it, can a country whose authorities are actively involved in serious violations of human and international law be described as a constitutional state."
"Ignoring this reality and failing to send out a powerful message from Europe makes us an accessory."
"I really would like to know what the Commission intends to do in this respect."
"Will Commissioner Rehn at long last deliver on his promise and include the protection of the minorities in the association agreement or will he not?"
"One crucial step, I think, could be for the European Union to do what Turkey does not do, or refuses to do, and enter into a direct and structural dialogue with representatives of the Kurdish community in Turkey on this matter."
"I would like to hear your opinion on this."
"Mr President, in my view the greatest service that could be given to the people of south-eastern Turkey is for Kurdish extremist groups to cease their campaign of violence and terrorism."
"It is a characteristic of terrorist campaigns that their victims are, for the most part, ordinary civilians who want nothing more than to have a fair chance of bringing up their children in an atmosphere of peace, stability, freedom and increasing prosperity."
"None of that can be delivered while terrorists and insurgents pursue their own selfish ends, oppress, intimidate and mobilise Kurdish communities at home and abroad, and seek to inflame international opinion against the Turkish authorities."
"I do not imagine that there is very much freedom of opinion in those areas dominated by the PKK."
"From time to time the PKK, an organisation with its roots in the Cold War, has declared a ceasefire."
"The most recent of those was last August, for less than a month."
"Since then it has continued its campaign of violence and murder."
"Since last weekend, as the Commissioner and other speakers have mentioned, over a dozen people have died as a result of terrorist violence."
"Over the years the victims of terrorism have numbered tens of thousands."
"Turkey’s EU accession negotiations are now under way."
"That is itself a factor in the PKK campaign."
"The PKK is not interested in a stable, thriving and democratic Turkey oriented to the West."
"It would prefer its own little Marxist state, living in the past."
"Of course we want to see reforms in Turkey as part of a modernising agenda; of course we want to see great economic improvements in south-eastern Turkey."
"I feel enormous sympathy for people that live in poverty and fear."
"We want reasonable Kurdish concerns to be resolved in a just and fair way through negotiation."
"None of that can be achieved with a background of violence or the continuing threat of violence."
"The Kurdish extremists must end their terrorism."
"The Turkish authorities can then respond in a spirit of goodwill."
". Mr President, I wish to thank Members for this very interesting discussion."
"I have listened with great interest to your remarks and these were duly noted."
"I think we can all conclude that the situation in south-east Turkey is serious and, therefore, we all look forward to that situation being addressed vigorously through a comprehensive strategy, encompassing not just security concerns – which are legitimate – but also the socio-economic development of the region and the development of cultural rights."
"I should like to refer to Prime Minister Erdogan’s speech of August 2005 – which I mentioned earlier – in which he emphasised the need to resolve through democratic means what he described as ‘the Kurdish issue’."
"The Commission will encourage the Turkish Government and its Prime Minister to take steps based on the commitment they made in that speech in Diyarbakir."
"The stability of the region is key to properly addressing those issues and the continuation of terrorist attacks represents a serious threat in this respect."
"At the same time, it is very important that the security forces and the authorities show restraint and do not use excessive force when they deal with civilians."
"I should like to comment on a few issues raised by Members."
"With regard to the Semdinli incidents, I should like to say that investigations are going on both in the judiciary but also in the parliament and we are awaiting the outcome of those investigations and we will continue to follow the situation."
"I have noted the issue of progress and we are continually encouraging the Turkish Government to continue with the reforms and to extend more rights to the Kurdish people."
"I refer to the recent development – at least it is a positive step – of allowing broadcasts in the Kurdish language at certain times on the television and radio."
"We expect more to be done in this respect."
"I can assure Members that we will continue to monitor the situation in the south east."
"All these issues will be raised with the Turkish authorities as part of our regular monitoring of the political criteria."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the debate on the six motions for resolutions on Darfur(1)."
". – Mr President, we have had repeated occasion to discuss the situation in Darfur, albeit not for some time, even though things there have taken a lamentable and tragic turn for the worse."
"Even in the few months that have passed since this year began, according to Mr Egeland, the UN Vice-Secretary-General with responsibility for Darfur, over 200 000 people have been driven from their homes and over 96 villages have been burned to the ground – and all this over a year since international action was taken with the intention of putting a stop to this sort of thing."
"This goes to show how incredibly feeble the international community is where Darfur is concerned, and the fact that the UN’s Vice-Secretary-General was prevented from travelling into the crisis zone in the first place shows that the Khartoum regime is quite blatantly defying and cold-shouldering the international community and thereby making of it a laughing stock."
"That is why it is past high time that we put a stop to our recurrent feeble protests; what is needed instead is for the United Nations, NATO, the USA, the European Union and the African Union to get together around one table in order, at last, to implement a concerted Darfur policy that amounts to more than paper resolutions."
"What is called for, then, is a far more massive intervention there than has been seen hitherto."
"It is, of course, the African Union, above all others, that needs to do something, but we ourselves cannot stand idly by while, quite openly, genocide is being committed – and that is how the United States has openly described it, even though they have not drawn the necessary conclusions from that."
"What we are dealing with here is, quite simply, genocide."
"We are currently mounting sad commemorative events to remember the beginning of the genocide in Rwanda and Burundi – and we averted our eyes from those, too."
"Today, everyone says that we should have intervened then."
"We find ourselves in a similar situation today. We look away, we do not act, we do not use the means available to us – weak enough though they are – and instead content ourselves with verbal protests."
"That makes Darfur not only a disgrace to the Sudanese regime, but also to the international and European institutions."
"That is why I am very glad that we in this House are again returning to this issue."
"To put it simply, it must be abundantly clear to us that normal or more or less normal relation with Sudan will be possible only if it for once does as it has promised and allows the international institutions to do their work there."
". Mr President, when a mission from the Committee on Development visited Darfur in September 2004, we were shocked to see at first hand people sheltering under twigs because their village had been bombed."
"We pushed hard at that time for a strengthening of the African Union monitoring mission, and in October 2004 it was indeed extended to include the protection of civilians who were under imminent threat."
"The tragedy is that 18 months on, bombings, attacks and rapes are still taking place, despite the best efforts of the African Union both in the Abuja peace talks and on the ground in Darfur."
"There are simply not enough African Union troops to be able to control the high level of violence that is taking place, particularly near the Chad border and in the corridor between Tawila and Graida."
"That is why the UN must get involved in Darfur as a matter of urgency."
"The UN needs to back the African Union during the remainder of its mandate and be prepared to take over in October 2006."
"The Government of Sudan says that this is colonialism."
"It is not."
"It is a sad recognition that earlier initiatives to rein in the violence have largely failed."
"Even the humanitarian effort in Darfur is now under threat, because access to the humanitarian agencies is being obstructed."
"With over 3.5 million people dependent on food aid and medical aid, we cannot just stand by."
"The violence has to stop."
"Mr President, ever since I was first elected, we have debated the situation in Sudan."
"What is it that is happening there?"
"Imagine a single friend being killed and the degree of tragedy and misery entailed in that death."
"Imagine, then, 180 000 friends having now died in the conflict."
"Imagine a single friend having his house burned down and being forced to leave his home."
"How does that feel?"
"Imagine now those tears being multiplied by two million in Darfur today."
"Imagine the rape of a single relative, and imagine the same thing happening to tens of thousands of others."
"That is the extent of the humanitarian disaster to have hit Sudan."
"So what is the government doing?"
"In resolution after resolution we have demanded that it disarm the Janjaweed guerrillas, yet nothing happens."
"In resolution after resolution we have demanded that it cooperate with the international community in order to help its own population, but very little indeed happens."
"Matters are not helped by the fact that the UN envoy, Jan Egeland, is refused permission to travel to Darfur whenever he considers it appropriate."
"The Commission is now already giving EUR 160 million and my own country SEK 330 million by way of aid."
"If this money is to be of any use, the regime needs to cooperate rather than seek to thwart our efforts."
"I think that we should impose an arms embargo, irrespective of what Russia and China say, and that all the countries that give their support to an arms embargo should help one another and help prevent the arms embargo from being breached."
"What is more, to imprison women who resist rape is absurd, and the four young women in question should, of course, be released immediately."
". Mr President, Commissioner, in Darfur, millions of people are on the run."
"The refugee camps are packed as a result of the extensive and chaotic flight of people in need, attacked by rebels and by the Janjaweed, often with stories of pillage and rape to tell."
"This is a hopeless situation; the African Union is too weak and the Sudanese Government appears to be backing the Janjaweed and to be unwilling to give international rule of law, represented by the African Union and the United Nations, a chance."
"It seems to be backed in this by China and Russia."
"Yesterday, it became known that Mr Pronk, the UN’s special envoy in Darfur, is resigning from his post."
"If even Mr Pronk, who I know as an incorrigible go-getter and optimist, no longer sees a chance for the peace process, then it is really time for us to sound the alarm."
"In Darfur, an unprecedented brutal conflict is raging, one that gives the European Union the opportunity to show what its role outside of Europe can be."
"This week, the one-hundred-day Rwandan genocide is being depicted here in a photo exhibition."
"This event epitomises the failings of the entire international community."
"We are now once again being put to the test."
"While China and Russia veto every action, the African Union is still trying to get the Sudanese Government on board, but it is too little, too late and too long-drawn-out."
"It is now up to the European troika, by means of money and backing of the African Union’s peace force, to establish an actual presence in order to provide logistical support, access to food aid and protection for the people."
"This chaotic massacre, characterised by an unprecedentedly cruel conflict of interests, must finally stop."
"Today’s appeal by our House in an excellent common resolution gives clear direction and impetus to Mr Solana, the Council, the Commission, and to our governments too."
"The credibility of Europe’s role in the world is at stake."
". – It is a strange fact that until oil was found in southern Sudan, Darfur was not talked about very much."
"Crop farmers tended to their fields, livestock farmers herded their animals."
"It is obvious that the Darfur region has a special attraction for some people."
"Secession attempts by potentially wealthy regions in Africa are nothing new."
"Let us not forget Biafra, Katanga and other problematic parts of a continent that is rich in natural resources."
"Where there is no such wealth, there are no such massive problems."
"After all, we will certainly find not only Russian and Chinese weapons in the region but also in the foreign military bases in Chad we will find weapons from other countries."
"The interesting aspect is that we are concerned that the UN General Secretary has not been allowed into Darfur."
"When there were similar events in Eritrea, Parliament approved humanitarian aid for the government."
"Why should our resolution, under paragraph 7, not call on the EU, the USA and others to help bring the situation in Eritrea to an end as well?"
"Although the Sudanese regime is certainly not a paragon of democracy, it would be wrong to resort to force to resolve the conflict."
"I agree with the resolution, albeit with these reservations."
". Mr President, my colleagues have already referred to the fact that we have discussed this issue time and time again."
"When it comes to human rights and the value of human dignity, we are dealing with variable geometry: when it is close to us, human life seems to matter, but when it is far away, we do not get our act together."
"I have often driven in that part of the world."
"I know that barren land;"
"I know how those people live – or rather, survive – in those conditions, even when there is no conflict."
"They are exposed to famine, shortages of food and a lack of drinking water."
"You cannot imagine how hard their lives are."
"Now, in their hundreds of thousands, they are being tortured, killed and the rest have fled their homes, and yet we will make another resolution here."
"That proves how powerless the international community is in dealing with human suffering."
"That is what it amounts to."
"How many more conflicts do we need?"
"Even in the Balkans we did not get our act together until far too late."
"And now Darfur is far too far away."
"China and Russia are very cynically blocking our efforts in the United Nations."
"Sudan’s rotten regime – I am sorry that I have to use non-diplomatic language – is blocking UN efforts, and we are powerless."
"When we have international conflicts or problems, we need international governance."
"Otherwise, future generations will say to us: ‘You had the problem in your hand."
"You saw the dark clouds on the horizon and you did nothing’."
". – I visited Darfur in September 2004 as part of a delegation from Parliament, and saw the extent of the tragedy, as Mrs Hall said earlier."
"Afterwards, here in Parliament and in the EU, we supported the role that the African Union has sought to play in resolving the conflict."
"This has been dragging on for three years now, has caused over 200 000 deaths and has made 2 million displaced persons or refugees."
"The United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) has gone as far as it can and the talks in Abuja are not making progress."
"The conflict has worsened and is spreading to neighbouring Chad."
"Jan Egeland was prevented from visiting Darfur – yet another snub by the Sudanese regime against the UN, not to mention the terrible war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated by its forces, including the Janjaweed militia."
"The provocative threats by Khartoum to turn Darfur into a cemetery for UN troops should not intimidate."
"The international community must not abdicate its responsibility to protect. Consequently, it must send, without delay, under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, a tough, well-equipped stabilising force, in so doing preparing the groundwork for a suitable-sized UN peace-keeping operation, both with a significant European contribution."
"All Members of the United Nations Security Council must assume their responsibilities, including countries such as China that have protected the corrupt, criminal dictatorial regime in Khartoum."
"Furthermore, there will only be a lasting solution to the conflict if there is an end to impunity for the perpetrators of the crimes of Darfur."
"Accordingly, it is crucial to support the investigations of the International Criminal Court and to step up sanctions against Khartoum, strictly implementing the arms embargo and declaring an embargo on oil exports."
". Mr President, my contacts in touch with those on the ground in southern Sudan inform me that there is a situation developing right now that deserves our urgent attention."
"While the government in Khartoum claims to keep peace agreements, which we know it does not, it funds the LRA – the Lord’s Resistance Army – from northern Uganda to continue the genocide for them."
"The LRA lay siege to southern Sudanese villages: killing the adults, taking the children."
"Young girls are abducted to become sex and labour slaves and they are also sold, traded and given as gifts to the LRA arms dealers."
"Young boys are terrorised into virtual slavery as guards and soldiers."
"The LRA is only a small force, but it is increasingly expanding because abducted young boys are being used as combatants."
"It is planting season now in southern Sudan."
"Civilians should be planting but they cannot, because of the LRA threat, which is again backed by their own government."
"If nothing is planted, famine will result."
"The situation is critical, they need our protection now."
"We have to ask ourselves: if Russia and China can support the government, why cannot we support the suffering Sudanese people?"
"Mr President, we are once again discussing Darfur here in the European Parliament."
"It seems to be a sort of ‘never-ending story’."
"It is with sadness that we must admit that the Sudanese Government bears full responsibility for the fact that there is still fighting in this region."
"The government in Khartoum respects neither the international agreements nor the authority of the United Nations, regarding the most recent UN peace mission as a return to colonialism."
"It is worth noting, however, that the Sudanese Government only dares to behave in this way because it has not been isolated by the international community."
"As the honourable speakers before me stated, countries such as Russia guarantee arms supplies to this country."
"Let us call a spade a spade."
"What we are dealing with in Darfur is genocide, which should be unequivocally condemned by the UN."
"It is highly inappropriate that some countries, such as Russia, are blocking the work of the UN Security Council in relation to this matter."
"The European Parliament should exert pressure on international opinion so that Darfur may cease to be a symbol of violence and abuse."
"– Mr President, the war in Darfur, in the western part of the Sudan, has lasted since 2003, a devastating civil war that has resulted in the appalling toll of 200 000 dead and 3 million refugees, which observers describe as ‘Rwanda in slow motion’."
"The European Union and the United States have expressed their support for the transfer of the mission from the African Union – whose 7 000 troops are quite unequal to the task – to troops provided by the UN."
"The UN’s special emissary to Sudan, Jan Pronk, sums the situation up in bitter words, saying that the UN's efforts at peace in Darfur have ended in failure, and that too little has been done too late."
"Some countries are treating the Sudan with kid gloves. Even though the countries themselves differ, the reason is almost always the same: raw materials and crude oil."
"Our resolution emphatically calls on the UN Security Council to meet to discuss the violence in Darfur and to do justice to its responsibility for the protection of civilians."
"Mr President, I think we should all be a little bit ashamed of ourselves because we are living in what we are calling a diplomatic society and civilisation, which is supposed to be one of the most advanced civilisations in the history of the world."
"Yet we look on helplessly as victims – women, children, innocents – are being slaughtered."
"We talk about it, we debate it, and we try and delude ourselves that the United Nations is doing something."
"The United Nations cannot do anything."
"We are realising that the United Nations, when faced with a regime that is prepared to do anything, whether involving nuclear arms in one country, or genocide or partial genocide of innocent people in another, cannot even visit the site where atrocities are taking place."
"On the other hand, we are witnessing independent action being taken by the military of a country, as happened in Iraq."
"And we are now calling for the Americans and the Europeans to save the innocent people in Darfur – and we are condemning the Americans at the same time for what has happened in Iraq, which was not the best of regimes."
"I shall conclude by saying the situation is so grave that in my country, Malta, one third of the refugees – and we had a debate and vote on it during this part-session – come from Darfur."
"That gives you one example of how desperate the situation is."
". Mr President, the Commission is extremely concerned by the situation in Darfur, which is the last open conflict on the African continent."
"Periodic fighting continues to erupt between the belligerents and the civilian population."
"In particular women and children are the first to suffer from this continued violence and the persistent lack of security."
"Although the worst possible scenario has been contained by the prompt intervention of the African Union, the precarious status quo cannot continue much longer."
"Almost three million people are depending on lifeline humanitarian aid, but access and security conditions for the humanitarian organisations are limited and hampered by continued violence, including direct attacks against relief operations."
"The conflict is now spreading rapidly into neighbouring Chad and could jeopardise the fragile Sudanese conciliation process, initiated with the signature of the comprehensive peace agreement between Khartoum and the SPLM on 9 January 2005."
"There is international consensus that the only way ahead is a political settlement in Darfur."
"The Commission, Member States and the international community are very supportive of the African Union’s objective to reach a rapid peace agreement in the talks in Abuja."
"This could also facilitate a smooth transition of the current military responsibilities of the African Union in Darfur to the United Nations."
"An indispensable move, envisaged by the African Union itself, but still being opposed by Sudan."
"The Commission believes that it is now high time for the parties, under the auspices of the African Union and with the support of the international community, to identify a roadmap to peace in Darfur and for the AU-UN transition with specific benchmarks and clearly assigned responsibilities."
"These would allow the international community to use all means of diplomatic pressure, including sanctions, to force the progress of the whole process."
"Nevertheless, to be sustainable a political conciliation in Darfur has also to be based on the provisions of justice and international support for the construction of the region."
"In this context, it is important that Khartoum and the rebels contribute and assist the work of the International Criminal Court on Darfur and that the donor community is ready to provide an immediate peace dividend once a positive outcome emerges from Abuja."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Iraq: Assyrian community, situation in prisons in Iraq(1)."
". Mr President, the motion in front of you focuses on two key issues of human rights, where two particularly vulnerable groups are gravely at risk in modern-day Iraq."
"The first issue is that of religious minorities, the second is that of prisoners."
"Turning to the religious minorities, there have been extensive assaults recently on Christians and the concomitant lack of aid for the refugees who have fled – who happen to be Christians and Assyrians – into nearby Syria and Jordan."
"Let me say immediately that religious persecution is non-Islamic."
"The Prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him, declared that Christians would be the best friends of his followers, the Muslims."
"In the Holy Koran there are clear statements of respect for other faiths."
"Those who are carrying out these assaults are anarchists: they misuse the name of Islam for their anarchical aim to restore dictatorship with themselves in power."
"What can we do?"
"We can urge, as we do in our strong and powerful resolution, the current government at all levels of Iraq to protect religious minorities and – in this resolution – most particularly the Assyrian Christians."
"We in the European Union could provide support and call upon the international community to provide support for the refugees now numbering hundreds of thousands, I understand, in neighbouring countries such as Syria and Jordan."
"I urge you to support this resolution."
"On the second issue – that of prisoners’ rights – let us remind everyone that the rule of law demands respect for the law on the rights of prisoners."
"That is something that all of the international community knows, as does the new Iraqi Government."
"Let us demand, therefore, that the rights of political and other prisoners are fully respected and let the European Union support the establishment of the rule of law from top to bottom, a justice system to support the Iraqi-elected Government."
". Mr President, since the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, thousands of people have been arrested by foreign troops, mostly from the United States and the United Kingdom."
"In many of these cases, no specific charges have even been brought and these people have been denied the legal and judicial guarantees appropriate under the rule of law."
"According to various sources, around 15 000 people are still in US detention centres in Iraq and an unknown number of people are not contactable and their whereabouts unknown, even to the Red Cross, which is a clear and flagrant violation of international law."
"They are what we sometimes call ‘phantom prisoners’."
"Furthermore, thousands of these people have been in this situation for more than a year."
"Reports and evidence of torture, humiliation and abuse are not just increasing, but they are becoming increasingly frequent and alarming."
"We must add to this the persecution of certain groups suffering as a result of their religious affiliations, as has been said, as I believe this Resolution stresses quite correctly."
"Nevertheless, in addition to the Assyrians, who are especially mentioned in the Resolution, I believe that we should take account of other non-Muslim minority groups such as the Yazidi or the Turkmen, for example."
"In any event, I would like to make two proposals which I believe to be fundamental, even though they are not taken up in the compromise Resolution itself."
"Firstly, I would like to call upon the multinational forces and the Iraqi authorities to publish the names of the people being held, to guarantee them the necessary legal representation and to allow them family visits, as we also recently demanded in the case of Guantánamo."
"Secondly, I believe that this House should call loud and clear for all of those people who have been accused of crimes under international law, such as torture and illegal detention, to be tried."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is closely related to the issues we are dealing with in the temporary committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners."
"Mr President, speaking on behalf of the PSE Group I should like to say that we are all aware of the awful situation in Iraq’s prisons."
"We all know about what happened in Abu Ghraib and elsewhere."
"We very much support the resolution demanding the establishment of detention conditions that conform with international standards."
"We will be voting in favour of the amendment that asks for the names to be revealed of those people who are held in prison and that they be allowed family visits."
"We also urge the Iraqi Parliament to ratify the Convention against Torture."
"I mainly want to speak on the issue of the Assyrians."
"As someone who supports and is supported by the ‘Save the Assyrian Campaign’, whose Honorary President is Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, I am well aware of the forgotten people of Iraq."
"We hear talk about the Sunni, the Shia and the Kurds, but who has been talking about the 800 000 Assyrians that live in Iraq?"
"They make up 8% of the population, which would be considerably larger if it had not been for the fact that, because of persecution, many have fled to Jordan and Syria, where they live in terrible conditions."
"We urge the Iraqi authorities to condemn all acts of violence against the Assyrians, the Chaldeans, the Syriacs and other Christian minorities in Iraq."
"We urge the Iraqi authorities and the multinational force to find the perpetrators of the crimes against them, to facilitate the return and resettlement of the Assyrians in secure environments where their customs and way of life are respected, and urge the Constitutional Committee of the Iraqi Council of Representatives to preserve the cultural and religious rights of all Iraqi communities in its proposals for constitutional amendments."
". – Mr President, according to the latest information, at least 14 000 prisoners are being held in Iraq without any definite charge being laid against them."
"Amnesty International does not mince its words when it says that the occupying powers – the USA and the United Kingdom – are, by keeping them prisoner, directly violating international law and that they have failed to learn any lessons from Abu Ghraib."
"There is no doubt about it; these prisons in Iraq are part of the policy of occupation."
"It is the occupation of Iraq that is the real political problem, and we should not beat about the bush in saying so."
"A whole array of EU Member States are, alas, directly involved in this occupation – the United Kingdom and Poland among them."
"The EU itself has a hand in what is going on in Iraq in the shape – among other things – of the Eurojust-Lex programme, which, I believe, needs to be reviewed, since, if the present legal system is to be judged by the vast number of people in jail, the programme can hardly be effective in any real sense."
"We must, then, demand in clear terms that the occupation of Iraq and the human rights violations in its prisons be brought to an end, and it is the European Parliament that must make that demand, and in very, very clear language."
". – Mr President, I have to say at the very start that I think it a scandal that Mr Pflüger had nothing whatever to say about the plight of Christians in Iraq, although that is perhaps understandable if one is aware that his party still lives off the money of another state in which Christians were subject to great persecution, that state being the GDR."
"I have to tell him, though, that there are many points on which I agree with him."
"I was – and still am – a forthright critic of the intervention in Iraq, and I do believe that we have to very objectively assess what has resulted from it."
"The main justification for this intervention adduced by those who sought to justify it was the need to improve the state of human rights under Saddam Hussein’s brutal regime."
"There have indeed been some improvements, but we must, unfortunately, note that a number of things have also got worse."
"First among these – and a major one – is the fact that the intervention caused the very complex ethnic balance in what was an artificial state created by the colonial powers after the First World War to be upset, and that nobody has any idea how to create a proper state in Iraq."
"The hardest hit by all this are the less numerous peoples and particularly the small minorities such as the Assyrians and other small ethnic groupings."
"I am very struck by the way in which so many in this House find it so difficult to stand up for the rights of Christians and to speak up in their defence."
"Here is a minority that is being persecuted for its Christian faith."
"Who shall plead their cause if not this Europe of ours, the inhabitants of which are 85% Christian?"
"We in this House must stand in solidarity with all those who are persecuted, with everyone whose human rights are violated, but there should be some sort of natural bond between the mainly Christian Europe and the ancient Christian minorities in this region, who have a very troubled history to look back on and who suffer in a particular way from the unstable conditions that prevail today."
"They are persecuted for being Christian, and their persecutors are extremist elements that – as Lady Nicholson put it so very well – misuse Islam for political reasons in order to subjugate and enslave the minorities they do not like."
"It is a politicised Islam that persecutes these minorities."
"We have every right to be critical of the state of affairs in the prisons."
"What must be plain to us is that, while we have overthrown a dictatorship, and are engaged in building up democracy and the rule of law – an objective I endorse and that needs masses of support from the EU – we must then be willing to be judged by appropriate standards."
"The conditions under which prisoners are kept and the justice system are the first steps on the road to a functioning state under the rule of law, and this is particularly true of those prisons that are run by others rather than by the Iraqis themselves."
"All things considered, one has to say that human rights are indivisible, and turning a blind eye is not an effective way for anybody to stand up for human rights."
"."
"Mr President, my party and I have always supported and still support the intervention in Iraq by Western democracies in defence of basic values and fundamental human rights."
"From the standpoint of a supporter of the intervention in Iraq by the United States and other democratic powers, I have to say that it is with great concern and sadness that I receive news of indications of human rights infringements perpetrated by a government which was supposed to be democratic and which should have brought democracy to Iraq."
"In fact, we find ourselves in an unfortunate situation if, after toppling Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship, we continue to witness human rights abuses in Iraq."
"That is precisely why, although I do not agree with many of the speakers before me and disagree with the use of the term ‘invasion’ to describe what happened in Iraq, in this case I have to admit that we should act together in this House and clearly demand that both the Western democracies and the new democratic government in Iraq should respect human rights."
"For it is only respect for human rights that will legitimise the actions that my country, irrespective of the government in power at the time, also supported."
"I would also like to state very clearly that it is laudable that the House has found the strength to speak up in defence of a Christian minority."
"We must also acknowledge that Christians are persecuted not only in Iraq but throughout the world and we, as Europeans, should come to the defence of the community which the honourable speaker before me mentioned."
"In Europe today, and in the European Union in particular, the rights of minorities are guaranteed."
"The rights of religious minorities, Muslims and all other minorities one could possibly imagine and which exist on our continent are also guaranteed."
"It is the norm and forms part of the achievement that the European Union represents."
"It also represents the current state of European civilisation."
"This is precisely why we have the right to call for human rights for Christians."
"Events taking place in Iraq affect, and this is particularly important, an ancient people from that region."
"It is a people whose Christianity and ethnic roots, which are inextricably tied to Iraqi soil, are deeply embedded in history."
"It is not an immigrant people; they are not invaders."
"They are the autochthonous inhabitants of those lands."
"As is often the case in this House, this resolution represents a compromise enjoying cross-party support."
"I hope that, in this resolution, we will be just as unequivocal in calling for the new Iraqi democratic government to respect human rights as in calling for the religious freedom of all inhabitants of Iraq to be guaranteed."
". Mr President, over the last few months in Iraq, we have seen an increase in violence against religious minorities."
"On the 29 January, for example, four churches and the Vatican embassy building in Baghdad, and two churches in Kirkuk, became the targets of attacks."
"Three people, including a 14-year-old boy, were killed and many more were wounded."
"This violence is directed against the Assyrian community in particular as well as against other Christian minorities."
"The Assyrian community is descended from an ancient people who inhabited these lands and it is threatened with forced displacement."
"As a result, world culture faces the disappearance of Assyrian culture in Iraq."
"The most important issue related to the rebuilding of Iraq remains guaranteeing the rule of law."
"The political situation bears many of the hallmarks of a civil war and it must not be allowed to deteriorate into a dirty war, where the forces of law and order constantly use torture, hostages are taken and lawlessness characterises the fight against rebel forces."
"Iraq needs more judges, a professional police force and a penal system which meets international standards."
"The Iraqi Human Rights Ministry and the EU Integrated Rule of Law Mission for Iraq Eurojust Lex should play a particularly important role in controlling this problem."
"The European Union must now decide to extend the mandate of this mission with respect to the training of Iraqi forces of law and order and forensic medicine."
"Mr President, ‘nearly three years after United States and allied forces invaded Iraq and toppled the government of Saddam Hussein, the human rights situation in the country remains dire’. That is the introductory sentence to the most recent report by Amnesty International on detention and torture in Iraq."
"Well-documented reports like that and many others make very grim reading indeed, recounting instances of arbitrary detention, widespread torture including brutal beatings, the breaking of bones, electric shocks, pulling nails out, hanging chained people from the ceiling, causing burns, rape and sexual humiliation, attacks by dogs, extrajudicial killings and many more."
"Colleagues, these despicable crimes are not happening in evil Hussein’s prisons, but in US- and British-controlled and run prisons."
"We rightly blamed Hussein for what was happening more than three years ago."
"Must we not now blame Bush and Blair and hold responsible for the gross disrespect of human life and dignity occurring in prisons in Iraq today?"
"After all, we in the West must ensure that we set the highest standards and are not found guilty of the ill-treatment of fellow human beings whose lives are in our hands."
". Mr President, for a long time, Iraq was subjected to a terrible regime, terrible for its opponents, prisoners, minorities, and even terrible for the large majority."
"We are now learning from first-hand experience the answer to the question as to whether external intervention really can improve such a situation."
"It may well have done so for a handful of groups, such as the Kurds in the north, who had brought about a factual split from Iraq a long time ago, and also the political opponents who had fled the country."
"To most people, Iraq is not a state in which they share but rather a battlefield between external interests and the very divergent group interests of, and the opinions held by, Shiites, Sunnis, Kurds and the Christian minorities who predated the Islamic era, and who, unlike the other groups, do not have their own territory as a possible federal state in a federation."
"Although we completely share Mr Posselt’s concerns about this group, nobody is able to offer a real solution under the current circumstances."
"The foreign occupiers have let the prison system deteriorate further, have allowed the re-introduction of the death penalty and cannot offer a future to a large majority of the people."
"Whilst the proposed resolution is right to identify a number of flaws, it is still far too optimistic and does not really contribute to a solution of the problems."
"It is important to draw the lesson that military interventions do not solve anything."
"."
"Mr President, today’s debate concerns the Assyrian community in Iraq and the problem of torture in Iraqi prisons."
"Whereas individual soldiers belonging to the international forces occupying Iraq are convicted of infringing the human rights of prisoners, the increased violence against Christians comes from Islamic extremists."
"They use blackmail and extortion, attack churches and carry out other acts of abuse which threaten the existence of the oldest Assyrian community in these lands, a community which speaks Chaldo-Aramaic."
"Massacres of the Assyrian people are nothing new, as 33 of them have been recorded since the third century, but they have become increasingly frequent in recent times."
"However, aggression and violence are not a way of solving the complex problems in this region."
"Violence breeds violence, just as aggression breeds aggression."
"The situation thus requires national dialogue, acceptance of religious differences and, as the resolution states, it requires the perpetrators of the violence to be identified and brought to justice."
"It needs to be made easier for refugees to return home, and real aid also needs to be delivered to Iraqis to rebuild their country."
"Violence is not a good or long-term solution to problems anywhere in the world."
"This is why we appeal for respect for human rights and dignity."
"() Mr President, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that no one may be unlawfully detained and that imprisonment must be in keeping with the letter of the law."
"That is what the legislation states, but what is the reality?"
"It is common knowledge that conditions in prisons in Iraq fall below all humanitarian and sanitary standards."
"Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is used."
"The American authorities boast that they investigate all reports of inappropriate treatment of prisoners."
"The Pentagon states that, over the last few years, disciplinary action has been taken against 200 soldiers accused of inappropriate treatment of prisoners."
"If we do want to plant the seeds of democracy in this country, we shall certainly not be able to do so while our representatives there become perpetrators instead of bringing aid."
"– The humanitarian disaster in Iraq is the result of the aggression perpetrated by the United States and the ‘coalition of the willing'."
"In case some of you are not aware to which countries this refers, the next in line are the United Kingdom and Poland, followed by a number of other countries."
"Among other things, representatives from these countries have been training Iraqi policemen, and I am sure that they will have made use of this opportunity to urge the policemen to uphold international standards on treating prisoners."
"I am also sure that the prisoners will have been informed under paragraph 9(b) of this resolution how to raise an objection in court effectively."
"I believe that the other procedures to which the motion for a resolution correctly refers will also have been discussed with them."
"Unfortunately, I have not yet seen policemen in Iraq protesting against the situation of prisoners or the mistreatment of minorities."
"We must therefore take a firm line on these issues and adopt this motion for a resolution, in its amended form."
"It would therefore, in turn, be opportune for the criteria contained in the resolution to serve as the basis for the guidelines for future negotiations on aid for today’s occupying force and the puppet regime."
"I support the resolution."
". Mr President, we are increasingly concerned about ethnic and religious violence and its possible escalation in Iraq."
"Lack of respect for human rights and the rule of law in Iraq is a matter of grave concern for the international community."
"All ethnic and religious communities of Iraq, including the Assyrians, have the right to protection and to practise their ethnic, religious, political, administrative and cultural rights."
"The European Union supports the development of a secure, stable and democratic Iraq, with a parliament and a government, elected on the basis of a constitution that guarantees respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Iraqi population as a whole."
"This is one of the key objectives for the European Union as laid down in the medium-term strategy of June 2004."
"This objective is just as valid today as it was then."
"The Commission emphasises the importance of effective protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and encourages the Iraqi Government to take appropriate action."
"This should also include the abolition of the death penalty which, to the strong disappointment of the European Union, was re-introduced by the Iraqi authorities in 2004."
"We join the international community in expressing our deepest concern at the cases of alleged torture and ill-treatment of Iraqi prisoners."
"We condemn any incidents of abuse of prisoners in Iraq, whether by Iraqi forces or by multinational forces, as contrary to international humanitarian law, and call for those responsible to be brought to justice."
"We have noted that the UK, the US and Iraqi authorities have launched investigations into reports of such abuse and some of those responsible for torture and ill-treatment have already been sentenced."
"We underline the obligations set out in the Geneva Conventions, that recourse to torture or inhuman treatment is a grave breach of those Conventions."
"It is vital for Iraq and the international community to work together to reassert full respect for international law, including human rights and humanitarian standards."
"The European Union is committed to actively supporting the stabilisation of Iraq."
"The Commission and the European Union Member States are working together to strengthen the rule of law through an ESDP – European Security and Defence Policy – operation called EUJUST LEX."
"It is an Integrated Rule of Law Mission providing training in EU Member States in the fields of management and criminal investigation for 770 senior officials and executive staff of the Iraqi judiciary, police and prisons."
"An essential element of that operation is training on human rights."
"In addition, we support the promotion of human rights, an important component of which deals with torture prevention and victim rehabilitation, and we support electoral processes and the constitutional process, working with the United Nations."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the case of Ayman Nour in Egypt."
". Mr President, this powerful resolution calls Parliament’s attention to the fate of a beleaguered parliamentarian, Al-Ghad opposition party leader Ayman Nour, and requests the Egyptian authorities to respect our views."
"We in the European Union are rightly proud of our deep and profound relationship with Egypt."
"Indeed, Egypt co-chairs the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and, with Egypt, we have defined a European Neighbourhood Policy, which strengthens political dialogue and integrates us with Egypt – as Egypt is within the Arab League – to promote peace and stability."
"Egypt is instrumental in helping us in that task."
"We bitterly regret, therefore, that after the recent presidential election and the parliamentary elections in Egypt in November and December last year, Dr Nour was arrested."
"It is hard to believe that the charges for which he has been given five years’ imprisonment could be true."
"Ayman Nour has hundreds, nay, thousands of supporters."
"It is very difficult to see why he would have bothered or needed to falsify some of the 50 signatures needed to have his candidature be legally effective."
"We are gravely disturbed at the deterioration of his health; deeply troubled that his appeal will be considered by a judge who be considered to have a major conflict of interest; and indeed we wish to remind the Government of Egypt, and the courts of Egypt, that human rights are a fundamental basis of the European Union-Egypt Partnership and Association Agreement, which we value so very highly."
"Indeed, we want to stress that our view is well in line with the laws of Egypt itself and so we request the Egyptian Government to look at this again and to regulate the framework, so that opposition candidates can stand and perhaps even Dr Nour’s judge might be reconsidered."
". Mr President, we need to realise that this is the third resolution dealing with human rights in Egypt and Dr Ayman Nour’s situation in particular."
"Dr Ayman Nour was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for the alleged crime of falsifying his political party’s registration documents."
"He came second in the last presidential elections and he remains in prison today where his health continues to deteriorate."
"It is positive, after a fashion, that his case will be reviewed by the Court of Cassation on 18 May 2006, but we must keep a watchful eye on this trial."
"In recital I of the resolution we commit ourselves to an ad hoc delegation at least trying to see him in the event that the trial continues his incarceration."
"It is clear, however – in the eyes of my group at least – that he should be released forthwith, because the crimes of which he is accused and indeed convicted do not appear to stack up in reality."
"The Egyptian Government should be in no doubt that we will watch this case with interest."
"Dr Ayman Nour is an example of a wider difficulty in Egypt with human rights in general, and it is in this connection that this resolution presents some concrete steps forward."
"In paragraphs 7 and 8 of the resolution, which I would ask the Commissioner to comment on this afternoon, we call on the Commission to create a specific subcommittee on human rights in the framework of the EU-Egypt Association Agreement."
"There is a human rights deficit in Egypt that must be addressed."
"The creation of a specific committee to monitor and enforce the action plan will be a concrete way to give teeth to the warm words that this House too often produces."
"Egypt is a valued partner of the EU and this House in the Middle East peace process, an ally in so much and a partner in development, but we must acknowledge that Egypt does not meet our standards."
"We must pointedly, if necessary, use the Association Agreement to assist in the development and building-up of Egyptian civil society for the betterment of the Egyptian people and a more constructive degree of EU-Egyptian partnership."
". Mr President, I believe that the most important point of this motion for a resolution is the last point but one, which states, ‘Calls on the Parliament of the Republic of Egypt to engage in a process of democratisation and of enforcement of the rule of law and human rights with a view to it playing a leading role in the region as a future model of parliamentary democracy’."
"Egypt is fundamental in the Middle East, it is crucial in the Mediterranean and it is, and must continue to be, a privileged partner of the European Union."
"For all of these reasons, however, there is no question that Egypt must be a democracy."
"Unfortunately, cases such as that of Mr Nour show us that that is not yet the case."
"I met Mr Nour at the first session of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, following its creation in March 2005, in Cairo."
"Thanks to pressure from us, he was released."
"I met with him, together with Mr McMillan-Scott and Mrs Flautre."
"He is a democrat and, as far as I am concerned, he must be released, and there is nothing more to say."
"That is what we want from the Court of Cassation which will meet in May, as a clear sign that Egypt is going to allow freedom of expression, of association and of thought and that everybody will be able to express their views freely during future elections."
". Mr President, Egypt’s stability has, for a long time, been based on a single-party state."
"In the post-Nasser era, this party no longer represents a common ideology, but merely the common interest which being in power involves."
"It is possible these days for individual outsiders to take part in the elections outside of this monopoly of state power, provided that they do not constitute a threat to those established powers that be."
"That is why opposing candidates constantly run the risk of being hounded, intimidated or locked up."
"Above all, they are not given the chance to surround themselves with a soundly structured and permanent movement."
"The state of emergency proclaimed in 1981 is still an important instrument for sustaining this situation."
"This time round, it was Ayman Nour, ex-parliamentarian and former presidential candidate, who was its victim."
"Due to Egypt’s contribution to the stability in the Middle East, particularly the peaceful co-existence with neighbour Israel since 1978, there is noticeably little criticism from Europe with regard to this situation."
"Quite the reverse: the European Union seeks good relations with all states along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea."
"My group wholeheartedly supports the demand for Egypt to become more democratic, to put an end to the state of emergency and no longer to obstruct opponents."
"Mr President, I should like to propose an oral amendment to insert a new paragraph 5a. The text is as follows: 'calls for the liberation of Dr Ayman Nour'."
"Mr President, this morning we had the Belarusian opposition leader, Mr Milinkevich, here."
"He is free, but Ayman Nour is not free, although the two men are in a similar position in their respective countries."
"Mr Milinkevich said that when he went to an election debate, he had to take his own drinking water with him."
"Well, every human being has an in-built aspiration to drink the clean water of democracy; what Mr Milinkevich is doing in Belarus, Ayman Nour is trying to do in Egypt."
"He tries to give Egyptian people hope."
"He wants to give hope to those people who believe in a free tomorrow."
"Egypt plays a crucial part, in many ways, in the Middle East."
"If it does not show the way to democratisation for the rest of that region, its future will be condemned in advance."
"Egypt plays an important part in terms of its relationship with the United States and its constructive approach to Israel, but if its relationship with the EU is to deepen, Egypt must take steps towards democracy."
"Egyptian people deserve democracy."
"Why is Ayman Nour in prison?"
"He is there because of flimsy charges; he is detained for nothing; he is detained because he dared to stand against President Mubarak."
"If we want democracy to blossom in Egypt, we must ensure that Dr Ayman Nour is freed."
"If he is freed, that will also free the democratic forces in that part of the world, which is also an issue concerning future stability in that part of the world."
". Mr President, I welcome the interest of the honourable Members of the European Parliament in the human rights issues in our neighbourhood, in particular in Egypt and in the case of Mr Ayman Nour."
"The Commission has been following closely the trial of Mr Nour, the leader of Egypt’s opposition Al-Ghad Party, since his first arrest in February 2005."
"As you will be aware, in reacting to the five-year sentence given to Mr Nour last December, the European Union stressed that the imprisonment sent a negative signal about democratic reform in Egypt."
"In our opinion, the case should be seen in the context of the process of democratisation in Egypt, as well as being related to the independence of the judiciary."
"The Commission expects the Court of Cassation to consider the case in accordance with the Egyptian judicial process and international legal standards."
"The Commission is ready to engage in a political and human rights dialogue with Egypt, in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"The negotiations for the conclusion of an action plan are well advanced."
"We are confident about making further progress in the coming weeks and we hope to finalise negotiations in the coming months."
"In order to monitor the implementation of the action plan – and this should answer Mr Smith’s question – a structure of subcommittees will be created in the framework of the Association Agreement."
"The subcommittees will deal with political and human rights reforms in Egypt."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates, in other words in a moment."
"The next item is Voting Time."
"Mr President, I should like to propose an oral amendment to insert a new paragraph 5a. The text is as follows: '5a."
"This amendment has been approved by the main political parties."
"That concludes Voting Time."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to inform this Assembly that an attack took place this morning in Nassiriya, Iraq, against a European military convoy: three Italian and a Romanian solider were killed."
"I believe that this House should remember the sacrifice made by those European citizens, who were doing their jobs and their service in order to promote peace."
"Thank you, Mr Tajani, and thank you also for informing us of this."
"I am sure that the House will endorse what you have said."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too agree with Mr Tajani’s remarks, of course, although I would add that it is perhaps really time that those troops left Iraq."
"I have, however, asked to take the floor under Rule 22, which relates to the duties of the Bureau."
"In particular, I refer to what took place in the Bureau yesterday, when the possibility for Europeans to write to the Community institutions in one of their own country's official languages was rejected."
"That decision by the Bureau is in no sense an administrative one, given that there would not have been any kind of cost involved for Parliament."
"It is a political decision and, as such, my group challenges it and intends to bring it up at the Conference of Presidents."
"A decision such as that, which prevents citizens from communicating in a manner that has already been approved by the Commission and the Council, cannot be adopted by an Assembly like ours."
"In taking the floor, I simply wanted to explain our position in relation to the duties of the Bureau."
"Thank you, Mrs Frassoni."
"Mrs Frassoni has made reference to what emerged from the Bureau meeting last night, with which I am sure not all Members will be familiar."
"Mrs Frassoni, I would recommend not only that you write to the President about this matter, but also that you inform your Secretaries-General and your Joint Chairman, and get this raised in the Conference of Presidents."
"The matter you have raised was resolved by being voted on in the Bureau yesterday – albeit with a narrow result."
"If you want to raise it again, I am sure you will have to do that via the Groups, who, I am sure, will take the matter up and write to the President."
"The next item is the report (A6-0072/2006) by Mr Titley, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on Road safety: bringing eCall to citizens (2005/2211(INI))."
". Madam President, I want you to imagine a scene: it is a dark and stormy night, it is cold, wet and windy, and you are driving along unfamiliar roads – possibly even lost – when, all of a sudden, something is in your way."
"You are forced to swerve and you hit a tree, knocking yourself unconscious."
"At that point, a relatively minor accident could become very serious: you could be in shock, you could develop hypothermia, you could have bleeding which if not stemmed could be fatal."
"If you are not knocked unconscious, do you know where you are?"
"Do you know anything about the emergency 112 number?"
"Indeed, do you have a mobile phone or is your battery flat?"
"In all of those circumstances a relatively minor accident could be lethal."
"That is because of what is known as the golden hour principle: if you receive treatment within the first hour you are more likely not only to have your life saved but also to have a reduction in the intensity of injuries."
"That is why we need eCall, which is a pan-European in-vehicle emergency call system based on the 112 emergency number."
"If you have an accident, a device within the vehicle will be triggered by the airbag going off, by a sudden rise in temperature in the car, by the car overturning or by sudden deceleration."
"When it is triggered it will send data – such as the time, location and identification of the vehicle – to a public safety answering point, which will then alert the emergency services who will come rushing to your aid."
"This device could also be triggered manually and have a voice call so you could communicate with the emergency services."
"I know there are some issues about privacy, but let us be clear that this system works only when it is triggered in an accident and is not a device for tracing where you are when you are driving."
"This came out of the Emerge project, which was funded by the Fifth Framework Programme, and I should emphasise that much of the technology is here now and some cars already have it."
"However, there is no common platform."
"We need this because 40 000 people are killed on our roads every year and 1.6 million people are injured."
"The cost is EUR 160 billion, or 2% of the EU’s GDP."
"We hope to halve the number of deaths by 2010."
"Thus eCall is the first building block in the Commission’s Intelligent Car Initiative."
"Most measures are designed to stop accidents happening, but accidents will inevitably happen and it is in those circumstances that we need eCall."
"Research has shown that it will reduce the response time in rural areas by 50% and in urban areas by up to 40%."
"That will save 2500 lives, reduce serious injuries by 15% and so cut road-traffic accident bills by EUR 22 billion a year."
"It will also cut accident-related congestion by about another EUR 4 billion a year."
"Therefore, it is a great idea."
"Unfortunately, it is a very complicated idea, because a huge range of stakeholders need to come together – the car industry, the telecoms industry, emergency services, public authorities – to get this introduced on a coherent basis on a common platform."
"That is why the eCall Driving Group was set up."
"It has produced a Memorandum of Understanding, which binds stakeholders to implement equal and agreed principles and an agreed timetable whereby we will have full-scale tests in 2007, PSAPs will be upgraded by the end of 2007 and we will introduce this in all new vehicles in 2009."
"We have over 50 signatures, but unfortunately only seven are from Member States and ironically one is from a non-Member State – Switzerland."
"If there is no commitment to this scheme from the public authorities it will not happen, because the industry cannot justify the research without the commitment of public authorities."
"What is needed?"
"We need to publicise 112 as a lot of people do not know about it."
"This system requires enhanced 112, which involves caller location."
"Member States have an obligation to have it under the 2002 directive, but many of them do not."
"We need to have PSAPs upgraded to deal with this."
"Many countries are doing that at the moment, but there is still a long way to go."
"This will cost money: the device in the car will cost anything from EUR 150 to EUR 450, but, if done properly, the price will come down."
"We need the PSAPs to be upgraded."
"This will cost about EUR 4.5 billion a year."
"However, set against savings of EUR 26 billion, there is a huge cost benefit to this device."
"My message to you is quite simple: this is a great device, it will save lives, it will save money, but we need the public authorities to get their finger out and get on with this, because they are the ones who are dragging us back."
". Madam President, I would like to express my warmest thanks to Parliament and most of all to its rapporteur Mr Titley for his report – and not only for his report but also for the energy with which he is pushing forward this very important facility for citizens."
"It is very encouraging to see that Parliament recognises eCall as one of the priorities of the e-safety initiative, if not the key priority, and the first building block for the Intelligent Car Initiative which I launched last February."
"I would also like to thank Parliament because it gives the Commission continuous support in the efforts to get the Member States on board."
"As the rapporteur said: the difficult part of the project is getting them to sign the Memorandum of Understanding."
"I really hope that your report will give a positive signal to the Member States so that we can have them all on board."
"I am pleased also to note that Parliament shares our views on the emergency number 112 and calls on Member States to make progress in the use of this number."
"You know that the Commission has already taken steps, by organising a high-level conference on 112 in October last year and by setting up an expert group on emergency communication."
"Parliament would like to synchronise the introduction of eCall with the Galileo timetable."
"I agree that Galileo will offer better positioning performances once it is operational."
"However, our target is to roll out eCall as soon as possible, and therefore I encourage the industry to develop a solution based on currently available technologies, such as GPS."
"I agree with Parliament that the cost-benefit analysis is critical, especially in making a convincing business case for eCall and I would like to underline the figures that your rapporteur has just quoted."
"I think this cost-benefit analysis shows that not only can you save lives, you can also save a good deal of money."
"Some Member States like Finland have started their own analysis, which I welcome, and the Commission has started a very comprehensive study called eImpact."
"The Commission believes that the industry can produce in-vehicle systems that fulfil the performance criteria with affordable prices when produced in large volumes, so it is a question of getting started and then introducing the system in all cars."
"We in the Commission do not intend to intervene with the industry on this issue, but we are encouraging equipment manufacturers to work with telecommunication equipment suppliers and mobile network operators in the design of the in-vehicle systems, which require reliability, robustness and functionality."
"I welcome Parliament’s call to the stakeholders to look into the use of incentives."
"Consumer studies indicate that, although they value safety very highly, consumers may not be willing to pay extra for safety features in cars."
"With the support of Parliament we will continue to pursue two lines of discussion on the issue of incentives, namely the financial incentives with the Member States and the possible reduction of insurance premiums with the insurance industry."
"Regarding the issue of getting eCall to users in rural and isolated areas, I would like to point out that eCall is for all, including the more affordable car models."
"It is not a luxury car item but for all citizens and for all cars."
"How quickly its use will spread will of course depend on many things, for example, whether or not we manage to implement the incentive schemes."
"I believe that here there will be an after-market solution which will speed up the take-up of eCall."
"I can assure you that eCall is very high on the Commission’s priority list and I am pleased that Parliament has helped us by making it one of its priorities."
"We will therefore continue our common effort to commit Member States to eCall."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the Commission for its initiative and the rapporteur for his report, which is a laudable contribution to making our roads safer."
"It is crazy how many accidents happen on our roads every day; not even the most modern technology can rule them out completely."
"Over 41 000 people are killed on our roads every year, with over 1.6 million being injured, some of them seriously."
"In future, fitting vehicles with the ‘eCall’ emergency call system will save lives, in that the vehicle itself will call for help in the event of a serious accident."
"It will of course be possible to trigger the alarm manually, for example if one witnesses an accident or gets into a life-threatening situation oneself."
"It makes it possible for the emergency services to get so much more quickly to the scene of the accident, particularly when it is somewhere isolated and hard to reach, and this would cut up to EUR 26 billion per annum from the costs resulting from accidents, so the initial expenditure of four and a half billion would no doubt be money well invested."
"Up to 7 000 lives could be saved every year by eCall, and it could result in 45 000 people’s injuries being less serious."
"If this is not something worth campaigning for, then what is?"
"Over one-third of all accidents resulting in personal injury happen at night, and over half of them happen to someone who is on their own."
"Even today, finding the victim of that sort of accident in good time is more a matter of luck; in winter, it is a regular occurrence that motorists who have had accidents on isolated roads succumb to their injuries, dying of hypothermia rather than as a direct result of the accident itself."
"After all, it is often the first hour after an accident – what doctors call the ‘golden hour’ – that determines whether or not it will prove fatal."
"In order that the eCall emergency call system may be usable as soon as possible, the European Union should make it clear to the Member States just how important it is that a satellite-based system of emergency call centres and infrastructures be built up everywhere, and without delay."
"A system of this kind ought to be operational by the end of 2009."
"At the same time as these infrastructures are being put in place, industry should see itself as being placed under an obligation to offer, from a specified date, all new vehicles equipped with eCall technology."
"Since it is in particular the purchasers of vehicles in the lower price bracket who are wary of spending more money on safety equipment, I would like to see the motor industry introduce the system throughout their ranges in order to reduce the costs to a minimum as soon as possible."
"eCall is also, and especially, vital to the life chances of motorcyclists, who are often not in a position to call for help themselves."
"The same applies in the case of HGVs and buses; ships and aircraft have long been equipped with a comparable system as a matter of course."
"In my electoral district, the emergency services, the police and the motorists’ associations, regional politicians, representatives of the media, and even the senior citizens’ associations are all hoping that eCall will be made mandatory."
"We have not got that far yet."
"I ask the House to adopt the report."
". – Madam President, I too would like to congratulate Mr Titley on his excellent report on such a fundamental issue as road safety. In this case, the report combines innovation and forward-thinking with safety and a reduction in fatalities, a reduction in the fatalities on the roads which constitute one of the most devastating epidemics of our century."
"I am also pleased that this House is once again dedicating some of its time to road safety, and particularly at this early time in the morning, at last, rather than at night."
"As Mr Titley has explained very well, we must help the drivers and passengers of vehicles."
"In my country we have just had an horrendous Easter holiday of journeys away and journeys back home. We thought that the downward trend in fatalities which began a couple of years ago with a special effort to combat road accidents was going to continue."
"That has not been the case and this demonstrates that we must continue to insist and continue to make progress on mechanisms that help to resolve the problems of the human factor. It has been shown that the main causes of death – that figure has not been reduced, although the number of accidents has dropped enormously, but not the number of fatalities – are essentially driver errors – that is to say, the human factor – and also delays in the arrival of the emergency services."
"It is therefore also essential to make progress in the field of intelligent vehicles."
"I would therefore like to welcome and congratulate the Commissioner on her determination and enthusiasm in maintaining the eSafety programme and continuing to make progress with programmes on intelligent methods for improving road safety."
"I also believe that this assistance, which is necessary for vehicles and for their passengers and drivers, should not be restricted to ordinary vehicles – top-of-the-range vehicles, firstly, since they will surely benefit most from these new improvements – but that it should be extended to agricultural vehicles, forestry wardens' vehicles, public works and emergency vehicles, those vehicles whose drivers and passengers are workers who normally use these vehicles to reach remote locations, in dangerous and complicated situations, and which are not generally the kind of vehicles that are equipped with this type of innovation."
"We have therefore asked for the inclusion of this kind of vehicle, and in particular their drivers and passengers, to be studied as soon as possible, since they are of great importance to us."
"With regard to price, I entirely agree that we should move towards a system of incentives, by means of insurance or other kinds of incentive that have already been put in place in other countries for the renewal of the fleet, etc."
"I would like to remind you that extremely fast progress has also been made on other road safety elements that are now entirely normal and accepted, such as safety belts and airbags."
"I therefore feel that that is the direction we must take with eCall as well."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, what are we discussing today?"
"We are discussing an emergency call system that is self-activating in the event of an accident or can be activated manually; we are also discussing studies according to which enormous numbers of people survive accidents if such a system is built in and if the necessary infrastructure – in the shape of such things as emergency call centres and standardised numbers – is in place in the Member States."
"I have to tell the House, quite honestly and frankly, that I regard these figures as grossly exaggerated."
"When we debate road safety, there are certain Members of this House with an interest in this issue – and I will name Mr Vatanen specifically – who evidently think that the only things that matter are those things that have to do with costs and the installation of electronic gadgetry."
"Amendments aimed at bringing in measures that would really address the causes of accidents and have real potential for getting people to improve the way they drive, by, for example, abstaining from alcohol or adapting their speed to the driving conditions, get thrown out altogether by the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"It is clear, then, that safety is no longer thought of except in terms of technology, and I do not think that that goes far enough, for, while it does indeed matter to me that the time it takes the emergency services to reach an accident should be reduced, my concern is primarily with the avoidance of accidents in the first place, and if that is what we are about, then it is much more efficient to do something about the problem of people who drive under the influence of alcohol or about getting people to drive at appropriate speeds – both of which are factors in most accidents – than to do no more than compel the fitting of electronic safety systems."
"Reference has been made to the amount that these systems cost."
"The cost of their installation is currently estimated at between EUR 150 and EUR 300, with the ‘possible’ hope of its ‘possibly’ becoming cheaper."
"Does the House really believe that fitting these things will be made any cheaper by being made compulsory by insurers or by the Member States?"
"The fact is that, if they are, there is absolutely no motivation for industry to produce them any more cheaply."
"I find it quite incomprehensible that the costs of this are of no interest to those of you who are at the same time vociferously critical of the much lower costs involved in the single European driving licence and who have campaigned against it in certain Member States."
"There is also the issue of the private sphere and of the increasing monitoring of every area of our lives."
"While I do believe that such measures are of use in some limited areas, I think it is wrong to talk the whole thing up as a great opportunity to save the lives of what are alleged to be half the victims of all accidents."
"I do not regard these studies as credible."
"If one, at one and the same time, rules out all the other measures that prevent accidents without cutting rescue times, then I cannot regard the Transport Committee’s accident avoidance strategy – which relies exclusively on high-cost measures – as a credible one."
". – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the citizens of EU Member States are often taken aback by the large numbers of fatalities in road accidents."
"There are, of course, various ways in which both the number of fatalities and the lasting impact of injuries can be reduced."
"As my fellow Member has already mentioned, these include the quality of the roads, the safety of vehicle design and more detailed transport regulations that can be enforced more easily."
"Among the measures offering rescue teams a better chance of arriving promptly at an accident scene are the reduction of the time taken between the accident occurring and the arrival of information on that accident, including its precise location."
"I warmly welcome the fact that apart from the seven Member States which have announced that they are ready to launch the system, four others have begun the process of adopting it."
"Our resolution calls on the 14 remaining countries to join the system, and I believe that that will not take long."
"Furthermore, I believe that the whole of the European Economic Area will sign up to this initiative, in addition to the EU Member States."
"The roll-out of the eCall initiative is to be synchronised with the fully operational phase of the Galileo satellite positioning system, which should start in 2010."
"It would therefore be a good idea for eCall to be fully functional by this date too."
"A further prerequisite for the full roll-out of the system is substantial progress towards the use of the emergency number 112, as the Commissioner has correctly pointed out."
"In light of the fact that there are considerable costs involved in all new equipment, the equipment used should of course be both cheap and reliable."
"If insurance companies respond to the call to take into account the use of eCall, this will be a further incentive to speed up introduction of the initiative."
"It is true that some question marks remain over the implementation of the eCall system."
"The proposed resolution calls for the process to be speeded up, whereby the system could be launched by the target year of 2009."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is rare that Members from almost all of the groups clearly welcome a report."
"We have witnessed that today."
"If reducing the number of victims of road accidents really is an important issue to you, I call on you to support the proposed resolution."
". Madam President, Mr Titley is a good man and this proposal is full of good intention."
"However, I am against it."
"I am against it because there are better uses for this level of public expense."
"The case for the project is overstated and I do not think it is financially credible."
"In the UK we have a traditional saying ‘necessity is the mother of invention’ and here we have the EU, mother of inefficiency, providing no necessity but forcing a new invention."
"I believe that you are all looking for new uses to justify the huge cost of the Galileo satellite project."
"What about the additional cost of this project both for the taxpayer and for the motorist?"
"How many false alarms will this eCall system trigger?"
"Will it divert the currently under-funded public services from real emergencies?"
"Which expensive new service will it call?"
"All this rings alarm bells for me."
"If you believe Britain wastes public money, multiply that inefficiency when considering EU projects like this."
"This project provokes the expression ‘EU ain’t seen nothing yet’ or even the Northern expression ‘Ee, did you call?’"
". Madam President, I wish to congratulate Mr Titley on his excellent report."
"The estimated 2 500 lives a year that eCall could save throughout Europe is significant and therefore it needs to be taken seriously as a means of curbing high levels of road fatalities."
"Legislation to take this on board is vital in Member States."
"It is vital that the emergency services, such as ambulances, police and fire services, arrive at the scene of an accident within the first hour – the golden hour – after the accident occurs."
"As of today, 134 people have lost their lives on Irish roads since the beginning of this year."
"Some of these lives could have been saved by eCall."
"Unfortunately no technology can replace the driver’s fundamental responsibility to drive safely and adhere to the rules of the road."
"Recently, a disproportionate number of those fatalities on Irish roads have, sadly, been Eastern European citizens who are working in Ireland."
"The majority of these tragedies occurred on secondary roads and were the result of driving under the influence of alcohol, speed and, in my opinion, the fact that they were driving on the left-hand side of the road in Ireland – a practice to which they are not accustomed."
"To compound the situation, many of them were in left-hand-drive cars which they had brought from their own homes in Eastern Europe."
"It is heartbreaking for any family to lose a member through a road accident, but it is even more tragic and traumatic when the repatriation of a broken body is needed."
"I earnestly call for an awareness programme to be put in place to alert non-Irish nationals on this issue."
"EU Member States badly need a cohesive, united road-safety policy, and the issue of which side of the road cars drive on in the Member States must also be looked at closely at this stage."
"In conclusion, mechanically propelled vehicles have become weapons of mass destruction on our roads and we have become somewhat immune to that destruction."
"We are elected legislators."
"Let us do all in our power to stop the carnage on our roads."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like straightaway to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work and his proposals."
"It is a question in this instance of swiftly implementing a European emergency call system that provides a precise indication of where the accident took place and that alerts the nearest emergency services."
"I believe that the main function of this ‘eCall’ system must and will be to save lives."
"If there is, in fact, one area in which emergency assistance is to be considered vital for the survival and the treatment of the seriously injured, it is indeed that of the roads."
"In this connection, I should like to draw your attention to a specific aspect of road accidents: accidents caused by, or involving, heavy goods vehicles."
"In 2003, of the 90 220 accidents recorded in France that caused the deaths of 5 731 people, 4 472 accidents involved heavy goods vehicles, resulting in the deaths of 720 road users, 107 of whom were drivers of heavy goods vehicles."
"With a 16.10% fatal accident rate, the seriousness of accidents involving heavy goods vehicles is two and a half times higher than that recorded for accidents as a whole."
"As the real crossroads of Europe's road network, France, together with its European partners, must think as soon as possible about implementing alternative solutions to road traffic, which today carries the greatest danger and produces the most pollution."
"In order to increase safety for road users, we must not only create emergency response systems such as the one proposed today, but also free up the roads by shifting road traffic to the sea and the railways, without forgetting the waterways."
"It is by combining all of these efforts, and not by limiting ourselves to systematic police clampdowns only on motorists, that we will succeed in significantly reducing the number of deaths on our roads."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, since all the sensible groups in this House have expressed their support for the eCall system, I propose, rather than going once more over the same arguments and the ways in which this system benefits mankind, to concentrate on something on which this system will depend, namely the existence of emergency call centres and the need for these to be modern, for I do think that there are still some gaps in the system of emergency call handling centres in the 25 European states."
"We should even now be taking a look at the two new states, Bulgaria and Romania, for if this system is to be introduced there, the emergency call systems will have to be in place there too, and so I urge the Commissioner to get down to some serious talking with the Member States about the implementation of the joint decisions."
"I do not want to make threats, but Community law does state that we possess the power to legislate on matters of road safety, and I do not doubt that that includes emergency call centres, which are an essential precondition for road safety being improved."
"We should therefore ask the Member States to at last get their skates on, for it is no use us leaving road safety matters primarily to them if they do not implement the joint decisions that have been reached on the subject."
"Let me appeal to you, then, Commissioner, to get down to some serious talking with the Member States and make every possible use of the options available to the Commission, for a system of this kind is of no value unless proper emergency call systems are available everywhere."
"As Mr Titley said, it is out in the countryside, rather than in the city, that help is needed when an accident happens, but for that to happen, the emergency call system must be available everywhere."
"You, Commissioner, thanked the rapporteur for the energy he has invested in this; we should be grateful for the energy with which you are following this project’s progress."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I wish firstly to thank Mr Titley for the interesting and excellent work he has done and for the interesting discussions we have had in the Committee."
"Road safety is important, and this is a road safety issue."
"We have a perpetual disaster on our roads in Europe."
"Every year, 42 000 people die on our roads in daily accidents."
"We must therefore employ every possible measure to prevent such accidents."
"One possible measure for saving lives on our roads is eCall."
"We know that people want to see this measure put in place."
"People want disasters to be prevented and lives to be saved."
"We also know that people want to see help arrive quickly."
"We have also seen this in the case of disasters other than road accidents, for example in the case of natural disasters both in Europe and in other parts of the world."
"Help and the emergency services must arrive quickly."
"By introducing the eCall system, we can help make this happen."
"As long ago as 2001, the European Parliament emphasised in a road safety resolution that, in our view, the EU’s road safety policy must also include measures for providing emergency help, medical care and rehabilitation, as well as guidelines for offering better medical aid to the victims of accidents."
"This is something to which the eCall system can contribute."
"The Commission has listened to what Parliament said back in 2001 and now wishes to introduce E112 throughout the EU, this being a measure that would benefit road safety."
"It will make it possible for lives to be saved and for seriously injured people to obtain medical care more quickly, and this in accordance with the principle of the ‘golden hour’ whereby anyone who receives medical care within an hour has a much greater chance of surviving as well as of his or her injuries being less severe."
"It is important for the Member States to be committed to this measure if manufacturers are to make progress in this area, for we know that there are now major European motor manufacturers that are developing the relevant technical systems in their cars."
"These systems must, however, have their counterparts in countries’ infrastructures so that there are people to take the calls."
"There is, then, a need because the motor industry is already developing the technology concerned."
"Amendment 3 is important if eCall is further to be developed and if the Member States are to realise that it is important."
"If the European Parliament chooses to support this amendment, we shall be given another opportunity to put pressure on those Member States that are lagging behind."
"Equipping cars with intelligent aids needs to be an EU strategy where work on road safety is concerned, because cars are produced for the whole of the European market."
"We know that, if we obtain a larger number of intelligent systems, we can also introduce, for example, alcohol locks, which would be a really excellent way of preventing drink-driving."
"I wish finally to call for the report and the amendment to be supported."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, we recently, in this plenary, discussed the mid-term review of the European Road Safety Action Programme, when we agreed that the chances of the targets we have set ourselves – namely halving the number of road traffic fatalities by 2010 – actually being achieved are relatively slight."
"eCall can, however, help us to reduce this figure."
"While we know full well that it is not itself a means towards the end of reducing accidents – something at which we have to do much better and in which we have to catch up and will have to continue to do so – it is, as a system, capable of bringing about a dramatic reduction in the harm resulting from accidents, and can also help to build a real broad alliance between the Commission, the Member States, the motor industry, telecoms companies, insurers and, of course, the emergency call services."
"If we succeed in providing universal access to the emergency call services, then that will be a small contribution towards helping the injured and towards ensuring that fewer people are seriously injured or killed."
"I do not want to argue about figures or about whether those under consideration are actually all accurate, which is a completely separate matter."
"If we manage to reduce deaths, and the number of suffering human beings, by 7 000, then that is worth every effort."
"On that assumption, this document will have a great deal of support from me – and, of course, from my group – and I would like to take this opportunity of extending warm thanks to the rapporteur and the Commission for the work they have done."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, where technology can help to make our lives simpler, more comfortable and safer, there we should exploit these possibilities and ensure that as many of us as possible can benefit from them."
"The proposal for the introduction of the eCall system falls into this category; eCall can make our lives safer and no doubt help to save them, so let us make use of the possibilities afforded by this new technology."
"I have three brief comments to make on certain points, some of which have already been addressed."
"One is data protection and respect for the private sphere."
"I am sure that Mr Titley is right to say that this system can be – and is meant to be – triggered only when and where appropriate, that is to say that it is not intended to track what people do in their private lives, but, rather than accepting this assurance at face value, we should establish in our own minds that this is indeed the case."
"If I may turn to the financing of this, there is more and more talk – and rightly too – about the need for the transport system to be run more on the principle that ‘the user pays’."
"I have already heard a lot said today about this, and it has to be said that there is a great desire that others should pick up the bill for something that is intended to be of immediate benefit to the persons involved."
"As for whether use of the system should be voluntary or whether its introduction should be mandatory, self-evident though it is that the system as a whole can work successfully only with the maximum possible number of participants, we should at least make the attempt to go for the voluntary option in the first instance rather than adopting a heavy-handed governmental approach straightaway."
"Madam President, I should like to thank the Commission for its excellent initiative."
"I also welcome Mr Titley’s report and commend him for his commitment to this whole undertaking."
"As I see it, the eCall initiative is one of many measures aimed at implementing the action plan to reduce the number of road accident victims by 2010."
"I believe that the speakers calling for the eCall scheme to be extrapolated from the total package of measures under consideration by the Commission and the European Parliament are mistaken."
"The safety of drivers and passengers is an issue of major importance for the Union."
"It is also very important for each individual Member State."
"In my country, Poland, the average number of deaths in road accidents each year is approximately 5 600."
"Any move to reduce the scale of the grief and suffering caused by such tragedies deserves wholehearted support."
"Another positive element of this undertaking I should like to mention is the significant drop in the number of deaths and serious injuries it would entail."
"In addition, the external costs of road transport borne by all citizens will be considerably reduced."
"I welcome Commissioner Reding’s statement concerning integration of this scheme into the Galileo system."
"It will enable us to benefit from the economies of scale achieved through development of the Galileo system."
"I strongly support those parts of Mr Titley’s report dealing with issues pertaining to respect for the privacy of drivers and passengers."
"Clearly, this venture should be dealt with as a complete package from the outset, as Mr Jarzębowski advocated earlier."
"I should also like to draw Members’ attention to the cost aspect."
"Parliament is, after all, considering a number of other measures in addition to the eCall scheme."
"I could mention the introduction of the euro 5 standards."
"The cumulative effect of all these measures on the cost of acquiring a motor vehicle could be significant."
"I therefore wish to appeal to Parliament, the Commission, the Member States and the Council of Ministers to devise an appropriate information campaign that would succeed in winning over the citizens of the European Union."
"It is not right to skimp on the installation of safety features such as eCall in motor vehicles."
"There can be no justification for risking loss of life or serious damage to health in this way."
"Nonetheless, it is incumbent on us to adopt solutions that will reduce costs to a minimum, especially costs to our citizens, because we do want them to purchase more and more new vehicles and replace older vehicles with new ones."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Titley on his initiative in drafting this report on a subject which brings Europe close to its citizens and by protecting the very valuable gift of life and health."
"The eCall system proves that the European Union can give added value to the measures applied by the Member States to prevent and deal with accidents and their multi-dimensional consequences, especially when we think, as has been said, that this system could save approximately 2 500 lives a year, reduce the seriousness of injuries and help to save billions of euros in the overall cost of the consequences."
"Several Member States signed the memorandum of understanding, as the rapporteur said, and I am delighted that my country, Greece, is one of them. However, cooperation must be extended to the whole of the European Union by 2009 if we are to have a single emergency number, with the facility to locate the scene of the accident."
"However, if this ambitious but very humane plan is to be implemented, real support is needed – as my honourable friends have said – from the automotive industry, from citizens themselves and from government departments, so there is good cooperation as regards the cost of implementing this plan and cooperation with the rescue and emergency services and, of course, with all the systems, such as the Galileo system: this means that we can make use of all the technology and the achievements of the European Union, not only for economic reasons, in the broadest sense, but also on matters which affect citizens' lives."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that Europe and its citizens stand to gain from eCall."
"While it is primarily intended to prevent deaths and reduce human suffering, its economic benefits and the increased efficiency of road infrastructure should not be overlooked."
"It brings Europe added value in the field of road traffic safety, which, despite the single European internal market in transport, is still primarily – perhaps Mr Jarzembowski would like to take note of this – a matter for the Member States’ jurisdiction."
"That is why this good own-initiative report of Mr Titley’s is aimed at calling on the Member States, firstly to sign the declaration of intent with respect to eCall as soon as possible, secondly to proceed with the technical implementation of the 112 emergency number and its specification, thirdly to inform the public about the advantages of the eCall system, fourthly to bring the debate on data protection considerations to a prompt conclusion, and, not least, and right now, to take into account the future new approach when modernising emergency call centres and emergency control units."
"eCall will give us a foretaste of the possibilities that Galileo will open up to us, not the least of which will be that of creating a number of new jobs in a future-oriented sector, and that is one reason why it is worth our while being committed to this."
"Madam President, allow me to suggest that the eCall scheme should not be treated as a scheme that has already been finalised and is to be put to the vote together with specific amendments."
"I believe it should be dealt with instead as an idea that is still at the general stage."
"In this instance we are involved in an extremely valuable parliamentary procedure which does not involve endeavouring to adjust legal provisions to reality as we perceive it."
"On the contrary, it is about first trying to create the reality."
"In a sense, therefore, this is a kind of experiment, and it is never possible to predict the results of an experiment during its initial stages."
"I therefore support all the comments made with a view to reducing the number of amendments as much as possible."
"It is not appropriate to make provision at this stage for what will only become clear in practice."
"The eCall scheme is a particularly valuable initiative."
"Nonetheless, I am fully aware of the need for the second link in this chain of communications to function correctly if all the benefits of the initiative are to be felt."
"I am referring to the medical emergency services."
"I realise we are not dealing with the latter at present, but when I think of the shortcomings of Poland’s medical emergency services I cannot but be concerned."
"Nonetheless, it does seem to me that if Parliament adopts the eCall idea, this could act as a significant incentive to improve medical emergency services in Poland and elsewhere."
"We must rise to this challenge because what is at stake is priceless."
"It is no less than the life of human beings."
"We cannot fail to support all measures aimed at saving human life and it is abundantly clear that the eCall scheme is one such measure."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to welcome this Commission initiative, and to congratulate Mr Titley on his outstanding report and on the dynamism that he brought to the discussions in committee."
"The time has come to bring fresh prominence to the issue of road safety, given that 42 000 lives a year are lost on the roads, as was mentioned earlier, a figure that must be brought down."
"Introducing this system will guarantee a faster response to accidents and could help to reduce accidents and deaths on our roads by half."
"Accordingly, this is an objective that should unite the whole Union and all Member States, starting with my own country, which needs to act more quickly to assume its responsibilities."
"In this regard, I should like to point out that the Commission’s statement refers to studies that the Member States are to carry out."
"I hope that the fact that the Portuguese, Spanish and French outermost regions are not mentioned does not mean that the implementation of the system has been postponed in these regions, which are the hardest hit by permanent handicaps."
"I feel that this should be an EU-wide implementation and as such should cover these regions."
"A further aspect that emerged from the talks was the safeguarding of the right to privacy."
"I feel, moreover, that this report has brought a new dimension to the issue of road safety, in terms of preventing accidents and enhancing and developing infrastructure and equipment for accident victims, whereby important help is offered to people injured in vehicle accidents."
"Consequently, this initiative is very much in the interest of the EU and the Member States."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, there are a number of initiatives on safe, intelligent transport, which will contribute towards meeting the European objective of reducing by half the number of lives lost on EU roads by 2010."
"This is our primary objective."
"We have at our disposal more and more technological resources that are capable of saving human lives and of reducing the seriousness of injuries."
"Examples of this include the considerable progress made in technologies, systems, services and safety, not to mention the potential offered by the development of Galileo."
"In this debate and in the subsequent vote, our task is to provide a vital impetus for the eCall system to be developed and rolled out across Europe by 2009."
"I believe it is vitally important to support this system, given the need to lessen the impact of accidents and help the victims."
"If accident locations can be found quickly, the arrival times of rescue teams, police and towing firms can be drastically reduced."
"The system may save thousands of lives per year and help to reduce considerably both the degree of seriousness of the injuries and the costs relating to accidents."
"The eCall project should be welcomed and deserves Parliament’s support."
"Yet this is not enough, Madam President, Commissioner."
"This kind of initiative depends on competition between large numbers of public and private organisations, including the car industry, telecommunications operators, equipment providers, motorway operators and insurance companies."
"All of the stakeholders have broadly welcomed the initiative."
"It is therefore essential that the Member States that have yet to act upon the Memorandum of Understanding on implementing eCall do so without delay. If so, this project, aimed at better and more effective road safety, will be more workable."
"This is investment, rather than a cost."
"This is the call that I should like to leave you with. I should like to congratulate the Commission on its initiative and Mr Titley on his outstanding report."
"Madam President, there is a great need for agreements about eCall to be concluded at European level, because only a standardised system can guarantee help in the case of accidents abroad."
"This is of major importance considering the ever increasing level of international traffic."
"The eCall system can, in addition to 112, make an important contribution to reducing the number of traffic fatalities in Europe, but its doing so is dependent on the Member States speeding up its introduction."
"That is true of the 112 system, but certainly also true of the eCall system, as my fellow Members have already indicated."
"Fortunately, the Netherlands can serve as a good example in this, because it is making haste, but this should be done on a Europe-wide basis."
"It should not be expensive to introduce the eCall system successfully."
"Costs can be cut by making the best possible use of the technologies available, albeit obviously without putting the emergency help function at risk."
"It therefore strikes me that Parliament is missing an opportunity by not explicitly recognising the need for what is termed an open platform structure, which would, among other things, enable every car driver to call out the breakdown services using eCall technology."
"Service providers could then pay for the use of the technical infrastructure, and costs could thus be shared more."
"I sincerely hope that the Member States will consent to the use of the broad scope of technology, again, of course, without this being at the expense of safety."
"I am pleased that Parliament is united in urging the Member States to get a move on, and we in this House will monitor this closely in the future."
"One of the great challenges facing transport is to extend the use of intelligent transport systems as widely as possible."
"One of these is the advanced GPS emergency call system."
"This technology facilitates the first steps in the direction of intelligent vehicles, that is, safer vehicles, and thereby safer transport."
"I can only congratulate Commissioner Reding, and we hope that we will use the intelligent systems in transport in more and more areas."
"The GPS satellite positioning system enables calls for assistance even without human involvement."
"However, Galileo, the European GPS system, already represents the next generation, and exceeds the functions provided by the currently used system by ensuring interaction."
"The introduction of Galileo, the largest new virtual infrastructure of Europe, will start in 2010."
"I proposed the harmonisation of the introduction of the emergency call system with that of the Galileo system, and the Committee on Transport and Tourism supported my proposal."
"I address the same request to Parliament."
"Naturally, this will be costly, like any new technology."
"Therefore, it is of utmost importance that the system is introduced gradually, and the measures needed to speed up and encourage this process should also be developed."
"Also, we cannot disregard the natural incentive that can be offered by insurance companies through lower insurance premiums offered to those who install this intelligent emergency call system in their vehicles."
"The Transport Committee supported this proposal, too."
"Finally, I think that it is imperative that we examine the experiences of our Member States following the introduction of the single European emergency call number, 112."
"The lessons we can learn from these experiences will be very useful at the introduction of the intelligent emergency call system."
". Madam President, let me once again express my thanks to the rapporteur and in particular to the political groups of the European Parliament, who, together and almost unanimously, think that eCall represents an important advance that is in the interests of European citizens."
"With this strong support from Parliament, the Commission will continue its efforts aimed at the introduction of the pan-European eCall by 2009."
"In particular, we will pursue further signatures to the eCall Memorandum of Understanding, and we will follow the progress in implementing the appropriate emergency services infrastructure for 112."
"By the way, I have launched 11 infringement procedures against Member States, because they have to implement it."
"Parliament is right: let us implement it at once and in the right way so that it serves our citizens."
"I will also work relentlessly with all other stakeholders whose commitment is necessary for implementing eCall, and I would like to inform Parliament that on 18 October 2005 I invited all the Member States to a high-level meeting to discuss progress and to obtain further commitment on the roadmap for the implementation of eCall as a pan-European in-vehicle emergency 112 call."
"There were 21 Member States present as well as Norway and the representatives unanimously supported the realisation of the in-vehicle emergency call, as well as the roadmap prepared by the industry."
"Since that meeting, my services have been in constant liaison with Member States, and several eCall conferences have been held at national level: in Helsinki, Lisbon, Budapest, Madrid and elsewhere."
"Therefore, things are moving."
"I am sure today’s action by Parliament will be very important in speeding this up."
"We are also launching a Eurobarometer survey to collect citizens’ views on 112, on eCall and on other such issues."
"You will get the results later this year as soon as they are available."
"While I am speaking about all the stakeholders, I would like to briefly mention the insurance industry."
"They said, and I quote, ‘there is a complete lack of any viable evidence to support the view that insurers will derive any benefit from eCall’."
"I would like to remind the insurance industry that eCall is not about making money, it is about saving lives, and I hope that there will be a review of this position after the very important vote Parliament is going to take."
"I would also like to say a word about standardisation."
"Standardisation of the data transmission protocol and signalling are urgently needed to enable the design work and investments to go ahead and, here, commercial interest should not block the work of the standardisation organisations."
"We now have a full consensus on the eCall specification and functionality, and I would like to urge all stakeholders, and especially the mobile network operators, to support the appropriate standardisation work in ETSI and CEN so that this work can be finalised as soon as possible."
"I should like to say a very heartfelt ‘thank you’ to the rapporteur and to all Members from all the political groups who will help us, not only today but also tomorrow, to make eCall a very important European project."
"It needs the support of all of the European stakeholders."
"Today we have achieved an important milestone."
"- The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, at 11 a.m."
"Road safety directly concerns all of the inhabitants of the European Union."
"Increased mobility comes at a high cost: each year 1 300 000 accidents cause over 40 000 deaths and 1 700 000 injuries."
"In particular, one out of two Italians uses his or her own car to get around."
"Twenty-six million Italians leave their homes each day to go to work or to school."
"Traffic costs the Italian economy more than EUR 4 billion each year, which equates to around an average EUR 200 per family."
"Italians are abandoning public transport in droves; in 1991 it was used by 17% of the population, but in 2001 by 12.9%."
"In Rome, there are seven cars for every 10 residents, which is absolutely the highest figure anywhere in Europe."
"That is why our country is so aware of the problem of road safety and of reducing traffic jams caused by accidents."
"Among the objectives the EU has set itself is that of halving the number of road accident victims by 2010. Ecall could save as many as 2 500 lives each year, reduce the number of traffic jams and help improve the efficiency of road transport at European level by reducing external costs, which have been estimated at EUR 4 billion in Europe and are somewhere in the region of 2% of GDP in Italy."
"The next item is the report (A6-0074/2006) by Mr Mavrommatis, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on measures to promote multilingualism and language learning in the European Union: European Indicator of Language Competence (2005/2213(INI))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the question of multilingualism, especially in an enlarged Europe, is more important now than it has ever been."
"It is vitally important for European citizens to possess the necessary knowledge and skills that allow effective communication and facilitate mutual understanding."
"Simply learning a 'lingua franca' is insufficient and fails to reflect Europe's true identity."
"The proposal sent to us by the Commission follows on from the decision by the European Council in Barcelona in March 2002, at which the Heads of State or Government called for improvements to the learning of basic skills with the teaching, from a very early age, of at least two languages."
"They also called for a common linguistic proficiency indicator, in other words, a language test to measure objectively the proficiency of citizens in foreign languages."
"Three years later, the Commission is proposing to create a European Indicator of Language Competence, common to all the Member States and with a high level of accuracy and reliability."
"The purpose of the indicator is to measure the proficiency of European citizens in foreign languages in four linguistic skills: reading, comprehension, speaking and writing."
"The indicator will record linguistic proficiency at each of the six levels on the scale of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages of the Council of Europe."
"This Common European Framework of Reference is widely accepted and is already used in many of the Member States."
"I agree with the Commission that, at an initial phase, linguistic proficiency should be tested in the five most widely taught languages in the European Union."
"The addition of Polish as the sixth language, at the initial phase, is something that will be determined by the budget, if of course it is feasible."
"A Eurobarometer poll published this week shows that English with 38%, French with 14%, German also with 14%, Spanish with 6% and Italian with 3% are the five most popular languages in the European Union which European citizens choose to learn."
"Nonetheless, I stress in the report that it is important at the next stage to extend this test to a larger number of European Union languages."
"I should like to point out here that non-Community languages, minority languages and regional dialects do not concern the indicator in question."
"However, they may be included within the framework of the strategy on multilingualism on which the European Parliament is preparing a report and with which they are more in keeping from the point of view of content."
"That is why I do not agree with Amendments 1 and 2, given that they do not refer to this specific report, do not improve the cohesion of the test and do not agree with the objectives of the indicator of linguistic competence."
"The indicator of linguistic competence is no more than a technical instrument that will be financed through an existing programme, namely the lifelong learning programme, the main purpose of which is to substantially strengthen the mobility of citizens, workers or students in the European Union."
"It is also worth noting that, according to recent statistics, while the percentage of primary school pupils being taught a foreign language is increasing, unfortunately the diversity of languages on offer is decreasing."
"In many countries foreign language learning tends to mean simply learning English."
"The indicator can also be used to extrapolate policy conclusions at European and national level."
"Despite the Commission's involvement in the process, the Member States must participate actively in the implementation and development of the indicator, because they alone can provide information on various factors that affect linguistic proficiency, such as television, family environment, number of hours of teaching, experience of teachers and so forth."
"Broadly speaking, the European Indicator of Language Competence is considered to be an extremely valuable instrument for obtaining reliable information on the linguistic proficiency of Europeans, in particular young people, enabling comparisons to be drawn between Member State policies on linguistic matters and facilitating the identification and exchanges of best practices, thereby giving fresh impetus to language teaching."
"Mr President, Commissioner, proficiency in at least two foreign languages should form part of the basic set of skills of a typical European living, studying, working and generally circulating in the European Union."
"We must not forget that 2006 is the 'European Year of Workers' Mobility', in which case I feel that it offers us a very important opportunity to highlight the importance of the skills of European citizens and to offer young people an incentive to attach greater importance and attention to the learning of foreign languages."
"We await the decisions of the Council on 18 May on the subject of the indicator of language competence with great interest."
"I am hoping for a positive response from the Council and an understanding of its obligation to take account of the parameters and an evaluation of the overall efforts of the European Parliament."
"I cannot close without mentioning the living example of multilingualism and its importance which we find in this House."
"I refer to the interpreters, thanks to whom the European Parliament is the only institution working in 20 languages, bringing our work closer to the citizens and making our communication more effective and for that I thank them."
". Mr President, I am very grateful for this report and I congratulate the rapporteur Mr Mavrommatis on his contribution and thank him for his comments and especially for the work and spirit which is embodied in this report."
"I am sure that diversity and unity is the best basis for our enlarged European Union in this 21st century and this diversity is strongly represented and built up further by multilingualism."
"I have just come from the first conference within the EU on minority and regional languages at the Centre Borschette."
"We believe that it is this diversity that makes Europe and in terms of culture and languages it should be protected and promoted."
"A new framework strategy for multilingualism adopted in November 2005 is a first multilingualism policy."
"The European Indicator of Language Competence is a very important instrument for making real progress in the area of multilingualism, which means language teaching, language learning and communication between different language communities in Europe."
"Mr Mavrommatis called on the Commission to encourage early language learning."
"We are currently funding a study of best practice in early language learning and the communication invites Member States to review their arrangements for early language learning in the light of best practice across Europe."
"As you rightly pointed out, it is a Member State competence, so that is why we need the Member States to be even more active."
"I also note the emphasis on awareness raising through initiatives such as the European Day of Languages or the European Language Label."
"We strongly support this type of grassroots activity."
"Further steps ahead of us are, for example, the creation of a high-level working group on multilingualism to develop new ideas and initiatives in this area."
"This high-level group will start work before this summer."
"On the basis of Member States’ reports in response to the Commission’s November communication and on the basis of the advice of this high-level group, I will present a further communication to Parliament and to the Council proposing a comprehensive approach to multilingualism in the European Union next year."
"We also plan to hold a ministerial conference on multilingualism next year in order to share the progress Member States have made and to plan future work."
"The Indicator of Language Competence is a highly valuable contribution in this area."
"Since there is no existing standardised survey of language skills across the Union, it is necessary to collect accurate and up-to-date data on the effectiveness of foreign language teaching."
"This indicator will show us a general level of foreign language knowledge."
"With such an instrument we will be able to improve more significantly the teaching and learning of foreign languages and, of course, increase the mobility of students and workers in our Union."
"In conclusion, I want to repeat my gratitude to the rapporteur and also to the Committee on Culture and Education and its Chairman Mr Sifunakis for their very valuable and continuous support for our programmes and policies."
"This report on multilingualism clearly demonstrates how Parliament can help the Commission and Council in our common commitment to promote diversity."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Mavrommatis on his report and also the Commission on complying with a decision adopted by the Barcelona European Council in 2002."
"I am convinced that a decisive element in terms of the success of the European integration process and also promoting European citizenship is the citizens’ knowledge of the different European languages, in addition to their mother tongue, and that this is also positive in terms of improving mobility within the Union."
"Given that we do not currently have data on the true linguistic and communication capacities of the Union’s citizens, though we know that they differ greatly amongst the Member States, I believe that the European Indicator of Language Competence may provide a good incentive for the improvement and convergence of foreign language learning policies on the part of the Member States."
"As well as contributing to an improvement in communication and mutual understanding amongst the citizens of Europe, this system will also lead to a qualitative improvement in the teaching of foreign languages in European education and training systems, thereby contributing to the achievement of the Lisbon objectives."
"The indicator will stimulate the exchange and knowledge of the good practices of the various Member States and will be a reliable system for measuring progress, initially in the five languages most widely taught within the Union: English, French, German, Spanish and Italian."
"The choice of these five languages for the first stage should not prejudice the other European languages, but it should represent the beginning of a process, without ruling out the possibility of including other languages during subsequent stages, of course."
"Specifically, thanks to the introduction of certain amendments that we have worked on in conjunction with the rapporteur, his report leaves open the possibility of a future evaluation of a greater number of official European languages, without prejudicing the teaching of the other languages not evaluated by the indicator."
"Before I finish, I would like to make it clear that, although this report is not the right place to deal with the situation of the minority languages or of other non-European languages, but that it is intended to improve the language competency of the citizens, the quality of teaching and learning systems for the official European languages, it should not in any way prejudice the recognition and protection of those languages that are not official in the Union, but which are official in certain Member States."
"I would like to end by saying that I am pleased with the text since it represents an important step forward towards a closer Union amongst the European citizens, as well as being very good news in terms of improving education within the Union."
". Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur on his excellent work."
"As you know, my country, Luxembourg, is in favour of multilingualism, and perhaps on more than one account."
"It is, in fact, a country that does not insist on using its own national language, Luxemburgish, and in which people do not hesitate to speak German, French and English."
"It is a country that is careful not to overemphasise the status of its own language in the context of its actions."
"In a way, multilingualism is the best means of promoting the unity of Europe; it is the best means of promoting mutual understanding."
"Yet, multilingualism is also the sign of our diversity, and the disappearance of languages spoken in a limited area must be of concern to us."
"We must ensure that languages that are still spoken also have the means to survive, even if it means including them within a multilingual context, otherwise we will not be able to understand each other."
"The measures taken by the Commission, which aim to encourage the learning of languages of neighbouring countries, are very welcome."
"It is this move that must lead us not only to promote the languages spoken, but also to take measures to understand our fellow citizens."
"Mr President, I will not hide from you the fact that I have some anxieties about the future of our European schools."
"We know that our officials, who are growing in number, are often called upon to move; besides, we are in the Year of Workers' Mobility."
"We should therefore provide for the school system in all of the European countries, in general, and make multilingualism more accessible, in particular."
"Mr President, Commissioner, esteemed rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, like the previous speakers, I too wish to emphasise how important the regional and national linguistic minorities are in this connection."
"Every language a person learns gives him or her access to a larger cultural dimension."
"It is enrichening to be able, as a Finn, to read the newspapers of the whole of Scandinavia, which is what we can now do thanks to the Swedish teaching we have in Finland."
"If we only had a knowledge of the major languages, we should still be unable to read these languages."
"In Finland, Swedish is both a native language and a neighbouring language."
"The major languages are important, and will always remain so, and it is good that a lot of people know them."
"It must not, for all that, be the EU’s strategy to concentrate on, for example, the five biggest languages or only the official EU languages."
"In the Nordic countries and the Baltic Sea region, it is helpful to know, for example, Swedish, Russian or Finnish."
"A lack of knowledge of these languages both alienates people from each other and impairs basic economic conditions."
"At the moment, the Baltic Sea region is the region of the EU with the most rapid growth."
"Respect for those who speak a minority or regional language is also of fundamental importance to European stability."
"For those of us who live in multilingual societies, it is only natural that the EU’s multilingual strategy should not be limited to just a handful of languages."
"I therefore strongly support Mrs Resetarit’s proposal that neighbouring countries’ languages and regional and minority languages be included in the strategy."
"There are also languages outside the EU that are important."
"Forty-six million inhabitants of the EU have as their mother tongue a language other than that spoken by the majority of people in their countries."
"That is a full ten per cent of the EU’s population."
"We also observe that, where more than one language is spoken, economies are often more successful."
"A sympathetic attitude to diversity also produces economic benefits."
"There are no short cuts."
"Europe is multicultural and multilingual."
"Solidarity is splendid but, in order to have this, we must be able to feel that we have equality, firstly between one country and another and, secondly, within countries."
"Traditionally, linguistic and regional minorities have been strong advocates of Europe and been prepared to learn other languages."
"Many of them are now very hard pressed."
"It is neither cosmopolitan in spirit nor compatible with the EU’s interests to turn our backs on a large part of our population."
"It is also partly in order to increase and consolidate the population’s confidence in the European Union that it is important to respect and affirm national linguistic and regional minorities."
"Too often, the majority populations of the EU Member States now wish to ignore their regional and national linguistic minorities."
". – The creation of a European indicator of language competence is something on which we can all agree."
"That being said, there are some comments I should like to make."
"The Commission explains that the Indicator will be obtained by written exams, ‘for practical reasons’."
"I understand this, but I cannot understand why those same practical reasons are behind the decision to assess, and I quote, ‘the five most widely-spoken languages in the EU’."
"The Indicator thus obtained would run counter to the Barcelona Summit objectives, because the choice of languages establishes working guidelines for Member States interested in obtaining results."
"The objective that we share, that every child should learn to speak at least two languages apart from their mother tongue, can be assessed."
"Please note, Mr Figel', the Indicator is obtained by sample and via written exams."
"There is no practical reason why people should not be able to learn any language in the EU area."
"If the tests are applied to the world of languages, the conclusions might be surprising. One might find, for example, that Turkish, Arabic, Chinese and Russian are important languages in the Union and that the children of immigrants are the closest to being able to speak two languages in addition to their mother tongue."
"This is why we voted in favour of the Resetarits amendments."
"I should briefly like to make a second comment."
"The Indicator should not be confused with the certificate of language knowledge."
"The harmonisation of language certificates is not a cultural measure and is not socially neutral."
"With populist policies and public opinion divided over immigration policy, such a measure could legitimise discriminatory policies of selecting immigrants, to the detriment of the poorest countries in the Union."
". Mr President, multilingualism is something that should be encouraged and developed."
"Communication is a necessary and powerful tool."
"However, despite what the EU and many other charlatans wish to pretend, Britain uniquely is a global trading nation of considerable status."
"Thus the languages that should be appearing on the national curriculum – let me emphasise ‘national’ curriculum – should be those of the large and rapidly expanding economies of the world, which, in the case of Brazil, is an EU language: Portuguese."
"But the teaching of Mandarin or Cantonese Chinese, Arabic, Hindi and Russian would serve European countries far better than the insular concentration simply on EU languages."
"The suggested European Indicator of Competence has its focus only on EU languages."
"This ignores the real world and illustrates the typical short-sightedness of the EU."
"It cannot be denied that part of the motivation for the Commission’s interest in this is that many, Mr Chirac included, resent the fact that the lingua franca of business throughout the world, and indeed the European Union, is English."
"People are becoming defensive about the potential erosion of their languages."
"However, the principal reason why the Commission is championing linguistic diversity is not any deep-seated fear that languages and cultures are being eroded, but the knowledge that their ultimate objective, a European federal superstate, is not possible until people can move only to be employable where the jobs are available."
"The content and organisation of national education systems is an area in which the EU, in theory, has no jurisdiction, and this report highlights why."
"Member States have different priorities, different trading links and traditions, despite the EU’s detrimental attempts to change these."
"It is for this very reason that any attempt at harmonisational convergence throughout the EU should be opposed."
"The proposed Indicator offers no tangible benefits to a global trading nation, simply one of the many tools to pursue the dreadful objective of a federal Europe."
". Mr President, a nation’s culture, existence and development are rooted in its language."
"In addition to cultural importance, every language has special significance in terms of nation-building and also in social and economic terms."
"Language is therefore important in dealings with the administration and for legal purposes in their broadest sense."
"Research suggests that almost half of the several thousand languages currently used by the nations of the world will disappear over the next 100 years."
"A significant amount of the knowledge amassed over the centuries will disappear with them."
"Accordingly, individual countries and nations are implementing a range of measures to protect their languages."
"Some, like Germany, have provisions in their constitutions to this effect."
"In others such as France, Poland and Slovakia, the national parliaments have passed laws to this end."
"Mr Mavrommatis’ report deals exclusively with the motion for a European Parliament resolution on measures to promote multilingualism and language learning in the European Union, together with establishing language competence."
"It enshrines a strong preference towards two or five languages."
"Not one of them is a Slavonic language, even though one in four of the Union’s citizens use a language of this type."
"By way of example, I could refer to Polish, a language used by more than 10% of the population of the Union."
"Instead of referring to multilingualism, therefore, we should refer to the culturally dominant nations restricting and displacing the culture of smaller ones."
"We should refer to the operation of European institutions and the competencies of their officials, including preparing them to carry out their duties in a multilingual Europe."
"The administrative dimension of language is quite different from its economic or cultural dimensions."
"Research and checks have revealed widespread infringement of provisions protecting national languages, especially in the new Member States."
"This can be verified simply by visiting a supermarket and looking at the goods on the shelves."
"It would be unusual to find that the information on consumption and use of these goods had been translated."
"Such systematic restriction of multilingualism benefits entrepreneurs at the expense of consumers."
"No thought is given to the fact that the European Union will only become strong and have a if it becomes user-friendly and if it makes it possible for its citizens to demonstrate respect for each other and for their cultural differences, including linguistic ones."
"– Mr President, there is, of course, in our interconnected world, no alternative to the acquisition of new knowledge or to the mastering of more than one language."
"It is of course inconceivable that English should ever be banished from the world of business and science, but German, being the first or second language of some 125 million people, is one of the most important languages in the world, and with 90 million people having it as their mother tongue, it is also the most widely spoken language in the European Union, in contrast, for example, to French, which is now spoken by only 23% of Europeans, and of those, only 11% have it as their mother tongue."
"There is, then, no doubt about multilingualism being an overarching objective, but there has recently been a perceptible, increasing, and unacceptable tendency towards the imposition of a single language, and this I believe needs to be resisted."
"The fact is that there is no democratic basis whatever for the favoured position accorded to English and French within the EU, and, particularly given the greater importance of German as a consequence of the enlargement, it is not acceptable that the EU should disregard long-standing agreements and more or less ignore German as a working language."
"It is an unfortunate fact that this House is as yet the only institution that not only reaches its decision in full public view but also makes them accessible to the public in their own national languages."
"Of the official working languages – English, French and German – it is always the last of these that draws the short straw."
"The Commission will, however, give way to the pressure exerted by the German and now have the progress report on the accession countries translated, so perhaps this gives rise to the hope that more use will be made of German under the Finnish Presidency."
"Every nation is proud of its language and wishes to preserve and use it in a united Europe too."
"The cultural image of Europe is enriched by linguistic diversity."
"And by learning foreign languages we also become acquainted with a nation’s culture, its history and its land and this also contributes to greater mutual respect."
"Learning foreign languages is a real struggle for adults but for children it is more often than not a game."
"It is therefore right and proper that we should introduce into schools the teaching of two foreign languages even in the earliest stages of education."
"Knowing other languages also makes it easier for us to establish friendly ties with other peoples, and this is especially important for the peoples of neighbouring countries, since it is with our neighbours that we usually have most in common and also the largest number of problems."
"For this reason it is sometimes beyond comprehension that certain politicians should build their political power on the limiting of the rights of minorities to use their mother tongue, as is happening to the Slovenian minority in Austrian Carinthia and the minority in Italy."
"Austria and Slovenia cooperate closely in various fields, and I am certain therefore that Austria’s democratic public does not approve of Mr Haider’s anti-Slovenian actions."
"The Austrian Presidency of the European Union has been exemplary."
"I would therefore call once again upon the government and democratic people of Austria to abide by the Austrian State Treaty, which lays down the rights of minorities."
"I would also call upon the Italian Government to begin to implement the law protecting the Slovenian minority."
"European Union institutions should also play a more important role where there are infringements of minority rights, and should issue serious warnings to countries that guarantee minority rights on paper, but in practice violate their own laws and also the rules of the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is with pleasure that I congratulate the rapporteur on the completion of this much-needed report."
"In my homeland of Estonia, widespread literacy has been considered to be elementary since the times of the Hanseatic League."
"Every merchant’s apprentice was expected to be fluent in the four local languages."
"This meant that in addition to one’s own language, one had to be able to speak the languages of the three main trading partners."
"The report rightly claims that language proficiency is an important precondition for citizens of the European Union to be able to enjoy the fundamental freedoms of the Union."
"Because services make up 70% of the volume of our economy, communication skills are of great importance in economic growth."
"It is not likely, however, that the Barcelona objective will be achieved at the present level of effort, because the acquisition of two languages in addition to one’s mother tongue is very time-consuming and difficult."
"Only a very few people do so without a definite goal."
"The Member States should effectively motivate their citizens, and also each other’s citizens, for instance by fully implementing free movement of labour."
"The European language proficiency indicator is, however, primarily important for motivating the Member States’ own citizens in creating a certain comparative and competitive advantage."
"It would be dangerous for both Europe, and for language itself, to be limited to only one universal language."
"This would cause language to be torn out of the ground without its roots."
"For instance, language professors from Cambridge have difficulty understanding supposedly English-language texts that come from Brussels."
"For this reason, I would particularly like to emphasise that not only language proficiency, but also the cultures connected with those languages should be promoted on the European level."
"Unfortunately I am only able to speak in Estonian, my mother tongue, at every tenth session of the European Parliament’s Cultural and Educational Commission – what an irony in a multicultural Europe."
"I hope this report helps to launch a much-needed programme for the promotion of multilingualism in Europe."
"Thank you."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Mavrommatis, for his dedication."
"How well do young Europeans know foreign languages?"
"Which languages are most spoken?"
"Is multilingualism on the increase?"
"That is what a Language Indicator is intended, in future, to find out, but considerations of efficiency and lack of funding mean that this Language Indicator is going to examine only five selected foreign languages, those being the ones that are allegedly the most widely taught within the EU."
"If they are going to get good marks, fifteen-year olds in every Member State will have to have knowledge of English, French, German, Spanish or Italian."
"Quite apart from the fact that other statistics, for example the latest Eurobarometer, show that the fifth place is held by Russian rather than Italian, I think this language policy will have the fatal consequence of making English, French, German, Spanish and Italian the languages that schools will be more likely to offer in future, for no country wants to risk the stigma of being shown by the Language Indicator – any more than by the Pisa study – as bringing up the rear where language skills are concerned."
"Even now, many students are more likely to want to take part in exchange programmes in France, Italy and Spain rather than in – for example – Prague, Warsaw or Budapest."
"Is that really what we want?"
"Ought we not to have a rethink and promote a policy that encourages us to learn the languages of countries bordering on our own, not only for the sake of better communication, but also with business considerations in mind?"
"Even today, an Austrian has far better chances in the labour market if he speaks an Eastern European language, no matter which one, yet, as a consequence of a misguided education policy, this skill has hitherto not been encouraged in my country’s schools."
"Nor does the language indicator provide any kind of incentive for an early change in this policy, and ‘later’ may well mean ‘too late’."
"We live in a very fast-moving world."
"What matters is not the number of people in Europe who speak one language or another, but the social and economic relations between states."
"I would even go further and say that, if we think not only in a European way, but also globally, it will be a very good thing if our children and grandchildren are open to all the languages of the world."
"The fact is that we are now living in a global village, and that is no longer something that is capable of being changed."
"It is a village in which the people who get what they want will be the ones who can make themselves understood."
"It is counter-productive for a language indicator not to be sensitive to these future needs or flexible enough to address them, and so I again urge you all, today, to support the amendments tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"Mr President, the nations of Central Europe have learnt from experience how important it is to know foreign languages."
"The Berlin Wall would have fallen sooner if we had learnt Western languages back in the 1960s or 1980s."
"Although there was no ban on learning French or English in the region, there was certainly lack of motivation."
"Hence the great significance of the European Union’s language policy, which requires citizens in the Member States to start learning a first foreign language between the ages of 6 to 12, for example, and to begin a second after the age of 12."
"The principle of learning two foreign languages is excellent."
"It will broaden our intellectual scope, particularly in the case of representatives of popular languages."
"The European Indicator of Language Competence is very appropriate, because assessment, examinations and diplomas are a source of motivation."
"They constitute a reward for work and encourage further development."
"I cannot, however, agree to including only the five most commonly used or taught languages in the first phase."
"We must not handicap ourselves from the outset."
"For instance, Polish is not a very popular language at present, but Poland is a large country, and it could soon generate significant interest in our language too."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Committee on Culture and Education I would like to state that this Committee has respected the principle of subsidiarity and has taken into consideration national interests while successfully pursuing the European legislative framework for the areas under its political purview."
"These areas include the adoption of norms for Europass, the European City of Culture, the report on key skills for life-long learning, the European Qualifications Framework, digital libraries and many other areas."
"Mr Manolis Maurommatis’s report on measures to promote multilingualism and language learning in the EU Union – the European Indicator of Language Competence – is another such example, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for his work."
"The report focuses on a common goal set out in the Lisbon Strategy, namely the goal of a knowledge-based society."
"I consider linguistic knowledge to be an integral part of life-long learning for EU citizens, and the report submitted by Mr Maurommatis adds another tile to the mosaic of European education, rightly complementing existing plans and programmes in the area of education."
"The theme of language learning is important not only in terms of simplifying communication and mobility for students and employees in the European Union, but also for evaluating the skills gained during the life-long learning of citizens."
"As a rapporteur of the Committee on Culture and Education dealing with drafting the European Qualifications Framework, which is primarily designed to set up a reference structure to transfer and recognise qualifications, I find it important to establish reliable systems for measuring progress and verifying language proficiency."
"As there is not enough information at present to evaluate the language skills of EU citizens properly, I am convinced that the proposed European Indicator of Language Competence should provide a key yardstick to be used by EU Member States."
"Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur Mr Mavrommatis for the hard work he has put into preparing this excellent report."
"It is undeniable that in a Union of 25, soon to be 27 different nations, having almost half a billion inhabitants and more than 20 official languages, it is imperative for individual citizens to be able to command the use of more than merely their mother tongue."
"To this end, measures to promote multilingualism and language learning through the introduction of a European Indicator of Language Competence seem essential and reports like the one before us this morning deserve our full support."
"However, is this really the answer to achieving the best communication possible between European citizens?"
"Would this level of communication be achieved in the most efficient and most economic way?"
"My answer to both of these questions is no."
"To substantiate my position, let me use the example of our Parliament, which represents a much-scaled-down model of the multilingual EU."
"In this House, representing 25 Member States, we communicate using 20 different languages."
"In fact it is laid down in the Treaties establishing this Union that we have the right to use our mother tongue to communicate in the organs of the EU."
"This is all very well, but what does it mean in practice?"
"It means that at any given part-session there can be up to 400 cross-interpretations in this room."
"If I were to speak in my mother tongue, Greek, to my Estonian colleague, then what I say in Greek has to be translated first into most probably English or French and then translated for the second time from English or French into Estonian."
"For my Estonian colleague to answer to me, then the reverse translation route has to be followed."
"This is not a 21st-century way of conducting communication in Europe."
"Not to mention the enormous amount of paperwork that is translated into 20 different languages and not to mention that approximately half the European Parliament’s budget for running costs is spent on interpretation and translation."
"Therefore, the real answer to better communication in a united Europe is for all of us to use only one working language of communication."
"Yes, we have to be seen to protect and preserve our national pride and culture, but we must also progress with the times and strive for a betterment of the unity and efficiency of our European family."
"After all, how united can a family be if every member speaks a different language?"
"The true unity of Europe will be achieved when we have a common working language of communication."
"This is in fact going to happen in the future whether we like it or not."
"It is inevitable."
"Looking at statistics today we see that approximately 38% of EU citizens can use English as a language of communication with French coming second at approximately 14% only."
"Therefore, why can we not be brave enough to take the common-sense step and at the same time as supporting multilingualism start laying down the foundations for deciding which second language will be the common language for Europe?"
"Yes, let us face the facts, let us be practical and honest and let us say that this second language has to be English."
". Ladies and gentlemen, it is always interesting to talk about culture and languages."
"In this instance, however, I would like to point out that the Indicator of Language Competence is an instrument for learning languages rather than for assessing their specific use in a social, economic or other context."
"Admittedly, it is necessary to improve, accelerate and enhance language teaching so that languages become a bridge rather than a barrier."
"I would like to emphasise that language and linguistic skills represent a bridge."
"We would be isolated islands without bridges, and bridges help us form communities."
"A single language does not suffice – ‘English only is not enough’ – as Europe is defined by diversity."
"Diversity within unity is the best description of our community, but I am convinced that unity has never been and will never be defined by a single language."
"A family, a company, a small community or a city might communicate using a single language, but they often fail to function well, as unity is determined not by language but by the values, beliefs and principles underpinning human relations."
"Language plays a specific role in this process, of course, but it is not the deciding factor."
"I would like to confirm that as a policy of the European Commission multilingualism envisages support for minority, regional and neighbouring languages."
"A specific question has been asked as to why only five languages will be used at the beginning of the test period."
"This is only the start of a test that will pave the way for all the official languages of the European Union."
"The Member States have been discussing this topic and will take a decision on it at the Council of Ministers meeting on 19 May."
"It is clear that the Dutch spoken in Belgium and the Swedish used in Finland will be added to these languages later, as they are both widely taught."
"The main criterion has been to ensure access to an adequate statistical sample in order to explore this indicator."
"There is no ulterior motive; our intention is purely professional, namely to develop a high-quality European indicator."
"In conclusion, I would again like to thank the rapporteur and the entire Committee."
"Mr Manolis Mavrommatis has indeed incorporated into his report everything we need to have in the EU’s policy on multilingualism."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, at 11 a.m., that is to say in a few minutes time."
"– Mr President, Members of the House, one of the greatest advantages of the European Union is that its citizens can express themselves in their mother tongues in EU matters, and the preservation of linguistic diversity and cultures is an objective of the European Union."
"However, this advantage often turns into a disadvantage, because it creates communication difficulties between Member States."
"This is why I support the report of Mr Manolis Mavrommatis, which actively recommends early language learning."
"In Central and Eastern Europe, we have seen that young people who speak several languages, who have the possibility of learning one or two languages in their childhood, at school, are at an advantage."
"Language competence is a factor that creates a social advantage."
"Therefore we must use all available methods to ensure that early language learning forms part of public education."
"I also believe that we must support the efforts of the European Commission to introduce the single European Indicator of Language Competence, facilitating the comparability of language competence and the mutual recognition of certificates."
"However, in the spirit of equal opportunities, I would like to call attention to the fact that language learning opportunities must also be provided for those who live in isolated, underdeveloped areas, with the employment of additional measures, if required."
"Thank you for your attention."
"– The next item is Voting Time."
". – Mr President, I simply wished to say that, during yesterday’s debate on the report, certain political group representatives proposed that the expression ‘free-trade area by 2010’ be replaced with ‘area of global interregional partnership in the medium term’ in paragraphs 6, 21 and 66."
"This proposal has also been taken up in the form of an oral amendment that Mr Lipietz wishes to table."
"Mr President, if the House has no objection, I do not have any objection to accepting this proposal either, and I therefore believe that the requests for split votes from certain groups, such as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, do not make any sense if the House accepts this wording, with which I agree."
"I would like to mention a final point, Mr President, which is a technical adjustment."
"In paragraph 77, the Committee on Foreign Affairs approved an amendment from Mr Fatuzzo relating to pensions."
"My only proposal is to take the section of Mr Fatuzzo’s amendment that I am going to read and move it to paragraph 35, which is a more appropriate place for it."
"We would therefore add the following to the end of paragraph 35: ‘which allows for more efficient social security systems offering secure and higher pensions’."
"I would therefore change the expression ‘Euro-Latin American free trade area by 2010’ to ‘area of global interregional partnership in the medium term’ in paragraphs 6, 21 and 66 and move the end of Mr Fatuzzo’s amendment to paragraph 35."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, further to Rule 168(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have heard that three of our groups are having problems with this draft resolution, with the consequent risk of there being, on this important matter, which is of course to some degree connected with the debate and with the Members’ Statute, no majority – or at any rate, not a large one – whereas a large one is what we want."
"I therefore move that this proposal be sent back to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"If that cannot be done or if we cannot agree to it, I move that, as an alternative, the vote be deferred to the next plenary part-session."
"The first option, then, is to send it back, with, if that does not happen, the next plenary sitting as an alternative."
". Mr President, I do not know whether you want me to read my oral amendments now or after paragraph 5, but I would like to have the opportunity to present two oral amendments."
". Mr President, I should like to add a new paragraph 5a to read: ‘Expects that the results of the review of unknown bank accounts related to Commission activities launched by the Commission in October 2005 will be made known completely to Parliament and be followed up’."
"And paragraph 5b: ‘Expects that the accounts thereby established will be audited and the funds credited to the accounts will be entered in the general budget’."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by saying that what we actually wanted to do today was to give discharge to the European Parliament and the administrative authorities, but, over the last two days, we have been presented with new events and new facts, which we have not been able to examine while producing this report."
"They have to do with the leasing of two buildings in Strasbourg."
"It took us several meetings of the Committee on Budgetary Control to examine the situation and work out a solution, but, since we, despite careful reading of the Rules of Procedure, have failed to find the most suitable legal basis for this, and bearing in mind the requirement that we comply with the Financial Regulation, I propose that we, pursuant to Annex V, Article 5(1)(a), vote against the discharge, which does not mean that we will not be giving it."
"We will, though, be gaining automatically six months of time in which to review the additional facts that have come to light and thereby establish a proper procedure for resolving all those questions that demand answers."
"I therefore also ask you to vote ‘no’ in the first round of voting, so that all the questions that have been raised can be answered in a proper manner."
"– Mr President, we would have preferred it to be sent straight back to the Committee, but since, as Mr Ferber has explained, this is not a substantively negative decision on the discharge, we too will vote against in order to make a broad consensus possible."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, agree with what the rapporteur has said."
"Regrettable though it is from the legal point of view, in no way does this circumstance justify negative comments of any kind on our part today, whether about the administration, the City of Strasbourg, or third parties."
"It is for procedural reasons that we are going down this path, without, as yet, stating a position on the subject matter."
"I hope that we will soon be in possession of the facts, so that we will soon be able to give discharge."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in the European Parliament, I too should like to stress that if we do deny Parliament its discharge, as Mr Ferber proposes, this will send the clear political message that we want to gain another six months in which to investigate this matter thoroughly, to go on a fact-finding mission, working through the details of the two buildings in Strasbourg with a fine–tooth comb."
"Nor will this be a discussion about the seat, for that is not at issue."
"What this is about is the need for us to know whether or not our money is well spent."
"That is the whole idea behind the delay."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Poettering and Mr Swoboda said, our vote, which is along the same lines, obviously does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation that is going to be conducted."
"It is just that, with the accusations being very serious, we must ensure that there is complete transparency so that we can then judge and assess matters with full knowledge of the facts."
"Mr President, on behalf of the UEN Group, I wish to support Mr Ferber’s proposal."
"We have not drawn any conclusions at this stage but we want six more months to investigate this case thoroughly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would draw your attention to the fact that we have just voted against granting discharge to Parliament because, at a late stage, further information came to light of which it had been impossible to take account earlier."
"We now face a similar issue."
"Where the Committee of the Regions is concerned, I have proposed that we postpone the decision on granting discharge."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control has ridden roughshod over this proposal, to some extent in peculiar circumstances."
"Since that decision was taken, further information has come to light that has now been made available to the members of the committee."
"I therefore definitely recommend that, on the same grounds as those that applied just now where Parliament was concerned, the Chamber, in this case too, postpone its decision and refuse to grant discharge today to the Committee of the Regions for its work during 2004."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not believe that Parliament has in this case fulfilled its task of demanding accountability."
"Through this vote that you have now held, I no longer regard myself as responsible for the resolution and recommend that you vote against it."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report was debated very late at night yesterday, and so there were few Members present."
"I would like to take this opportunity to briefly revisit one of the amendments."
"The report was the subject of a great deal of interest in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, where some 150 amendments were tabled to it, most of which could be dealt with by the drafting of compromise amendments."
"One of the objects of the debate in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee was to decide whether we should recommend to the Commission that the weaknesses that have been discovered in the existing directive should be dealt with by individual legislative measures and by action on the part of the industry, acting on its own initiative, or whether we should propose to the Commission the drafting of a whole new directive."
"By going for the first option, we decided against having a completely new directive."
"Even though we reached our decision with only one vote against it, and therefore, in principle, unanimously, along comes the Socialist Group in the European Parliament with its Amendment 6, the intention of which is to again put a question mark against it, and, since Amendment 6, in principle, turns the report’s reasoning on its head, I ask the House to throw that amendment out."
". Mr President, I wish to move an oral amendment which is a merger of the original Amendment 1 and the text as adopted in committee."
"The paragraph would then read as follows: ‘Regards large companies as an essential component of the innovation system; considers, however, that State aid to large companies is appropriate for encouraging cooperation within innovation clusters and poles of excellence (large companies, SMEs and knowledge centres), provided that they meet the criteria of the ex ante rules.’"
". Mr President, I would like to add two words to Amendment 2, namely ‘and SMEs’, so that the first line would read ‘Agrees that State aid should be allocated on the basis of criteria favouring innovative start-ups and SMEs’, etc."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to say that we are about to vote on a fantastic resolution on the promotion of multilingualism in Europe, which will undoubtedly be approved by a large majority of this Parliament."
"At times, unfortunately, contradictions arise between what Parliament does and what Parliament says: yesterday, the Bureau rejected the possibility of European citizens addressing our institution in a language with equal official status, contrary to the positions taken in the Council and the Commission."
"I believe that that is completely at odds with what we are about to vote on, and we, as a group, will appeal."
"– Mrs Frassoni, that is the second time today and I think it is not on the agenda."
"In all events, we have listened to you with great sympathy."
"– That concludes Voting Time."
". I voted against the change of name for the Iranian delegation not in order to make our relations with Iran any more difficult (on the contrary I hope we can have good and positive relations with this country) but simply because I believe Parliament should be consistent."
"If we were to change the name of this delegation we should do the same for all those countries that have complex names."
"It is established practice that we use the geographic names of counterparts."
"I am not against revisiting this practice but we should do it for all countries."
". Any decision to change the name of this Parliament’s exchange delegation with the Iranian Parliament is far too fundamental not to be preceded by proper preparatory discussion."
"If that name reflects the fact that Iran currently refers to itself as an Islamic Republic, this could mean that this House might not be interested in contacts with Iran under a different regime, although a change in regime is both likely and desirable."
"The current regime threatens its own people with capital punishment and restricts their freedoms, and the outside world with the development of nuclear weapons and the denial of Israel’s right to exist."
"The regime believes in everything to which the pursuit of democracy and human rights is opposed."
"Adapting to that regime is not the solution, nor is waging war with it."
"The only way to improve this situation is if the Iranian opposition, which is partly living in exile in Europe, is given the opportunity of running their country in a normal manner."
"Anticipating this, there is no reason whatsoever to pander to the wishes of the current regime in its belief that the current state structure is eternal and God-given."
". I am totally opposed to the proposal by the Conference of Presidents to change the name of the delegation for relations with Iran."
"More than anything, the timing is poor."
"At a time when Iran needs to be made aware that the international community is not prepared to ignore the threat posed by the regime, this gesture makes no sense."
"Furthermore, any analysis of this proposal would have to be done on an across-the-board basis, addressing all of the countries with which Parliament has delegations and which also have different official names from those used in the parliamentary name."
"This not being the case – and I am not advocating that this is what we should be doing – there is even less justification for making an exception for Iran."
"The only exceptional thing about Iran at present is the fact that it is posing a challenge and a threat to the international Community."
"Now is the time to stand firm."
"It is the time to negotiate, of course, but to do so resolutely."
"To change the name of the parliamentary delegation is not a sign of resoluteness."
". Given that Bulgaria, Romania and Austria submitted requests for aid due to the damage caused by the floods between April and August 2005 and that on other occasions, I have supported the use of the Solidarity Fund to respond to such disasters, I must add my voice to the calls for solidarity with these countries."
"The idea of solidarity, risk-sharing and mutual help lies at the heart of cases such as these, and deserves my support."
"– Mr President, on the subject of the Prets report, I believe it to be a platitude to say that cultural diversity has to be promoted."
"We have hitherto been concentrating far too much on promoting cultural diversity, especially among the Muslim immigrant population, albeit without, on the other hand, ensuring that our own culture is recognised in the countries of the Islamic world."
"Things have come to such a pass that their culture is attempting to force ours, even in our own countries, to yield place to it."
"It is not just a case of Western culture being put under pressure by demands for such things as headscarves for schoolteachers, but also of Muslim immigrants becoming ever more hostile to Christian symbols and traditions."
"In the meantime, a misconceived tolerance and ideological multiculturalism are resulting in the building of more and more minarets, and our own linguistic culture, too, is being undermined by school classes in which over half the pupils are foreigners."
"These are disturbing developments, and I do not believe that the Unesco convention takes such things into account."
". Parliament has shown its commitment to recognising cultural diversity within the field of international law, by adopting a Convention within UNESCO on Cultural Diversity on 20 October 2005 in Paris."
"The purpose of this Convention is to promote and protect the diversity of cultural content and artistic expressions. Furthermore, it aims to facilitate the development and adoption of cultural policies and appropriate measures for the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions and also to encourage wider international cultural exchanges."
"The Convention establishes, at international level, the recognition of the sovereign right for states and governments to draw up and adopt cultural policies allowing the development of their own cultural sectors."
"The Convention acknowledges that cultural diversity is strengthened by the free flow of ideas and reaffirms the importance of freedom of thought and the diversity of the media."
"It recognises the right of States to adopt audiovisual policies and foster their audiovisual industries."
"It reaffirms the important role of public service broadcasting for cultural diversity and media pluralism."
"Hence our vote in favour."
". I welcome this report on the UNESCO Convention."
"The new Convention aims to facilitate the development and adoption of cultural policies and appropriate measures for the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions and also to encourage wider international cultural exchanges."
"The Convention acknowledges that cultural diversity is strengthened by the free flow of ideas and reaffirms the importance of freedom of thought and the diversity of the media."
"I welcome the fact that the Convention recognises the distinctive nature of cultural goods and services as transmitters of values and identity and it establishes that they transcend their commercial dimension legitimising thus domestic and international cultural policies."
". This report relates to the amendments to Council Decision 90/424/EEC so that EU financial support will be granted for veterinary measures affecting aquatic animals as well as terrestrial animals."
"These amendments are vitally important if financial support is to be obtained from the future European fisheries fund, which would enable Member States to combat serious diseases in farmed animals."
"The change to the date of entry into force laid down by this report is consistent with another amendment proposed in the report relating to the Directive on the prevention and control of diseases affecting aquaculture."
"This is a more workable solution than the one previously put forward by the Commission and as such deserves my support."
". The purpose of this report is to update, recast and consolidate the rules on animal health in relation to the trade in aquaculture products, including the prevention and control of certain diseases, and in turn to increase the competitiveness of European aquaculture producers."
"The objective of the legislative amendments that have been tabled is to simplify and modernise existing rules and innovation in the sector in readiness for future challenges."
"I feel that the amendments to the Kindermann report that have been adopted enhance the Commission’s original proposal and have brought it up to speed with the actual situation in the Member States in this field."
"We voted in favour of the report on the transition from analogue to digital broadcasting."
"It would, however, be naïve to believe that the transition did not involve increased costs for consumers."
"The transition does involve certain costs, for example in connection with new equipment."
"The Member States should, however, ensure that these costs are kept to an acceptable level."
"It is important for piracy to be combated, but we are dubious about continued harmonisation of copyright."
"We have voted against the report on the transition from analogue to digital broadcasting because we do not believe that decisions on matters such as this should be taken at EU level."
"We have definite objections when it comes to the practical issues too."
"Cultural diversity cannot be guaranteed by authorities or by protecting so-called public service companies from competition."
"We are also opposed to the idea of changing TV technology by decree and through political decisions instead of letting people’s own choices prevail."
". In spite of the cosmetic amendments brought in at the eleventh hour and the inclusion of points with which we naturally agree, the resolution before us reveals much about the EU’s real intentions as regards its so-called ‘cooperation’ with Latin American countries."
"Among many other aspects that are worthy of criticism and that we reject, I wish to highlight the following:"
"- the use of so-called ‘integration’ processes – always following a model imposed by the EU – as an instrument for promoting capitalist integration and the liberalisation of trade, to the benefit of the major powers and the large economic and financial groups;"
"- the creation of the largest possible free trade areas, on the basis of bilateral and multilateral agreements, in order to attain a level of trade liberalisation that has hitherto been impossible to introduce at the WTO;"
"- the creation of a so-called ‘bi-regional conflict prevention centre’ as a means of paving the way for EU interference in Latin America (not to be reciprocated);"
"- lastly, showing lamentable consistency, the total lack of condemnation of the criminal embargo on Cuba and the USA’s extra-territorial laws against the country."
"In other words, this is a resolution that runs counter to the declaration made by progressive Members of Parliament from Europe and Latin America at Bregenz."
"Hence our vote against."
"This own-initiative report is about the form to be taken in the future by cooperation between the EU and Latin America."
"At present there is an interparliamentary conference, but the European Parliament now wants to set up a parliamentary assembly with a permanent secretariat."
"The report also contains a host of very bad proposals in areas in which the European Parliament should definitely not express opinions."
"For example, it is proposed to set up a solidarity fund, together with a ‘Plan for Latin America’."
"The June List objects to this proposal."
"It is certainly true that a very large part of Latin America’s population lives in poverty, but it is not the EU that is the solution to the problem."
"In relevant cases, aid should be provided by individual Member States or through UN bodies."
"It is also proposed that, as soon as possible, the Latin American regional parliamentary assemblies introduce elections by direct universal suffrage to these assemblies in order to create a structure similar to that of the European Parliament."
"It is, of course, up to the countries concerned to decide for themselves how their interparliamentary cooperation is to be organised."
"I have therefore voted against the report in today’s vote."
".Latin America was heralded as the giant power for the end of the 20th century."
"Sixty years later, ultraliberal policies, institutional shortcomings and the difficult relationship with the neighbouring United States have had consequences that can be observed in the Andes or the favelas of Rio."
"Yet, Latin America is rich in every respect, starting with its inhabitants, who have a powerful culture."
"Europe cannot, therefore, fail to take an interest in it."
"We must therefore give ‘power to the imagination’ in European-Latin American relations, because the correct model of relations lies between ‘Christlike cosmopolitanism’ and ‘Westphalian cosmopolitanism’."
"This median point between diplomatic Plato and Machiavelli is located in a ‘four-square model of humanitarianism’."
"Europe must propose that resources are shared between the two shores of the Latin world: water, food, education and medicines."
"An economic security Council must be added to the Euro-Atlantic Assembly, which was proposed by the Bregenz summit on 25 April 2006."
"Funded by a form of VAT on the numerous services provided, from space and geostationary satellites, this Council would make a success of partnerships aimed at supplying water and providing basic medicines, education and food."
"This four-square model at the core of humanitarianism would prevent Ecuador from pouring into Spain and children in Latin America from being reduced to donating their organs for the commercial trafficking of insane capitalism."
". Europe’s main priority, in my view, should be at regional level."
"The EU has a duty towards the citizens of its Member States, and as a member of the international community, to play a unique role in its immediate sphere of influence."
"There is a place, and a need, however, for this to be extended to other areas of influence, and that naturally includes Latin America."
"For historical, cultural and linguistic reasons, this is an area with huge potential for developing political and economic cooperation and, more importantly, international relations, where collaboration between those on both sides of the Atlantic could be extremely advantageous."
"Lastly, I wish to make a point from a Portuguese perspective."
"Whilst Portugal has a duty to make Africa one of its priority areas in foreign policy, it must not overlook the importance of transatlantic ties. It must therefore give full support to initiatives such as the summit to be held in Vienna on 12 and 13 May."
"I therefore hope that this summit will produce a positive outcome, with particular regard to the negotiations with Mercosur, an issue to which I have on a number of occasions displayed my concern and commitment."
"In the year in which we are celebrating 20 years of Portugal and Spain’s membership of the European Communities, it is appropriate to point out that Europe has stood to gain from the special knowledge of life in Latin America that these countries have brought. It would gain even more besides if it promoted the teaching of Portuguese and Spanish as important world languages."
"I agree with the rapporteur that we need closer ties in terms of economic and cultural cooperation with Latin America and I would highlight the vital role in this regard of relations with Brazil, an essential player in this partnership process."
"I am alarmed to note that while there has been progress in terms of democracy and freedom in Latin America, this has generally not been matched by progress in combating poverty and social inequality."
"The EU should not, in my view, accept flagrant violations of human rights and the scaling back of civil liberties, as we have seen in Cuba and more recently in Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela."
"I await with interest the outcome of the Vienna summit and hope that it succeeds in genuinely strengthening relations between the EU and Latin America. `"
". The changes to the fisheries protocol discussed in the Commission’s proposal and Parliament’s report will make it possible to bring fishing effort into line with the precarious state of resources in the cephalopod category and to compensate the fleet by means of an increase in the number of licences for the pelagic and tuna categories."
"These amendments do not obstruct the integration of fleets flying flags of the new Member States, whilst at the same time guaranteeing continuity of access for Community fishing vessels which traditionally operate under this agreement."
"I therefore support this report."
". The way in which the Commission handled its finances in 2004 gives me and Mr Belder sufficient reason to call for the granting of the discharge to be postponed."
"First of all, it must be absolutely clear what the Commission intends to do about the problems surrounding the opening balance sheet."
"In addition, it is undesirable that there should be any delay setting up, applying and enforcing the internal control standards."
"Thirdly, the Commission must table a plan of approach that includes a target date for working towards a positive Statement of Assurance."
"Fourthly, the amount of the advance payments left outstanding is high to an untenable degree."
"It is not clear to us how, and when, the Commission would like to see this problem solved."
"Finally, it defies belief that Greece, a Member State, still receives maximum agricultural subsidies even though it has not met the requirement of fully introducing the IACS for more than ten years."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have asked to take the floor in order to explain my vote: I voted not to grant discharge to Parliament's budget, because I believe that the decision taken on the issues that have arisen concerning the buildings in Strasbourg underplays matters."
"An issue such as this, which is connected precisely to the buildings in which the work of our Parliament in Strasbourg is carried out, can no longer be filed away amongst internal administrative paperwork."
"I have heard that the President himself has already duly sent a letter to the City of Strasbourg."
"As per the fundamental principle of transparency that underpins the European institutions, I propose that a temporary committee of inquiry be set up immediately in order to shed light on all the circumstances surrounding the leases on the Strasbourg buildings and on who is behind the Erasmo company."
". My colleague Mr Blokland and I have voted against discharge being granted to the President of the European Parliament for the implementation of the budget in the year 2004."
"The dislocation of Parliament in Strasbourg meets with incomprehension among the electorate, although Parliament itself is dealing with the consequences of a decision that was taken by the European Council."
"We think that the rent paid in excess, which amounts to 10% of the annual rent, should be reclaimed from Strasbourg city council."
"This is a for granting discharge."
". I voted not to grant discharge to Parliament’s budget, not because of any problem with the administration of Parliament itself, but because of the allegations that Parliament, and therefore the people of Europe, have been ripped off by the City of Strasbourg."
"We have the absurdity of John Major’s deal in 1992 during the then British Presidency that gave Germany the recognition of Croatia and the consequent tens of thousands of deaths in the ensuing civil wars."
"That gave Britain an opt-out from the Social Chapter threatening to deny, before the welcome arrival of Tony Blair’s Labour Government coming to the rescue, decent social standards to the people of Britain and condemned, at French insistence, Parliament to travel in perpetuity to Strasbourg, at a cost of EUR 400 million a year and the criminal inefficiencies entailed."
"Now we learn on top of all that the City of Strasbourg may well have been using the decision to exploit its monopoly to defraud the people of Europe."
"Mr Ferber’s report on the 2004 discharge of the European Parliament is fundamentally dishonest."
"Taking advantage of the new anti-Strasbourg offensive launched by the Anglo-Saxon lobby, Mr Ferber is going beyond his role of rapporteur in order slyly to set himself up as Strasbourg's critic."
"No, the European Parliament cannot decide on the location in which it will be based."
"That is a unanimous decision taken by the Heads of State or Government, which has been enshrined in the European Treaties since the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1999."
"No, neither Strasbourg nor France are prepared to agree to give up what they have for some uncertain alternative, that is, to agree to the European Parliament’s being transferred to Brussels in exchange for a European Institute of Technology."
"Why not have a European centre of gerontology?"
"Just as some people want to make France and the Netherlands vote again on the defunct European Constitution, others indulge in wishful thinking and want to do away with the European Parliament’s base in Strasbourg in flagrant breach of the Treaties."
"We will resolutely oppose that, not only on behalf of France, but also on behalf of the general interest of Europe."
". I voted against this report in order to give the Committee on Budgetary Control more time to investigate the possible overcharging of the Parliament for its buildings in Strasbourg."
"It is vital that a full investigation be held into this highly unsatisfactory situation."
"Parliament must do everything possible to safeguard taxpayers’ money."
"Since 1999, all Dutch Members have committed not to join the pension fund, because on the one hand, by joining the fund, those taking part are entitled to two pensions and on the other hand, the pension premium is largely, if not wholly in practice, paid by Parliament."
"It is extremely vexatious that this House should be landed with the shortages that have already occurred on account of bad management in the Members’ pension funds."
"In that way, the taxpayers end up picking up the tab for irresponsible behaviour on the part of the people who represent them, and whose main interest would appear to be in seeking excessive financial reward."
"I consider even more vexing the fact that the Committee on Budgetary Control has largely deleted the just criticism of the account of what happened in connection with the pension fund, as included in the original version of the Ferber report."
"In so doing, this Committee has failed miserably as a monitoring body, and it is for that reason that I shall not be voting in favour of this discharge."
". This week, it became public knowledge that in all likelihood, the European Parliament has, for 25 years, been wrongly required to pay an excessive rent for the use of the buildings in Strasbourg."
"That was reason enough for putting off approval of the annual accounts until such time as this matter has been fully investigated."
"That, to my mind, is only fair."
"At the same time, a similar scenario is being played out in the Committee of the Regions."
"Here too, there have been financial irregularities and an inquiry is underway."
"It is therefore beyond me that a majority now appears prepared to approve these annual accounts, even though inquiry into fraud is still running, and so nothing like all the facts are known."
"The fact that a majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control has rejected a planned hearing about the irregularities in the Committee on the Regions strikes me as very worrying."
"It now looks like Parliament only objects to financial irregularities if its own money is involved."
"This is about funds that all Europeans together have to raise for fulfilling useful tasks, and those funds should not be wasted."
"I will therefore vote against approval of the Committee of the Regions’ annual accounts."
". I voted in favour of granting discharge to the Ombudsman."
"As a member of the Committee on Petitions I value the work of the Ombudsman and believe he carries out his duties effectively and diligently."
". I contribute to this debate as someone who was partly responsible, as Parliament’s representative on the Council of Ministers’ Consultative Commission on Racism and Xenophobia from 1994 to 1999, for the establishment of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia."
"I have no serious quarrel with Mr Guidoni’s report on this Monitoring Centre, but I wish to enter reservations about firstly the underfunding of this Centre compared to the raft of other centres with what I consider less importance to the people of Europe such as Translation or Training."
"Secondly the commitment without additional funding to widen its remit to human rights, making its already difficult task virtually impossible."
"I do not believe these events are unconnected with the politics of this institution."
"Some are fellow travellers with racists and xenophobes, while others take the issue far too lightly."
"I do not see how they can with the rising racism in football, whether in Italy, Spain or elsewhere, the electoral successes of the far right in France and Belgium, Italy and Denmark, plus the threatened breakthrough in 4 May local elections in Britain by our own version of Le Pen’s , the British National Party."
". I voted in favour of granting the European Centre on Racism and Xenophobia discharge."
"It is clear from the report that the Centre was diligent in spending its existing resources."
"However, with racist political parties on the rise and a reported increase in racist incidents there is a strong argument for increasing the Centre's funding."
". I voted in favour of granting discharge to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction."
"However, with the flow of drugs apparently on the increase and the level of addiction rising particularly among some of Europe’s most deprived communities I would like to see the Centre raise its profile and make a more significant contribution to tackling these problems."
". I voted to grant discharge to the European Medicines Agency."
"I believe the agency has a vital role to play in ensuring that new drugs get to the market safely and with the minimum duplication of effort on the part of individual Member States."
". Cape Verde has set an excellent example in terms of democracy, good governance and respect for human rights, and has deep historical, social, political, cultural and geographical ties with the EU."
"This puts the country in a unique strategically important position for developing and deepening Euro-African relations. Cape Verde provides stability and security on one of the outer edges of the European area."
"Although it represents Europe’s Southeast Atlantic border, Cape Verde has been included in other programmes, which, in themselves, do not reflect the country’s actual proximity, nor its identification with common values such as the rule of law, the promotion of good neighbourly relations and the principles of the market economy and sustainable development."
"The Cape Verde authorities and the largest opposition party have been developing contacts with a view to obtaining special status or a partnership with the EU."
"The country’s inclusion in the neighbourhood policy could prove an important step in this direction. It would also set down an important marker in a neighbourhood policy that would be impoverished if it were focused solely on the Union’s southern and eastern borders."
"I welcome the adoption of Amendments 36 and 38."
". I voted to grant discharge to the European Food Safety Authority."
"With food scares on the increase the Authority has a vital role to play in ensuring both the safety of our food and consumer confidence in the food chain."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues have voted against the Parliament’s reports on the budgetary discharge because, for the eleventh year running, the Court of Auditors has been unable to give a positive statement of assurance of the overall EU accounts."
"Conservatives believe that this must be tackled as a matter of urgency by the Commission."
"There must be a zero tolerance of all cases of mismanagement and fraud and there are three main areas to focus on:"
"First, the new accountancy systems put in place in January 2005 must be monitored closely to ensure that they will deliver world class standards of accounts."
"Second, whistleblowers must not only have their rights vigorously defended, they must be encouraged to come forward."
"Third, the issue that concerned the Auditors most was the 80% of the budget that is spent in Member States."
"The Commission is responsible for the expenditure of all EU funds but, in reality, the power is delegated to paying agencies in Member States."
"The objective, as the President of the Court has suggested, must be the introduction of the principle of making Member States responsible for this expenditure."
". This report is indicative of the increasing domination of the financial sphere over that of the real economy."
"The primary objective of the measures put forward to amend the legal structure of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), and the investments thereof, is to increase the cross-border trade in investment funds. The intention is also to remove all obstacles, including tax obstacles, with the aim of maximising the profitability of these funds, including fund mergers."
"In order to facilitate this trade and to increase competition, the plan is to harmonise the prospectuses and rules on consumer protection. The report also seeks to expand the areas of investment into transferable securities, which will lead to greater risk for investors."
"The proposal is to bring the financial markets and the investment funds model in the EU closer to that of the USA, which forms part of the drive towards financial globalisation."
"It is no surprise to find that pension funds come top of the list of priorities."
"This money-making scheme, which sucks the manufacturing economy dry and tramples over the rights acquired by many workers, maximises the profits of the banking industry and management companies, whilst increasing the risk of financial and economic crises."
"We therefore voted against."
". The EPLP agrees with the general approach of the rapporteur to settle at a balance of regulatory and market needs."
"The EPLP could not agree that the directive needs to be included as a ‘Lamfalussy’ type of directive, which was the suggestion of Amendment 6."
". The report before us forms part of the neoliberal agenda of the Lisbon Strategy."
"It proposes that State aid be considered an exception and calls for more measures to deregulate, to ensure competition, to facilitate access to capital, to encourage entrepreneurial spirit, to remove barriers to the movement of both workers and researchers."
"It also calls for a common immigration policy to suit these ends, not least in the area of recruitment in the information and communications technology (ICT) sector."
"At the same time it encourages private-public partnerships and deems aid for SMEs ineffective."
"All of which in the name of innovation!"
"On the other hand, it promotes a strategy of horizontal objectives for State aid defined at Community level, especially, once again in the name of so-called innovation."
"The purpose of this process, which also forms part of the Bologna education process, is for universities and schools to meet the basic needs of the large multinationals, ‘educating’ a homogenous workforce with linguistic skills in ICT and in languages that facilitate the professional and geographical mobility and the adaptability of work, whilst at the same time commercialising knowledge and the fruits of research."
"We therefore voted against."
". I abstained on this report, because I believe the distinction implicitly made here between discovery and innovation both misunderstands the nature of scientific discovery and the economic consequences that follow."
"If we are to compete in the world of high technology innovation and improve our post-innovative performance from its current lamentable levels compared to our competitors Europe must support innovation with public money where appropriate."
"This report by Mrs in 't Veld does not accept that analysis limiting state aids, in my opinion, unreasonably."
"I therefore could not support it."
"– Mr President, the Titley report is a positive step towards enhancing road safety. The eCall system, which will help save human lives on Europe’s roads and reduce the severity of injuries, will have a very favourable cost-benefit ratio."
"Our response to the growing volume of road traffic needs to be enhanced passive and active road safety."
"As part of the world-renowned eSafety initiative, the eCall system is a priority item belonging to a programme covering, , advanced driver assistance systems, lane departure warning and the collision mitigation system."
"The incorporation of the Galileo system is a further improvement to this state of the art technology which will benefit Europe’s transport. The eCall system will serve the hundreds of millions of citizens who every year travel abroad by car."
"Accordingly, I voted in favour of the report on making eCall available to citizens."
". I have voted with enthusiasm in favour of this excellent initiative by my colleague Gary Titley."
"It proposes a pan-European automatic emergency call system."
"In the event of a road accident, the eCall device in the vehicle will automatically transmit an emergency call directly to the nearest emergency call centre, providing information on the precise location of the accident."
"This will result in a dramatic reduction in rescue time and make it possible to treat more injuries in the crucial ‘golden hour’ following the accident."
"The advantage of this system is not only that it will help save lives but also that it will reduce congestion time and contribute to the efficiency of road transportation in Europe with a reduction of external costs."
"It is an excellent example of the advantages of action at EU level, complementing the common emergency telephone number (112) which I was involved in suggesting when I was a junior civil servant many years ago."
".I firmly support the recommendations in the Titley report aimed at rolling out ‘Bringing eCall to citizens’ in the 25 Member States."
"This arrangement is, in fact, a key element as far as improving road safety is concerned."
"In the event of an accident, the response time – in terms both of making the accident scene safe and of helping the victims - is the most important requirement in terms of limiting the most tragic consequences."
"There are more than 40 000 tragic deaths each year on the roads of the European Union."
"This system, which would enable 2 500 lives to be saved each year, must quite clearly be promoted by the public authorities of all the countries and demanded by the citizens, who are increasingly calling for safer roads."
"It is therefore regrettable that some Member States – such as France, in which road safety has nonetheless been declared an important national cause – should be late in implementing ‘Bringing eCall to citizens’."
"Let us hope that the adoption of the Titley report and the publicity it will receive in the European Union will speed up the implementation by all of the Member States of this essential intelligent car system."
"It is important to give priority to road safety issues and to work to bring about a reduction in the number of fatalities on our roads."
"There are thus good reasons for the Member States to consider introducing the in-vehicle emergency call service, eCall."
"I do not, however, see any reason for the European Parliament and the other EU institutions to call on the Member States to sign the Memorandum of Understanding regarding eCall."
"The Member States must adopt positions on this matter without political lectures from the EU institutions."
"The introduction of eCall entails costs and technical harmonisation."
"It must be up to the individual Member States to decide which road safety measures are most important and realistic and to be given priority."
"I have thus chosen to vote against this report."
". This report introduces a new system whereby, through the use of digital and satellite technology, emergency services are called directly ‘on impact’ to a car crash."
"The new system should be installed in all new cars from 2009, saving up to 2 500 lives a year across Europe."
"A sensor in the car is activated by the impact of a collision and sends information on the location, speed and owner of the car through the pan-European emergency number 112 to the nearest police, fire and medical services."
"I welcome this report as it will save those hundreds of car crash victims who find themselves trapped in their cars and unable to reach their mobile phones because of their injuries."
"Although the smart car system will cost EUR 4 billion it will ultimately save EUR 26 billion across Europe in accident and congestion costs."
"According to the Commission, the smart car system could reduce the numbers of fatalities on the roads by as much as 15%."
". I voted against the Mavromatis report (A6-0074/2006) on promoting multilingualism and language learning in the EU because in a Europe based on coexistence between communities, it is crucial that the citizens have the necessary skills to be able to communicate effectively with one another, thereby strengthening mobility in the EU."
"It is wrong to confer privileged status on certain languages, without other factors being taken into account."
"The creation of a ‘multilingual’ society, in which every citizen has the opportunity to learn at least two languages other than their mother tongue will help to foster closer ties between citizens of different EU Member States."
"It is also important, however, that this is not done at the cost of devaluing national languages."
". We voted against because multilingualism is not considered in all of its practical applications."
"Steps are being taken that may lead to the creation of a directory to select the languages used."
"It is appalling that the proposals to broaden the range of languages, including those of immigrants, were rejected."
"To quote the Commission: ‘the EU institutions should try to strike a balance between the costs and benefits of being multilingual’."
"This sentence follows a series of repeated examples of discrimination relating to the use, translation and interpretation of the official languages of the EU, and to the dismissal of dozens of teachers who worked in the Commission’s services. This serves to increase our concerns as regards the need to promote multilingualism as a cultural value of the EU."
"An agreement of this nature should respect the diversity of cultures and languages, given that language is the most direct expression of culture. It should also guarantee equal treatment of all official languages, thereby putting an end to the proposed distinction between ‘official languages’ and ‘working languages’, which has served to discriminate against certain languages like Portuguese."
"The June List has previously pointed out in this Parliament – and now does so again – that the Member States are exclusively responsible for the organisation of teaching and the content of education systems."
"In both resolutions now being dealt with, the European Parliament is shamelessly trying to get involved in language teaching and the adjustment of education systems to, for example, new technology and digitalisation."
"I am therefore voting against both resolutions."
"I nonetheless appreciate that the Member States may need to discuss among themselves a number of issues such as, for example, the consequences of the transition from analogue to digital broadcasting."
"In its proposals, however, the European Parliament is, as usual, going too far in its ambition to develop policy areas at EU level within every possible subject area."
"I believe that the Council of Ministers is the best place in which to find out how far there is a need to go in terms of cooperation in the aforesaid area."
".Responding to the linguistic standardisation of Europe, whereby English is the popular phonetic soup, with a form of multilingualism that the European Union would do well to practice itself, is all well and good."
"The French, who listen to Mr Trichet speaking in the European Parliament in English, and the Germans who, despite representing 30% of the people of the Union, see their language's share of the European language market reduced to 14%, can only approve of the sanctioning of multilingualism."
"It is not Europe’s job to help destroy linguistic biodiversity."
"From that perspective, the Catalans make some sensible observations."
"The Catalan language which, with more than 15 million speakers, is used more widely that Finnish, Danish, Latvian or even Dutch, cannot be overlooked in the European Parliament."
"The Catalan, Occitan or Breton languages represent the rootlets of France's cultural tree."
"The same could be said of the tree representing Spain’s identity."
"Faced with the winds of Anglo-Saxon globalisation, these national trees need all of their deep cultural roots in order to remain standing."
"It is true that, if it were not for the fact that multilingualism is a necessity, in a few years time, we, the French MEPs in the European Parliament, would be calling for the right of our minority to speak our regional language."
". The Mavromatis report addresses one of the key factors in the success of the teaching and training of EU citizens, namely language skills."
"The Europe of the future needs citizens who are ready to respond to the challenges of the knowledge-based society. Accordingly, it is vitally important that they can communicate in at least two languages other than their mother tongue."
"I therefore believe that it is necessary to adopt an Indicator of Language Competence in order to bridge the current gap in verifiable data about the EU citizens’ language skills."
"It is unacceptable, however, that certain languages are favoured to the detriment of others, not least Portuguese, which is spoken by 200 million people and is the EU’s third most widely-spoken language in the world."
"Quite apart from this language indicator, there is an alarming political indicator emerging from the report before us, namely that of a Europe that focuses more on itself than on the world around it, and of a Europe that values its languages on the basis of internal demographics, which may work out very well for some, but which is politically unacceptable in terms of the founding principles of the EU."
"For these reasons, I voted against the Mavromatis report."
". The enlargement of language knowledge brings an added value to individuals, and represents a vital tool for mutual understanding between countries, communities and cultures."
"In other words, it is crucial for a Europe seeking unity in diversity."
"The lack of data on the citizens’ language skills means that there needs to be a system whereby progress towards attaining the objective laid down by the Barcelona European Council of developing the EU’s education and training systems into a world-renowned centre of excellence can be measured."
"The European Indicator of Linguistic Competence could prove a valuable instrument for obtaining reliable data on the language skills of Europeans, facilitating exchange of good practice and giving fresh impetus to language teaching."
"I feel it is essential that European language policy should not reflect an idea of an insular Europe."
"In this regard, I would like to reiterate the need to bring into this debate the concept of a European language of universal communication."
"English, Spanish, Portuguese and French, in that order, along with, to some extent, German and Italian, are special vehicles of communication with the rest of the world and as such deserve preferential support and encouragement from the EU."
"– I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 27 April 2006."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I regret that I have some sad news to communicate to you: the passing of our fellow Member, Professor Rolandas Pavilionis"
"Mr Pavilionis was a fervent defender of human rights, he fought actively for Lithuania’s independence and then for his country’s accession to the Union, before being elected a Member of the European Parliament."
"Before that accession, Professor Pavilionis had taken part in the work of the Convention on the future of Europe."
"He was highly active in the fields of education, science and culture and I would like to stress his position as rector of the University of Vilnius."
"We shall all remember him for his work in our Parliament, as a member of the Committee on Culture and Education."
"He was vice-chairman of his Group, the Union for Europe of the Nations, in which he was greatly valued by his fellow Members for his intellectual qualities."
"I would also like to inform you that tomorrow there will be a book of condolence in front of the Chamber, which will be open for all Members and anybody who wants to record a final remembrance to sign."
"I would now ask that we observe a minute’s silence in his memory."
"Mr Hans-Peter Martin has the floor for a point of order."
"Would you please kindly tell me which Rule of the Rules of Procedure your point of order relates to."
"– Mr President, I refer to Rules 132 and 142 of the Rules of Procedure."
"This European Parliament, here in Strasbourg, reeks of corruption."
"I ask you to do something about it, to defend the dignity of this House of ours, to allocate speaking times in such a way that …"
"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 11 May 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed."
"Pursuant to Rule 168 of the Rules of Procedure, the Confederal Group of the European United Left-Nordic Green Left has requested the referral back to committee of the report by Mr Speroni on the request for waiver of the immunity of Tobias Pflüge, the vote on which is scheduled for tomorrow."
"– Mr President, my group, on the basis of Rule 168 of the Rules of Procedure, wishes to move that the Speroni report – which has to do with the lifting of the immunity of Mr Pflüger, a member of our group – should not be discussed, but should instead be sent back to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"I see this as being the appropriate decision to take, since the fact that the decision as to whether or not to lift immunity was taken by a mere eight members of the Committee on Legal Affairs shows us in a poor light, and that is something we should avoid."
"Any one of us could end up having our immunity suspended, but it is intolerable that less than a third of the Members who actually work in the relevant committee should actually be present to vote on it, and so I ask that we should send the report back to the Committee rather than having a vote on it."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by asking you to reject this motion as inadmissible."
"The immunity procedure is subject to Rule 7, which has the last word to say on the subject."
"Rule 7 (8) states that: ‘The report of the committee shall be placed at the head of the agenda of the first sitting following the day on which it was tabled.’"
"The Rule goes on to say that: ‘The proposal(s) for a decision contained in the report shall be put to the vote at the first voting time following the debate.’"
"That is a binding rule, the purpose of which is to speed up the immunity procedure, and if this motion were to be permitted, it would be virtually capable of annulling it."
"If you do not reject this motion as inadmissible, I would nevertheless ask that it be thrown out altogether on the grounds of irrelevance. The reason why it is irrelevant is that the resolution we, in the Committee on Legal Affairs, adopted was adopted unanimously, that this resolution is not a matter of dispute between the groups, and also that there is no doubt about the procedure that Rule 7 (8) lays down to deal with it."
"If you object to the substance of this motion, then all you have to do is to vote against it."
"If it then gets majority support, the result is automatically reversed."
"It therefore makes no sense that this matter be either adjourned or deferred, and so I ask that this motion for a resolution be voted on in the plenary tomorrow."
"– Mr President, like many other Members, I have had to consider this issue in the Conference of Presidents, but, not being a lawyer like Mr Lehne, I had imagined it would be rather more straightforward."
"Now, though, the lawyers have spoken, and I have to concede that I did not understand what Mr Lehne said, but perhaps that is my fault."
"I do not, right now, want to weigh up the pros and cons of Mrs Kaufmann’s and Mr Lehne’s arguments, but I do have a request to make; it is that we should stipulate that immunity matters no longer be dealt with by the Committee of Presidents, since I, as a group chairman, do not feel equal to dealing with such a complex process."
"My sense of justice has led me to agree to this matter being referred back, since if, in a committee, only eight people vote and certain groups are not represented at all, I think it would be fairer and better to avoid a formal error and send the matter back."
"If, though, sending it back results in one being committed, then that is something we will have to live with."
"Having been shown where I was wrong, I think we should do as Mr Lehne suggests, but I would, at the same time, ask that immunity cases be in future considered only in the plenary."
"Mr President, this is wrong: you give the floor to someone who was supposed to speak in favour of the proposal, and here he is speaking against it."
"That is wrong."
"A decision must be made."
"The Rules of Procedure are clear; they make provision for one speaker in favour and one speaker against."
"I, for my part, wanted to come out in favour, and I am going to do so."
"I find that, if …"
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, I am taking the microphone from you because I did not ask you to take the floor."
"Please sit down and wait."
"I gave Mr Schulz the floor in order to speak in favour."
"Mr Schulz has not in fact used it for that purpose."
"I therefore believe that we should start the speeches again and ask whether anybody wants to speak in favour."
"Mr President, a group submitted this request to amend the agenda armed with a very clear supporting argument."
"Given that there were not enough Members present at the committee responsible - which implies that what Mr Lehne said, namely that all the groups are in agreement, cannot be true, since those who were not there were unable to say whether or not they agreed - it now falls to the plenary to decide to refer the matter back to the committee so that, in a month's time or even at the mini-session, if that were possible, we might vote on this subject."
"Therefore, it is only a question of postponing the vote by two weeks."
"Mr Lehne, you have already spoken."
"This is the way things work in a Parliament: the person who speaks last is often right."
"I therefore call on Parliament to support the proposal made by Mrs Kauffmann."
"– Mr President, questions of immunity ought to be dealt with either by the immunity committee or by the whole House."
"I would like to ask, again, that immunity matters no longer be brought before the Committee of Presidents, since I do not see that as a place in which I am in a position to rule on them."
"I said nothing more than that, nor did I wish to do so."
"I will, in any case, as the Chairman of a group, no longer take part in such debates in the Conference of Presidents."
"We have taken note of your concern, Mr Schulz."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that the vote on the report by Reinhard Rack (A6-0408/2005) on improving the environmental performance of the freight transport system (‘Marco Polo II’) be moved to Wednesday."
"The Council has informed me – and I am passing this information on to you – that it will not be able to stay here beyond 7.00 p.m."
"This has been discussed in the Conference of Presidents and the Council has confirmed that it cannot stay here beyond 7.00 p.m."
"Questions to the Council will therefore only last one hour."
"– Mr President, while I cannot at the moment name the rule, I refer to what you have just said about the Council."
"I would like to say in this plenary what I said in the Conference of Presidents about the Council’s announcement of its inability to be present."
"I do not regard a statement of that sort on the part of the Council as one that this House should accept."
"As I understand it, the Austrian Government is composed of 16 members and has 16 secretaries of state, which adds up to 32 people who ought to be in a position to represent the Council, even after seven in the evening."
"I think it is quite improper that a Council Presidency should declare itself unable to be present here after 7 p.m with no better reason than that Parliament's calendar has changed."
"I would like to know just what would happen in a national parliament if an executive were to tell it that it was knocking off for the evening at seven."
"That is not acceptable, and you should tell the Council so."
"Mr President, following what you have just announced, I must draw the attention of the House to the fact that there is an oral question to the Council on Wednesday night’s agenda regarding the Energy Community Treaty, which we are due to debate that night."
"If the Council cannot be there, I suggest we withdraw that item and the discussion of assent to the Treaty from the agenda until the Council can be present."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in this House have a monitoring role, and so, just as we, as matter of course, expect the Commission to be present, so we also expect the Council to be here."
"I am not talking here about the presidency, but about the Council as such."
"In particular, I ask the General Secretariat of the Council, to advise the Council in such a way that its presence is assured, and it follows that we endorse what Mr Schulz had to say, as he was quite right to do."
"– Mr President, being an Austrian myself, I would like to make a suggestion of a pragmatic nature."
"This is obviously about the Council wanting, come what may, to catch the eight o’clock flight back to Austria."
"Perhaps, Mr President, you would inform the Council that there is also a train that runs between Strasbourg and Vienna, which makes it no problem at all to actively participate in the sitting here and be in good time for the Parliament in Vienna the following morning."
"All that needs to be done is to fly a bit less and perhaps do without a few luxuries."
"I shall communicate all of the comments made here to the Council."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has requested that a third debate be added on cases of violations of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, specifically on Taiwan."
"Mr President, first I should like to add the support of my group for the statements made by Mr Schulz and Mr Poettering in favour of the Austrian Presidency looking again at its availability."
"The Conference of Presidents last week agreed on only two subjects for debate in our regular ‘urgencies’ slot on Thursday; normally we debate three."
"My group put forward a proposal to the Conference of Presidents that we debate the issue of Taiwan’s membership of the World Health Organisation."
"That proposal fell because it was not supported by either of the two major groups – the PPE-DE Group and the PSE Group."
"Health is widely considered these days to be a human right."
"It is an issue that needs our discussion and therefore my group wishes to propose to this House that we use the third slot available on Thursday afternoon for consideration of the issue of Taiwan’s participation in the World Health Organisation."
"Mr President, my fellow Member, Mr Watson, is a very intelligent and very astute person."
"I do not believe that he can look us in the eye and seriously say to us that we are talking about a human rights issue here."
"We are talking about something altogether different, as everyone knows; we are also talking about something that runs counter to the position held by the international community."
"I therefore believe that we should not support this proposal."
"– Mr President, I think it is a splendid idea on Mr Watson’s part to put this matter on the order of business."
"It is a disgrace that Taiwan, the only Chinese state with a democratic system, is not allowed even observer status at the World Health Organisation."
"This House would be very well advised to discuss this issue and make it known to the whole world that we believe health to be a human right and that no country in the world should be barred from the deliberations of the World Health Organisation."
"(1)"
"Mr President of the Republic of Bolivia, I would like to welcome you to the plenary of the European Parliament at a time when Europe’s relations with Latin America and the Caribbean are highly topical and are being debated between us."
"Just three days ago, the leaders of our two continents held their fourth Summit in Vienna, in which you played an important role."
"It is a pleasure for the European Parliament to receive you as President-elect of Bolivia, the first President of indigenous ethnicity, of the Aymara, whose three fundamental principles are contained in their three wise sayings, : do not steal, : do not be weak, : do not lie."
"The President of Bolivia was born in a poor and out-of-the-way town in Bolivia, in Isavalli, in the canton of Orinoca, very close to lake Poopó, in Oruro."
"These names sound remote to us because they do not fall within our normal geographical references."
"From childhood he was a farm worker, he looked after his family’s herd of llama, he worked as a brickmaker, a bricklayer, a baker and a trumpet player."
"Then, when the Bolivian high plateau suffered one of the most serious droughts in its history, his family emigrated to new pastures, to Cochabamba."
"There he embarked upon a trade union and political career that has led him to the Presidency of his country, the second poorest country in Latin America, after Haiti, but which has the second largest gas reserves in the whole of Latin America; a country in which two-thirds of the population live in poverty, and which, throughout its history, since it achieved its independence, has had difficult relations with its neighbours, a country which today is seeing the emergence of new political forces, such as that of the President, who has won the elections with 53% of the vote and who, as you know, is proposing political measures relating to the nationalisation of the energy industry and investments made there by many European companies, something which we undoubtedly have an interest in debating."
"I would therefore like to thank you for coming here, Mr President, and not just for speaking to plenary, but also for agreeing to take part in a debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the dinner that will follow it."
"Please believe me, Mr President, that we very much appreciate your visit, because it was clearly acknowledged in Vienna by many Latin American Heads of State that the return to democracy in the region has unfortunately not led to any improvement in the living conditions of a large proportion of the Latin American population."
"Europe and Latin America are determined to try to build a cohesive society and Bolivia is a clear example of the essential need to include a very significant proportion of its population in human development, since they have not benefited from the natural wealth of their country."
"We will also have the opportunity to discuss this within the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly, the creation of which was decided upon at the Vienna Summit."
"I hope that it will provide us with new opportunities for political dialogue."
"Mr President, your visit today is both symbolic and multi-faceted, because it reflects the European Parliament’s commitment to enhancing relations with Latin America, it reflects the importance of parliamentary diplomacy and it reflects the role that dialogue must play in resolving any conflicts that may arise amongst us."
"Thank you once again, Mr President. You have the floor."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, through the Members of this Parliament, I would like to send a special, warm and brotherly greeting to all of the people of Europe."
"I am extremely pleased and happy to have been invited to take part in this hugely significant meeting of two continents: America and Europe."
"I am honoured, pleased and proud to be here with you and I have come accepting an invitation not just to speak to you, but also to listen to you."
"We original indigenous farming peoples of America, and of Bolivia in particular, belong to a culture of dialogue, a culture of life, a culture of balance, justice and equality."
"As the President of the European Parliament said, I come from a very humble family, from the Aymara nation."
"Historically we have been excluded, but we do not exclude anybody."
"Historically we have been enslaved, but we have never enslaved anybody else’s family; we are inclusive, we fight for unity while respecting the diversity of other peoples and when, thanks to the conscience of my people, we won the Presidency as indigenous people, it was not through a sense of revenge, but through our peoples’ sense of hope."
"The absence of the State in our indigenous farming communities has left much to be desired and we therefore want to resolve the social problems, the cultural problems, the economic problems and the structural problems of my country."
"With regard to health, there are farming communities with no resources for resolving health problems; traditional medicine is not recognised and there is no policy for recovering it."
"We recognise that some progress has been made through the participation of UNESCO."
"The issue of education has been abandoned."
"You may be interested to know that my mother – may she rest in peace –was illiterate and my father could hardly write; he was also illiterate."
"My parents had no documentation."
"During our short time in government, therefore, during the almost 110 days of the Presidency, we have begun to work on literacy, thanks to unconditional cooperation from certain Latin American, European and Asian countries."
"At the end of this month nearly 2 000 people will have completed their literacy studies."
"We want to eradicate illiteracy in my country."
"With regard to the issue of documentation, we are making progress, also thanks to solidarity from other countries."
"So far we are told that almost 50 000 people have been provided with documents free of charge (indigenous farming families; particularly women) thanks to international cooperation."
"And in terms of documentation, there are families that have been entirely abandoned; they have no documents and they therefore do not have certain rights as citizens."
"This is an issue of great concern in my country."
"I know that here in Europe and in certain continents, man’s best friend, the dog, has a passport in order to be able to travel from one country to another."
"Back in my country some of us do not have any documentation at all — no identity cards and no birth certificates — to enable us to take part in elections."
"We are therefore going to continue with our campaign for identification: in less than two months we have provided almost 50 000 new documents free of charge and we are going to go on to provide one or two million people with documents free of charge."
"Also thanks to cooperation from certain Latin American countries, we are carrying out campaigns to help the poorest families with regard to health."
"By means of eye operations, in less than two months we have cured 8 000 people free of charge."
"These are some of the social problems that we are facing in my country."
"This political movement, therefore, the Movement for Socialism, originally called the Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples, created by the Original Indigenous Farmers Movement, it has not been created by a group of political experts, or professionals or intellectuals, but it was born to fight injustice, to fight for economic and social demands, in 1995 in particular, to change our Bolivia, to put an end to discrimination, and in order to change those policies that have historically been geared towards the extermination of the original indigenous people in our country and our continent."
"We indigenous peoples are also human beings, we have the same rights, the same duties and we want to change."
"And I am happy to say that this political movement has brought me to the Presidency."
"I would like you to know that I did not unfortunately have the opportunity to study at university; the greatest asset that I and our movement have is honesty."
"I felt great respect and admiration for the President when he mentioned our ancestors’ cosmic law, the , which is the law of the original indigenous peoples: not to steal, not to be weak, not to lie."
"That principle of a cosmic law has brought us this far and it is my duty to apply our ancestors’ rule in order to change our history."
"I am sure that you have questions about many structural issues, many social issues."
"So far we have clearly decided to recover our natural resources, both renewable and non-renewable resources; natural resources that make it possible to resolve the social and economic problems of my country."
"I would like to mention the fight to defend the coca leaf, the fight for water, to prevent any privatisation of water resources, and the fight for hydrocarbons, which were also the fights of our ancestors, of indigenous leaders such as Tupac Amaru, Tupac Katari and Bartolina Sisa: it was the fight for territory."
"Bolivia has so much wealth, and yet so much poverty."
"We are not talking about distributing poverty, but rather about redistributing wealth and, in order to redistribute wealth, we have the obligation to recover it, through nationalisation."
"It is true that oil and natural resources were nationalised twice during the last millennium."
"And now, in this new millennium, my government and the Bolivian people must nationalise again, together with many social sectors, from both the countryside and from the city."
"I want you to understand that nothing will be expropriated and nobody will be expelled."
"I would like to be very frank and speak to you with the greatest of respect."
"Our families come to Europe because of a need, because of a lack of work, and many are being expelled."
"Historically, my country, my region, and indeed the whole of America, which used to be called Abya Ayala, has never expelled anybody."
"And with this nationalisation we are not going to expel anybody either."
"I understand perfectly well that they must recover their investment and they have the right to profits, but they cannot be owners of the hydrocarbons, and nor can they control them."
"The Bolivian State will be in control at the wellheads and inspection centres."
"Any company that has invested in the country has every right to recover their investment and has the right to make profits, but not to control, and they will therefore be partners and not owners of our natural resources."
"I very much regret that certain sections of the media wish to bring us into conflict with regions, with continents, with countries, with companies."
"We belong to a culture of solidarity, a culture of reciprocity and it is therefore important to seek solutions jointly."
"It is true that we need cooperation in this process of change in Bolivia, but I am also bringing you proposals to invite you to resolve the problems together, whether they be America’s or Europe’s problems."
"I understand that immigration is a problem for the Europeans."
"As a result of a lack of work, many people are abandoning America and Bolivia and coming to Europe."
"The only way to resolve this problem is to create sources of work in Bolivia, to guarantee markets for small-scale producers, for micro-businesspeople, for cooperatives, for associations, for communal companies."
"That will surely put an end to the mass invasion of this continent by Bolivians."
"The industrialisation of natural resources is important."
"You know that historically we have been subjected to the constant plundering of our natural resources."
"And while at certain times the State has controlled the natural resources, whether oil or minerals, it has not been able to carry out industrialisation, to give added value to these natural resources."
"Following nationalisation, our task will be to industrialise, together with our partners, whether they be States or companies."
"There will be no exclusion or marginalisation."
"We are convinced that the industrialisation of our natural resources will put an end to the mass abandonment of my country towards other countries."
"Before it was the United States or Argentina, but now I very much regret that many of our brothers and sisters are coming to Europe to seek sources of work."
"There is a central issue that is a problem for you and also a problem for us: cocaine and drug-trafficking."
"I would like to tell you that we original indigenous people do not have a culture of cocaine."
"We do not have a culture of drug-trafficking."
"Cocaine is a new problem that has unfortunately been imported."
"There must be a real and effective fight against drug-trafficking."
"The fight against drug-trafficking cannot be an instrument for domination, for recolonisation or submission."
"I regret that certain countries in America use the issue of drug-trafficking as an instrument for submission and subordination."
"I believe that we all have a responsibility to combat drug-trafficking effectively and genuinely."
"I would also like to say that coca is not cocaine."
"I have looked closely at the history of coca in Europe."
"European countries were the first to industrialise the coca leaf."
"We are talking about the 19th century."
"Only recently have Latin America and the United States begun to industrialise it."
"And the coca leaf cannot be legal for Coca-Cola, but illegal for the Andean region, for the indigenous peoples."
"I believe that it is important to revalue the coca leaf, but I would like to say that, while during my government there will never be free cultivation of coca, there will never be zero coca either."
"I am pleased to say that we are discussing with our brother producers of coca leaf how we can rationalise its production, and I would like to reassure you that we are talking about a small area of coca growing per family: 40 metres by 40 metres."
"We are perfectly well aware that a proportion of the coca leaf is diverted towards an illegal market and we do not find that acceptable."
"Policies of eradication with financial compensation and then eradication by military force have left much to be desired in terms of human rights and the only way to put an end to that confrontation is for coca production to be controlled by the farmers’ movement itself, to be rationalised and in that way to make the fight against drug-trafficking effective. The production of that small quota, of 40 x 40 metres — many people looking into this must have read about the so-called ‘cato’; the cato is not a question of hectares, it is 40 x 40 metres— must be controlled and its production used for legal consumption: what could be better than to industrialise for purposes that benefit Humanity."
"The fight against drug-trafficking cannot end with that control, however, but it is also important to control the forerunners, the chemical agents."
"And what better way is there than, together with you, to control banking secrecy."
"Because the real drug-trafficker is not the person who is currently in prison in Bolivia, but — we have investigated this over a short space of time — the person who is handling thousands of millions of dollars."
"They are not walking around or travelling on buses or lorries carrying piles of dollars."
"They use private banks."
"What could be better than to control private banking, the banks, including State banks, in order to put an end to this aspect of the drug-trafficking business."
"I would like to take this opportunity, through you, to tell all of the nations of Europe of my respect and admiration for the European Union."
"We in Bolivia also very much want the Andeans, the Latin Americans, the South Americans, to unite."
"That will be our responsibility."
"In this process it will surely require dialogue and patience in order to bring our countries together."
"I say this because we in Bolivia have decided to remodel Bolivia, to put an end to economic models that have not resolved the social problems, in order to change that colonial State."
"With the greatest of respect, I would also like to say that what we have at the moment is a colonial State."
"But we are not proposing an armed fight or change."
"I very much regret the fact that there are armed conflicts in certain countries neighbouring Bolivia."
"Thanks to this political movement, which has emerged from the historically most scorned and hated sector, the sector that has suffered most discrimination: the original indigenous people."
"Why am I talking about the original indigenous people?"
"The last census in 2001 showed that 62.2% of the country was made up of indigenous people."
"I would say that we original indigenous people make up more than 70% or almost 80%."
"Because, when Bolivia was founded in 1825, 90% of the population was made up of indigenous peoples but just 10% founded Bolivia."
"Nevertheless, that 90% took part in the fight for independence and now, democratically and peacefully, by remodelling Bolivia, we want to change and we want to carry out a democratic, cultural and peaceful revolution, preventing any confrontation."
"I believe that that will lead to a genuine change, which makes it possible to live in peace with social justice."
"I perfectly understand the countries and many businesspeople who want legal security."
"We are all fighting for legal security, but to that end it is important that we have social security, that we have health, education, housing, employment."
"That will happen when we recover our natural resources and when they benefit the whole of the Bolivian population."
"That is the transformation we want to see in the economic and political spheres."
"I am extremely happy with the support we are receiving from the Secretary-General of the United Nations."
"On the occasion of this Summit of Heads of State, of Presidents of Europe, of Latin America and of the Caribbean, I have been invited to a short meeting with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, who has promised me his full support for the constitutional assembly, both in terms of advice and in economic terms, in order to guarantee the in-depth democratic transformation of my country."
"I would like you, with your great experience, to be involved in this profound change."
"I am convinced that Europe is the symbol of democracy, and that it defends democracy and human rights."
"And on the subject of human rights, I would like in particular to ask you to help us defend them in Bolivia."
"And defending human rights in Bolivia means creating sources of work, health and education, and recovering our natural resources."
"I would like to say to you, with the greatest of respect, that there were certain governments in the past, during the dictatorships, that massacred the people."
"You are perfectly aware of Bolivia’s history."
"But democratic governments too, in order to defend interests other than Bolivia’s interests, massacred Bolivia and some of them escaped to the United States."
"Through the Bolivian judicial system, we have called for the extradition of those people who humiliated Bolivia and I would like to ask for your support in order to ensure that those people who have done so much to harm the human and economic rights of the Bolivian people are brought before Bolivian justice, including Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada and Sánchez Berzaín, who killed many people in my country and we want them to face the Bolivian judicial system."
"In this process of change, we are not just seeking political interaction, and understanding amongst countries, but also integration, by providing my country with a road structure."
"Bolivia, the heart of South America, has no access to the sea as a result of an historical injustice."
"My government can resolve this road structure problem with all of our neighbouring countries."
"We only have a section with Peru, but we do not have a hard road with Chile, or with Argentina via Potosí, or via Tarija, or via Brazil."
"I have great affection and respect for my friend the President of Brazil."
"It is not true that there is conflict between us, as some sections of the media would have you believe."
"We have a strategic alliance with the government of Brazil."
"I see Lula, a former trade union leader, as an older brother who gives me real guidance."
"I would also like some guidance from you here in Europe."
"I told you a moment ago that we are not exclusive, but rather inclusive."
"I want to learn from you, but essentially I want to learn how to seek solutions within a context of balance, justice and equality."
"That is my great wish and that is what we are fighting for."
"We in our government, a popular and indigenous government, now have the opportunity, with the support of many intellectual sectors and even business sectors in Bolivia — the middle class."
"My experience to date has been of certain of my fellow citizens saying two things to me: ‘I am not indigenous, but now I am an indigenist’."
"They say: ‘the governments used to make us cry with depression, now our governments make us cry with emotion, with dignity, a sense of sovereignty, respect amongst us and above all a sense that we are recovering our natural resources’."
"I would therefore like to say to you, honourable Members of the European Parliament, that, through you, I would like to maintain a strategic alliance in favour of life, in favour of humanity."
"The way of life of the indigenous people does not involve exclusion or marginalisation, but rather — I would insist — it is solidarity, reciprocity, and not just amongst human beings, but it is also harmony with mother earth."
"We are extremely worried that the western model of industrialisation is affecting planet Earth, the mother earth: the ."
"If we do not revise this form of industrialisation, surely within a short space of time, not just you, or us, but everybody, is going to have a problem of life."
"I believe that it is important to take up initiatives and proposals that come from the people in order to defend and save Humanity, and that will be done essentially by respecting the mother earth, living in harmony with her."
"These are important contributions that we can make, on the basis of our way of life."
"Based on our native organisations, whether they be unions, communities, councils of the elderly, those authorities that hold continuous debates and propose solutions."
"I have learnt that it is not a question of imposing programmes or policies, but of taking up these proposals and programmes for the good of humanity."
"It is also the case that, in this process of change, how to participate in Bolivia is an important issue, and does not mean either subordination or submission — some have described us as ‘puppets’ — but rather we must share our principles and our experiences, in a horizontal fashion."
"We hope that this brief visit to the European Parliament can serve a purpose."
"We no longer want to be a beggar State."
"Bolivian Governments have generally looked outside of the country to seek aid, they begged for the country’s General Budget."
"We want to put an end to that."
"I am sure that by increasing export volumes and by improving prices — a rational price, not blackmailing or imposing prices — and by recovering our natural resources, we will put an end to that beggar State."
"I very much regret that we have a beggar State and together with you, by reviewing our history, we would like now in this new millennium to resolve those social and cultural problems."
"On behalf of the Bolivian people, particularly on behalf of the original indigenous movement, I would like to say that we want strategic allies in our defence of life."
"We want to put an end to that hate, that racism, that contempt."
"We are from an inclusive culture, not an exclusive one, despite the fact that we have been subjected to exclusion, and when I heard that the European Parliament had invited me here, I genuinely felt very happy and very proud to come."
"I want you too to feel proud of the original indigenous peoples, who defend life."
"It is an honour for me, and a new experience, although we are always nervous at the outset — forgive me — but I would like to say, from the heart and with the greatest of respect, that I would like your support in our work of saving the life and improving the social and cultural situation of my country."
"Thank you very much."
"Mr President of the Republic of Bolivia, thank you very much for your words, spoken from the heart, and which the Members of this Parliament have applauded in the manner you have just witnessed."
"Mr President, you are the democratically elected representative of your people, you have presented an electoral programme that your citizens have supported and you are inspired by the best of intentions to achieve prosperity for all of them."
"I hope that Bolivia and Europe can maintain a relationship of cooperation which will enable us to contribute to building a shared future of progress, on the basis of respect for the rule of law."
"Thank you very much, Mr President."
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Mr President, with countries that have energy sources – such as Russia, Bolivia, etc. – aiming to get consumer societies to agree to their requests or obey their dictates, we are facing a new stage in present-day tensions."
"If Europe wants to preserve energy and political independence from Russia, and not fall for deceptive words such as interdependence, the EU must plan the diversification of alternative sources rapidly and defend its various alternatives."
"Europe to be transferred into a department of an energy heartland – that is the Kremlin’s dream."
"Do we agree with that?"
"An even sweeter dream would be a new union replacing the old European one."
"The gas union of Russia and Europe is to be built around the Moscow-Berlin core axis."
"Such a vision was presented only slightly covertly in the Russian President’s recent state-of-the-nation address."
"Do we agree with this?"
"Mr President, a few days ago, this Parliament’s Bureau rejected the use of Catalan and the other co-official languages of the Spanish State between the citizens and this institution, which should be the institution closest to and most representative of their interests."
"The Spanish Government’s proposal is already a reality in other European institutions: in the Council of Ministers, in the Commission and in the Committee of the Regions, where it already operates quite normally."
"The proposal implies no cost for Parliament and it is clearly not at the expense of the implementation of the other official languages of the new member countries."
"In fact, this initiative would help to bring the citizens closer to the European institutions."
"The General Union of Workers, one of Spain’s largest unions, has therefore embarked upon a campaign calling for support for this initiative, because it believes that it would promote social cohesion."
"As a defender of cultural diversity, the European Parliament cannot and must not be the only institution not to implement this right of more than twelve million citizens."
"Incidentally, did you know that Catalan is the fourth most widely used language in the forum for debate that the Commission has put in place on the future of Europe?"
"I would ask you please to look once again at this request in the Bureau, because it would help to bring the citizens closer to Europe and to all of their fellow citizens."
"I am pleased that the European Union is making the right moves in the battle with Lukashenko's dictatorship, because we, as Europeans, must not support this dictatorship at the heart of the continent."
"However, I have here a list of European Union cities from various states and regions, which have cooperative, brotherly ties with various Belarusian cities and regions."
"And as we know, in Belarusian cities there are loyal servants of Lukashenko's regime and they are the people who are supporting the dictatorship."
"Therefore we, Members of the European Parliament, must urge European Union city leaders to suspend official relations with the servants of Lukashenko's regime."
"There is no doubt that our European cities must maintain ties with Belarusian cities in the areas of culture, sports and education."
"However, our city leaders, city leaders of the European Union states, must not legitimise or recognise Lukashenko's dictatorship by maintaining relations with the official servants of the regime."
"I believe that we must make some sort of decision or position on this matter."
"– Mr President, political detainees in Russia are in a very bad position."
"The case of Mikhail Khodorkovsky is a concrete example of how various means are used to break them down both mentally and physically."
"Whilst Platon Lebedev received inadequate treatment for his serious illness north of the Arctic Circle, Khodorkovsky was attacked in his cell by night."
"No precise evidence is available as to what happened."
"That such a thing should occur is incomprehensible in view of the fact that the prisoners are under permanent observation."
"This occurrence confirms the dire conditions in Russian prisons."
"Russia’s holding the presidency of the Council of Europe offers an opportunity to approach it and call upon its government to agree to Khodorkovsky and Lebedev receiving the independent medical examination that has hitherto been denied them."
"I call on the Council to bring influence to bear on Russia in order that the human rights of those it holds in prisons may be secured."
"Mr President, a version of the envisaged North of Ireland Assembly has reconvened today in Belfast."
"The Assembly and its power-sharing executive have been suspended by the British Government since 2002."
"Sinn Féin is committed to seeing local ministers make local decisions."
"At present, British ministers make all policy decisions in the North of Ireland, yet are not accountable to voters there."
"It is time for Ian Paisley’s Democratic Unionist Party to move forward with the rest of us, on the basis of equality, to fully restore the North of Ireland Assembly and the power-sharing executive."
"The recent sectarian killing of Catholic teenager Michael McIlveen shows that much change is still needed in our society."
"Continued assistance and support at European level are also needed."
"– Mr President, the month of May this year marked the 61st anniversary of the end of Hitler's barbarity against Europeans and Jews."
"However, it has been 87 years since the barbaric genocide of Turkish Greeks by Kemal Ataturk."
"On 19 May 1919, he entered the city and slaughtered 490 000 people."
"The Black Sea turned red."
"Observers at the time said that there were squares piled with the heads of innocent people."
"The only difference is that post-Hitler Germany said sorry."
"Turkey has never said sorry, either for the genocide of the Turkish Greeks or for the genocide of the Armenians."
"On the contrary, the other day it coerced the French parliament into withdrawing the Armenian genocide bill and three days ago in Vienna Mr Erdogan embarrassed the Greek prime minister because we want to acknowledge the genocide of the Turkish Greeks."
"People do not forget history, they relive it."
"I therefore want the European Parliament to take an initiative to recognise the memory of the genocide of the Turkish Greeks."
"( Mr President, last Wednesday we received the sad news of the death of our colleague Rolandas Pavilionis."
"We recently worked together in the Committee on Culture and Education."
"His position was that of member and coordinator for the Union for Europe of the Nations Group."
"We will all remember his commitment and his dedication to cultural matters, as well as the openness and kindness he showed to his colleagues."
"His passing away is a great loss."
"On behalf of my colleagues from the UEN Group, and also on behalf of all Polish MEPs, I would like to offer my condolences to his family."
"Mr President, last week was the 61st anniversary of the end of the Second World War."
"It was the most tragic war in human history and it deserves to be commemorated."
"We need to build a future together in Europe, but in order to lay the foundations for that future we must pay tribute to those who died and learn the painful lesson of history."
"I say this as a Pole, aware that the Second World War claimed 6 million of my fellow citizens, both Poles and Jews."
"We should remember them with the greatest reverence, just as we should remember the many other victims of that historical catastrophe."
"We live in a Europe full of difficult challenges, a Europe of peace."
"This peaceful Europe is our joint achievement but it is, therefore, all the more important to remember those who did not taste happiness and peace."
"Their memory should be what unites us all in Europe."
"Mr President, in Ireland last week we saw the horrors of trafficking when a programme was broadcast on RTE television about young women from Romania being trafficked into the EU, and into Ireland in particular."
"The programme showed that, unfortunately, Ireland is one of a small number of countries that has failed to implement various EU directives on combating trafficking."
"It is important to point out that, as a cross-border activity, trafficking knows no borders."
"All European countries should implement all the various directives as required."
"I would call on the Irish Minister for Justice to do just that, because trafficking is a terrible abuse."
"It is growing in reach and is affecting young girls and women in particular."
"It was a great shame to see that Ireland was one of the countries not implementing the required directives, and I would hope that our government will change that and immediately implement them."
"– Mr President, a study published on 8 May by the non-governmental organisation 'Save the Children' revealed that underage children are prey to sexual exploitation in the refugee camps in Liberia, including by members of humanitarian organisations and soldiers from the multinational peacekeeping forces."
"The European Parliament should, first of all, be officially informed by the UN as to the extent of these tragic events, which blacken every concept of humanitarian aid, and should condemn politically and legally this conduct on the part of the soldiers who, according to the information in the study, have acquired the mentality and conduct of mercenaries, conduct which is beyond any concept of impartial humanitarian aid."
"At the same time, however, the governments and the Commission itself should make the corresponding moves, so that we can all, if nothing else, give children the minimum human right to bread and water without the need for them to debase themselves body and soul."
"Mr President, I should like to ask those in this House to imagine themselves as an 18-year old on holiday in another country."
"You take a taxi, it turns into a nightmare."
"There are no witnesses, but the taxi driver ends up dead and you go straight to the first police station."
"You say he pulled a gun on you and what happened was self-defence on your part."
"That leads to a legal process lasting 18 years."
"You spend these 18 years in prison, away from your family, enduring a legal process that goes back and forth, condemning you to death, then finding you innocent, then starting again until every appeal is exhausted and you are finally condemned to death a second time."
"Eighteen years – half your life – in prison, with some of that time on death row, is punishment enough."
"That is the terrible story of my constituent, Mirza Tahir Hussain, condemned to death early next month."
"Mr President, if there is anything this Parliament can do, with its long history of opposition to the death penalty, I implore you to do so by writing to the President of Pakistan appealing for clemency."
"Mr President, for the past two weeks, the Dutch press has been dining out on the vulnerable position in which Commissioner Mrs Kroes finds herself, having already been questioned by this House in 2004."
"The questions mainly concentrated on some of her business dealings with entrepreneurs who seek to increase their profits by flouting the law or by deliberately acting against the general interest."
"Mrs Kroes’ answer, at the time, was that she had learned from her previous mistakes."
"She was reported to have ended all her business interests and relations prior to her possible appointment."
"It was in part this undertaking that meant that she was eventually considered an acceptable candidate by a majority in this House."
"Meanwhile, it has transpired that until 2006, she was the beneficiary of a guarantee in respect of losses made on office blocks which she owned in two Dutch towns, and which were worth EUR 7 million."
"The person who guaranteed those office blocks, and as appeared subsequently, her own private dwelling as well, has once again been arrested on suspicion of being the financial brain behind a very violent criminal syndicate that has been known to murder people."
"Mr President, how will Parliament be informed about this and how can this Parliament speak out about the risks and implications?"
"Mr President, I appeal to the Members of the European Parliament, and to Mr Poettering in particular, but also to other public figures and those who are waging a campaign of terror in the mass media, to cease manipulating, blackmailing and exerting pressure on the democratically elected Polish Government."
"In our opinion, interpreting solidarity on energy issues as submissiveness and acquiescence and coercing countries into accepting the European Constitution are forms of economic and political intimidation well known to Poles from the period of Soviet occupation."
"Fortunately, we do not play democracy by ear in Poland, which is, however, something we see during votes in the European Parliament."
"We demand that the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States ratified by the UN in 1974 be observed."
"Article 1 of this Charter reads as follows: ‘Every State has the sovereign and inalienable right to choose its economic system as well as its political, social and cultural systems in accordance with the will of its people, without outside interference, coercion or threat in any form whatsoever.’"
"Mr President, on 22 January a demonstration was held in Madrid in support of the victims of terrorism, which was attended by the then Minister for Defence, who was jeered by many of the demonstrators."
"That Minister insisted that he had been assaulted during that demonstration and, as a result, two People’s Party activists were arrested by officers of the National Police, despite the fact that there was no evidence against them."
"There were political orders, however."
"Those arrests were illegal, since they breached constitutional rights, and judges have therefore sentenced three police officers to terms in prison for that crime of illegal detention, which, as the sentence indicates, was an unmotivated, arbitrary, abusive and illegal detention."
"When these events took place, the Minister for Home Affairs, who at the time was Mr Alonso, who still holds a post within my country’s Socialist government, endorsed in Congress the actions of the police that he was in charge of."
"In other words, he endorsed an attack against Spanish democracy, which was the arrest of these People’s Party activists despite the lack of evidence against them."
"Now this Minister is washing his hands of the affair and, far from accepting his responsibility, he is protecting himself through the resignation of a second-rank political figure."
"We are therefore denouncing this case in the European Parliament today and my Group will be asking the Commission and the Council about this issue which is casting a shadow upon a Member State of the European Union."
"Mr President, the historically most extensive enlargement of the European Union was two years old on May 1."
"In its latest announcement, the Commission emphasised that accession has brought economic perspective and resources for new Member States, and a new momentum and a larger market for old Member States."
"In spite of the fears, social dumping has not materialised, and wage levels and social resources in Western Europe have not dropped."
"Therefore, let us put a stop to the initial distrust between the two camps, and let us show European citizens the true effect of accession, because in our globalising world neither the new, nor the old Member States stand any chance of remaining in the competition without the European Union."
"The first signs of working together without distrust are already noticeable in the compromises reached in handling the Services Directive and the Financial Perspective."
"We must join our efforts to speed up the transformation of the structure and decision making of the European Union, because it is possible to adopt a Constitutional Treaty, and it must be done."
"My wish for all of us is that we draw faith and courage for our work from the second anniversary of the last enlargement."
"Mr President, the city of Strasbourg is today hosting the , women from Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, who have come to meet other women from their countries living in Europe."
"They want to demonstrate the fact that they have been fighting for a long time for their rights and for the developments that have taken place in their respective countries: the right to move and work, and to educate their children."
"These women have come to Strasbourg, the seat of the European Parliament, in order to call on us to support their work by taking action here, in Europe, against the attempts to bring about a return to the obscurantism to which they can fall victim not only in their own countries, but also here."
"A delegation of these courageous women is currently present in the galleries of our Chamber."
"I would be grateful to you if you would kindly extend to them the warmest of welcomes and show them your support, for example in Broglie square, in Strasbourg, where one of their demonstrations will be taking place."
"Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"Thank you, Mrs Roure, and thank you to our visitors."
"Mr President, I would like to call on the Council and the Commission to take another look at the situation with regard to the sugar regime in the European Union."
"In particular, they should now consider bringing in flexibility with regard to the compensation payments to sugar beet growers and sugar producers who have lost their livelihoods, and targeting those resources instead towards the creation of alternative energy crops and alternative fuels."
"This would require the Commission to make a decision that compensation can be given for new processing methods without actually taking away the structure of the manufacturing capacity that is available for these alternative fuels in many Member States."
"That can help to eliminate or to reduce our dependence on oil, it can also contribute towards a cleaner environment and, most importantly of all, it can offer many farmers around the European Union a valuable crop to grow, which would guarantee them economic security for the future."
"– Last week, the so-called Middle East quartet, which includes the EU, decided to set up a temporary international mechanism to provide humanitarian aid for the Palestinian people."
"This decision follows moves, of which the United States was the leading proponent, to isolate the Palestinian Authority, namely the suspension of funding for the running of the Authority."
"In the context of the occupation and oppression by the Israeli Government, this measure will have the objective effect both of hastening the collapse of the Palestinian Authority – and consequently public services such as education and health – and of exacerbating the already desperate situation in which the Palestinians live, a situation that the United Nations had warned would arise."
"This unjustifiable punishment of the Palestinian people is happening at a time when the Israeli Government, having breached all agreements, is continuing to pursue its policy of violating international law and of failing to comply with United Nations resolutions, is maintaining its military occupation, is continuing to build the fence and is threatening once again to strengthen settlements in the West Bank."
"Mr President, the time has come to put an end to what are effectively sanctions and to take political initiatives that promote compliance with international law and with United Nations resolutions."
"Mr President, each village and town in England has a line around it for planning purposes, stating that it is a defined village or town settlement."
"However, we are now witnessing the erosion of the traditional communities and destruction of our landscape due to the total disregard for sensible and locally acceptable planning developments."
"You might ask who is responsible for this."
"Have a guess: the regional assemblies accountable directly to Brussels."
"Is this surprising?"
"Not at all, when you consider that planning applications and projects are no longer discussed with the people that they affect."
"To protect England’s precious greenbelt land and to end overdevelopment and towns merging, we have to abolish these unwanted and undemocratic assemblies and return planning issues to where they have been dealt with traditionally: town halls."
"Then, and only then, will our greenbelt land be given the protection and respect it deserves."
"Mr President, I wish briefly to take issue with what Mrs Krupa – who unfortunately has now left the Chamber – said a minute ago."
"She made a statement comparing the European Union to the Soviet Union."
"I must say that it is not a fair comparison."
"I shall just relate one little anecdote."
"Mr Prodi, the previous President of the Commission, went to Estonia before it joined the European Union."
"He was asked why Estonia should join the European Union, since it was just like the Soviet Union."
"He thought for a while and said that it was a valid point, but he could not exactly remember when Estonia applied for membership of the Soviet Union."
"I think Mrs Krupa should always keep that in mind when she thinks about Poland’s role in the European Union: it is there because membership is in its interests and came about through a democratic process."
"– Mr President, the Galician language is one of the oldest Romance languages. It survived for centuries with no institutional protection, thanks to the will of its citizens, until democratic Spain recognised its official status and its right to be used by the citizens."
"I therefore deplore the Bureau’s decision to reject the reasonable use of this language within the context of Parliament’s relations with the citizens."
"I regret that it has taken the opposite view to that adopted by other Community institutions, thereby showing a lack of democratic coherence."
"It is an unfair and disproportionate decision, and I would therefore ask that it be reconsidered."
"Galician Literature Day will be held on Wednesday, during this part-session."
"Aware of your work in this field, Mr President, I would therefore ask you to send a message of support for this Day, which recognises the European vocation of the Galician language and its contribution to the Union’s cultural diversity and wealth."
"Tomorrow we will await the European Commission's Convergence Report covering Lithuania."
"I hope that this will recognise that Lithuania has made strong economic progress and satisfies many of the criteria laid down in the Maastricht Agreement."
"The acceptance of Lithuania to the Euro zone should not be delayed on the grounds of a slight mismatch with the inflation indicator, because, according to the Treaty Establishing the European Community, inflation criteria can be interpreted quite broadly."
"Lithuania has not used artificial measures to reduce inflation, and the somewhat higher level of inflation has been caused by rises in the cost of global energy resources."
"I believe that Lithuania could be admitted to the Euro zone on economic grounds, bearing in mind its rapid economic growth."
"I would go so far as to say that this uncertainty in the application of the Maastricht criteria is a matter of political importance and should be included in the agenda of the summit of EU leaders in June."
"– Mr President, the period of reflection expires in 2007 and I imagine that it is for this reason that the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, presented the Commission's position last week."
"However, it is with regret that I see that the Commission has insisted on retabling the question of the European Constitution, without there having as yet been any pan-European consultation with citizens."
"During the same presentation, Mr Barroso also spoke about a citizens' agenda, with greater solidarity between citizens in future."
"I wonder what measures will be used to strengthen this solidarity: globalisation, the Lisbon Strategy or liberalisations?"
"To close, I believe that it is our duty, as an institution, to dedicate at least one more sitting of the European Parliament before the cut-off date of 2007 to debate this most serious issue."
"– Mr President, in the procedure to rekindle interest in the ratification of a European constitutional treaty, it would perhaps be useful to correct the text so that it supports institutions which have created and highlighted the particular character of European culture and the European economy."
"Today we are celebrating World Family Day and we see that the large majority of European men and women continue to create families and to support and be supported by the institution of the family."
"Let us not be influenced by the minorities."
"Of course, family policy must continue to be a matter for the Member States, but the inclusion of the family dimension in various Community policies will help to strengthen social cohesion and increase competitiveness and reduce socio-economic problems such as unemployment, poverty and reduced productivity."
"Apart from equality between men and women, apart from the rights of children, the difficulties encountered by every family during its creation and development need to be recognised, because these are the main reasons for Europe's demographic problem."
"In order for the European constitutional treaty to be accepted by European citizens, importance needs to be attached to the family and to traditional European values."
"– Mr President, I would like to say something today about the human rights situation in Romania, with specific reference to the MISA yoga school and the visa for its founder, Gregorian Bivolaru."
"On 21 October 2005, the Swedish supreme court ruled that Mr Bivolaru, the founder of the MISA yoga school, should not be handed over to the Romanian justice system on the grounds that his personal beliefs meant that he could not expect a fair trial in Romania."
"He was granted political asylum in December of the same year."
"Proceedings in Romania against 39 persons associated with the MISA school of yoga have still not yet been concluded."
"Freedom of religion and an independent justice system are fundamental to the European Union, and Romania’s accession in 2007 is conditional upon them."
"Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accessions are, of course, on the order of business for tomorrow."
"I think it important that this House should continue to keep a very close eye on the human rights situation in both the present and future Member States."
"Mr President, I should like to submit a proposal concerning the human rights situation in Tunisia: this situation remains extremely worrying, as the President of the European Parliament highlighted only last week."
"Last week, members of the militia violently attacked several lawyers inside the Bar, which continues to be occupied by their fellow lawyers as a sign of protest against the project relating to the creation of a lawyers’ training institute, as provided for in the agreements between the European Commission and Tunisia."
"In actual fact, the project is designed systematically to bring the training of lawyers under control by placing it at the mercy of the political power and, more specifically, of the Ministry of Justice."
"We must strongly protest against this attack and show concern about the fate of our fellow lawyers, who are currently rallied in Tunis."
"The Congress of the Tunisian Human Rights League will take place next week."
"It is the first Human Rights League on the African continent."
"It has already been the subject of many European Parliament resolutions."
"Its Congress will take place in Tunisia, where the conditions and the atmosphere are currently atrocious."
"It would be helpful if official representatives from Parliament were sent there."
"Mr President, I should like to draw the House’s attention to the fact that this morning in Belfast the Northern Ireland Assembly came together, almost three-and-a-half years since it was elected."
"I should like to ask the President of Parliament to send a goodwill message to the Speaker of that Assembly in view of the difficult role and task she has ahead of her."
"The European Union has always been very supportive of my constituency of Northern Ireland."
"Mr Verheugen, who is here today, played a central role at one stage, a number of years ago."
"I thank the European Parliament and the Commission for their support in this regard."
"I would like to see a democratic, stable assembly in Northern Ireland, where we make our own decisions for our own people and are able to make those decisions work."
"– Mr President, a few days ago, at its invitation, I visited the , an animal protection organisation in Styria, and was very impressed to see what it does, not least, and particularly, since they are now starting to build up networks throughout Europe and to attempt to develop contacts in this Parliament too."
"Believing as I do that that is the right thing for them to do, I agreed to present a petition on an issue that is of recurrent concern to me, that of animal transport."
"As you all know, millions of animals are transported the length and breadth of Europe."
"The journeys take a very long time, the lorries used are full to bursting point, and the animals are short of water, food, and ventilation."
"To that must be added the fact that the people in charge of them are generally quite utterly inadequately trained for the job, that they are subject to too few controls and the penalties applicable are derisory."
"The present situation in this area is utterly unacceptable."
"The total time that live cattle spend in transit must be drastically reduced."
"I endorse the views expressed by the animal welfare organisation and would like to call on the Council, the Commission and the whole House to at last do something of practical usefulness in this regard."
"Mr President, two years have passed since the largest enlargement in the history of the European Union."
"During this time significant changes have occurred in the economic and social spheres."
"What we lack, however, is a substantial, overall assessment of these changes."
"It seems appropriate for the European Commission to prepare a document assessing the economic and social effects of enlargement for the Union as a whole, as well as for the new Member States which joined the structures of the Union two years ago."
"– It is exactly one year since the election in Ethiopia, when the people voted en masse for democracy and change."
"Through its mission, which I headed, the EU unfortunately had to conclude that the elections did not meet international standards, due to the lack of transparency of the count and, above all, due to the serious violations of human rights that took place."
"The main opposition leaders and thousands of people have been arrested and face the death penalty."
"What more needs to happen for the Council to take action and impose targeted sanctions on those in charge of the Addis Ababa regime, as it did in the case of Belarus?"
"What more needs to happen for the Commission and the Council to take action to secure the swift, unconditional release of the detainees?"
"The EU does make a difference in Addis Ababa."
"We must not let the people of Ethiopia down."
"Mr President, in Surinam, a country in South America, 25 000 people have been homeless since 7 May."
"There are 175 villages largely under water, and tens of thousands of people have fled."
"Surinam is one of the ACP countries, with which we in Europe deal through the Cotonou Agreement."
"Poverty reduction and schooling are seriously at risk."
"Last week, I asked the Commission to help via ECHO emergency aid."
"I should like to ask you, on behalf of this House, to convey to the people of Surinam and their Parliament our sympathy with their suffering."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the report (A6-0143/2006) by Mrs Kaufmann, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the outcome of the screening of legislative proposals pending before the Legislator [2005/2214(INI)]."
". – Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Verheugen’s initiative towards bringing about a marked improvement in European lawmaking, which will involve withdrawing 68 pending legislative proposals, hits the mark in no uncertain fashion."
"Public opinion in our own Member States has for some considerable time regarded the European Union as far too bureaucratic and as possessed of a mania for regulation, and so the time for facing up to this justified criticism is already overdue."
"At the end of the day, the bottom line is that the ‘less, but of better quality’ approach can bring dividends, and it would certainly be good for Europe and for its citizens, and so, Commissioner, with this approach to policymaking, you have the European Parliament – the directly elected representatives of the public – wholeheartedly and unreservedly alongside you, and I would add that it is not just the Commission, but also this House, that has work to do in this respect."
"The focus of my report, though, Commissioner, is not on the ‘whether’ but on the ‘how’; it has to do, firstly, with the question of how the Commission and Parliament work together as institutions, and, secondly, with the question of whether it takes Parliament’s legislative role sufficiently into account."
"As you know, the Commission’s announcement that pending legislative proposals would be withdrawn or amended was the cause of some excitement in our House, and not just from an institutional point of view."
"This House’s committees subjected the specific individual proposals to close examination, the upshot of which was an exchange of letters on the subject between the Presidents of our two institutions."
"In the case of certain of the proposals, Parliament does not share the Commission’s view, but the Commission has not changed its mind."
"It was almost exactly a year ago that Parliament and the Commission adopted a framework agreement that renewed the basis on which our two institutions work together, and so the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has examined not only the package you have announced in terms of its impact on the Treaties, but also, of course, the framework agreement itself, notably points 31, 32, and 33."
"Believing as we do that there is a need for legislation over and above the framework agreement, it is our expectation that the Commission will not turn a deaf ear to our proposals, but will instead endorse them in a spirit of sincere cooperation with Parliament."
"The first thing that has to be said is that it has become apparent from the whole affair that the agreement, which has generally been held to, that our House should be informed in advance of the Commission’s intentions, is just not enough."
"We must not only be informed in advance, but also informed in good time, and what that means is that Parliament should be in a position to do more than just give an opinion on the proposed withdrawal of proposals."
"The main thing we expect from this is that proper account should be taken of our opinion when the Commission takes its final decision; if, for compelling reasons, the Commission’s decision differs from our own, then we take it as read that we will at least be given an explanation as to why."
"That is why – secondly – the Commission must, in future, go about things in a different way, by adopting the discontinuity principle as practised at the national level."
"Every newly-appointed Commission should, immediately after taking office, draw up a list of the legislative proposals produced by its predecessor indicating which of the pending proposals it is planning to keep."
"There should also be an indication in the annual legislative and working programme of which of the proposals currently going through the lawmaking process are to be withdrawn or amended."
"Thirdly, as part of the present streamlining initiative, a package was submitted, containing both a list of proposals and an explanation of the package itself."
"Quite apart from the fact that I myself cannot see why the criterion of competitiveness should be declared to be an overriding principle and virtually ennobled, I want, in my role as rapporteur, to stress that an explanation of the package is precisely what we do not want in future, for it was the explanation of the package that was the cause of a certain amount of irritation, since it cannot be one of Parliament’s functions to explore the Commission’s thinking and match the principles set out in the explanation to the various proposals to which they relate; that is precisely what the Commission is supposed to do when it announces its intention of withdrawing or modifying certain proposals, and that is why we want, in future, to see every single proposal for withdrawal justified separately."
"I can tell the Commissioner that it is not only important from our point of view that this practice be adopted;"
"I also think it would be beneficial to the Commission, for, if you had explained your proposals one by one and item by item, I am sure you would not have got tangled up in the undergrowth of your own institution."
"You would then not have announced the withdrawal of the proposal for the Council resolution approving the European Community’s accession to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, without having already noticed that it had already been adopted."
"You can find it in the Official Journal, L 30, for the year 2005."
"The Commission really does not possess the authority to declare null and void laws that have already been adopted."
"If you had checked them one by one, you would not have announced the withdrawal of proposals that had already been withdrawn, for it is to be presumed that you would have noticed the mistake."
"My report has to do with the way in which our two institutions work together, an area in which little is laid down by the Treaty on the European Communities, which, I might add, gives the institutions in question – us in Parliament and in the Commission – discretion to determine the manner of their cooperation in a responsible way."
"It is my hope that my report will help to improve the EU’s institutional structures and to promote the duty of sincere cooperation between our two institutions."
"I wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the other groups for their good cooperation, which has made it possible for us to present this report without dissent."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is in the same constructive spirit in which the rapporteur has just spoken that I would like to reply on behalf of the Commission and say that the most important thing about this project is indeed that the institutions should cooperate closely with one another."
"I am most obliged to Mrs Kaufmann for having said that, considered from the political point of view, this project enjoys your House’s wholehearted support; although the debate we have just had has made that clear to me, it was important that it should be confirmed."
"I will also readily concede that there was room for improvement in the test run that we are discussing today, and I am quite sure that the Commission will accept many of the suggestions you have made in your report."
"I do not think that we will, in future, have any more grounds for complaint about cooperation in this matter."
"I would, though, very much like to set out once more what we have actually achieved."
"Current legislative procedures have been reviewed in the light of the new considerations and priorities that have recently emerged."
"What happened before they did so?"
"This Commission is concentrating its efforts on a strategy for growth and employment, and what we wanted to know was whether the proposals that were already on the table were congruent with this strategy’s objectives and priorities."
"Mrs Kaufmann will be aware that the problem with many of these proposals was that no assessment whatever of their eventual impact had been carried out, even though it was to be expected that some of them would have a massive effect on the economy."
"That is the second argument, for the Commission had in fact, in the previous year, already decided that no more proposals would be put forward without a broad-based and methodologically sound means of assessing their impact, and it was with this, too, in mind that the proposals were reviewed to determine whether they would be equal to the demands for quality lawmaking that we had newly devised."
"Lastly, too, there was also the question of whether specific proposals still stood a chance of being adopted, and that brings me to the point that you so rightly addressed."
"There were a number of proposals in respect of which your House did not share the Commission’s view, for example where the legal status of association and companies on a mutual basis is concerned, proposals in respect of which have been lying around in the Council for twelve years without the least thing being done with them."
"There is not the remotest indication of the Council actually wanting to do anything with these proposals, and one cannot but wonder whether they are perhaps unlikely to survive the political process, and whether one perhaps ought to think again and come up with something better."
"It is in precisely those cases in which your House has expressed misgivings that the Commission has announced the forthcoming close re-examination of the underlying issues – the social significance of which I acknowledge – and the possibility of our producing new proposals that would actually stand a chance of being considered within an appropriate period of time."
"Where justification is concerned, I am of one mind with you;"
"I do not believe that to be a problem in either political or legal terms."
"When the Commission took its decision, it had in its possession individual justifications for every single proposal."
"I am myself unable to explain to you why these individual justifications were not put before your House, for I had no objection whatever to that being done, and, moreover, had personally handed over the individual justifications to the groups’ rapporteurs, so I am sure that we will be able to take these proposals into consideration."
"I would like to make it quite clear how important it is to me that the rapporteur has not lost sight of the point that the withdrawal of proposals forms part of the exercise of the right of initiative."
"The Commission is also, in principle, open to your suggestion that the annual legislative and working programme should, in future, indicate which, if any, proposals the Commission intends to withdraw, so that Parliament may express its point of view in good time."
"I regard that as a very sensible proposal."
"I hope that it will be clear to you from my response that I do not believe that we should get into an argument about the principles of this."
"I am quite happy to acknowledge that things could have been done better in one or other respect, but what matters to me is that we should, together, make a success of the political project, and where that is concerned I can do no other than agree with your rapporteur that that is precisely what Europe’s citizens expect of us."
"What they expect is not deregulation, not the erosion of rights and certainties, but rather that European legislation should be clear, simple, comprehensible and usable, so let us work together to that end."
". – Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I will start by expressing my gratitude to the rapporteur for the very good report but above all for having taken on board the Committee on Legal Affairs’ opinion to a considerable degree."
"I am sure that we are agreed that the wording of the Treaty enables the Commission to withdraw proposals up until such time as the Council has taken up a Common Position, and this state of affairs is unsatisfactory from the legal point of view, in that the Commission could, following the first reading in this House, which can require a great deal of effort – one need only think back to the services directive to realise that – withdraw its proposal, thereby wiping out with one stroke of the pen a great deal of work on the part of this House."
"That is why I would like to emphasise the principle of sincere cooperation, to which reference has been made in this context."
"If the first reading stage, with all the hard work that it entails, has been reached, then the Commission should no longer be able to withdraw its proposals."
"The Commission should also respond with greater sensitivity if Parliament requests by a large majority that its proposals be withdrawn."
"I need only remind the House of the dispute about the software patent directive, where we repeatedly asked the Commission to withdraw a proposal that was disastrous and scarcely worthy of mention."
"It declined to do so, whereupon this House in any case rejected the proposal by over 500 votes."
"I think – and you have yourself just said – that there were a number of inconsistencies in the package of withdrawn proposals that was submitted."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs attached particular importance to the Associations Statute and to there being European law covering such entities."
"I am pleased to note your willingness to review this matter and look forward to really new proposals, for the ‘justification’ for this package as having to do with the reduction of bureaucracy and of excessive impositions is certainly not applicable here."
"If we want there to be a European law on associations, it is because we want to relax many of the rules and regulations in this area, thereby enabling non-governmental organisations, in particular, to operate more easily across Europe."
"I would also like to draw attention to something that the Commission has overlooked."
"We recommended the withdrawal of certain legislative proposals: not just the software patent directive, but also the mediation directive, and I do not see why other proposals for legislation were withdrawn, but this directive was not."
"Here too, it is not quite clear in what way the package is balanced, but if you can promise us that closer cooperation with Parliament will result in that changing in future, then we will be happy to take note of that."
". Mr President, I am actually speaking on behalf of your countryman, Mr Protasiewicz."
"Firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent job."
"The work we did in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs went very smoothly and most of the committee stands behind the report."
"I would like to make three points."
"The first point is that our group welcomes the Commission’s initiative of withdrawing 68 pieces of legislation."
"The original idea of European integration was to bring down walls, not to create them, and the Commission in its analysis and screening did an excellent job."
"The second point, however, is that when we deal with this issue we have to be very careful that we do not start changing the Commission’s exclusive right of initiative."
"The idea of a new Commission withdrawing initiatives or announcing which initiatives it will withdraw as soon as it comes into office is a good one, and to a certain extent we could say that the Commission did that this time around, which should be welcomed."
"My third and final point is that we want increased consultation between the European Parliament and the Council as well, but it is very important to retain and keep the institutional balance pretty much as it stands."
"So we want closer involvement, but maintenance of the institutional balance when we talk about screening of legislation in general."
"I have always considered myself to be a bit of an institutional nerd, but I can guarantee that the next speaker, Mr Corbett, is even more of one!"
". Mr President, that is one reputation that I will have to live up to, or should I say live down!"
"My group, too, welcomes the report by Mrs Kaufmann."
"We believe it is an excellent report, which has got the balance just about right."
"The original logic of the Treaties, in giving the right of initiative to the Commission – in those days the Commission proposed and the Council disposed – was entirely right for that time."
"We wanted the Council to work not on the basis of competing drafts put forward by different Member States, but on a common proposal drawn up by an institution that belongs to all of us – the Commission – and that is duty bound to serve the interests of all Member States in the proposals that it brings forward."
"It was then up to the Council alone to look at that proposal, modify it if necessary, accept it or otherwise."
"There was a certain balance."
"Since the original Treaties, though, we have seen the emergence of this Parliament, which was first directly elected in 1979 and more recently has acquired co-legislative powers."
"Because of their national experience, people in most of our Member States expect that a parliament will have the right of initiative, that its members can propose legislation and that when they stand for election they say they will propose this or that."
"That is lacking in the European Parliament."
"It is true that it is lacking in some national parliaments as well and many parliaments have that right in theory, but it is not exercised in practice."
"Nonetheless it is something our citizens expect."
"So how have we tried to resolve that at European level?"
"The Maastricht Treaty gave this Parliament the right – and the Council already had the same right – to ask the Commission to bring forward a legislative proposal."
"In practice that has usually worked quite well."
"Now the Commission has told us that it will also listen very carefully to Parliament and consult us before it withdraws proposals."
"I welcome that sort of not quite sharing but working closely together on the right of initiative, as regards both proposing and withdrawing."
"I believe the Commission listened to us quite carefully on this recent package, although not, I regret to say, on the proposals regarding mutuals and the European Statute for Associations."
"There I believe the Commission should review its position."
"But on the whole I believe the system has worked quite well."
"If the Commission is going to be able to defend its monopoly on the right of initiative, it must continue to exercise it in that responsible way, to maintain a dialogue with Parliament and take up the legitimate concerns expressed in this Parliament."
"The Commission must also accept that its right to withdraw should not be a right of veto at the last stage of the legislative procedure."
"The right to withdraw should exist right up to the end of the first reading in each body, Parliament and then the Council."
"Once the Council has reached a common position and it comes back to Parliament, it is no longer the property of the Commission."
"It is a Council common position that we will be dealing with, and so on through the rest of the legislative procedure."
"The Commission will still play a role, but should not at that stage have the right of withdrawal, which would unbalance the system."
"It should have it in the first stages, as it does."
"I welcome what has been put forward by our committee."
"It is a good balance in that it proposes that there be due justification, due dialogue, proper consultation and advance notice."
"If we can work together on that basis, I believe that is a reasonably correct balance in the context of the current Treaties."
". Mr President, I have two comments to make with regard to Mrs Kaufmann’s report, the general thrust of which I endorse."
"First of all, I should like to draw your attention to the need for screening legislative proposals not only in respect of Better Regulation principles or the Lisbon agenda, but also with regard to subsidiarity."
"I am aware that this is a concept to which this House is increasingly averse, but in no way does that alter the fact that European legislation must clearly add value over and above national legislation."
"I take the view that fighting overregulation at European level plays an important role in the pursuit of a better and simpler approach to legislation at Community level."
"My second comment concerns the role of national parliaments."
"I am right behind Mr Barroso’s initiative to send new legislative proposals to the national parliaments, for Member States are capable of carefully screening for subsidiarity, something which will undoubtedly increase the support base for European legislation among Member States."
"– Mr President, better lawmaking is one of the Commission’s priorities, and this initiative has been welcomed by both the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and this House as a whole."
"There is indeed a great deal of clearing out to do where our legislation is concerned, some of which will involve simplifying and codifying packages of laws, but it will also be necessary to withdraw those that are no longer appropriate, and it is at this point that I would like, not only to thank Mrs Kaufmann for presenting a very good report, but also to make three observations."
"On Wednesday, in the German , Chancellor Merkel raised the question as to whether we too ought to bring in the concept of discontinuity between one legislative period and another, so that laws would lapse and have to be reintroduced."
"This was a problem that we had with the Bolkestein directive, when the old Commission had proposed something that its successor certainly did not want in that form, not least because of changes in circumstances and in outlook, so I do think it would be a good thing if the Commission – at the beginning of its term of office, at any rate – were to sift through the proposals on the table in order to determine which they are going to keep because they fit in with their programme, and which they are going to withdraw on the grounds that their substance or something else makes them obsolete."
"My second observation is this: Mr Corbett said, and rightly, that Parliament acquired the right of codecision over a period of time and that there is therefore something missing from Article 250(2), in that it states only that the Commission can no longer withdraw legislation once the Council has delivered its Common Position, but it does not state that it could not do so either following the first reading in this House."
"There is a loophole in the Treaties, and the only acceptable way to fill it is for us to be very sincere in our dealings with one another, and – as has been said today several times over – for this House to be given a say when the Commission contemplates withdrawing proposals, at least when we have gone past first reading."
"I can tell you, Mr Vice-President, that we even said that you could withdraw a proposal even following the Council’s Common Position if the Council turned the proposal into something it had not been, for it seems that, on two or three occasions, the Council adopted a resolution that was the precise opposite of what the Commission had intended to propose, and we were advised by the legal service that you would, in such a case, still have the right of withdrawal."
"The third thing I want to say is that you mentioned the growth and employment strategy as the yardstick against which these sixty-eight proposals had been measured, and I am glad that you said that this was an inevitability in the case of European law on associations;"
"I live in the Saar-Lor-Lux region, which borders Lorraine and Luxembourg, and I could tell you some stories about the difficulties civil society organisations there have with establishing associations that cross borders."
"The journalists’ Inter-Regional Press Institute, for example, tried to, and then ended up somehow doing it under French law, because its chairman lived in France, while other associations have had recourse to Luxembourg or German law; that is not an appropriate way of going about things."
"This is an area in which you should be doing more, perhaps by coming up with a more modern proposal."
"Overall, though, we are working well together in this area."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the programme for better legislation aims to improve the transparency of the Union, to ensure its effectiveness, efficiency and to move closer to the goal of implementing the Lisbon Strategy."
"The programme is also intended as a response to accusations that Brussels all too frequently opts for legislative mechanisms and, as a result, creates too many laws."
"Until now, the Union’s has consisted of tonnes of documents written in a language that is unintelligible to citizens, generally drawn up without consulting European social partners or European citizens."
"This last accusation suggests that European Union legislation is created without the participation of the citizens of Europe, for whom we, as the European Parliament, work and whom we represent."
"What should be done to change this image and to bring the European Union closer to its citizens, now that it finds itself in the midst of a constitutional crisis?"
"It seems that withdrawing these 68 pieces of draft legislation is a step in the right direction, but is it enough of a step in terms of better legislation?"
"It does not seem enough."
"It seems that, in order to improve legislation, we need better inter-institutional cooperation between the Commission and Parliament."
"We need these two institutions to have, as part of their structure, special groups created to work towards better legislation."
"These groups will act as the conscience of the EU, a legislative barometer which will issue a warning if one of the institutions lapses into bureaucratic routine and acts against the code of good EU legislation and legislative principles such as appropriateness, subsidiarity, cohesion, transparency, proportionality and predictability."
"Commissioner, I have no doubt that good EU legislation will be possible when good cooperation is established between the Commission and Parliament."
"Parliament and the Commission must trust each other, respect each other and treat each other as full partners with complete respect and trust."
"Only then will the legislation improve."
"Only then will we be able to create legislation together for the good of the citizens."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"- the recommendation for second reading (A6-0122/2006), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the common position established by the Council [09858/3/2005 C6-0018/2006 2003/0165(COD)] with a view to adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on nutrition and health claims made on foods (Rapporteur: Adriana Poli Bortone) and"
"- the recommendation for second reading (A6-0078/2006), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the common position established by the Council [09857/3/2005 C6-0017/2006 2003/0262(COD)] with a view to adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods (Rapporteur: Karin Scheele)."
". – Mr President, today finds us discussing a brace of regulatory packages on foods, in the shape of Mrs Poli Bertone’s report on the nutritional and health claims made in respect of them, and my own report on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to them."
"These two proposals for legislation have always been discussed and considered simultaneously and in tandem, since there would have been no point in taking the two at different times."
"This House having taken up some very controversial positions – as some of its Members still do – on whether, and if so how, claims of health and nutritional value should be regulated, there have always been time problems whenever the report on enrichment by the addition of minerals and vitamins was on the order of business."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those concerned – the groups’ staff, the European Council and the Commission – for the very good cooperation in between sittings, which has made it possible for us to keep the lines of communication open and to achieve good compromises."
"The intention is that the proposed regulation should harmonise the various national regulations on the addition of vitamins and minerals, and of certain other substances, to foodstuffs, and, today being the occasion of its second reading, I would like to mention that this regulation covers only the voluntary addition of vitamins and minerals, so that national regulations requiring their addition are unaffected."
"One principle underpinning my report is that the Community should work towards a state of affairs in which it is with considerations of nutrition and health in mind that manufacturers use vitamin and mineral supplements, and so I am glad that, not only within this House, but also between the institutions, a compromise has been achieved, and that there is support for the bio-availability approach, according to which all added vitamins and minerals must be capable of being used by the body, for, if that were not the case, it would be misleading for the consumer and in extreme cases could result in adverse effects on human health."
"In debating it, we have heard, over and over again, of examples of how, when too many vitamins or minerals are added, the human body ends up being unable to process this combination of substances, and so I think it is a good thing that we should opt for this bio-availability approach."
"We have also made progress by agreeing to define other substances as well as vitamins and minerals, which are, of course, listed – and hence defined – in Annexes 1 and 2 to this Regulation."
"It is because an excessive intake of vitamins and minerals can cause damage to health that safe maximum amounts must be laid down for the addition of such substances to foodstuffs."
"Provision is already made for such maximum amounts in the directive on food supplements, but these have not yet been published."
"Considerations of consumer safety, then, make it a matter of urgent necessity that they be laid down."
"The amendment of Article 6 is intended to ensure that the Commission will submit proposals for safe maximum amounts within two years."
"Having myself been, for many years, a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I am also pleased that the Commission, in a supplementary statement, has announced a revision of the nutrition labelling directive, which is long overdue."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of the vote on the report concerning the labelling of foods, I am pleased to inform the House that, following intense negotiations, we have arrived at a common text that I hope will enable us to avoid the conciliation procedure."
"Before going into detail, I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups, Mrs Sommer, Mrs Corbey, Mr Maaten, Mrs Evans, Mrs Breyer, Mrs Liotard and Mr Blokland, for their decisive contributions and for their willingness to negotiate, even in the most trying times."
"In a state of deadlock, in which the Council did not seem willing to grant us anything further, we succeeded in putting a compromise package together: a final text that, bolstered by the support of all the parliamentary groups, prompted the Council to accept the proposals on the table."
"All that remains is for tomorrow’s vote to put the seal on matters and, in that regard, I call on all of my fellow Members to support the compromise with the aim of reaching the qualified majority that we need to amend the common position."
"I believe that, overall, this is a balanced text that effectively pursues the objective of guaranteeing consumers accurate, clear and understandable information, so as to enable them to make a balanced and informed choice about their diet."
"Everyone in this House agrees on the need to promote a healthy and balanced diet for Europeans, and to prevent a situation in which a tempting label promising extraordinary benefits for a person’s figure or, worse still, for his or her health, in reality disguises a high-calorie foodstuff, without the consumer having the opportunity to identify it as such."
"In a Europe in which, according to the WHO, one in five children is obese, and in the light of the recent studies demonstrating the link between advertising and junk food consumption, this regulatory measure can no longer be postponed."
"I believe that the primary objective of consumer protection has been fully achieved in the text resulting from the compromise."
"I should like to add that, through Parliament’s intervention, we have succeeded in following up and responding to the requests for clarity and definite timescales that were worrying the food industry."
"This compromise has not been easy, partly because the Council’s position on some points remained very inflexible – practically rigid – until the end of the negotiations."
"That is precisely why I regard it as a great success that we have won concessions on these very points: I refer, in particular, to Article 4 and to the measures relating to alcohol that we will address later on."
"I should, however, like to point out straight away that the agreement with the Council relates to a package that must be supported I therefore call on you straight away to reject Amendments 90 and 49, which fall outside the package agreed on with the other European institutions."
"As for the placing on the market of so-called 'health' labels, the Council has agreed to introduce a simplified and faster procedure that will guarantee our businesses more certainty."
"Ever since we cast our unanimous vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, it has been clear that shortening the timescale should not mean sacrificing a thorough scientific assessment of the authenticity of the claims made on labels."
"The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) should have exactly the same amount of time to assess claims under both procedures."
"The Council has supported us in this proposal and the final outcome is that Parliament has succeeded in ensuring that health labels presenting no particular problems will be able to receive a definitive marketing authorisation in eight months."
"On the other hand, the simplified procedure will not apply to some labels that are particularly dangerous insofar as they are very appealing, such as those that boast of being effective in reducing health risks and those that refer to children’s development."
"Those labels will instead have to be subject to the full authorisation procedure that will guarantee greater control, not only in scientific terms on the part of EFSA and the Commission, but also on the part of the Member States in the context of the comitology procedure."
"As regards the controversial subject of nutrient profiles, or the notorious Article 4, I should like to point out that, until last Wednesday, the Council was against any derogation from the text."
"In essence, the common position stipulated that no type of labelling – neither nutrition nor health labelling – could be used on a product that did not comply with the nutrient profiles established by EFSA."
"For example, a sweet with a high sugar content could never bear a health or nutrition claim."
"The compromise text accepted by all of the groups and the Council now provides for the option to affix labels containing nutritional information even when a substance exceeds the nutrient profile, provided that a statement is added on the same side of the packaging to warn the consumer of the high levels of the substance exceeding the nutrient profiles."
"In that way, the consumer is guaranteed accurate information, which can be seen at a glance on the same side of the packaging, while, at the same time, the food industry is given the opportunity to use this type of claim."
"I regard this text as a victory for Parliament on a point that the Council had initially thought untouchable."
"In relation to brands, we have succeeded in ensuring that existing brands can continue to be used for 15 years without any further requirements."
"Once that period has expired, they may continue to be used provided that they are accompanied by a corresponding claim that complies with the provisions of the present regulation."
"I believe that this is a sufficiently long transitional period for the industry, enough, at any rate, to enable it to adapt to the Community regulations."
"Furthermore, we have safeguarded the use of generic names that traditionally accompany food products such as ‘aperitif’, ‘digestive’ and ‘cough sweets’: those terms will be granted special exemptions and may be readily used."
"I would also point out to the House that all the systems of negative labelling, the so-called ‘traffic light’ or ‘red stamp’ systems, which are already in use in some countries, remain outside the scope of the regulation and will therefore be regulated at national level."
"In our role as Parliament, we have won some important victories in the negotiations concerning the protection of SMEs."
"What we had initially been told was impossible on technical grounds has instead been granted to us."
"Two recitals highlight the importance of making it easier for SMEs to use the labels, insofar as they represent ‘important added value for the European food industry’."
"Under the new Article 15, the Commission will have to commit itself to making instruments and guidelines available to SMEs in order to make it easier, in particular, to apply the present regulation."
"Furthermore, by reducing the data protection period to five years, compared with the seven planned initially, we have shortened the waiting times for claims to be used by those small and medium-sized enterprises that do not have the financial resources needed to fund their own research into labels."
"Thanks to Parliament’s amendment, SMEs will soon be able to use all of the labels that have already been authorised and that are available in the list provided for in Article 13."
"They can be used free of charge and without any formalities."
"Those who do not have the financial means to fund research into a claim will therefore also be able to use it easily and at no extra cost."
"As regards the protection of children – a matter of great importance in this House – we have succeeded in ensuring that all labels that refer to children’s development or improved health are assessed under the full authorisation procedure, so as to ensure that thorough checks are carried out, including by the Member States, on whether the label is scientifically valid and whether it can be understood by the consumer."
"Claims made by medical, dieticians’ and nutritionists’ associations will be accepted, but not those made by individual doctors."
"As regards alcohol, nutrition labels had already been accepted in the common position."
"Beverages containing more than 1.2% by volume of alcohol were authorised to bear labels marked ‘reduced alcohol content’ or ‘fewer calories’."
"As a further, albeit final, offer, the Council has also allowed the use of the wording 'low alcohol content'."
"We have also obtained significant recognition of the importance of safeguarding the variety of culinary traditions, as well as the possibility for those who sell foods loose to receive special conditions."
"To conclude, I call on you all to support the amendments forming part of the compromise signed by all of the groups, and those amendments alone, so that the legislative process for this report – which has been so controversial that it has remained before this House for more than three years – may be brought to a successful conclusion."
"I should like to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone, including my colleagues from the groups and the support staff."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking both rapporteurs, Mrs Poli Bortone and Mrs Scheele, for their excellent work and cooperation with my services in working out this compromise."
"I also wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their contribution."
"It is true that it was not an easy task."
"You will remember the great differences that separated the views of the three institutions on this issue."
"However, I believe – and the rapporteurs have rightly said – that we have managed to reach a good compromise."
"That is a fact."
"However, as with any compromise, it leaves a little to be desired by all sides, so each side would have preferred to go a bit further in one direction or another."
"Nevertheless, these compromises on both documents have managed to balance the interests of all involved: consumers, industry and economic operators."
"But this is a delicate and sensitive balance and I believe that the two documents should be adopted as agreed in the compromise, because anything else would upset this balance and would definitely upset the compromise."
"These two regulations state that, if economic operators voluntarily use claims or other marketing tools to sell their products, they have to be truthful and accurate and the claims must be scientifically based."
"This means that it is the consumer’s choice – it is ultimately for the consumer to decide – but the consumer has to be presented with correct, accurate and scientifically-based information in order to make this informed choice."
"I agree with the rapporteur that this is a very important step in the long-term struggle that has just begun for the health and nutrition of European citizens."
"The health claims regulation will prevent consumers from being misled by unsubstantiated or misleading claims."
"At the same time, it will provide harmonised rules allowing products to circulate freely in the internal market."
"It will also create a clear legal environment, a level playing field for economic operators to ensure fair competition, and it will encourage investment in innovative food practices."
"For example, in addition to the list of permitted nutritional claims or the list of physiological function claims, it will now allow, through an authorisation procedure, claims related to the reduction of a disease risk, something that until now has been prohibited."
"So, these harmonised rules will be of great interest to the European food industry but, through the process we have adopted in the legislation, we also guarantee consumer protection."
"Also, for health claims based on newly developed data, the compromise now provides for a simpler and faster procedure in order to boost innovation in the area of food."
"I am sure Parliament recognises the effort that both the Commission and the Council have made on that point."
"On the nutrient profiles, which have already been described, these are products that, on the basis of the claims, are made to appear better to consumers, encouraging more consumption."
"We therefore need proper criteria in this respect."
"The nutrient profile is one good criterion that could be used and the proposed compromise introduces flexibility in order to facilitate the application and use of these claims."
"In the context of this compromise, I should like to make the following statement:"
"‘In establishing the nutrient profiles referred to in Article 4(1) through the Regulatory Committee procedure, the Commission undertakes to accompany the proposed Commission measures, submitted to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, with an explanatory note outlining the criteria that will be taken into account for the establishment of the nutrient profiles.’"
"As I have said, I believe that this is a good compromise which covers the interests of all the key stakeholders."
"On the regulation concerning the addition of vitamins and minerals, again we have reached a good compromise."
"On the basis of this compromise, I should like to make the following statement:"
"‘Further to its statement accompanying the adoption of the common position, the Commission has the intention to present, as soon as possible and in any case within two years of the adoption of the regulation, a proposal for the revision of Directive 90/496/EEC on nutrition labelling for foodstuffs."
"In that context, the Commission has the intention to consider the review of the rule concerning the meaning of ‘significant amount’ as mentioned in the Annex to that directive.’"
"I very much hope that Parliament will support this compromise package, which regulates the composition aspects of foods and ensures the safety of the product."
"It also introduces appropriate specific rules on labelling, presentation and advertising, and at the same time provides the basis for scrutinising and if necessary regulating the addition of certain other substances, as already mentioned by the rapporteur."
"That will ensure a very high level of protection for public health and consumer protection and at the same time allow the industry to have a stable, concise, clear regulatory environment that will allow for innovation and the need to remain competitive at Community and international level."
"In conclusion, may I again thank the two rapporteurs and everyone else who has cooperated in achieving this compromise."
"I am looking forward to an interesting debate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though, in our campaign against this law, which has lasted three years, we have achieved some good tactical victories, the fact is that what we face tomorrow is a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea; we have to approve the compromise package from the informal trialogue, even though I have to say to the Commissioner that we are very far from pleased with it, for, if we do not, we will then be thrown back on the Council’s Common Position, which is every bit as revolting as the Commission’s original draft."
"Those are the facts of the matter."
"Moreover, the tendency of this law – even with this compromise – is to deprive citizens of their freedom of choice by categorising foods as ‘good’ or ‘bad’ on the basis of mythical nutrient profiles."
"To this day – even after three years of debate – the Commission has been unable to submit even a rough outline of what these values might be."
"The consequence of this is that we will be obliged, tomorrow, to vote for something that does not actually exist; can being constrained to do that be described as a reliable way of making policy?"
"Scientists tell us – and this is where I do not agree with Mrs Poli Bortone – that the whole approach is nonsensical, since it is not food advertising that is responsible for people getting fatter and fatter."
"That is a highly complex problem and has to do with society as a whole; it is not one that can be done away with by censoring advertising."
"What really is wrong, and, as I understand it, stupid, is to take the line that individual foods need to be rated."
"So do you eat dry cornflakes all day?"
"I do not."
"It is not least thanks to our opposition – of which I am rather proud – that our cause is not completely lost."
"Mrs Poli Bortone has listed all the things we have achieved."
"We have, in particular, managed to save fresh products."
"It would not even have been permissible to describe fruit as healthy without it being tested scientifically, in a manner appropriate to the individual type, at the point of sale, which just goes to show how ridiculous the whole approach is."
"We have also managed to rescue cough lozenges; how embarrassing that we had to do that."
"We have also built in safeguard clauses for SMEs; how embarrassing that we had to do that, that there are laws that need that to be done to them, for it shows up all the pious speeches for the lies they are."
"Commissioner Verheugen has just delivered yet another one."
"This law will make SMEs suffer; it will cost jobs."
"It will make laws null and void, and will bring the consumer no additional benefit, for it will do nothing to reduce obesity and we already have laws to protect consumers from misleading advertising."
"The Council and the Commission know all that, yet they are standing in this House’s way like a wall of concrete, shoulder to shoulder together in a way I have never seen before."
"The impression I get is that the Council is under the thumb of officials in the Commission – officials who themselves always want to make more policy, officials with legitimacy conferred on them by nothing and nobody, but whom the public pays well; not controlled by the public, but paid well by them, and it is the public who, at the end of the day, must pick up the tab."
"It is the public who will pay the price for this law, and that price will be paid in jobs lost."
"This law is the very opposite of what is always being talked about in the Commission’s fine speeches about cutting back bureaucracy, better lawmaking, the Lisbon agenda, and all the rest of it. This law is likely to make the public far more eurosceptic than they already are."
"I think that is something we cannot allow, and we have no option but to vote in favour tomorrow in order not to end up with something quite terrible."
"That is what I said at the outset, but I am persuaded that there is still something that can be done in the face of this bureaucratic madness."
"I will be calling on the German Government to examine whether it might be able to take legal action against this regulation."
". Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank Mrs Poli Bortone."
"I think that, along with her, the Council and among ourselves, we have reached a sound compromise."
"I am also indebted to Mrs Sommer and the other groups that have played a part in this."
"Many consumers are anxious about their health, about cholesterol and blood pressure, or wrestle with excess weight."
"The food industry is cashing in on this."
"There is a proliferation of all kinds of claims."
"This morning, I enjoyed a sandwich that is beneficial for my intestinal flora, with a covering of butter that reduces my cholesterol and an egg that contains high levels of Omega 3."
"Perfect … or at least that is what I think, for I do not know."
"Consumers do not know whether the claims manufacturers make are true, and that is why this legislative proposal’s stipulation that the health claims which food manufactures make must be scientifically underpinned is so crucial."
"We must avoid consumers being taken for a ride."
"Consumers are often prepared to pay more for a product that claims to benefit their health, but they should be able to be confident that it really does."
"Whilst misleading advertisements are already banned, the burden of proof has so far been with the authorities."
"Of course, this does not work in practice."
"It is impossible for governments to constantly check claims on packaging and then to disprove them."
"This proposal will benefit consumers, in that manufacturers in all 25 countries must from now on provide honest information."
"At first reading, Parliament gave in to pressure from businesses that were scared of being exposed, businesses that deliberately mislead consumers by painting a different picture, and they cannot in any way count on my sympathy."
"No profits on the back of people who are worried about their weight or health."
"The internal market should not be a licence for leading consumers up the garden path, something which, fortunately, the compromise recognises to a large extent."
"Deception comes in many guises."
"According to Article 4, health claims can only be made on products that meet a certain profile."
"I would like to assure Mrs Sommer that those food profiles do exist."
"They are used in the United States."
"All major enterprises apply them and they work very well."
"It is also appropriate that food claims can only be added to products that are, in principle, healthy."
"After all, the greasy hamburger will not suddenly become a health food only by adding a few vitamins."
"Nor will the sugary lollypop by adding vitamin A."
"The compromise rejects health claims on alcohol, which will only be allowed where the alcohol percentage or calorie level is reduced."
"If one considers all the problems involving alcoholism, including liver damage and brain damage, it is hard to allow health claims on alcohol."
"Luckily, all parties were prepared to support this proposal in the end."
"At first reading, it transpired that the proposal is unnecessarily bureaucratic."
"This position was also shared by our group, although we did want sufficient guarantees for adequate procedures."
"These are now in place."
"There is now a weighty authorisation procedure for claims directed at children and claims that pertain to reduced health risks."
"Our group is behind the consumer and well-meaning enterprises."
"This legislation ensures that consumers are given honest information."
"I would express the hope and expectation that this legislation will contribute to better food and better health."
"Thank you for your attention."
". Mr President, the aim of the proposed regulation on nutrition and health claims is to harmonise European legislation in that area."
"That should combine two elements: firstly, introducing the general rule that in the interests of consumers, nutrition and health claims must be clear, accurate and meaningful; secondly, protection of truthful producers from unfair competitors."
"After a very controversial debate we now have a compromise package for second reading."
"Does it meet the original aims?"
"We believe it does."
"We may not be entirely happy with the result, but we have to take into consideration various interests such as the fears of small and medium-sized enterprises, the danger of procedures that are too long and too bureaucratic, the interests of producers and genetic descriptors – provided the main objective of improving public health is maintained."
"Some of the restrictions proposed by the Commission were unclear and open to interpretation."
"In order to avoid legal uncertainty, the European Parliament adopted a large number of amendments, inserting clauses designed to make application of the regulation easier."
"Some of them have become part of the compromise package that the ALDE Group supports, together with other political groups."
"On one of the two most controversial issues – nutrient profiles and in particular the derogation in Article 4(2) – we consider that a workable compromise has been reached."
"Therefore we wish to support the wording of Amendment 17."
"The same goes for the proposal concerning trademarks and brands and for Article 4(3) on nutrition claims about alcohol, linked to the provision that health claims supporting national authority or Community messages about the dangers of the misuse of alcohol should not fall within the scope of the regulation."
"This is a good result."
"I should like, in particular, to thank Mrs Poli Bortone for her successful work."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mrs Scheele and Mrs Poli Bortone, for all the work they have done on these two very important reports."
"As with the other speakers, my remarks concern the report on nutritional and health claims."
"This is an issue on which I am pleased to say Parliament has performed a great U-turn."
"This time last year this House voted by a majority to follow the industry line and deleted elements which were absolutely central to the effectiveness of this legislation."
"The purpose of the whole proposal was almost totally undermined, but now, at second reading, we have been able to reach a compromise agreement, as the rapporteur said, which reinstates the crucial points and takes us much closer to our original aim: to outlaw untrue and misleading health and nutrition claims on food that deceive consumers into thinking that those foods are good for them when they are not."
"The Verts/ALE Group has supported the system of authorising claims through an effective and efficient process."
"We have supported clear labelling, consumer involvement, banning health or nutritional claims on alcoholic drinks, as others have mentioned, and many of the other items on which we will be voting tomorrow."
"This new law will make a big difference to people’s everyday lives, because food is a very political issue."
"What can be more political than people being able to choose what food they eat?"
"People have a right to be confident that labels on food mean what they say."
"It is not just a question of honesty on the part of food companies; it is also a question of health."
"People are much more aware nowadays of the need for a healthy, balanced diet and they are much more careful about the food they buy."
"Food manufacturers spend a thousand times more on marketing than governments spend on fighting obesity."
"It is time we redressed that balance, and tightening these rules will play a part in that."
". Mr President, following the scandalous outcome about health claims at first reading, Parliament is now being given a second chance."
"It appears that the tenacious lobby of food and particularly the drinks industry has not been as effective this time round."
"Or is it perhaps the case that the Members are simply embarrassed about the fact that for once, the Council was more progressive than Parliament?"
"The compromise proposal that is now before us contains a few valid points, banning health claims on alcohol being an obvious one."
"The food profiles are back and will hopefully at any rate prevent the most scandalous health claims."
"The protection of the consumer against false claims will, alas, be far from watertight."
"There are still many loopholes in the law that make false claims possible."
"Moreover, I have serious doubts about the very influential part to be played by the European Food Safety Agency, the independence of which is regularly called into question."
"In other areas, such as GMOs and aspartame, the EFSA is happy to take industry’s line."
"However imperfect this proposal may be, though, it is at any rate a great improvement on the sad outcome at first reading."
"Moreover, without a compromise, we run the risk of dragging this issue behind us for many years to come."
"Since it is unacceptable that consumers should be kept in the dark for that long, my group will be supporting the compromise proposal."
". Mr President, I should like to express thanks to Mrs Scheele and Mrs Poli Bortone for their contributions towards both agreements at the draft stage."
"With regard to the report on additives, I regret that due to that agreement, it is no longer possible here in the plenary to thrash out the usefulness of, and need for, certain additives."
"While the usefulness of a number of substances has been proven beyond any doubt, I still have my doubts as regards fluoride being added, for example."
"That is also one of the reasons why some of my group will not be backing this agreement."
"As for the food and health claims, I should like to say that I will back the result that has been achieved during negotiations."
"Amendments tabled by this House at first reading have already improved many of the points in the common position."
"I would refer to the opportunities which companies have to submit applications in their own Member States, as well as to a reduction in the timeframes."
"I should like to ask Commissioner Kyprianou when the Commission thinks the food profiles will be ready and what role it thinks Parliament could play in formulating them."
"Finally, I should like to add that I fully endorse the agreement on food claims and hope that this can be fleshed out properly in the Member States, so that consumers can enjoy effective protection."
". Mr President, I wish to congratulate warmly my group colleague, Mrs Poli Bortone, upon reaching this stage of negotiations with what seems like a fruitful result for consumers."
"It was an extremely arduous task."
"At a time when the average EU citizen is getting heavier and up to 27% of European men, 32% of European women and a staggering one-quarter of Europe’s children are now obese, I warmly welcome the European Union’s initiative in tackling obesity through a very important first step: the addressing of nutrition and health claims on food."
"For far too long consumers have been influenced by marketing and advertising, much of which was without any basis."
"At present, consumers are faced with a deluge of marketing ploys in order to entice them to purchase food products."
"Often, the nutritional health claims on food products are not entirely accurate or honest."
"A varied and balanced diet is a prerequisite for good health and individual products have a relative importance in the context of the overall diet."
"Now we are in the process of voting through a system that will provide confidence to consumers on a product-by-product basis, with nutritional and health claims based on scientific evidence."
"Ill health as a result of obesity is costing taxpayers millions of euro each year and exerting extreme pressure on health services."
"The health problems associated with obesity are well known: heart disease, strokes, high cholesterol and diabetes top the list."
"Common reasons cited are overeating and lack of exercise, but the problem is far wider than that."
"Immediate action must be taken."
"This is only the tip of the iceberg for European citizens."
"In tandem with clear and substantiated nutritional health claims we also need to focus on organising a general information campaign on nutrition issues and the importance of acquiring healthy eating habits in a timely fashion."
"Today’s consumer is under pressure to prepare meals quickly."
"We are becoming more and more dependent on processed foods."
"I also welcome the increased support to SMEs."
"I am delighted that they will get support and appropriate technical guidance and tools to help them in due time."
"I would like to thank my colleague Mrs Poli Bortone for the effort she has put into the report on nutritional and health claims which is now with us for a second reading."
"This directive is extremely important at a time when Europe has high levels of obesity and disease which would not exist if we ate in a more healthy way."
"We must shift the emphasis to consumer awareness, and therefore to food labelling that is not misleading."
"If a food is labelled as low-calorie this must be based on facts, without misleading the consumer."
"The recommendations of so-called ‘independent’ doctors or experts are often just an advertising ploy with no basis in fact."
"If a food product has a high calcium content, which promotes bone growth, it is unacceptable call it ‘healthy’if it also contains large amounts of fats and sugar."
"Equally, low-fat yoghurt cannot be called healthy if it contains 100g of sugar."
"Chocolate spreads cannot claim to be good for children just because they are full of vitamins and minerals."
"Consumers read the ingredients on food packaging and often base their choice on what the package says."
"Nutritional and health claims must be there to inform, not to misinform them."
"My intention is not to have these products removed from the market, but they should not be promoted as healthy on the basis of dubious health and nutrition information."
"This regulation will stimulate innovation."
"Producers will have to produce food that really is healthy, and will therefore strive to reduce the amounts of fat, sugar or salt in their products."
"I also agree with the rapporteur on Amendments 28 and 31 which put particular emphasis on children’s food, where labelling controls must be tightest."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am shadow rapporteur for the Regulation on additives and I must therefore begin by saying that the Commission’s proposal was reasonably balanced."
"Nevertheless, Mrs Scheele has done excellent work in bringing points of view together and I would therefore like to congratulate her."
"I would also like to thank the Council and the Commission for the efforts they have made in order to reach an agreement at second reading."
"The consumption of enriched foods within a varied diet can supplement the ingestion of nutrients."
"The important thing is that the fortification be based on scientific criteria and that all of the agri-food industries be subject to the same rules with the least possible bureaucracy."
"The aim of this proposal is to harmonise the national provisions in force and we in my group do not therefore agree with accepting provisions allowing for stricter rules in certain countries, except where they are justified scientifically for public health reasons."
"I believe that it is right to have extended the time limit for marketing for certain products already on the market and labelled on the date on which the Regulation enters into force."
"Finally, the food available to us is extremely varied, and we are not going to put an end to obesity by means of rules and labels."
"In order to do that, perhaps what we should do is ban the TV remote control. The solution is much more complex."
"Foodstuffs must be healthy and the consumers must be given accurate information."
"The really important thing is for each person to choose their diet according to the life they lead."
"Education is therefore much more important than any rule we may lay down in an attempt to put an end to obesity."
"With regard to the report by Mrs Poli Bortone, both she and the shadow rapporteurs, Mrs Sommer in particular, have done excellent work."
"The explanatory statement of this proposal for a Regulation emphasises the lack of specific Community provisions as one of the principal reasons for this new Regulation, and I agree with that."
"Nevertheless, wine, for example, is an agricultural product that is governed by a very thorough common organisation of the market, which prevents nutrition and health claims on its labelling, which regulates advertising, which regulates promotion, and which regulates absolutely everything."
"There is therefore no justification for regulating what is already regulated and it will merely confuse the consumers and complicate the legislation even further, not to mention the complications it will entail for producing companies."
"Wine must not be subject to this Regulation and I do not understand why producing countries such as Spain, France or Italy have not expressed these arguments in the Council."
"I also regret that we have missed the opportunity to amend the annexes."
"I shall end simply by expressing my full agreement with everything that Mrs Sommer has said."
"I wish to join in thanking the rapporteurs, Mrs Scheele and Mrs Poli Bortone, the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Council for the work they have done on ensuring that, tomorrow, we have an agreement on which to adopt a position and that will make it much simpler for consumers to make healthier choices, because they have access to more accurate and more comprehensive information."
"Many of us have undoubtedly bought breakfast cereal, bread or yoghurt that, when we were in the shop, we understood to be extremely healthy."
"When we have come home, we have discovered that the yoghurt may not have contained any fat but, instead, contained a large quantity of sugar."
"It is not by chance that many of us have been placed in this position."
"Companies know that we wish to make healthy choices and therefore do everything to make food appear beneficial, even if it is sometimes the very opposite of that."
"A familiar device is for the manufacturer to select an individual ingredient perceived by consumers to be beneficial and then to emphasise this using large thick letters, at the same time as using microscopic lettering to state, for example, the sugar and fat content."
"The agreement on which we shall vote tomorrow may put an end to these and many other types of misleading advertisement."
"Statements about health benefits need to be substantiated scientifically and not be made about products that, considered as a whole, are not good for people’s health."
"If, in future, companies wish to highlight the presence in an item of food of a particular ingredient that people perceive as beneficial, then that item of food should not, in principle, have an unduly high sugar, fat, salt or alcohol content."
"Obviously, there is still a lot of work to be done on this regulation, and we shall monitor future work carefully and, in particular, the preparation of nutrient profiles."
"I and many others in my group are extremely proud of this agreement, but we are also prepared, if need be, to come back with further requirements designed to make it more stringent."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if all goes well tomorrow, our Parliament will give the green light to these two new regulations in the food sector."
"One is designed to bring some order to the jungle of foods and of drinks that are fortified, for example, with vitamins; the other is designed to authorise or to ban, under certain conditions, nutrition and health claims that increasingly appear on these very products."
"We are concerned here with two proposals that genuinely speak to Europeans and, with a view to helping them choose what to buy, provide them with concrete answers regarding the trust to be placed in these claims."
"BEUC points out, in actual fact, that 60% of consumers believe that a calcium-rich product can only be good for a balanced diet, something that is not necessarily true."
"In reality, the only way not to make a mistake is to know the full composition of a food or drink product, its sugar, salt and fat content; that is why we need nutrient profiling, real nutrient profiling and not cut-price profiling."
"That is what is proposed to us in the shape of compromise 66, the famous disclosure clause, which in reality proposes giving both the red light and the green light to the same package."
"As far as I am concerned, this is the height of contradiction, a move designed to make the consumer as confused as possible and, on that point, I do not agree for once with our rapporteur’s analysis."
"That being said, I shall abstain on this issue so as not to block this text, which is urgent."
"I have already said on numerous occasions that I am opposed to this Article 4 being toned down in any way and to certain messages praising the virtues of alcohol being authorised."
"I am therefore opposed to both Amendment 18 and Amendment 489."
"I should, of course, like to thank our two rapporteurs, Mrs Poli Bortone and Mrs Scheel, and the Commission and the Council. They have grasped the full importance of these citizen-friendly laws, while taking into account, as has been pointed out, the anxieties often expressed by SMEs, as well as the need to work in this Chamber for the general interest and to resist certain specific interests."
"I believe that, in one part of her speech, Mrs Sommer set the tone of the debate by making what I felt were harsh and unwarranted criticisms of the work of the Commission and of our Commissioner."
"You will therefore allow me to conclude, at this point, that we have nothing to gain from European law being drafted at the International Sweets and Biscuits Fair in Cologne."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that Mrs Poli Bortone, with her report, is giving this House another dose of good sense and I rejoice in the hope that we will, tomorrow, get the green light and will at last be able to give consumer protection renewed impetus."
"What is at issue today is the need for more honesty."
"Do we want to allow consumers to have excessively fatty, over-sweetened or over-salted foods palmed off on them by businesses that are then allowed to get away with boasting about the health benefits?"
"Nobody wants to ban the sale of chips, coca-cola or sweets, but we cannot allow these foods to be sold on the pretext that they contribute to health and wellness."
"Nor are we talking in terms of bans on advertising, but only of new marketing rules."
"What we need is minimum standards that ensure honesty in marketing."
"Harmonised rules make for legal certainty and that is to the benefit of the businesses as much as of anyone else."
"A survey revealed that 70% of consumers had confidence in the health-related claims made by manufacturers, and that is what makes this regulation a key piece of legislation, not only in terms of greater transparency in consumer protection, but also of improved health protection."
"At present, over 200 million adults and 14 million children in the European Union are overweight or suffering from obesity."
"There has been a dramatic increase in the incidence, especially among children, of diabetes II, which is attributable to nutritional factors."
"It is because we are facing the possibility of obesity and lack of exercise dislodging smoking from its statistical position as the number one cause of death that we regard this compromise as a good one, and as a good package."
"I would have liked to see more objectivity and greater honesty in this debate; in Germany alone, we are contending with nutrition-related problems that are costing us EUR 71 billion, and that makes clear that this is something we have to address."
"I also hope that the German Federal Government will not act on Mrs Sommer’s suggestion and lodge an appeal; any government – not just the German one – that appealed against something after having agreed to it in the Council would make itself look ridiculous and lose credibility, and so I hope that tomorrow will see us achieving a milestone in our quest for more protection for consumers and for their health."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate both rapporteurs."
"During the first reading of the report on nutrition and health claims made on foods, we – as the European Parliament – approved a large number of amendments designed to facilitate the application of the present regulation for the benefit of consumers."
"The majority voted against regulation of the nutritional ingredients in food and rejected Article 4, thereby considerably weakening the regulation in question."
"This regulation should, above all, aim to make consumers more aware of the importance of a healthy, balanced and harmonious diet."
"This is the reason why we should all agree with the Council's common position, which is why I continue to support it as a starting position."
"However, given the difficulty in achieving a compromise and the need for European consumers for there to be such a regulation, I call for us all to at least support the package of compromise amendments."
"In this way, we shall be able to secure proper information for European consumers."
"Mr President, I should like to point out to the Commissioner that the Irish Government has mass-medicated my people with disodium monofluorophosphate for 40 years."
"The fluoride put in Irish water is a toxic waste."
"Although it is added in levels that seem small, it accumulates in our bodies over time."
"The practice of water fluoridation has blighted the health of the Irish people with conditions like skeletal fluorosis: fluoride seeks calcium, especially the bones."
"It also causes conditions like a hypo- or underactive thyroid; fluoride was once used as a medication to suppress the thyroid."
"It causes dental fluorosis, damage to the tooth enamel, which is symptomatic of fluoride poisoning in childhood."
"A recent study revealed that 40% of young Irish adults demonstrate permanent and unsightly tooth mottling and staining related to dental fluorosis."
"These are just some of the conditions that a steady accumulation of fluoride has inflicted on the Irish people."
"In a review of the water fluoridation policy by the Irish Government a few years ago, 90% of the public submissions called for an end to this mass-medication."
"Fluoride, as we use it in Ireland, is a toxic waste taken from the scrubbers of an artificial fertilizer factory, which also contain poison like mercury and cadmium."
"It is unthinkable that we in this Parliament will allow fluoride – a toxin – to be included in a list of acceptable vitamins and minerals."
"It is neither a vitamin nor a mineral."
"In food and water it is a curse."
"To avoid confusion, fluoride in toothpaste and mouthwash is considered a cosmetic and is not affected by my amendment."
"It only affects fluoride in food and water."
"I beg my fellow Members to help the Irish people and vote for that amendment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, so-called ‘functional’ foods, those fortified substances that are supposed to improve the health or well-being of consumers, constitute one of the most innovative sectors, with the most room for market growth."
"We must therefore ensure that checks are carried out on this type of food and, above all, on the claims made on labels, which entice the consumer by promising benefits in terms of diet and health."
"The compromise text guarantees clear and comprehensive information in relation to food labels and enables consumers to make an informed choice about their diet."
"This measure is made all the more urgent if one considers the impact of advertising on children."
"Advertising, in actual fact, directly influences children’s food preferences and changes their consumption patterns."
"Furthermore, thanks to the measures taken by Parliament, due attention has been paid to SMEs, which must be supported if they are to adapt to the changes introduced by the regulation and which will consequently be able to rely both on definite time periods in which to place their own products on the market and on the possibility of using pre-authorised claims."
"Finally, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Poli Bortone, for the excellent, though not easy, job she has done."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the House for taking up this topic."
"The regulation on nutrition and health claims on foods and the regulation on the addition of vitamins and minerals and certain other substances to foods are significant for consumer protection."
"They give the consumer the opportunity to make the right decisions regarding the purchase of many foodstuffs."
"They create better conditions for fair competition among those producing and supplying food to our market."
"They facilitate a better diet which will then translate into better physical shape and health."
"Adopting these regulations will be, in my opinion, a step in the right direction."
"Mr President, the previous debate in this Chamber was about the screening of proposals for legislation."
"I suspect that if that had been in force before this health claims proposal came up, this one might have fallen at the first hurdle."
"In fact it nearly did fall at the first parliamentary hurdle and for that reason I congratulate our rapporteur and our shadow rapporteurs who worked with the Commission officials to improve the original proposal."
"That is why we feel able to support the compromise tomorrow."
"However, we are still legislating in the dark when it comes to nutrient profiling, and that is not a good way of legislating."
"We do not know how this will be achieved; we do not know how EFSA will run it."
"We have to rely on the experts sorting it out after this measure has left this Parliament, and whatever they sort out will not come back to this Parliament for approval, so that is not good legislation."
"Nevertheless, I think we can say that what consumers want – and they are the only vested interest that matters – is confidence in the terminology of claims, such as low salt, high in polyunsaturates, and so on. We want to make sure that negatives are not concealed behind positives and we want to make sure that the whole picture is honestly portrayed."
"Ultimately, any claim must stand up in court based on the science which purports to support it."
"So, I think we have made progress on those issues."
"We have removed some of the health claim anomalies – not least, may I say, on light ale, which no more claimed that people would become light than a cough sweet claims that people will cough."
"We hope that the Council will agree to our amendments because we want sensible information in sensible format, which will lead to a better chance of people choosing a healthy diet and thus enhancing their own health and that of their families."
"Mr President, I am going to speak on the report by Mrs Poli Bortone."
"I welcome this legislation because we need it."
"Just look around the shelves in supermarkets and see what is claimed on so many products, including an increasing range of sweets and confectionery – some of those claims are frankly absurd."
"We have heard again tonight people in this House claiming that we do not need this legislation, that it is about the nanny state."
"However, what on earth can be wrong with asking manufacturers who make health and nutritional claims to give the scientific evidence for those claims?"
"A recent survey carried out in my region by the National Consumers’ Association, Which, showed that 99% of people want health claims on food checked before the food goes on sale."
"Indeed, many are quite surprised to find that the claims are not checked properly."
"We have heard a lot of talk about Article 4, with people saying that we do not need it, that nutritional profiling cannot be done."
"Of course nutritional profiling can be done: experts have done it and it is being done in the United States."
"We must move away from the idea of banning this or that."
"Nothing will be banned, but what you will not be able to do is to make a claim for a food substance if it is clearly not a healthy option for people."
"As my colleague Mrs Westlund said, people are fed up with buying so-called low-fat products only to discover by reading very carefully that they are high in sugar or some other ingredients."
"This legislation will mean that all claims should be based on sound and solid evidence."
"Responsible retailers and manufacturers I have met welcome it."
"We seem to forget that without European standards we will have a plethora of national standards, and that is not good news for business."
"This is good for business, it is good for consumers and we should welcome it."
"– Mr President, even though the Council ignored this House’s abundantly clear vote on the health claims at first reading, we have now reached a compromise that I – albeit with gritted teeth – will vote to accept, for, as Mrs Sommer so rightly said, we are now, in practical terms, being faced with the choice between a great evil and a lesser one."
"Turning specifically to two contentious points, I do believe that trademarks are subject to a different legal regime, are covered by other regulations and are quite out of place here."
"As for nutrient profiles, whilst the compromise has made it possible for the profiles to be prevented from having a prohibitive effect, we are nonetheless a long way off making the right deletion, as we did at first reading."
"I remain convinced that nutrient profiles are a misguided concept."
"Obesity and excess weight are problems that need to be taken very seriously; they are the subjects of emotional debates that will be with us again – by the time of the Green Paper on the promotion of healthy eating at the latest."
"I would like, at this juncture, to briefly jump ahead and say that advertising does not make people fat."
"The causes of obesity are multifarious and highly complex, and it is not by imposing more bans that we will successfully address them."
"We should seek the solution in cooperation with the food industry rather than in opposition to it."
"Mr President, this is just another piece of legislation that seeks to increase the authority of the EU over Member States."
"We already have Directive 2002/46/EC, which requires safe upper levels for food supplements."
"However, those limits have not yet been published."
"A better example of EU incompetence would be hard to find."
"Despite this, the EU juggernaut carries on with its overbearing legislation, which only serves to destroy small businesses and removes freedom of choice from the consumer."
"The UK has had enough of this misinformed interference."
"At present there is Private Members’ Bill going through Westminster, calling for the UK to be freed from the directive I mentioned relating to food supplements."
"I hope it succeeds and thus sets a precedent that is the beginning of the end in the UK for the authority of these damaging and unnecessary regulations."
"That would be a significant step towards the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, this regulation takes as its starting point the need to tackle obesity and promote healthy eating, and that is something one cannot do other than agree with, but what we are presented with here is characterised by nothing more than a high degree of bureaucracy, which does little to achieve the objective and, in fact, simply asserts that there are bad food producers, consumers who cannot take responsibility for themselves, and foods both bad and good, the bad ones containing salt, fat and sugar, a state of affairs which nutrient profiles are now to put right."
"If you, Commissioner, really had taken note of what Parliament proposed at first reading, you would have been able to achieve all these lofty objectives, of which I am in favour, and it would have been possible without red tape and burdensome impositions, for these nutrient profiles are beyond my comprehension, and I cannot forget how Mr Podger from the Food Safety Authority said quite clearly that he did not know how he was meant to arrive at them."
"It is for that reason that we are, with this proposal, legislating in the dark, out of touch with reality, with what is going on in society and with the public, to whom it will be very, very difficult to explain this bureaucratic endeavour."
"We can of course turn round and say that we want all data from now on to have a sound scientific basis, which is what everyone wants, but this legislation will not give it to us, and that is why it is not actually a very good idea that we should adopt it in its present form, and it was not well-advised of the Commission and the Council to submit exactly the same proposal, for a second time, at second reading, for it was Parliament’s first response after first reading that was the basis for further discussion that would achieve our objective."
"What we are now embarking on is the suppression of competition and of the market economy, and I do not think that will do our society any good."
"Mr President, the regulation on the addition of vitamins and minerals and certain other substances to food is a most important piece of legislation and has a very significant bearing on the safety and wellbeing of consumers in the EU."
"Mrs Scheele is to be congratulated on the excellent way she has dealt with the subject."
"Congratulations are also due to the Commissioner, Mr Kyprianou, for the open and responsibly cautious way he has approached the subject."
"The reason for my short contribution is to add my voice of support concerning the need for bio-availability and establishment of safe maximum amounts of vitamins and minerals, as well as the need for an accurate but fully comprehensible system of labelling and consumer information."
"Especially with regard to the latter, it is absolutely imperative that European consumers must be able to have at their disposal and be able to read and understand scientifically proven and honest information."
"That may, after all, be essential in order to protect themselves and their families against ingesting excessive and possibly harmful amounts of vitamins and minerals."
"Mr President, European citizens are making increasing efforts to eat healthy foods, because they can see how important this is."
"However, the intention is not sufficient on its own, if it is not accompanied by appropriate information."
"These days, consumers are lost among the great variety of products, and have no alternative but to rely on the statements of manufacturers, which are sometimes unfounded, and often biased."
"We, the legislators, must ensure that the efforts of citizens are not in vain."
"We must ensure that the information specified on products actually helps consumers to select healthy foods."
"At the same time, we are also responsible to ensure that regulation does not create an impossible situation for food manufacturers and distributors."
"Consumer protection is an area that helps bring Europe closer to people."
"When it is interpreted and applied correctly, it also helps manufacturers, because it reduces unfair market competition, it keeps away poor quality products, and ultimately strengthens consumer trust."
"However, it also involves the risk that by incorrect application and over-regulation – as they say, by regulating the curvature of the banana – we could make it all look ridiculous in the eye of European citizens."
"Therefore we must find the golden mean, where we can eat the cake and have adequate information on what it contains."
"Europe will only develop if it does not create conflict, but cooperation in the social and economic area."
"This is why I believe that we should welcome and support the proposal package with its compromises, prepared with long and hard work, even if it is not the ideal solution, as already mentioned by Mrs Sommer and others."
"Beyond the above, as an MEP representing a country with considerable traditions in wine making and wine consumption, I would also like to call attention to the situation of wine."
"It has been scientifically proven that moderate wine consumption brings real health benefits."
"I do not think that in our attempt to fight against alcoholism, instead of trying to eliminate its underlying causes, we should use this or any other law to declare war on wine or beer, which are so important both to European culture and diet; this is why I support their exemption."
"Commissioner, let me begin with a short quotation from a letter I received recently from a company which employs more than 100 people: ‘With great concern we are following the debate on the claims regulation’."
"The regulation on our desk today will make enterprise more complicated and will increase costs for consumers."
"Companies will increase prices and the increased prices will harm consumers, consumers whose needs and interests we mention whenever and wherever we can."
"I think it is common sense to let companies look for their competitive advantages by themselves and let consumers make a choice."
"I want to stress that we do not take into account individual choice and individual responsibility."
"People are fat and people are inactive."
"Some people are becoming fat and some are getting slimmer."
"How easy it would be to blame companies, producers, retail chains and governments for being fat."
"I am strongly against the second reading proposal on our desks."
"It harms enterprise, it increases prices for consumers and it ignores common sense."
"Our lives are in our hands and there are no entitlements without meeting obligations and individual responsibility first."
"Mr President, in the context of the concerns and wider debate on combating obesity and other chronic diseases, the Nutrition and Health Claims Regulation, based on nutrient profiling, will have absolutely no impact."
"It will in fact do damage from a health education point of view, as nutrient profiles are solely based on the composition of a food or food category and do not take into consideration the consumption of the food or food category or consumers’ individual habits."
"The effect of a food containing a substance such as sugar or salt at a low or medium level, but consumed in great quantities, is much more damaging than that of a food containing a substance at a high level but consumed only occasionally."
"Interestingly, scientists have now established that obese children and young people do not actually consume more junk food than children of healthy body weight, but their lifestyle contains a serious deficit of physical activity."
"Establishing objective and science-based nutrient profiles may prove an impossible task and the European Food Safety Authority will have its work cut out."
"Against that background, any policies based on such profiles are likely to be incoherent and lead to arbitrary decisions."
"It is a central tenet of the Lisbon Agenda that legislation should be simple, clear and enforceable."
"Instead of accepting compromises for the sake of political expediency, we should send this Monday morning directive back for redrafting under the better regulation initiative."
"We should ensure that it is in step with scientific best practice in this area, with minimum red tape, that it is SME- and consumer-friendly and, most importantly, that it does what it says on the tin, i.e. it becomes a tool to help combat obesity and other chronic diseases."
"With regard to the regulation on addition of vitamins and minerals and the so-called ‘certain other substances’ to food, I feel very strongly that mass medication of the population at large, through the addition of substances to publicly supplied basic necessities such as drinking water, is ethically questionable and should not be permitted, particularly if it cannot be scientifically proven that the health of sensitive groups within the population is not adversely affected by such an addition."
"For example, the addition of fluoride to drinking water has a disproportionately negative effect on bottle-fed babies and young children, as their reconstituted milk formula made from that public drinking water equates to their total diet."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations to Mrs Scheele on her report, which, with the amendments added, amounts to a fine dossier, and many thanks to Mrs Poli Bortone, who has certainly put a lot of work into a report that is complex and comprehensive without, alas, being in line with my way of thinking."
"What has to be borne in mind here, both as a matter of principle and of policy, is that the Council and the Commission have played from what is still a position of excessive strength vis-à-vis Parliament, which has now been forced to give its agreement for fear of even greater damage being done."
"The powers-that-be in the administrative community constituted by the Council and the Commission have got their way against the political will of a majority in this House, and a good draft, amended at first reading, has been well and truly filleted."
"While I have no objection to nutrient profiles, a dossier needs to be put together in accordance with certain principles; for a start, there are no concrete proposals – what one might term the pre-production model – from the Commission."
"The expert knowledge of medical specialists, nutritionists and psychologists needs to be drawn on, and their opinions need to be balanced against one another."
"I wonder what added value this is going to bring to Europe; I want to be told about the chances of this being implemented, and about how SMEs are meant to survive."
"I also ask myself whether protecting consumers should not mean something more than treating them like children, but should – and can – also involve helping them to reach their own decisions."
"Looked at from the scientific angle, it has to be said that one can expect the effect of this on the way Europeans – particularly children – eat and consume to be virtually non-existent, but, even so, we will have created a new bureaucratic monster to persuade our citizens of Europe’s usefulness."
"We will swallow this particular toad – the nutrient profile for which will probably describe it as ‘too slimy’ – but I hope it will be the last of its kind."
"Mr President, like my colleague, Mrs Sommer, I can only express my deep dissatisfaction faced with the common position that has been submitted to us for second reading."
"We have here a typical example of a missed opportunity, particularly on the part of the Commission, to support the reasonable position adopted by Parliament at first reading, and this at a time when Mr Barroso constantly regales us with arguments in favour of more subsidiarity, less bureaucracy, and I could go on."
"Seeking to impose nutrient profiles on consumers, without any scientific evidence, is as unacceptable as it is rash."
"Mr Schnellhardt illustrated this point well."
"As chairman of this Parliament's ‘wine’ intergroup, I have a duty to emphasise the disproportionate nature of the total ban on any claim appearing on alcoholic beverages of more than 1.2% volume."
"Not only is wine the subject of specific Community regulations, but very credible scientific evidence exists to show that wine, when consumed in moderation, meaning two or three glasses per day for example, is good for a person’s health."
"It is, among other things, effective in preventing cardiovascular diseases, cancer and dementia, a point that the Commissioner and his services magisterially overlook."
"The compromise worked on by Mrs Sommer, whom I thank, is merely the lesser evil."
"I can only lament the little understanding shown by the Council and the Commission regarding this matter, as well as the consequences of their obstinacy, particularly for employment."
"In order to give the Council and the Commission one last chance to reconsider some incomprehensible positions that could compromise the conciliation procedure and the objectives set by the Lisbon Strategy, we, together with Mrs Klass, have tabled an amendment that excludes wine and beer from the scope of Article 4(3), so as not to harm sectors that have been part of our cultural and culinary heritage for thousands of years."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, I too have serious reservations regarding the Commission’s proposal."
"Its administrative and financial burden will hinder competition and lead to price rises for consumers."
"I therefore wonder whom this costly system is supposed to benefit."
"The proposal will be detrimental to SMEs, for which any new red tape is an obstacle to business, and it paves the way for the monopolisation of the European market."
"I do not support these regulations on health grounds, since they cannot make any demonstrable improvements to the health of Europeans."
"Expensive nutrition and health profiles on food packaging will not in themselves influence consumer behaviour and will certainly not cause Europeans to lose weight or to improve their health."
"Such matters are influenced instead by lifestyle, a healthy environment and trust in doctors’ explanations and professional advice."
"What European consumers obviously need is to understand all of the complex information on foods, and that applies to all EU Member States."
"I therefore support the consolidation of rules concerning claims made on foods throughout the EU and the fight against false claims."
"Consumers, however, would still much prefer to have transparency and visible information regarding ingredients, rather than an assessment of the health effects of each food."
"Unfortunately, this new regulation does not do a great deal in terms of improving guidance for consumers, for example with regard to the size of lettering and a clear, standardised format for claims."
"Instead of rules of this nature, it proposes a complicated licensing system for the content of information on food."
"Speaking as a doctor, I am aware of how important it is for people following special diets to be able to check exactly what is inside every food item."
"For example, people with gluten allergies need to know for certain that products such as unpacked pâté do not contain flour."
"From a health point of view, this is more important to them than information regarding the reduction of fat in yoghurt, something European consumers might enjoy along with a roll and butter, and, heaven forbid, even a slice of white pudding."
"The Commission’s proposal runs counter to the Lisbon Strategy."
"I believe that tomorrow we will obtain a majority for our proposals, which at least pave the way for greater flexibility for registration, the possibility of greater protection of rights for claimants, a shorter protection period for scientifically established claims, the removal of unpacked alcohol products from the directive and other amendments."
"Otherwise we would have to reject the proposal outright."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Members for a very interesting debate."
"Those who have worked with me for the past year and a half know by now that I tend to speak in a very open and frank way."
"I can honestly say that this is the only legislative proposal I never thought I would have to fight for."
"It is a proposal based on logic."
"It states that if someone wants to make money by using a marketing tool, that person or company has to tell the truth."
"It is simple."
"We talk about consumer choice."
"What would consumers do: set up a little chemical laboratory at home to analyse every food to see whether it has sugar or fat?"
"How can consumers exercise this choice unless someone checks that this is accurate?"
"Regarding health claims, will consumers carry out clinical tests in at home to see whether a specific product lowers cholesterol?"
"It is impossible!"
"That is why it is important to have this legislation adopted, especially after the compromise, and I am surprised that there has been no legislation so far in this respect."
"What happens if we do not have this legislation?"
"What will be the result?"
"Anybody can say anything and hope for the best."
"In the European Union, all of us, including the leaders of large Member States, pledge to place the European citizen at the heart of European policies."
"I believe that this is a good test of whether we actually do so."
"I firmly agree that better regulation is an essential policy for us."
"However, that does not mean there should be no regulation, especially when it comes to health and consumer protection."
"It means we have to do it in the proper way."
"As I stated in my introductory remarks, I believe that with Parliament’s suggestions and amendments we now have a good piece of legislation which does not put any unnecessary burden on the industry and, at the same time, protects the consumer."
"We tend to forget a very important aspect: the internal market."
"You have my word that these areas of health will be regulated."
"The question is whether it will be done at Community level, meaning that there will be one level playing field in the internal market and that industry, benefiting from the 450 million consumers, can be competitive, or whether there will be 25 different sets of rules and regulations breaking up the internal market."
"All along I have been in dialogue with the industry and this is what it would like."
"I always ask industry representatives whether they would prefer one piece of legislation, even a strict one, or 25 different laws with flexible levels."
"They prefer to have one piece of legislation."
"That is a very important factor."
"On wine, I understand what was said, but we have to remember that wine is an alcoholic beverage."
"It may come from an agricultural product, but it contains alcohol and it must be covered by this legislation."
"On the issue of fluoride, I must remind you that the problem mentioned is compulsory fluoridation, which does not come under this legislation but under the Member States’ competence."
"It is a different issue and we could discuss it, but it is not part of this legislation, because the claims and additions in question are voluntary."
"In conclusion, as I have already said, it is a good compromise."
"Each side would have liked to see this compromise go a bit further in one direction or another."
"However, it takes into account, in a balanced way, the interests of all stakeholders."
"I agree that, alone, it cannot solve the problem of obesity."
"As you know, we have generally followed a non-regulatory approach to deal with such a complex issue."
"We have set up a platform and we are discussing with industry and stakeholders how we can each help to solve this problem."
"However, in certain areas legislation and regulation are required."
"We therefore need a combination of all actions and initiatives to achieve the ultimate goal(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.30 a.m."
"Although the compromise struck between Parliament and the Council is not perfect, it is one I can support."
"Compared to the original proposal, it is far less bureaucratic without prejudicing consumer protection."
"Consumers are given proper information without being patronised."
"Dutch terms such as or may continue to be used to describe cough sweets, since everyone appreciates that these sweets cannot always immediately make the cough disappear."
"Consumers must be able to rely on food and health claims being true and scientifically underpinned."
"Research has shown that 53% of consumers trust food claims."
"As we have rid the regulation of unnecessary bureaucracy without compromising consumer protection, the consumer can make an informed choice."
"At the same time, though, the bakery round the corner can continue to promote its high-fibre rolls without having to negotiate a long-drawn-out authorisation procedure first."
"The Commission can accept Amendments 50 to 89."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments 1 to 49, 90 and 91."
"The Commission can accept Amendments 1, 5, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 19."
"The next item is the report (A6-0140/2006) by Mr Maat, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing measures for the recovery of the stock of European Eel (COM(2005)0472 C6-0326/2005 2005/0201(CNS))."
". Mr President, I welcome Parliament’s report on the Commission’s proposal concerning eels and would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Maat, for his good work."
"I see that Parliament has taken very seriously the grave threat to the European eel population."
"Parliament has made a number of helpful and practical suggestions to improve the proposal."
"I can support many of the amendments as they stand."
"A number of others I can support in principle, but not their inclusion in the proposal, because they should be dealt with in another way."
"A small number of other issues require further scientific analysis before they can be implemented practically."
"I can accept Amendments 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 21, 22, 23, 27 and 29."
"I agree that Member States should be able to choose their own closed seasons to reduce fishing effort by 50% and that the timescale of the proposal should be lengthened so that Member States can better develop management plans and have more flexibility in defining the areas to which eel management plans should apply."
"I also accept that Member States should be able to move forwards individually if difficulties arise in developing management plans in cooperation between several states."
"There are several amendments proposed to which I am sympathetic in principle, but which concern issues that I believe should be addressed differently."
"Amendments 4, 8 and 11 concern implementation and further research on the way aquaculture could be involved in improving the stocking of European waters with eels."
"Research needs cannot be addressed directly in a Council regulation of this type."
"Funding through the framework programmes and consultation of advisory bodies, such as the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, are more appropriate ways to further research."
"I will ensure that these more appropriate methods for commissioning research are used."
"Until the results of the research requested in Amendment 4 are available, it would be premature to proceed with implementation as requested in Amendments 8 and 11."
"Amendments 5 and 25 concern exports of glass eels."
"This is a trade issue."
"Once the Community has developed internal conservation measures for eels, the Community could then develop export restrictions that would favour and protect the use of eels for populating Community inland waters."
"My colleague, Commissioner Mandelson, is aware of this issue and he will begin preparing export measures for glass eels once the Council has taken a decision on eel conservation."
"In order to ensure compatibility with the World Trade Organization rules, conservation measures within our own waters must be the first step."
"Amendment 9 expresses a good idea: migration of glass eels should not be obstructed."
"However, I consider it would be more in the spirit of the developed approach adopted in this proposed regulation that Member States should make such choices themselves in the context of eel management measures."
"Amendment 16 is no longer necessary, because I have accepted that Member States can have flexibility in the definition of eel river basins, as requested in Amendment 13."
"I agree with the principle expressed in Amendment 17, but the possibility for several Member States to prepare a joint management plan is already covered in Article 8."
"Amendments 18 and 28 concern the targets and implementing methods to achieve eel stock recovery."
"Here I refer to the latest advice of the STECF."
"This advice tells us that it is extremely difficult to measure eel escapement and that it is preferable to focus on directly applicable measures such as a 50% reduction in the impact on eels due to fishing and a similar reduction in the effect on eels of fixed installations such as turbines and pumps."
"I believe we should proceed on this basis at present, but Member States should improve and refine data collection concerning eels in order to improve management targets and measures."
"Amendments 19 and 20 concern financial aid for restocking and for constructing passes for eels."
"I support these ideas so long as restocking results in improved silver eel escapement, but as these ideas are to be included in the new European Fisheries Fund regulation, this piece of legislation is not the right place for them."
"I can accept that the burden caused by the need for reports should be lightened, as proposed in Amendment 26, but this could take place through less frequent reports."
"It is still necessary for Member States to improve substantially the collection of data, so a requirement to improve the scientific basis for eel management is an important part of my proposal."
"Amendment 24 suggests extending eel management plans to coastal waters and, in particular, to the Baltic Sea."
"I agree that management of eel fisheries in coastal areas is important, but it would not be technically feasible at present to apply an escapement target to sea fisheries, because this cannot be measured."
"Indeed, I will support the inclusion of marine fisheries for eels as fisheries that should be subject to a 50% reduction of general fishing effort."
"I thank the Committee on Fisheries and the rapporteur, Mr Maat, for their very positive cooperation in the preparation of this report."
"I sincerely hope that, by making a significant and substantial effort in the near future, it will be possible to improve considerably the situation of eel stocks in Europe."
". Mr President, I should like to extend warm thanks to Commissioner Borg for the excellent cooperation and also for the way in which we were able to look into the technical opportunities."
"I will return in due course to a number observations pertaining to amendments."
"First, though, I should like to consider the object of this debate."
"After all, this debate about the regulation for the recovery of eel stocks shows that the European Parliament can lay down legislation, even in areas where it only has advisory powers."
"Although fishing in inland waters is strictly speaking a matter for the Member States and not for the European Union, in close cooperation with my fellow MEPs and Mr Borg, the European Commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs, we have managed quite literally to give eels a helping hand."
"What is so special about eel is that it is both a freshwater and salt water fish."
"While the regulation for fisheries is a matter for the EU, inland waterways fall within the remit of the Member States."
"As such, the eel has been overlooked for years."
"Since there was no legislation at European or national level, the eel slipped, time after time, through the legislator’s nets."
"Eel stocks have now declined dramatically."
"Over the past 50 years, stocks of young eel at sea, so-called glass eel, have declined by more than 95%."
"With only 25% of adult eel left, they have not fared much better."
"It is therefore high time we sprung into action to save the European eel, and a broad and comprehensive approach is desperately needed."
"For that reason, I would also thank Commissioner Borg for the swiftness with which he has translated Parliament’s own-initiative report into a proposal for a regulation."
"After all, only a unanimous stance of all those involved, including professional fisheries, recreational fisheries, regional and national authorities, environmental and nature organisations, can bring about a U-turn."
"It is therefore unique that the new initiative to rescue eel should be supported by all those parties in the manner I will describe to you now."
"In order to get eel stocks to recover, it has been decided to reduce eel-fishing by half."
"Member States can, however, instead of this reduction by half – which, in practice would often lead to closure – also draft a management plan for the recovery of eel."
"They can do so for the entire territory, a region or for a river basin."
"This management plan could become the ultimate form of cooperation between all parties involved."
"This does not require any action from on high – from Brussels or the Member States’ capitals – but from the bottom up, involving citizens and people on the job."
"This method can regulate the exports of glass eel and is eminently usable for European rivers, canals and lakes."
"Also, this recovery plan hugely promotes technical measures, such as hydro-electric power stations, sluices and dikes, thus making unhindered fish migration possible."
"The broad, north-to-south, support in Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries is the key to successful decision-making in the European Fisheries Council."
"If the European Commission adopts the adjustments proposed by Parliament, as the Commissioner indicated with regard to a large number of points, successful decision-making can be guaranteed with a wide support base – from Sweden to Spain – of fishermen, recreational fishermen and environmental organisations alike."
"That also means that the Commission and Council should not let this unique opportunity slip."
"I am particularly grateful to the Commissioner for adopting a large number of the amendments."
"I am also indebted to him for the initiatives he has taken with Mr Mandelson, particularly with regard to international trade policy, in order to better regulate not only the catch of glass eel but also the exports in this area."
"This offers prospects for glass eel as a venture, in European waters as well as elsewhere, which also makes it possible to work towards sustainability."
"The Commissioner was right to observe that Parliament has deleted a specific sustainability criterion from an amendment and has indicated that he, in tandem with technical experts, would like to find out how an objective measuring method can be arrived at after all."
"I welcome this, for this also reflects the mood in Parliament."
"The specific number 40%, however, did cause problems here and there, and perhaps regional differences can also be taken into consideration in this respect."
"In a nutshell, I am pleased that the Commissioner has accepted a large number of amendments."
"As for trade policy and a number of other areas, I am convinced that we will now manage to achieve much better eel stocks in the European Union in five or ten years’ time."
"This is something that will benefit everyone, not only the public, but also fisheries, recreational fishermen and everyone who cares about eel."
"I would thank the fellow Members once again for the excellent teamwork during the preparation of this report and I am looking forward to the debate that will follow and also the vote on my report."
". – Mr President, I am pleased that the Commissioner has taken good note both of this Parliament’s report on the recovery of European eel stocks and of the rapporteur, Mr Maat’s, working methods."
"The rigidity of the Commission’s proposal, its obfuscation in ignoring the biological behaviour of eels, whose capture is closely linked to lunar phases, and the injustice of seeing fishing as the only cause of the reduction in the eel population, have been replaced by a compromise by the rapporteur. We must thank him for his flexibility and his sensitivity in listening to the different fleets fishing eel during all of the phases of their lives and in habitats and river basins that vary enormously throughout Europe."
"The Commission’s proposal was rejected by the sector in all of the countries of the Union, by national administrations and by this Parliament."
"Mr Maat’s report has been approved unanimously in the Committee on Fisheries and has restored calm."
"The Commission must therefore take good note."
"We are aware of the urgent need to recover eel stocks and the proposal is therefore to reduce the fishing effort by half."
"Nevertheless, a reasonable way to do so is being proposed, replacing the Commission’s absurd proposal that fishing be halted from the first to the fifteenth day of each month."
"The obligation for future national plans to guarantee a 40% escape rate for eels, something that is practically impossible to calculate, is also removed and replaced by measures that guarantee a high escape rate for adult eel and, to this end, it is requested that account be taken not just of fishing, but of all human activities along rivers that hinder or prevent the return of eel to the sea."
"In conclusion, the report by Mr Maat and the Committee on Fisheries is a balanced and measured consensus report and, in line with what the Commissioner has said, I hope that both he and the Council will take good note of it."
".Mr President, in my home country of Denmark, as in so many other places in the Community, eel fishing has a long history, and in many places eel is an important foodstuff."
"This tradition is now threatened, not only in Denmark but throughout the Community, as a result of the critical state of the eel stock."
"The European eel is now so overfished that the stock is only around 1% of what it was in the past."
"This is not only a precarious situation, it is also a great challenge for the common fisheries policy."
"In the end, one may add, it is also the last chance."
"The main aim of this report is for each Member State to produce a national Eel Management Plan for each and every river basin, and precisely the fact that the report covers each and every river basin is very important."
"These plans are intended to make it highly probable that a high percentage of the biomass of adult eels will be able to escape back to sea."
"Under the Commission’s original proposal, there was to be a sea-return rate of around 40%."
"This, in my opinion, was a positive feature and, in fact, I would also have preferred us to have retained it."
"Something else that I am very happy about – and another thing that Mr Maat was involved in – is that we will now be having special measures to ensure that the restocking of fry can continue."
"It is absolutely critical that we have fry, because, if we do not, then we have no possibility of rebuilding our stocks."
"It seems to me that, through his report, Mr Maat has produced some good work, and I would very much like to thank him for that."
"I believe that we now have before us something that can be made use of and that has great significance for all of us, and I hope that both Parliament’s contribution and the debate to take place amongst the fisheries ministers in the Council will result in the development of an action plan that will lead to the rebuilding of the eel stock."
"As I said at the beginning, we are now at the stage where the situation is such that, if an effective effort is not made on the part of each and every Member State, eels within the Community, as such, will be a thing of the past. We have an obligation to safeguard the stock of eels."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although the continental fishing of eel is not officially subject to the common fisheries policy, we are all aware of the reduction in stocks suffered by this species over recent years, and this could put eel at risk of extinction unless we implement an action plan within the European Union."
"With a view to tackling this situation, the Commission is presenting us with a proposal for a Regulation containing measures which reflect good intentions but which, in my humble opinion, could be improved."
"In the Basque Country, which I represent here, we are not just well acquainted with the adult eel, but also its young – the elver – which has historically been an ingredient in one of the most succulent and highly-prized dishes in our cuisine."
"For this historical reason, we are aware that the life cycle of our eel is very long, that it is a migratory species and that the females, before dying, travel for a year to spawn in the Sargasso Sea, in the Atlantic Ocean between Bermuda and Puerto Rico, where they lay up to 20 million leaf-shaped eggs which float freely in ball-shaped groups and are carried by sea currents, taking a year to reach the North American coasts and up to three years to reach European coasts."
"When they reach our rivers they have undergone a metamorphosis: they have become elvers and they carry on growing until they mature into eels."
"Since their fishing depends on the lunar cycle, the ban on their fishing from the first to the fifteenth day of each month could lead either to the almost complete closure of that fishing or, quite the opposite, it may have no effect on it, depending on the phase of the moon during that fortnight."
"It would be more effective to reduce the fishing season in such a way as to reduce the fishing effort by half."
"Furthermore, the proposed timetable does not appear viable, since the plans require coordination amongst different regions and Member States, and that takes time."
"Furthermore, since the current knowledge for calculating escape rate is not sufficient and the models currently being investigated within the SLIME project will not be available in the immediate future, the best option is to delay until 2008 the authorisation to fish eel during seasonal bans, as an exception based on a particular management plan."
"We know that many people live from eel fishing and we cannot destroy the sector, but rather we must find a balance which guarantees the survival of resources at the same time."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also the Council on its working document, which confirms everything that we have said."
"Make no mistake: eels were the trailblazers."
"Long before we Europeans began to cooperate across borders, eels did so as part of their lifestyle."
"They converge in the Sargasso Sea from throughout Europe in order to meet each other and produce offspring, irrespective of national borders."
"In the last 40 years, however, eel stocks have declined by more than 75%."
"The most rapid decline has taken place over the last 20 years."
"It takes eels 20 years or more to reach sexual maturity, and it will be many years before we are able to fish for those eels being born today."
"This also means that it will be many years before we get to see the results of the measures, so it is time for all countries to help each other."
"Eels have already taken more of a beating than they can tolerate."
"Given that eels are a symbol of cross-border cooperation, it would be a symbolic failure for the whole of the EU and in terms of the whole future of the EU if we did not succeed in saving the eel."
"I welcome Commissioner Borg’s comments this evening on the sensible proposals put forward in the report with regard to closure and Member States’ abilities in this respect."
"I certainly hope that Commissioner Mandelson can move on the international trade aspect."
"The glass eel is particularly vulnerable, since large quantities of glass eels are exported to south-east Asia, and this has consequences for the industry as a whole."
"Today’s report contains very sensible proposals."
"In my own constituency, the Lough Neagh Fishermen’s Cooperative Society has taken great care over the years to manage the fishery in such a way as to conserve stocks, and I will continue to commend this to the Commission and Parliament as a model of best practice, which should be supported at both national and EU level."
"You began your speech in Irish, which becomes an official language of the EU next January, so you were anticipating that event."
"Mr President, it is important to point out and to remember that river and inland fishing is not a competence of the EU, yet here we have in essence a proposal for eel management, which, in effect, asserts EU control over inland waters."
"So there is a question as to whether aspects of this proposal are ."
"Within Northern Ireland we have the largest commercial wild-eel fishery in Europe, centred on Lough Neagh and the lower River Bann."
"It supplies quality eels to much of Europe, particularly northern Europe."
"Efficiently run, it has been meeting its ecological obligations by already ensuring sufficient escapement of mature eels for spawning, and, at its own cost, funding restocking with junior eels."
"It would be absurd if it were now to be subjected to punitive restrictions because the greed and practices of others elsewhere in Europe have radically diminished European stocks."
"The main cause of stock reduction is the export of elvers to the Far East."
"Last year, France alone exported eight tonnes of elvers."
"I therefore welcome the report’s attempts to curb this exporting of the future of the European eel industry."
"I also welcome moves to insist that eel farms should guarantee a percentage escapement of mature eels."
"All have a part to play in the recovery of the biomass, but particularly those who have to date squandered our resources."
"I strongly support the rejection of a 15-day closure per month and I favour eel management plans that are specific to each individual river basin, rather than established on a national basis."
"I believe that will enable areas such as mine, which have looked after their product well and properly, to continue and to avoid draconian and unnecessary restrictions."
"That self-regulation and control should be an example to others."
"I hope that under the EFF there will be restocking funding available and that it can be taken up."
"– Mr President, I start with a finding made by all my honourable friends who spoke previously: in numerous areas, stocks of eel have fallen by up to 90%."
"In many rivers, eels migrating upstream for spawning have fallen by over 95%."
"We are heading for an ecological disaster."
"Everyone recognised earlier – and we all agree on this – that we need to take measures to deal with this situation."
"The target has been set: the escapement of adult eels must be at least 40%."
"However, we propose the following: the measures taken must not be fragmentary; they must be scientifically proven and must be taken in cooperation with fishermen."
"We need the fishermen, because they know the subject better than anyone and, at the same time, we need their consent and their cooperation to ensure the measures are more effective."
"I heard with a great deal of pleasure – as many others acknowledged – that it is not just fishermen who are to blame for the present situation."
"Pollution is to blame, various technical works are to blame and many other factors are to blame."
"However, what is important is the final finding on the matter in question."
"Account also needs to be taken of the peculiarities of each Member State and of the differences between free and controlled fishing."
"To close, I would emphasise that we need to consider how we are to combat copious uncontrolled exports to third countries, because if we leave them free, with the trend described today, we shall empty our waters of eels and we shall not have any to send to the Orient anyway."
"– Mr President, this proposal is the result of the Commission’s Communication on the development of a Community action plan for the management of European eels."
"This Communication proposed actions such as the prohibition of fishing gear intended for the capture of silver eels in certain areas, measures to facilitate their emigration downstream and also, finally, additional proposals intended to improve the survival rate during other phases of their life cycle."
"The Commission justified this sequence with the premise that the advantages resulting from a reduction in the fishing of young eel are still uncertain and it stressed its belief that the evolution of the population depended on factors other than fishing, the pollution of riverbeds, the disappearance of habitats, the non-maintenance of ecological values and obstacles to upstream and downstream migrations."
"Starting with this approach – with which I agree – we ended up with a proposed Regulation which points to fishing as solely responsible for the European eel population falling outside of the biological safety limits."
"The proposal also includes an arbitrary fifteen-day ban that lacks any biological justification. a ban on fishing, landing or conserving eels from the first to the fifteenth day of each month."
"These are drastic, erroneous and supplemented measures with an objective that is very difficult to define or monitor – the escape to the sea of 40% of the biomass of adult eel."
"In this regard, the report by the Committee on Fisheries and the work by the rapporteur, Mr Maat, corrects these two serious problems and they will naturally have our support."
"I would also like to address the People’s Party and our rapporteur, Mr Maat, to ask them not to start fires and then end up having to put them out, and I am talking specifically about the proposal for a ban on elvers, which would have extremely serious consequences for certain regions in my country."
"Mr President, after other species such as cod, it is now the turn of eels to be threatened by a fall in stocks, of more than 95% for elvers, for example."
"Since the species migrates three times over - in the Atlantic, from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, for example, and from the sea to the river - the fate of eels clearly serves to remind us that the world is interdependent, especially when the sudden rise in demand from the East encourages fishing in Europe."
"That being said, the everyday reality for eels is one of being caught by locals, for example in pools on the edge of the Mediterranean in the South of France."
"There, hundreds of fishermen make their living from that activity."
"To ban them from fishing for two weeks a month, while booms, cormorants, power stations and oceanic disturbances place a strain on the life cycle of eels, is unjust and ineffective, and that is where subsidiarity must come into play."
"Let us leave it to the fishermens’ - the professional organisations - to look into the fate of eels more closely."
"The survival of eels does not depend on Community federalism, but on the action of local professional organisations."
"Mr President, I believe that Mr Maat’s report comes to the European Parliament at a time when expectations are high in terms of finding a solution to the problem of glass eel stocks in Europe."
"Global demand for European eels is estimated at approximately 200 tonnes. In recent years, however, the catch of glass eels has been decreasing."
"In 2004 barely 130 tonnes were caught and in 2005 the figure fell to 75 tonnes. As a result, the price of glass eels rose rapidly: from EUR 300-400 in the mid-1990s to EUR 1200 in 2005."
"Eel production has basically ceased to be viable in Europe."
"A particularly difficult situation is faced by those countries that have a very limited access to free sources of glass eel stocks."
"This includes the majority of the Baltic States."
"As we know, this situation is the result of the decline in the number of glass eels migrating from marine waters to inland waters."
"In turn, the low level of glass eel stocks forces these countries to import fish rearing material."
"However, they are facing a growing number of financial restrictions resulting from the rising price of glass eels in Europe."
"The new Member States from the Baltic region are being burdened with the very high prices for glass eel exports to Asian countries."
"Bearing this situation in mind, a system needs to be created that is based on ensuring that the costs of protecting glass eel stocks are fairly distributed among all interested parties."
"This, of course, also includes exporters and importers of glass eels."
"Mr President, I welcome Mr Maat's report on eels, because I believe that we need to take action."
"The biggest problem is the fishing of elvers."
"The problem is that they are so valuable, probably as valuable as gold, and for this reason people collect them."
"If we could reduce the number of elvers being taken, then we would build up the eel population."
"On my own farm, people sometimes fish illegally by letting fresh water out into the salt water to attract the elvers and then catch them."
"It is not always easy to catch the people who are catching the elvers."
"We need to control the quantity of elvers sold in each Member State."
"These elvers are collected in tanks in local towns and villages and it should not be too difficult for the authorities to clamp down on where they are being sold."
"It is a good idea to rejuvenate stocks and give money for this purpose."
"However, it is much more sensible to allow the wild elvers coming back from the sea to swim up the rivers and develop into large eels."
"Then we can either catch them and eat them as whole eels or use them to replenish the stocks."
"The problem is not the lack of eels but the fact that we catch them when they are very small."
"I welcome this report, because it is time that we took action."
"Otherwise we will be talking here for so long that by the time we have finished there will be no eels – either elvers or mature eels – left for us to catch."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Maat, that we can and should regulate where it is necessary."
"I hope this measure will produce the desired results and that it is not too late."
"If one looks at the figures, the situation is almost catastrophic."
"Mr Gklavakis mentioned that stocks of eels are about 90 to 95% less than historic levels, which has been confirmed by the scientific research into levels of stocks of eels and silver eels in particular."
"I cannot agree more that it is a bottom-up approach, not a top-down approach, and that the Commission would like to have more of this."
"That is why we are trying to involve the sector more and more, by setting up regional advisory councils and by listening to the European Parliament, which is always very close to the grass roots of this sector."
"The Commission had an open approach and came up with a proposal, for want of a more appropriate and specific approach, because when we talked to the sector we did not, at that juncture, find a more appropriate solution than the 15-day closure in the original proposal."
"As I said in my opening remarks, the Commission is willing to accept the proposal Parliament presented to it, since that would work towards replenishing eel stocks in a way that would produce results without too much difficulty for the sector itself."
"Mrs Fraga Estévez and Mrs Miguélez Ramos mentioned that the Commission proposal was rejected by the sector."
"That is true, but the proposal at least served to launch the debate in order to try to find the most appropriate solution for the whole question of eel management."
"With Parliament’s amendments, which the Commission has accepted, we can now speak of a measure that can move towards producing results and has a reasonable prospect of success."
"Mr Kristensen mentioned that the Commission proposal underlines the need for management plans by Member States at national or regional level, and with the amendment proposed by Parliament we can move ahead with reasonable prospects of success at those levels."
"As I said before, on the points made by Mr Ortuondo Larrea and Mr Martinez, closure for the first 15 days of the month was proposed for want of a better proposal."
"The amendment before us has been accepted and even the extension of the implementation period has been accepted by the Commission."
"I agree with the comments by Mr Schlyter, Mrs de Brún and Mr Parish and I have taken note of the points raised."
"Mr Allister raised the question of ."
"The Commission’s view is that conservation measures are not ."
"If a country or region manages stock of eels or other inland fisheries properly, certainly no intervention would be solicited or required and therefore self-regulation and control would continue."
"However, where the situation requires intervention for conservation purposes, the Commission would have the right to intervene on behalf of the Community."
"Export measures will be undertaken separately, but we must first set our own house in order, because, at the end of the day, if we go to international fora presenting measures that would curtail exports, they would be immediately attacked if we have not introduced measures to rectify our own situation."
"Finally, with regard to the point raised by Mr Chmielewski, I have taken note of the points he raised and we will look into them, especially in conjunction with possible funding under the European Fisheries Fund."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate rapporteur Albert Jan Maat on a timely report."
"My country, Estonia, is surrounded by sea on two sides, and on the third by a large lake."
"Fish have played an important role in our economy and culture for centuries, and we know well how complicated and sensitive a topic this is."
"The fifty-year-long Cold War and arms race also took place in the area of fisheries."
"Their legacy is enormous fishing capacities and fish stocks that cannot be restored."
"In order to restore the natural cycle, fishing must be reduced by as much as 60% in some places."
"Former fishermen are unable to find other work, and fishing boats purchased with European Union aid are now being made into scrap metal with European Union aid."
"The replenishment of eel stocks will be a test of international cooperation."
"Glass eels are threatened by demand from Asia, and the passage of eels of reproductive age from inland waters to the sea is influenced by man-made obstacles, such as the dam of the Russian-owned hydroelectric power station on the Estonian border."
"Such problems cannot be solved without effective international cooperation."
"I expect effective action from Member States and the European Commission in the international arena."
"I do not, however, expect intervention on a detailed level."
"I am glad that this report introduces an amendment to the initial text, which had established fishing restrictions for specific periods."
"Traditional fishing families in coastal villages know best how to fish sustainably, but industrial fishing on the high seas has brought their lifestyle to the brink of extinction."
"They too need purposeful support: without them and their knowledge, it may prove impossible to restore a sustainable fishery in Estonia."
"Thank you for your attention."
"The next item is the report by Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco (COM(2005)0692 – C6-0040/2006 – 2005/0280(CNS)) (A6-0163/2006)."
". Mr President, I am very pleased to refer today to the Commission proposal for a Council regulation concerning the new Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the Community and Morocco."
"Before outlining the Commission’s position on this file, let me first thank the Committee on Fisheries and especially its chairman, Mr Morillon, for his excellent work, and the rapporteur, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, for his report."
"As Members know, this agreement marks the renewal of our relations with the Kingdom of Morocco in the fisheries sector after the previous agreement came to an end in November 1999."
"The agreement also marks an important step forward towards strengthening our overall relations with Morocco."
"The agreement marks a new era in fisheries relations between the Union and Morocco."
"For the first time the Commission has negotiated a fisheries partnership with Morocco, following the principles laid down in the Council conclusions of July 2004."
"It prepares the ground for fruitful cooperation between the two parties with a view to achieving sustainable fishing and it will foster a favourable climate for further cooperation in all segments of the fisheries sector."
"The new Fisheries Partnership Agreement establishes the basis for a political dialogue between the Community and Morocco in order to identify areas of common interest, thereby taking into account also the particular objectives, needs and opportunities of the Moroccan fishing sector."
"On this basis, the agreement will contribute to the development of a reasonable fisheries policy in the waters concerned."
"At the same time, I am convinced that the agreement with Morocco is a very balanced one, which responds to the interests of the Community fleet and in particular the small-scale fleet that was most affected by the terms of the previous agreement."
"Six categories of fishing possibilities are covered by the agreement."
"Four of them are small-scale fisheries, small pelagic vessels in the north, bottom long-liners, small-scale vessels in the south, and pole-and-line tuna vessels."
"A category of demersal fisheries is also included, as well as industrial pelagic fisheries, which is limited to a quota of 60 000 tonnes of catches per year."
"The protocol sets the financial contribution at EUR 36.1 million per year."
"A substantial part of this amount – EUR 13.5 million – is earmarked for support measures in view of the implementation of a sustainable and reasonable fisheries policy."
"The agreement has been concluded for a period of four years and contains a number of elements on which the partnership approach is based."
"They include, amongst other things, an exclusivity clause which prohibits the existence of private licences or other private arrangements outside the scope of the agreement; scientific cooperation in order to promote responsible fishing in Moroccan fishing zones; the possibility of a review of the fishing opportunities on the basis of scientific evidence and within the limits required by the sustainable management of Morocco’s resources; vessel monitoring system requirements to reinforce checks on vessels operating in Moroccan fishing zones; and the social clause applicable to local seamen signed on by Community vessels."
"I am confident that this agreement will be implemented in the best possible way and in the spirit of partnership, dialogue and remarkable mutual respect that has characterised our relations with the Kingdom of Morocco since the beginning of the negotiations."
"At this point allow me to turn briefly to the amendments."
"Although the Commission can agree with the spirit of certain amendments, such as Amendments 2, 5, 7, 10 and 13, it does not consider them necessary."
"Similarly it does not consider Amendment 4 necessary, and it cannot accept Amendments 1, 3, 6, 8, 9, 11 or 12."
"On Amendments 14 to 18, the question of the EC-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the related question of Western Sahara have been discussed at great length, in the European Parliament’s Fisheries Committee, as well as in the Committee on Development and the Committee on Budgets."
"I would like to emphasise again that the agreement is fully in conformity with international law."
"This has also been confirmed by the opinion of the European Parliament’s Legal Service, and the legal services of the Commission and the Council."
"The content of the agreement does not contain any provision dealing with the legal status of the maritime waters pertaining to Western Sahara."
"It defines the Moroccan fishing zone as the waters falling within the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Morocco."
"This neither defines nor prejudges the legal status of the waters concerned."
"According to the provisions of the agreement, it is up to the Moroccan authorities as the contracting party concerned to define the fishing zones on the basis of which fishing licences will be issued."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as promised, we are here today, just one part-session later, in a position to present plenary with a report by our Committee on Fisheries on the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Morocco."
"We believed that our committee should not be deprived of the opportunity to debate this sensitive agreement, and it therefore had to be debated and approved by us first."
"I believe that this time has been extremely useful: it has been useful for the rapporteur, who now has more information than he had before, and it has been useful in that it has given us a more in-depth awareness of what has been agreed and of what has not yet been agreed."
"We are in a position today, therefore, to ask the House to vote in favour of this Agreement, but with the reservations, the adjustments, the guarantees and improvements that we have introduced in the Committee on Fisheries and which are included in the report."
"I believe that this report has improved the Agreement and Parliament’s institutional position and we have fully and responsibly carried out the duties for which we were elected."
"Our real objective was, and remains, to improve the guarantees for the fisheries sector, which is the beneficiary of the Agreement, to ensure compliance with its clauses and to make it operative and viable."
"We did not understand before, and we still do not understand, why some people were opposed to this exercise in responsibility and transparency."
"In addition to the technical fisheries issues that I will comment on in a moment, the Agreement was politically sensitive because of the thorny issue of the Western Sahara, which we could not sidestep but which we could not get involved in either."
"I have tried to remain neutral on this issue, acknowledging the problem but not speaking for any of the parties, in order to ensure that Parliament does not show any particular support for any one of them, though at all times respecting international law and the on-going dispute, and not ignoring it, including the United Nations’ doctrine regarding non autonomous territories."
"The opinion of Parliament’s Legal Service has been extremely useful and has been incorporated into the report, as well as the amendments by Mrs Attwooll, whom I would like to thank for her sensitivity and understanding, and the only amendment approved by the Committee on Development relating to the Sahara."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Kindermann, coordinator of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, for the assistance he has given me and for his efforts to keep his group united – although he has not achieved this entirely, I am aware of the efforts he has made."
"I therefore believe, as rapporteur, that the report is balanced and reasonable, although compromises mean giving some ground and not everybody can be one hundred per cent satisfied."
"I would now like to make a few comments about the strictly fisheries-related aspects of the report."
"The European Parliament expresses its support for the Agreement but, as I have said, it reserves for itself the task of scrupulously monitoring its application, which is fully in accordance with our duties of control over the Commission, calling for an exhaustive annual report on its application and in particular demanding that we be kept informed of each and every modification introduced into the text; in particular, we ask to be made aware of any opinions the Commission issues with regard to the possible modification of the Agreement’s exclusivity clause."
"We want to be made aware of how fisheries resources develop, in particular those species excluded from the agreement and of high commercial value, such as cephalopods and crustaceans, since, with the current exclusion, the Galician fleet is marginalised."
"We also want to be informed of the measures adopted to allow the Andalusian fleet to fish with lamps, as it has been doing, and also to ensure that there is no discrimination in this fishing area or in the measures intended to ensure landing in local ports."
"We also want to be kept informed of the technical measures that have not yet been clarified in relation to longline fishing and of the agreements of the joint committee that relate to the way in which the European Union’s financial contribution will be invested."
"The final distribution of fishing opportunities must be communicated to Parliament, since adjustments are still being made to them at the moment."
"To this end, we have approved the amendments by Mrs Fraga, so that distributions respect relative stability and the sector and Parliament can observe the application of these vital issues."
"While it may appear irresponsible to prolong the parliamentary negotiation of this Agreement indefinitely, we believe that it would have been more irresponsible to approve it blindly and hence to approve it without these demands and guarantees."
"Our wish has been to reassure all of the parties involved that the Agreement will be applied rigorously and seriously and in accordance with international rules."
"That was our difficult commitment and will continue to be so in the future, in order to ensure that the European Parliament conscientiously monitors its application once it has entered into force, in accordance with the amendments approved by the Committee on Fisheries and if the House adopts the report tomorrow, as I hope it will."
"I would like to thank everybody for their understanding and cooperation."
". – Mr President, we are naturally pleased to have a new fisheries agreement with Morocco although, as the rapporteur has said, we do not yet know precisely what form it will take."
"We do know, however, that, after six years without an agreement, during which contacts have been constant, in the end, the two fleets that made fisheries relations with Morocco so very important have been left out: the cephalopod fleet and the crustacean fleet."
"That is one of the reasons why our feelings about the new agreement are bitter-sweet."
"Unfortunately there are other problems, however."
"We regret the pressure that has been put on us by the other institutions, even to violate the established procedures. This pressure has complicated the work of our Committee and the rapporteur very much, when our only intention is to ensure that this new agreement does not cause as many problems as the last one, and to obtain legal guarantees that the content sent to Parliament truly corresponds to what our fleet is going to face."
"We regret that doubts remain about this, since what the Commission considers to be technical negotiating errors of minor importance may mean, for example, that the seiner fleet cannot fish."
"Furthermore, the possibility of modifying the technical datasheets remains too open and we would therefore ask that all possible information be communicated and that Members of this Parliament be able to attend the joint committees as observers."
"Finally, we must thank the rapporteur for the balance he has achieved in relation to the political issues that have arisen."
"Like him, we believe that the Committee on Fisheries is not the place to resolve extremely important and complex international political problems."
"His report is scrupulous in terms of international law and, as has been said, it is in line with the legal reports of the Community institutions, and we would therefore ask once again for the new amendments presented to be rejected and instead we would ask all of the groups to support the report by the rapporteur."
"I would like finally to ask the Commissioner what stage the approval of this proposal by the Moroccan Parliament is at. According to what we have been told, that Parliament was going to meet on 15 April with this as one of its first subjects for debate."
"We would like to know whether it is in the process of being approved by the Moroccan Parliament."
". – Mr President, I believe that the EC/Morocco fisheries partnership agreement is of crucial importance in two respects: on the one hand, from a social and economic point of view, many fishermen have been waiting for six years, and are still waiting, with their vessels in harbour, to see a firm political will to treat the signature of a fisheries agreement with Morocco as a priority."
"On the other hand, this Agreement is also of great political importance because it contributes to the normalising of relations between the European Union and Morocco, a neighbouring country."
"It is not a merely economic agreement, since it is intended to provide for collaboration in terms of the sustainable management of resources and enhanced cooperation."
"The Agreement reflects a new partnership dynamic between the European Union and third countries in the field of fisheries."
"I would also like to stress that this is the best possible agreement."
"I would like to state clearly that I believe this to be a good agreement for the European fisheries sector, both in terms of the number of licences it will allow and in terms of industrial fishing capacity."
"To those people who are welcoming the Agreement, but are critical of it at the same time, I would like to point out above all that we must bear in mind that it will allow an activity which has been halted for too long to resume, with a number of licences and a fishing capacity that have not existed for the last six years."
"I believe that the Agreement is born of a will for permanence, and provides for the mechanisms necessary to resolve any dispute that may arise and the possibility of improving the figure when resources allow."
"This Agreement reached Parliament a few months ago, during a consultation procedure."
"The fishermen, the sector and with them the majority of the citizens hoped that the Agreement, which has required a lot of time, work and negotiation, would receive Parliament’s support and would enter into force, thereby allowing the fishermen to begin their activities as soon as possible."
"However much the rapporteur may insist, therefore, we still cannot see any justification for the delay, which we believe to be unnecessary."
"This unnecessary delay reached its peak with the refusal to deal with the report by means of the urgency procedure, which would have allowed it to enter into force this May."
"All of this delay and the resulting harm suffered by the fishermen have resulted in the presentation of a report the text of which I believe has not been changed in any significant way and whose delay has merely led to debates which have nothing to do with the fisheries sector."
"I believe that the time has come to look to the future."
"I am entirely happy with the Agreement and believe it to be positive that it has been reached."
"I would therefore ask this Parliament to support it, thereby sending the message to the fishermen and the sector that their Parliament unreservedly supports their immediate return to work and that it intends it to be lasting this time."
". Mr President, Commissioner, the ALDE Group has continuing difficulties with the whole range of third country fisheries agreements, although we acknowledge that the new partnership model is an improvement on what went before."
"The agreement with Morocco creates particular problems, given the situation of the people of Western Sahara."
"Whilst the prevailing legal advice is that the agreement is not, on the face of it, in contravention of international law, there is a clear risk of the breach of peremptory norms in its implementation."
"That is why, at committee stage, we proposed amendments intended to build safeguards into the regulation."
"These make approval of the agreement subject to its being operated in conformity with international law, insist on that operation being closely monitored and require a suspension if there is evidence of breach."
"As included in the report, these provisions afford protections that would otherwise be sadly lacking."
"We are grateful to the rapporteur for his sensitivity to the issues and for the compromise reached, as also for the support afforded to the whole set of amendments in committee."
"I know, however, that many colleagues would have preferred a different outcome."
"I would like to reassure those who are uneasy about the mention of Western Sahara in the recital that it only recognises the fact of occupation and does not in any way imply its legitimacy."
"I can understand, too, the motivation of those who would like to see the waters adjacent to Western Sahara excluded from the agreement altogether, but I have to point out that this would have the paradoxical effect of depriving its people of the right to any financial benefit from the agreement, whilst not actually giving them greater security with regard to natural resources."
"I conclude, though, by saying to the Commission and the Council that, however Members of this Parliament individually approach tomorrow’s vote, concern for the people of Western Sahara is felt across Parliament as a whole."
"Please take heed of that."
"Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna has done an extremely thorough job, but we heard President Morales of Bolivia speak earlier this evening of 500 years of colonial plundering."
"That period should be in the past."
"We come now, however, to this illegal fishing agreement, which is a piece of pure neo-colonialism."
"Western Sahara is occupied, yet no one acknowledges the hegemony exercised by Morocco."
"Only if the changes designed to exempt occupied areas from the agreement are approved can justice be done in practice to the European Parliament’s talk of human rights."
"Do read SHERPA’s legal analysis."
"They are experts on international agreements and they completely condemn the fisheries agreement."
"The institutions’ legal services have been used to misinterpret the UN Charter in the interests of exploitation, but Parliament’s legal service recognises that the agreement is only legal if it benefits the Saharawi people."
"In the previous agreements, Morocco showed not the slightest concern about the population."
"This agreement contains nothing about compensation for the Saharawi people or about targeted aid as compensation."
"Morocco has stolen Western Sahara, and anyone entering into fisheries agreements with Morocco becomes guilty of receiving stolen goods."
"It is just like calling on a thief to go into someone’s kitchen and steal fish from the table, something that no one in this Chamber would do."
"Anyone who puts out their hand and presses the ‘yes’ button in support of this agreement, without exempting Western Sahara’s waters from it, is behaving just like a dealer in stolen goods, putting out their hand to receive payment for them."
"– As regards the content of the fisheries agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morrocco relating to the waters under its effective sovereignty, I should like to highlight, in broad terms, the opinions expressed by representatives of the fisheries sector."
"They believe that the conditions of this new agreement will bring restrictions, greater burdens and fewer benefits for fishermen, and will accordingly be extremely harmful."
"Yet this agreement raises a more fundamental issue, namely respect for international law and the legitimate rights of the people of Western Sahara."
"Morocco is illegally occupying Western Sahara."
"According to United Nations resolutions, Morocco has no sovereignty over this territory nor, in turn, its natural resources."
"It also has no right to be the territory’s or administrative power, under the terms of the United Nations Charter."
"Morocco is very much the illegal occupying power in Western Sahara, that is to say, its illegal colonial power."
"Consequently, any agreement with Morocco that, ambiguously or otherwise, involves the exploitation of Western Sahara’s natural resources constitutes a clear violation of international law."
"The issue at stake, as the Polisario Front maintains, is whether the EU Member States will uphold international law and contribute towards a fair and lasting solution to the conflict involving respect for the Sahrawi people’s inalienable right to self-determination, or whether, by contrast, they will encourage injustice, aggression and the violation of human rights."
"The inclusion in the agreement of clauses that say, in watered down form, that the European Community’s financial contribution should also be used to develop coastal fishing communities in Morocco and Western Sahara, as borne out in previous agreements, falls short of what is required and does not safeguard the rights of the Sahrawi people."
"If the intention really were to ensure that the Sahrawi people could enjoy the benefits of exploiting their fishing resources, the necessary conditions would be put in place to safeguard their interests and rights, by setting up a United Nations fund, for example."
"We have therefore retabled two amendments, which, in line with international law, specifically exclude the waters off Western Sahara from the fisheries agreement before us, granting fishing possibilities only to Community fishermen in the waters falling within the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Morocco, or in other words solely in the waters north of the 27°40' parallel."
"Lastly, it is important to point out that although the Council and the Commission have, of their own volition, expressed serious concerns about this agreement, the Polisario Front, the legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people, has not been consulted at any time during this process, and that is something we find appalling."
"We have previously pointed out how dangerous the EU’s fisheries agreements are, both for the populations of the world’s poor countries and for EU taxpayers."
"The only winners are fishing companies from, in the main, the countries around the Mediterranean, where companies are heavily subsidised through the agreements."
"This time, however, it is much more serious because the EU intends entering into an agreement with a colonial power of the worst sort."
"By doing so, the EU would be indirectly recognising the brutal occupation of Western Sahara, which is illegal under international law."
"It is outrageous that old European colonial powers are even today continuing to conduct the same policy as before, and just as destructively, albeit in a more subtle form."
"These fisheries agreements are extremely objectionable."
"They prevent poor countries from developing their own fishing industries and are partly responsible for depleting the oceans of fish. They also cost EU taxpayers huge sums of money."
"I therefore call on you to vote against all the fishing agreements that will require decisions by Parliament, and especially against this one."
"Mr President, I welcome this agreement, which is reasonable on two grounds."
"Firstly, it is reasonable as far as the fishery resources in the Moroccan provinces of Western Sahara are concerned."
"It is not the opinion of Parliament’s legal service that counts, but that of the International Court of Justice."
"For centuries, Morocco has exercised a certain form of sovereignty over that territory."
"If Algeria wants an outlet into the Atlantic, that is its problem, but that is not a good enough reason to invent laws."
"It is also reasonable because it is good to retain the benefits derived from these agreements and to transfer them to the Saharan provinces of Morocco and to the people."
"I have just one reservation, however: it concerns the annual 60 000 tonnes of industrial fishing granted to the large seiners of Northern Europe, which have no historic precedence, especially not in comparison with the historic precedence of Morocco, which nonetheless authorised the presence in its waters of 244 vessels, which disappeared at the end of the agreement."
"Since the agreement with Angola has been denounced, we must take delight in the fact that we have concluded this reasonable and balanced agreement with Morocco."
"Let us not pick a quarrel with the Moroccans."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work he has done in terms of showing consideration for everyone's interests and of reaching the best possible compromise."
"In accordance with the international legal status of Western Sahara, no entity, not even the European Parliament, can intervene in this disagreement, under international law, and as has been confirmed to us by the European Parliament's legal service."
"That is why I am delighted to observe that the agreement has not been the subject of a political dispute, which means that the rights of the Moroccan and Saharawi people are safeguarded, together with those of the fishermen and the fishing industry in Europe."
"On the other hand, it is up to the European Union to ensure that everyone, including Western Sahara, gains from the benefits derived from the agreement."
"That is precisely the aim of the amendments tabled in plenary by the Committee on Fisheries."
"Compliance with international law during the implementation of the agreement is once again at the forefront."
"Financial aid will have to be used in order to facilitate the development of coastal populations that subsist on fishing, and this so as to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to be created in this sector, whether in Morocco or in Western Sahara."
"Finally, the Commission will have to present an annual report with the aim of assessing whether the agreement is being applied properly and, if it is not, then the Commission will be able to suspend it, as provided for."
"I am convinced that these amendments are the guarantee of a coherent and fair agreement."
"I hope that the European Parliament, for its part, adopts them by a large majority."
"Mr President, as Western Sahara is not a sovereign state, it is international law that applies to its population."
"Under international law, this population group has a right to self-determination via its recognised representatives."
"This means that if an agreement is to be entered into, the population of Western Sahara must be involved and their economic interest must be taken into consideration."
"The Legal Service of the European Parliament has determined that the agreement is not in contravention of international law as long as the Moroccan authorities provide the population of Western Sahara with economic compensation for the resources taken from their waters."
"However, nowhere in the agreement does it state that compensation is to be provided."
"In fact, not once are the people of Western Sahara mentioned, nor have they been involved in the process of entering into agreements."
"I do not believe that it is the job of the Committee on Fisheries to solve conflicts between Morocco and Western Sahara, but I do think it is important that international law is obeyed and that the population of Western Sahara does not end up as the loser in this agreement."
"I therefore also believe it to be important that we vote in favour of those amendments that exclude territory belonging to Western Sahara."
"If these amendments are adopted, I believe that we could end up with a positive agreement."
"If not, the agreement will be a bad one."
"There is a lot to be said about the EU’s fisheries policy."
"There is no doubt a lot of politics involved over and above the actual fisheries agreements."
"This agreement in particular has a very great deal of politics associated with it, and there are many uncertainties where Western Sahara is concerned."
"Morocco has been occupying Western Sahara since 1975, and the world community has still not succeeded in solving this issue."
"Morocco has refused to accept the UN’s plan for a referendum and has unfortunately failed to contribute to any form of dialogue or negotiation."
"I am extremely concerned that, by voting in favour of this report, we are giving Morocco opportunities to exploit fishing resources belonging specifically to Western Sahara and its people."
"The legal analyses are contradictory and, as many of these point out, the position under international law is unclear because the boundaries of Morocco’s territorial waters are being erased."
"It may lead to Morocco distributing fishing licences belonging to Western Sahara, something that would contravene both the UN Charter and international law."
"Morocco has done this before, and the money has not benefited the West Saharan people."
"I shall therefore support the amendments limiting the agreement to what is compatible with international law."
"I think it important for the EU not to recognise the policy of occupation."
"Rather, we should show that we want to see a solution to this conflict regarding what is Africa’s last colony."
"If the amendments do not go through, I and, I hope, many others intend to vote against this agreement."
"We cannot say that the agreement is just about fisheries and the conditions under which fishermen operate."
"It is, to the very highest degree, about politics, and that is something we must realise."
"We have a big responsibility to make our position clear, and that is something we can do by voting against this agreement."
"Mr President, I have become increasingly sceptical over the years I have been here about the value of fishing agreements in general: usually only a few of our Member States benefit, while all our taxpayers foot the bill."
"I am far from confident that the European Union can properly monitor fishing activity in these agreements or guarantee that our money ends up where it should."
"However, this agreement has an added dimension: the absolute right of a people to self-determination, the right, in this case, of the Saharawi people to control their own resources."
"We should not be signing up to any deal with Morocco that leaves any doubt whatsoever whether Western Saharan waters can be included by the Moroccan Government."
"If Amendments 14 to 18, restricting the agreement to Moroccan waters only, are approved – amendments which my group and I have signed – I would consider supporting this report, otherwise I would have to reject it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group cannot vote in favour of the agreement with Morocco because its entry into force would be as good as a violation of international law."
"The proposed definition of Moroccan territorial waters as including waters that actually belong to Western Sahara means trampling on the Sahrawi people's rights, which are clearly defined by the United Nations, particularly its right to self-determination, which is already included in the declaration."
"We are all aware that, for many years now, the Moroccan Government has done everything in its power to stop a referendum from being held on the independence of Western Sahara."
"Instead of putting pressure on Rabat to go down the road of a diplomatic solution, by signing the agreement under discussion today, the Union is in danger of sending out the wrong signal, by legitimising a form of occupation that has been denounced for years."
"A few part-sessions ago, we voted in favour of a resolution that called for the sovereignty of the Sahrawi people over the resources of that country to be upheld."
"I believe that we need to reaffirm this point, by doing what my group tried to do and denouncing those parts of the agreement in which Morocco absorbs Sahrawi territorial waters."
"Finally, I believe that this agreement demonstrates a need to include the democratic clause in all of the fishing agreements reached between the Union and third countries."
"In February, Parliament unanimously adopted my report on that subject."
"It is unacceptable that, as in that case, the Union and Morocco are doing business at the Sahrawi people's expense."
"Respect for international rights, and therefore for the sovereignty of Western Sahara, must be a prerequisite if EU-Morocco relations are to develop further."
"– Mr President, I believe that this is an important day, because the signature of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco and of a protocol for the next few years restores relations – fisheries relations – which have been suspended since the last one elapsed in 1999."
"I perfectly recall what a difficult time we had, Commissioner, when the last Agreement came to an end and how many fishermen, the majority of them Spanish – mostly from Galicia, the Canary Islands and Andalusia – we obliged to undergo a difficult restructuring."
"That was not a bitter-sweet time, Commissioner, but rather a thoroughly bitter time – a very bitter time."
"The beginning of a new phase of cooperation and dialogue between the Commission and the Kingdom of Morocco has contributed in no small way to the achievement of this Agreement, and I would like to congratulate you and all of your team most warmly. I would also like in particular to thank you for being here with us today."
"I also believe that it is worthy of note that, unlike five years ago, the Spanish Government has actively supported the Commission’s negotiating process, which has brought success."
"I would like to point out that this Agreement, which belongs to a new generation of agreements, will make a very positive contribution to promoting our southern neighbour’s fisheries sector."
"In this regard, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate you, because we are going to contribute to generating stable employment and we are going to help to combat illegal immigration."
"– Mr President, we believe that it is legitimate, and necessary – as has been said – to normalise fisheries relations between Morocco and the European Union, but that should not be done at the expense of legitimising Morocco’s illegal occupation of Western Sahara."
"The United Nations does not consider Morocco to be the administrator of the Sahara, and that country does not therefore have the right to negotiate over Saharawi waters. By accepting that those waters are included, the European Union is regrettably helping to perpetuate the pillaging that we have condemned so many times in this House."
"As laid down in the Convention on the Law of the Sea, the profits from the exploitation of a territory whose status has yet to be defined, according to the United Nations, must benefit the population of the territory in question."
"Nevertheless, the Moroccan authorities’ hostile and entirely uncooperative attitude to the Western Sahara dispute means that they are very unreliable in this respect."
"We therefore believe that the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco must explicitly exclude Saharawi waters, otherwise our group will be obliged to vote against the report and hence the Agreement."
"This fisheries agreement is a disgraceful agreement through which the EU is a party to crimes under international law."
"The agreement covers Western Sahara’s fishing waters, but Morocco is occupying and oppressing Western Sahara and has no right to the country’s natural resources."
"Western Sahara’s legitimate representative, the liberation movement Polisario, is firmly opposed to this agreement."
"The Geneva Convention bans an occupying power from exploiting occupied areas’ natural resources for its own gain, but that is precisely what this agreement involves."
"It means that the EU too would profit from, and legitimise, Morocco’s illegal occupation of Western Sahara and thus be an active party to crimes under international law."
"Commissioner, the agreement you have negotiated with Morocco is disgraceful."
"Mr President, fishery agreements should be used to promote sustainable fishing, but that is not always the case, unfortunately."
"In this agreement too, question marks can be placed by the 22 trawlers that are permitted."
"This agreement, however, is more restricted than its predecessor, which ran until 1999, and excludes a number of vulnerable fish species, mainly octopus and crustaceans."
"The focus is more on small-scale fishing, which is important."
"The agreement with Morocco will contribute towards a sustainable treatment of scarce fish stocks and will be based on the principle of maximum sustainable yield."
"This is all well and good, of course, but alas, Parliament can hardly put any of this to the test at a time when we are issuing our advice about the new agreement with Morocco, because we do not have access to the Commission’s assessment."
"I back the rapporteur’s amendments in which he asks for more information about fish stocks, as well as about the way in which the agreement benefits the parties involved."
"I would, at the same time, insist on Parliament gaining access to these assessments or impact assessments in good time, so that we are well-informed before we give our opinion."
"Then, there is, of course, the issue of the Western Sahara, in respect of which the report is incomplete."
"The agreement is not restricted to the Moroccan coastal waters, but also applies to waters belonging to the Western Sahara."
"Although a joint committee must ensure that the people of the Western Sahara will benefit from this agreement, it is very much in doubt whether the Saharan people actually stand to gain."
"This is, in any event, left ambiguous in the report."
"We should state in no uncertain terms that this agreement will only pertain to the Moroccan coastal waters."
"Amendments to that effect have been tabled, which I hope will receive your support."
"– Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission and the Commissioner for the work they have done, allowing us to reach this Agreement with Morocco."
"I would like to express my complete agreement with the Commissioner’s comments on the rejection of the unfounded amendments proposed, because the intention to subordinate this Agreement to political conditions of a different nature has no basis in international law."
"I would also like to express my gratitude to a section of the population who I represent and the region in which I live;"
"I am talking about the population of the Canary Islands, which also neighbours these waters, which has always fished in these waters and not, despite what some people have said, in a colonialist fashion."
"My great-grandfather signed an agreement with the population of the coast in order to fish there, on the basis of the principle of mutual interest."
"We had been fishing in those waters, we shall go back to fishing there, and I would like to thank the Commission for the effort it has made."
"I hope that this Parliament will approve this Agreement by a large majority, since it is very fair and very correct from the point of view of international law."
"– Commissioner, Mr Morillon, this has been a lively debate. It has also been an important one, because whilst the legitimate rights of the fishermen and of Morocco must be respected, this agreement must not be allowed to legitimise the occupation of Western Sahara, which is not recognised by international law."
"This is an absolutely fundamental issue, and as such I cannot give my agreement to a proposal that simply turns a blind eye to this problem, which is a problem of the highest importance to the international community, although I do understand those who have taken a different view in this debate."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna for his opening remarks."
"I fully understand the points raised regarding monitoring and I have no difficulty with keeping the Committee on Fisheries informed of how the agreement is actually implemented."
"I fully share the concern to keep Parliament informed of the various aspects of the implementation of the protocol."
"I would like to underline that the Commission already complies with the requirements on the transmission of information, in line with the current institutional arrangements."
"We have also continued discussions with the chairman and members of the Committee on Fisheries in order to try to improve the existing exchange of information and dialogue, in particular with regard to the conclusion and the ex-post follow-up to the conclusion of fisheries agreements."
"Concerning the points raised by Mrs Fraga Estévez, in particular with regard to cephalopods and crustaceans, I would like to underline that Article 4 of the protocol provides for reviewing the fishing possibilities under the agreement if the scientific reports indicate an improvement of the situation of certain stocks."
"On the basis of the conclusions of the annual Scientific Committee meetings, the two parties can agree jointly to modify the existing fishing possibilities as long as sustainable management of the resource is ensured."
"The fishing possibilities established in the agreement reflect the total amount of available species, as recommended by the scientific report, and the capacities of the Moroccan national fleet."
"The Commission does not intend to re-open discussion on this issue except within the parameters of Article 4."
"Also, with regard to the point raised concerning modalities, the modalities referred to are certainly important but let me emphasise that these are technical questions that by their nature are not defined in the agreement."
"Technical modalities such as the use of lamparo, the number of hooks for long-liners and the issue of landings for industrial pelagic fishery will be fine-tuned during the first Joint Committee meeting that will be convened after the entry into force of the agreement, and we certainly have no problem with keeping Parliament and the sector fully informed."
"Information could be given on technical modifications during our regular closed session meetings."
"The next one is foreseen for 21 June and if by then we have already had contact with the Moroccans, we will certainly report back to the Committee on Fisheries on the outcome of those contacts."
"I was asked by Mrs Fraga Estévez how far Morocco has proceeded with regard to concluding the process of adoption of the agreement."
"Our information is that everything is moving smoothly."
"We do not know of any particular difficulties on the Moroccan side."
"It should therefore be adopted by the Moroccan Parliament immediately after we have adopted it some time in June."
"I would like to thank all those who have expressed support for the agreement reached."
"Regarding the point raised by Mrs Corbey concerning the ex-ante evaluation, let me say that it was sent in September to the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries and distributed to all members of the Committee on Fisheries."
"As regards the points raised by Mrs Attwooll and a number of others, I repeat that concerning Western Sahara the wording used in the agreement was formulated very carefully."
"I repeat that it neither defines nor prejudges the legal status of the waters concerned."
"Again, with regard to what Mr Schlyter, Mr Hudghton, Mr Guerreiro and others said on the question as to whether Morocco can conclude agreements that concern the exploitation of the natural resources of Western Sahara, the United Nations legal adviser gives a clear answer."
"Although the United Nations has never recognised Morocco as an administrative power in accordance with Article 73 of the Charter of the United Nations, and Morocco is not listed as an administering power of the territory in the United Nations’ list of non-self-governing territories – this is point 7 of the Opinion of the United Nations legal adviser – agreements can be concluded with the Kingdom of Morocco concerning the exploitation of natural resources of Western Sahara."
"The interpretation given by the UN legal adviser recognises the competence of Morocco to conclude these types of agreements and in this way implies that Morocco is a de facto administrative power of the territory of Western Sahara; the mandate given to the Commission by the Council was to negotiate with the Kingdom of Morocco."
"In the framework of these agreements, international law seeks to assure the right of peoples and nations to use and dispose of the natural resources in their territories."
"In that respect, the agreements are considered compatible with the Charter obligation of the administering power and in conformity with the General Assembly resolution and the principle of permanent sovereignty of natural resources enshrined therein, if the exploitation of the resources in non-self-governing territories is considered for the benefit of the peoples of those territories, on their behalf or in consultation with their representatives."
"In that respect, Morocco is under an obligation to take all appropriate measures to ensure the full application of the EC-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement in accordance with the obligations of international law."
"May I say in response to Mrs Sudre’s and Mr Kristensen’s concerns that the agreement itself already guarantees certain benefits for the local population."
"In particular with regard to industrial pelagic fishery, which is focused on stock C, the agreement foresees the obligation to land 25% of captures."
"The main purpose of this provision is to contribute to the better supply of pelagic fish to the transformation industry that has in recent years suffered from irregular and short supplies of raw material."
"Additional economic incentives are therefore foreseen to encourage pelagic vessels to land a bigger part of their catches, more than the obligatory 25%, in the local ports in the south."
"In addition to the above-mentioned landing obligation, the agreement also makes stipulations regarding services and infrastructure activities in the local ports in the south."
"That provides for additional earnings and contributes to development of these ports."
"The agreement also ensures additional support for the development of the coastal area through the following financial measures."
"The agreement sets an amount of at least EUR 4.75 million per year for the modernisation and upgrading of the coastal fleet."
"The agreement also specifies that part of the financial contribution should be used, among others, for the restructuring of small-scale fishing, training and support of professional organisations."
"The industrial pelagic fishery is under the obligation to land 25% of all catches in the local ports."
"This obligation has been inserted into the agreement in order to support the development of the local fishing industry, which suffers from an irregular or insufficient supply of raw material."
"I thank the Commissioner, all the speakers and the chairman of the committee for their presence throughout these debates."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30."
"Mr President, yesterday evening you announced to Parliament that the Council was not going to be present after 7 p.m. tomorrow evening."
"According to our agenda, after 9 p.m. tomorrow evening we are due to debate whether to grant a cent to the Energy Community Treaty and put an oral question to the Council with regard to this Treaty."
"If the Council is unable, or unwilling, to be present to answer this oral question, I see little point in considering either the Treaty or the oral question."
"I ask you, therefore, to gain an assurance from the Council that it will be present."
"Otherwise I will move that we defer this item until the next part-session of Parliament."
"We will try to ensure that the Council is here."
"We will do everything we can between now and then."
"You are right that there is not much point in dealing with this item on the agenda as planned if the Council is not present."
"We will make a last effort, and if that does not work, we will discuss how to proceed, but we must not lose hope, which is the last thing that should be lost."
"The first item on the agenda is the Commission’s statement on the Commission’s contributions to the June 2006 European Council: a plan for citizens, producing results for Europe, the discussion period and ‘Plan D’."
"Mr President, honourable Members, the first message I would like to deliver today is that the Commission is listening to citizens."
"We want to base our actions on and deliver on their expectations and concerns."
"Listening is at the very heart of Plan D. The Commission has implemented a series of activities to stimulate the debate in all Member States and has given support to those countries which requested it."
"We can draw some important lessons from the national debates, which are fully supported by the Eurobarometer surveys."
"Firstly, citizens are concerned about the high rate of unemployment and the negative effects of globalisation."
"This is no surprise to most of us."
"Social protection is at the very core of the debates and the request for comparable living standards is high almost everywhere."
"Enlargement is the second predominant issue."
"More and more citizens question, if not the principle itself, the scope and pace of future accessions."
"We need to show that enlargement does not happen by default and why it is necessary."
"The third lesson we can draw is that Europeans want more not less Europe."
"But they want to see results and to be more involved in the policy process."
"They perceive the Union as an entity that can protect them."
"They are asking for more security, as well a higher level of environmental protection, food safety and a more stable energy supply."
"The Commission intends to respond to these concerns."
"That is why we have adopted a citizens’ agenda for Europe."
"We are not suggesting a completely new strategy."
"Our work remains rooted in the three building stones of prosperity, solidarity and security, with a continued emphasis on jobs and growth, in line with the Lisbon Strategy."
"We are, however, focusing to a greater extent on citizens."
"What do we propose?"
"Deeper economic integration should go hand in hand with solidarity."
"Europe is not just a marketplace; it also has a social dimension."
"Next year, we will therefore launch an agenda for access and solidarity."
"We have also discussed the idea of an ‘entitlement card’, to facilitate citizens’ full access to their rights and to make these rights more visible."
"We will also continue to implement the sustainable development agenda."
"In addition, we will launch a comprehensive review of the single market, to be completed next year."
"The single market has brought huge benefits for citizens, but it is still unfinished business in the areas of energy, banking charges and roaming fees, for instance."
"We need to remove the remaining barriers."
"European Citizens rightly expect Europe to be a fair and safe place to live in."
"But Europe is not always capable of combating terrorism and organised crime."
"The existing decision-making tools create undue delays and, even more regrettably, do not ensure proper democratic scrutiny."
"The Commission proposes improving the decision-making process in these areas."
"We can do that by using the provisions of the current treaties."
"Before addressing the institutional questions, I would like to mention two more areas where further action is proposed."
"While honouring our commitments on enlargement, we must not lose broad public support for this important part of the EU project."
"The Commission will take forward the debate on enlargement and its added value, and this will be part of the Commission’s enlargement strategy report, to be submitted in the autumn."
"Last but not least, the Commission is willing to improve the coherence and efficiency of the European Union’s action in the international arena."
"We will present concrete proposals next week."
"In all of our actions, our commitment to subsidiarity, openness and transparency, as well as our efforts towards better regulation, will be vigorously pursued."
"We will seek to involve national parliaments more in the process of policy formulation."
"However, the Commission’s main interlocutor remains the European Parliament."
"Let me now turn to the institutional issues."
"Five countries that had not ratified the Constitution before the start of the period of reflection have now done so."
"Furthermore, Estonia’s Parliament voted in favour of the Constitution on 9 May, which brings the number of countries to have ratified to 15."
"We are pleased that Finland, which will hold the incoming Presidency, is also planning to ratify the Constitution."
"We welcome the new ratifications."
"They show that Member States are attached to the principles and values of the Constitution."
"We have to listen to the views and the positions of the countries which said ‘no’, but it is equally important to listen to the voices of those who say ‘yes’."
"I hope that there is no misunderstanding among us on the following point."
"The Commission continues to endorse the principles and improvements the Constitution would bring."
"The Constitution would definitely make the Union more effective, more open and more democratic."
"This is natural for a Constitution where parliamentarians were the majority voice."
"Of course we would like to see the Constitutional Treaty ratified in all 25 Member States."
"We stand with Parliament on this."
"Many options have been floated on how to overcome the current deadlock."
"Many ideas are being discussed."
"Yet no consensus exists on the way forward."
"Is the time ripe for a solution to be presented?"
"To use wording that is familiar to us, is it now time to work on the text or still time to work on the context?"
"We need to rebuild a climate of confidence and trust."
"We need to reconnect with citizens and prove, with firm results, that the Union can address citizens’ needs and aspirations."
"Let me be clear: delivering results for citizens through key policies is not an alternative to tackling the institutional issues."
"We propose that, next year, the three institutions should jointly adopt a declaration."
"This should serve as a basis for European Council decisions on a process leading to a future comprehensive institutional settlement."
"I see the declaration as firm proof of Member States’, Parliament’s and the Commission’s firm will to solve the constitutional deadlock."
"I expect the European Parliament to play an important role here."
"Like you, I hope that together we can achieve a constitutional settlement by the 2009 European elections."
"The listening exercise proved to be successful and should continue. Plan D was not a one-off operation."
"I have promised the Commission that after the June Summit I will address what our next steps should be – if you wish, the second phase of Plan D."
"Our citizens’ agenda will demonstrate the added value of the Union and thus help to restore citizens’ confidence."
"It is by reconnecting with citizens that we can create the conditions for a future comprehensive institutional settlement."
"Looking forward to the debate with you today, I would like to thank the political group chairmen for their contribution to the Commission’s policy formulation."
". Mr President, Mrs Wallström, Vice-President of the Commission, my group supported the Commission’s Plan D because it believed, and still believes, that it is a good way of responding to the challenges facing Europe at the moment."
"We therefore encourage you to keep going."
"You said that we were going to move on to the second phase of Plan D; the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is going to make a proposal to you: we are no longer calling it a discussion, because a discussion that lasts for too long can give the impression that we are having a rest and not doing much more; let us call it an analysis, because I think that what follows an analysis is a proposal, which is what you are referring to with the joint declaration by the three institutions."
"I think that this joint declaration by the three institutions is a good idea, Mrs Wallström, firstly because it marks the symbolic anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, which were the starting point for the Community, but also because it means that the Council, the Commission and Parliament want to put forward proposals together for a way out of the situation of the Constitutional Treaty."
"You can therefore count on the European Parliament for this institutional declaration, but this means that we want to take part in drawing it up, not just sign it at the end."
"I think that the fact that the process of ratifying the Constitution continued in Estonia and that the Finnish Parliament decided to ratify it is good news, which proves that all those who are prophesying that the Constitution is dead are wrong."
"No one ratifies something that is dead."
"I think that the task that we have at the moment – and when I say task, I know that what I am asking is not simple – is to convince European citizens of what we could call ‘the cost of non Constitution’."
"Remember many years ago, when the Single European Act was being debated, there was a report called ‘The cost of non Europe’, in other words, what it would cost people if the Single European Act did not come into force and the internal common market was not created."
"I believe that what we need to do in this debate on the Constitutional Treaty is something similar: to explain to people, with examples, what would be lacking in their lives if there were no European Constitution."
"I am certain that this is a good task for the second phase of analysis, because it could produce proposals that will ultimately help to achieve what all of us, the Commission, the Council and Parliament, want: for Europe to add value for people, for Europe to defend our common values and for Europe, ultimately, to make people’s lives more effective, fairer, freer and better supported."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks, Commissioner Wallström."
"You are one of the really prominent people in the Commission who are speaking up not only for Plan D but also for the democratisation of Europe as a whole and for greater effectiveness in the Commission's activities."
"You are – and I say this on behalf of our group – one of the personalities who can be described as an asset for progress in Europe."
"Your speech once again made it clear that you, as the Vice-President of the Commission responsible for Plan D, are someone in whom we can trust and on whom we can rely."
"What recognisable results have so far come out of this period of reflection, which, as Mr Méndez de Vigo said, is continually threatening to degenerate into a siesta?"
"What the citizens of Europe want is more transparency."
"They want a better understanding of what happens in the institutions."
"They want a clearer division of competences: who does what, where, when and on what legal basis?"
"They want greater effectiveness in legislation and administration."
"They want the subsidiarity principle to be strengthened."
"Not everything has to be done in Brussels – some things can be done at home."
"Not everything, though, can be solved at home, and those things should be regulated by Brussels."
"That is a clear message."
"The people therefore also want the EU to have a stronger presence in international politics."
"They want the EU to be effective in fighting crime."
"We know all of that, and it is up to us, the Council and the Commission to achieve it."
"It is all in the Constitution, though."
"We all know that we need the Constitution if we are to meet these demands from the public."
"At the end of the period of reflection, it is now clearer than ever that it is not possible to meet the demands of the public on the basis of the Treaty of Nice."
"It was not possible with 15 Member States – which is why Nice needed to be amended and replaced by the Constitution – and we will soon have 27 Member States and still do not have the Constitution."
"How can it be possible now?"
"The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties."
"Without a shadow of a doubt, nobody should be fighting harder for the Constitution than the President of the Commission."
"I should therefore like to thank you, Mrs Wallström, but I would also say one thing quite clearly to the President of the Commission: How can you go into an interparliamentary conference like the one last week, where the overwhelming majority of the national and European parliamentarians present spoke out in favour of the Constitution and the next President-in-Office of the Council Mr Vanhanen declared that, during his Presidency, Finland would symbolically ratify the Constitution, and then, as President of the Commission, raise doubts – and these doubts do exist – as to whether you yourself are prepared to say to the Heads of State or Government: if you do not join with me in implementing the Constitution, the expanded Europe will grind to a halt?"
"I will give you an example: 25 ministers of labour, and representatives of the Commission and the European Parliament, were present at the last informal Council meeting in Luxembourg, at which the Services Directive was discussed."
"After the initial two and a half hour long debate, each minister could speak for three minutes."
"That is a long time in comparison with the European Parliament, but was out of all proportion to the matter on the agenda."
"Europe cannot make any sensible policies in an elephantine body like the Ecofin: it is quite the opposite of good management, clear legislation and efficiency."
"We are reaching the limits of the current structures."
"If we want to make Europe more democratic, more transparent, more efficient – if we want to deliver to the people – we need to act, not talk."
"That is why we need the Constitution."
"As long as the Bureau of the Commission, and in particular the President, is sending messages that raise doubts about whether that institution is really determined to implement the Constitution, the opponents of the Constitution could well believe that we have given up."
"No, those who support the Constitution are behind you, Mrs Wallström, and they are in the majority."
"There are those in this Parliament who oppose the Constitution."
"Those people now raising their voices are in a minority."
"The overwhelming majority of this House are in favour of the Constitution."
"The overwhelming majority of the Member States are in favour of the Constitution."
"The overwhelming majority of the Commission are in favour of the Constitution."
"We therefore all have opportunities, so let us fight together, and that goes for Mr Barroso too."
". Mr President, Europe is undergoing a serious crisis, probably the most serious in its history."
"We see it every day – Europe is not moving forward, or even standing still, but going backwards, and at the same time national egos are growing and the feeling of sharing a common destiny is in retreat."
"Ahead of the next European Council, you have put forward a number of proposals in an attempt to respond to this crisis."
"Our group has taken note of a few timid steps forward among those proposals."
"For example, you are going to send all of your legislative proposals directly to the national parliaments at the same time as you send them to the European Parliament; that is good, but it does not change anything."
"You are going to propose to the Member States a reform of the decision-making process in the field of judicial and police cooperation."
"That is better, but did it really need to take a year to come up with it?"
"Do you really think that these proposals are going to recreate a climate of trust between the citizens and Europe?"
"Your revival plan, be it in the field of policy or of the institutions, is not up to the challenges with which we are faced."
"You seem to be happy with taking very small steps, but what we need is a giant leap forward."
"First of all, your Europe of results is singularly lacking in ambition when it comes to policy."
"I should have liked to have heard you advocating new common policies, which are vital in order to prepare better for the future."
"This is particularly true when it comes to research, where we are losing ground all the time, to the United States and Japan today, and to China and India tomorrow."
"It is also true with regard to energy: it is clear that the issue of energy and energy supplies will be one of the major challenges of this century."
"The issue of immigration is also relevant."
"We need a common policy in this field, because it is clear that issues of migration and co-development need to be dealt with at European level."
"Moreover, we should have like to have heard some proposals on the issue of economic governance."
"If we want to generate growth, and therefore employment, we obviously need to strengthen our economic, budgetary and industrial coordination, at least within the Eurozone."
"This really is a matter of urgency."
"The lack of proposals from you regarding the institutions is, in my opinion, even more serious."
"With regard to the basic issue of the future of our institutions, and therefore of our democracy, you contented yourself with commenting that there is currently no consensus between the Member States."
"Mrs Wallström, the Commission's role is not just to make observations, but to present proposals."
"It was incumbent on the Commission to define a path, and to defend and carry a vision, and you have failed in that."
"We must stop lying to ourselves."
"Even though the ratification process is continuing symbolically, we all know that this Constitution will never see the light of day."
"We need to rewrite the Constitution, to produce a new text that is shorter, simpler, more readable and more tightly focused on the major principles on which the European Union is founded."
"This text should say who we are, what we want and what values we espouse and defend."
"If we want to be in a position to ratify a political project of that nature in 2009, when European elections will be held in all the Member States, we must start preparing for it right now."
"Those, Commissioner, are the regrets of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"Last week, Mr Barroso quite rightly called on the Heads of State or Government to take responsibility for the European project before their citizens."
"Today, we call on the Commission to revive the inspiration without which nothing much can ever be achieved."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, in Ancient Rome, when a high-ranking man was condemned, he had the right to have someone else punished on his behalf."
"It rather looks as if you are in that position today, and you do not deserve it."
"However, the President of the Commission should hear the verdict of this House on his role in the constitutional process, and I hope you will ensure that he does so."
"He has played a quite disastrous role: cowardly, unimaginative, contradictory and deeply counterproductive."
"Perhaps he applied for a job as the grave-digger for the European Constitution; he certainly has every chance of getting it."
"I know that the President of the Commission is a master of misunderstanding: we have certainly always misunderstood him."
"One can hardly quote him without him claiming the exact opposite in the same speech, and whenever one tries to pin him down he claims to have meant something quite different."
"Interestingly, however, the whole of Europe has understood the same message from this master of misunderstanding: no chance."
"Nothing will happen for years."
"Nice?"
"Oh, it was not as bad as all that!"
"As he said, the world will keep on turning without the Constitution."
"And the worst thing is that the citizens still expect results, not rhetoric."
"That is yet another misunderstanding, of course, but the citizens have understood perfectly well."
"Since the start of his time in office, the President of the Commission has not made the slightest effort to find a solution to this constitutional conflict."
"At no point has he acted as an advocate for the European Constitution."
"For him, it is a glass bead game for political elites, institutional European navel-gazing – a phrase from Mr Blair, variations of which he continually drops in."
"Commissioner, we will not make any progress this way."
"Parliament has adopted a decision."
"Right from the start there was a lack of support from the Commission, and there have been some significant misunderstandings."
"Nice may well allow some steps towards integration, Commissioner: we know that there are 'bridges'."
"There are possibilities for silent, almost discreet integration, but is that really what you want?"
"Without a Charter of Fundamental Rights?"
"Without the comprehensive democratisation of the EU?"
"With no capacity to take action?"
"Without the 'pedal to the metal' of unanimity in many areas?"
"Do you really want it without social rights?"
"Do you want it without a constitution to create the political environment in which the interests of the people of Europe can be better taken into account?"
"Greater legitimacy, introducing more representation into decisions, more transparency and openness to the citizens, greater accountability to the citizens, more checks and balances, more parliamentary and judicial controls: that is what the constitution contains!"
"It is not just formulas or pure rhetoric, as the President of the Commission keeps trying to suggest in this debate."
"You say he is listening to the people."
"I was very surprised by the Eurobarometer surveys following the referendums in France and the Netherlands, which clearly showed that more than two thirds of those who had voted 'no' were in favour of improving the constitution, and that they wanted those improvements to aim for a social Europe."
"In other words, this conflict is about a European democracy and the social dimension of Europe as a response to globalisation."
"And what is Mr Barroso doing?"
"He is listening to the people and hearing something completely different."
"He is increasingly becoming the advocate of a Europe of governments."
"The crux and the cause of the crisis is the Europe of governments."
"Did he not understand that the people were protesting against the democratic deficit, against the lack of transparency?"
"Did he not listen?"
"They did not mention terrorism."
"Yes, the Austrian Presidency is talking about subsidiarity and bureaucracy and the Court of Justice, but the citizens are not."
"While the governments are clinging on to their claims to power, the citizens want a European democracy, they want a social dimension, they want their basic rights, and they want a better constitution."
"It is the President of the Commission’s historical responsibility to initiate and support this improvement process, and he would be well advised to assume it."
"Mr President, Commissioner Wallström, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission and a significant proportion of this Parliament have really distanced themselves from the citizens of Europe."
"The people do not just want to understand better what is going on in the institutions – they want greater participation."
"They want to be asked what they want, they want to make decisions, they want to be involved in the discussions on the future of Europe, and they want that to be taken into account."
"I therefore have a rather different conception of the term 'listening' of which Mr Barroso is so fond."
"Precisely in this respect we need to make changes, so that we can ultimately have a real discussion on the future of the European Union."
"On his scores of trips, the President should not have just preached, but actually listened."
"All of those involved could have heard, from many people, quite specific conceptions of what the European Union should look like in the future."
"A few days after the European Social Forum in Athens, the European Commission held a press conference to present their initiative for a Citizens' Agenda."
"However, if you expected any reference to the discussions during the European Social Forum, in which 35 000 people participated, you would have been disappointed."
"The members of my group take this forum seriously, though, and both before and during the forum they were involved in the discussions regarding a European appeal – Europe gives the citizens their say – and regarding the Charter of Principles for a Different Europe."
"This refutes all those insinuations that the Left within the European Union is not prepared to join in discussions on the future of the EU or on the Constitution."
"I share the ideas used as starting points in both papers."
"We need to have a truly democratic debate on the future of Europe and the path we are going to take, and this debate must be based on the assumption that the dignity of every person must be sacrosanct and must be respected and protected."
"In my opinion, it is therefore quite grotesque for the President of the European Commission to state, as he did on 10 May 2006, that we must deliver results for Europe through a citizens' agenda."
"Today we adopted our proposal for a citizens' agenda; the communication proposes 11 initiatives relating primarily to the internal market."
"President Barroso is remaining particularly loyal to that topic."
"He is sticking by his basic conviction that the objective of the European Union must be to remain competitive as a whole in the global market."
"However, that will never result in a true social Europe of solidarity with social cohesion at the forefront, and that is what the citizens of Europe are so critical about."
"That is the path they do not want to be taken down."
"They want different priorities to be set, and I think it is time for this to be taken into account."
"That is what we need to discuss within the European Union, in the context of the constitutional process and the discussion on Plan D."
". Mr President, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!"
"What a sad, inward-looking, almost ostrich-like speech that was from Commissioner Wallström."
"I can only conclude that Plan D stands for ‘delusional’."
"You really ought to get out more, because it seems to me that you are surrounded by Commissioners, officials, sycophants and parliamentarians here, who clearly do not represent the view of at least half the citizens of Europe."
"Mr Barroso himself is no better, because when he is not working in the Commission he is off on luxury yachts, holidaying with the super-rich."
"I think perhaps I have a remedy for you."
"I should like to invite you, Commissioner Wallström, to come to my local pub one Sunday lunchtime and meet some real people."
"I can do even better than that: I could invite you to the Oval to watch a test match."
"Come and watch some cricket and, again, meet some real people!"
"If you do not have time for any of that, you could read your own Eurobarometer poll, which shows that less than half the citizens of Europe now think that the European Union is doing a good job."
"You are ignoring all these things; in fact, you are developing a bunker mentality, and perhaps that is a good thing, because at least it shows that the end is in sight!"
"An organisation with any sense of honour would have respected the French and Dutch referendum results and there would have been a complete halt to further integration."
"Instead, you have all conspired against the French and Dutch people; you have conspired against your own rules, when you said here that it would have to be unanimous, and you are pressing on with this crazy project."
"The gap between the political classes and the real peoples of Europe is getting wider by the day."
"Shame on all of you!"
"Mr President, I think that Commissioner Wallström prefers hockey to cricket, and I am bound to agree with her in this respect."
"If I am to be honest, Plan D seems to have more to do with a democratic deficit than with democracy, and more to do with a lack of dialogue than with dialogue."
"There is superficial discussion rather than real debate."
"The European Commission, which emphasises that Plan D is not an operation to save the European Constitution, reminds me of the Soviet agency TASS, which always denied that disasters occurred in the Soviet Union or that poverty existed."
"What you are doing, in fact, is comparing apparent actions so as to ride out the storm for a while and hold out until the Constitution is accepted, almost certainly in an unadulterated form, in just a few years."
"If the Commission really and truly wanted to introduce a real Plan D, its first decision would be to call for constitutional referenda in the countries where the European Constitution was adopted by parliamentary decree, frequently by acclamation."
"Only four out of a dozen or so countries have so far held referenda."
"Two of these countries ratified the Constitution, whereas two rejected it."
"This reflects the real debate taking place in society and the lack of a real debate within the structures of the European Union."
"Let the European Commission finally stop resembling a Chinese opera chorus, which sings ‘Let us flee, let us flee’ for three whole acts, but does not budge an inch."
"Commissioner Wallström has the opportunity to play a more significant role than that of the conductor of this chorus."
"Mr President, the paper ‘Citizens’ agenda: delivering results for Europe’ is to be welcomed in the emphasis placed on policy delivery rather than on institutional grand designs."
"Even if I do not agree with all the proposed solutions, in particular I welcome the commitment to a comprehensive review of the single market."
"I hope that this review will be heavily accentuated towards the opening of markets, liberalisation and tearing down economic barriers that still exist in Europe."
"I know that the President of the Commission is personally committed – as I am – to economic reform and liberalisation as the only way of ensuring growth and greater prosperity."
"I do not, however, welcome the proposed agenda in the field of justice and home affairs."
"It is true that people in Europe want to see greater cooperation between Member States to combat and defeat the threats we all face in the modern world – particularly terrorism – but I want to see more intergovernmental coordination in tackling crime and terrorism, rather than trying to make such issues the subject of qualified majority voting."
"They are matters that go to the very heart of the nation state and its responsibilities to its citizens in each case."
"The national veto should remain in those areas."
"The British Government is currently playing with fire in its ambivalence on the subject."
"Instead, I urge the Commission to concentrate on delivering the economic reform agenda."
"People in Europe want action; they want action on growth and they want action on jobs."
"There is no appetite for endless debate on Constitutional, institutional structures."
"They do not want grand projects that erode the sovereignty of their nations or affect their chances of getting a job."
"So my message to the leaders for the June summit has to be simple: they should focus on people’s priorities, particularly the plight of the 18 million who have no job in the Union."
"There is nothing for them in the current European Constitution."
"Europe needs to demonstrate clearly and unambiguously that it has learned some lessons from the votes on that."
"It needs to show that it is ready to move on to an ambitious reform programme that tackles those very issues that I referred to of low growth, high unemployment and threats to our environment."
"The social model needs to be reformed drastically."
"How can one speak of a social model that consigns so many to the misery of joblessness?"
"My opposition to the Constitution currently is not based on dogma, but it is known – as far as I am aware – that it would not be good for the people of Europe."
"I believe that is what the people of Europe have said, particularly in France and the Netherlands."
"The time has now come for the governments of Europe to wake up."
"We need reform."
"We need to be accountable, more transparent, and we need to reform priorities."
"We need to respond to the wishes and needs of the citizens, which was what we were charged to do at Laeken and where we have, unfortunately, currently failed the test."
"As we move forwards to an EU of 27, let us celebrate the diversity of the modern European Union; let us harness that diversity to work together for a true Europe of nation states."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I fully support what you said today, and I know how committed you are to Plan D. However, what you said today about the Constitution is not in the papers."
"I am talking in particular about the citizens' agenda."
"I therefore share the criticisms made by Mr Schulz and many others that, reading these papers, one gets the impression that the Commission has given up on fighting for the Constitution."
"I think that is a great shame, because you have severely disappointed not only many citizens who have also fought for the Constitution – for example in the referendums."
"That really is worthy of criticism."
"There are two major deficits to which you barely refer in this paper."
"The first is the institutional deficit: this could be dealt with through the Constitution, and I agree with Mr Méndez de Vigo that the costs of not having the Constitution have not been stated."
"The second deficit relates to the lack of financial resources."
"That, too, has barely been mentioned."
"I now come to my main problem."
"I agree with you, Mrs Wallström, that it is absolutely vital not just to wait and to fight for the Constitution and for better funding, but also to take action now."
"I am referring in particular to the problem of unemployment."
"You have said some very pretty things here, with which I can agree, but where are the concrete proposals in addition to what we have discussed in the past with respect to Lisbon and so on?"
"Where are the concrete proposals regarding, for example, coordination in economic policy, which is absolutely vital, especially in the euro area but also outside it, in order to create better economic conditions?"
"The President of the Commission has agreed to make an effort to ensure that public investment in infrastructure is better coordinated, because we do not have enough money to fund everything from Europe and much will have to be funded at national level."
"None of this is in the papers, though."
"If I may turn to energy policy, we have discussed the fact that, independent of the Constitution – which also gave Europe more competences in energy policy – we need to take some significant steps, particularly with regard to infrastructure."
"None of this is set out specifically in the papers on the table."
"It is a similar case for foreign and security policy, in which it can be said, on the one hand, that we need to go as far as we can without Constitution, but also that it is very important to have a Constitution so that we can go still further."
"You call for a European response to globalisation, but in this respect too there are far too few indications of what this European response could look like, in order to develop a European social model whilst at the same time pushing forward with modernisation and keeping up with the competition."
"That, too, is a citizens' agenda, and it is precisely what many of the citizens expect from us."
"Therefore, I would ask you once again to clarify the Commission's attitude towards the Constitution."
"We must not just stand still; I am absolutely in favour of taking appropriate steps in parallel with that."
"However, do not neglect the institutional conditions, because you will disappoint the citizens if you do not clearly say to them that a Constitution is also necessary so that their interests can be implemented globally."
"The period of reflection is coming to an end, but it does not feel as if very much thinking has been done around Europe."
"The lively debate that was to be launched in all the Member States and that all the prime ministers promised at their summit on 18 June of last year has mainly been conspicuous by its absence."
"The Presidency clearly does not think it worth taking part in this debate, either."
"This is not because people do not want to talk about Europe."
"You know, as I do and as do all of us, that people want to debate Europe."
"In schools, at workplaces and in debates, people everywhere are committed to discussing the issue and have views and ideas about what our European cooperation should consist in, about how it can be changed and improved and about what it should not include."
"What is missing is leadership."
"European leaders are too absorbed in their internal problems to be able to raise their sights to European level."
"Now it is time, however, to pull ourselves together and show the required leadership."
"If the prime ministers and foreign ministers do not wish to show leadership, then we ourselves must do so."
"A certain amount needs, of course, to be done in the institutional sphere."
"A number of your proposals are extremely constructive."
"I believe that, if more transparency is introduced in the Council and greater scrutiny exercised and if the way in which subsidiarity is applied begins to be monitored – all things that can happen without a change to the Treaty – then that would be a step forward."
"We have high expectations of the Finnish Presidency."
"On this issue, the light appears to come from the east."
"We do, of course, need a Constitution in the sense of a set of regulations providing legitimacy."
"I too believe that, in the end, there will be a revised Constitution different from that which we have at present, but it should ideally be founded on the same basic ideas."
"We need to be proactive and committed in foreign policy and the fight against crime and to stand up for enlargement."
"I hope that we can produce practical proposals within the very near future."
"We all know that the period of reflection will be extended."
"We must show that the EU is needed for the sake of jobs and the economy and in order to bring about continued internal market reforms."
"We must show that the EU is needed in the world and we must point out the advantages of enlargement."
"Among the matters debated a lot in Europe and featuring among the top subjects on the Commission’s web site are institutional issues and the issue of Parliament’s seat."
"A huge number of people throughout Europe find it bizarre that the European Parliament meets in two locations."
"It costs a lot of money for it to do so and gives Parliament an air of the ridiculous."
"I do hope that this citizen initiative will soon land on Mrs Wallström’s desk with a million signatures."
"Mr President, this is not the first time that this House has debated the future of Europe."
"The Commission’s contribution to the European Council of June 2006, which is the topic of this morning’s debate, offers little in the way of analysis, unfortunately."
"I would like to make one observation and three recommendations."
"As the Commissioner knows from internal reports, one of the main reasons for the Dutch ‘no’ was the loss of sovereignty."
"It is perplexing that the Commission should subsequently attempt, through the back door, to extend the European Union’s powers in the areas of freedom, security and justice."
"I am all in favour of extending this period of reflection, provided that time is actually spent on reflecting on Europe’s future."
"We must move away from the text of the constitution, and a reorganisation of existing treaties must lead to a user-friendly institutional framework."
"This framework – call it a basic treaty if you like – must put concrete policy before the setting up of new institutions, such as an EU foreign affairs minister."
"This course of action will ultimately benefit the citizen more than a meaningless signature by a prime minister of the kind suggested by Mr Barroso in a declaration of loyalty."
"This will really not help us any further and will not impress the Dutch voter – something which my Dutch fellow Members do not need to be told."
"Mr President, I have three points."
"Firstly, I agree with Mr Kirkhope that the Constitution is alive and kicking and we should be happy about it."
"Last week was great: we had the Interparliamentary Forum, the Commission produced a paper, Estonia ratified the Constitution, Finland gave a clear signal that it would ratify and Mrs Merkel gave a great speech."
"Mr Farage is no longer here, but it was interesting to see that his message to the ‘cricket people’ was that he wants France and the Netherlands to decide for everyone else how the Constitution should be dealt with."
"It is an interesting message to give to the British people."
"My second point, echoing what Mr Méndez de Vigo said, is that we have five phases in this debate."
"The first phase was reflection, not siesta, as some would have liked to say."
"Now we are moving to the second phase, which is analysis."
"The Austrian Presidency needs to move the reflection phase on into a period of analysis and take on board Mr Méndez de Vigo’s excellent idea that there should be a study on the cost of not having a Constitution."
"Thirdly there will be a proposal phase and, fourthly, a negotiation phase."
"Finally, much like the Commissioner said, we will hopefully have a ratification phase in 2009."
"My final point concerns the blame game."
"It seems to me, from listening to Parliament’s debate and the public debate, that we are playing a blame game."
"It appears that the Member States are blaming the European Parliament and the Commission for everything that goes wrong."
"The Commission has a tendency to blame the Member States, and the European Parliament blames both the Commission and the Member States."
"We need to get out of this blame game and start looking at this more as a team."
"The idea of a joint declaration, in which the European Parliament also participates, is a good one."
"May I just point out that we are talking about the future of the Union, in preparation for the European Council, and only one group leader is present in this Chamber: Mr Poettering."
"Mr Schulz is no longer here, but he mentioned meetings of the Council of Ministers, in which each of the 25 Member States is given three minutes to speak, which makes a total of 75 minutes."
"If you take that example and apply it to our Chamber, with two minutes for each of the 732 MEPS, the total is 1 464 minutes."
"The debates in the Council are not necessarily sexy, but we could also make improvements in this area."
"My final point is directed at the Commissioner."
"You have just said that it is great that some Member States are ratifying the Treaty."
"Five have done so since the negative referendum results and a sixth ratification is on its way."
"I urge you to tell your Prime Minister, Mr Persson, that it would be great if Sweden ratified it as well."
"This is not a statement in view of the Ice Hockey World Championship."
"It is a simple statement that Sweden should do it too."
"Mr President, the debate about Europe’s future is set to continue for some time yet."
"In fact, the discussion on the EU’s course and policy will be a permanent fixture."
"The Commission is right to point out that Plan D is not just linked to the debate about the constitutional treaty, however important that may be."
"It is a first exercise in more open, more pro-active European communication."
"More and more communication is an essential pre-condition for successful European cooperation."
"Last week, the Commission presented the first results of operation ‘Plan D’, which I welcome with open arms."
"The Commission clearly indicates the concrete action that has been taken, which, in itself, proves that the Commission sets great store by sending out a clear message."
"At the same time, we have to be careful we do not fall into the trap of communicating for communication’s sake."
"In communication, less is often more."
"Moreover, the way it is done is only one of the two components of successful communication."
"We must also ask ourselves what exactly we want to say about the future of Europe and, above all, how this message relates to the action which the European Union has taken."
"The information which the Commission’s activities have produced so far is in this respect very interesting."
"Public surveys – I refer in particular to Eurobarometer – have revealed that Europeans have high expectations of the European Union in many areas, which inevitably leads us to conclude that a negative vote on the EU is in any event partly attributable to the fact that the European Union does not perform the way it should."
"I do not, then, have any problem with the Commission focusing on a concrete agenda of policy."
"Does this, though, sufficiently highlight the context in which we have to operate?"
"I have a few observations to make."
"Firstly, the citizens’ agenda must be sufficiently substantial in order to meet the citizens’ expectations at least to some extent."
"Has the Commission in this respect achieved enough or has it only considered policy that is already in the pipeline?"
"Moreover, we must not only consider the expectations – which the Commission has clearly done – but also the citizens’ perception of the environment."
"Should we not carry out studies into the way in which the citizens experience Europe and ask ourselves whether the citizens’ agenda can make a positive contribution to day-to-day life?"
"Secondly, an agenda such as this creates expectations which we need to meet."
"Indeed, if we clearly state what we want to achieve and then fail to deliver, then this will only contribute to a negative opinion about the European Union, which brings me to my last point."
"Which is the question as to the direction of the debate about Europe’s future in the different Member States."
"Whilst the Commission, based on what emerged from the Eurobarometer survey, has managed to indicate the topics that are of concern for the Europeans, how does it assess the state of affairs in all those national discussions about European cooperation, the direction in which we are going, and the constitution?"
"Is some degree of convergence kicking in, or are we still no further down the road than we were in July 2005?"
"All institutions have a role to play, but certainly as a Member of this House, I should like to draw the Council’s attention to its particular responsibility for the execution of a substantial policy agenda that is necessary to get the public to back the European project."
"Mr President, what we learned from the Dutch and French referenda was that many people, sadly, see the EU as part of the threat of globalisation, rather than offering a safe haven from its colder winds."
"We need to stress how the EU offers both security in the classic sense and an internal strengthening and dynamism, which makes us able to compete in the world and deliver prosperity."
"The Commission action on mobile roaming charges is excellent, by the way."
"I want to concentrate on security in the justice field."
"The single most visible demonstration of the EU’s usefulness to my London constituents that I have experienced came last summer."
"Under European arrest warrants, a suspected murderer was brought back from Latvia in four weeks and a suspected terrorist back from Italy in six weeks."
"That was a real illustration of the EU delivering the increased security from crime and terrorism our citizens want."
"The British Conservatives, incidentally, are playing a weak hand on law and order in opposing the European arrest warrant."
"So I strongly support President Barroso’s push to improve decision-making on justice matters, with laws on police and judicial cooperation and legal migration progressed through more effective and democratic and open methods."
"But the EU should also be united, solid and active on human rights."
"There is a lot of support for the EU playing a strong role in the world, promoting peace, democracy and the rule of law."
"But there has never been a Council common position or joint action under the CSFP calling for the closure of Guantánamo Bay or even just for the return of our own citizens and residents."
"Recently, our Temporary Committee on Extraordinary Rendition heard Javier Solana say he had no power to check whether Member States were upholding their human rights commitments."
"I said that this conveyed a pathetic image of the EU."
"Now Tony Blair, far from leading a national debate on the benefits of Europe, is conniving disgracefully in a dangerous and populist attack by Conservatives and the media on the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Let us concentrate on delivering a real citizens’ Europe, security from terrorism and organised crime and from abuses of fundamental rights and discrimination, and promotion of Europe’s soft power in the world."
"– Mr President, we are talking about the future of Europe."
"What Europe?"
"The Europe whose borders we do not know?"
"Who here in this House knows the borders of Europe?"
"None of us."
"What Europe?"
"The Europe which has no foreign policy, but is led back and forth by the Americans?"
"What Europe?"
"The Europe which has no army of its own and has a European army with an American commander-in-chief like ΝΑΤΟ?"
"What Europe?"
"The Europe with no energy policy?"
"Are we conspiring against Putin, who will give us gas, and getting embroiled in the trouble the Americans want in the Gulf so we cannot have cheap oil?"
"What Europe?"
"The Europe without enough democracy?"
"Talk to me about a single electoral system!"
"You have one set of electoral rules, I have another, someone else has another."
"What Europe?"
"The Europe which cannot have a single referendum because in some countries parliaments are in charge and in others the people?"
"Consequently, we are not one Europe with a future, because for one country, one nation, one union to have a future, it must know what it is and where it wants to go."
"Fortunately, however, we received a lesson yesterday: a lesson in patriotism and culture from an Indian, Mr Morales who, of course, escaped the ethnic cleansing we Europeans carried out in his country."
"It was a big day for Parliament when it heard that passionate patriot."
"– Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, in response to what the previous speaker and a number of others have said, I have to say that I did not have a vision only yesterday; on the contrary, the European ideal is the vision, for it is an ideal that has for decades brought us the peace and prosperity that only few parts of the world have experienced in the course of history."
"That is what we should call to mind, and it is a crucial point; it is something that is now simply taken for granted, rather than being – as it once was – regarded as a positive gain."
"Nor is ‘no more war’, and the fact that there has been none, enough any more, although it is still decisive."
"Even though we know how thin the ice of civilisation is, we are unable to communicate to our citizens the real reasons for European integration, because what we talk about never rises above the trivial, and by ‘we’, I mean the governments in particular."
"When I think back to how some talked about nothing but their own status as net contributors, while others, who had got five billion, nevertheless complained about not getting ten billion more, so that that ten billion became the sole subject of discussion and was taken as evidence of a lack of European solidarity, then we cannot be surprised to find the state of affairs that we do at grassroots level at the present time."
"I would like to urge the national governments to at long last get back to telling the truth and giving the people comprehensive information, and the Commission not to dispense them from this obligation and not to be over-cautious in this regard."
"I hope that the document submitted for our consideration today will be a first step in this direction."
"It has to be said, though, that misunderstandings in this respect need to be avoided."
"True though it is to say that what matters is that this Europe of ours, as it is presently constituted, should be got moving again, with progress – which alone is convincing – in important areas, the impression must not be given – as it is being to some extent in the media – that this is an alternative programme to the Constitution."
"It has to be made clear that we want, by doing this, to put the case for the Constitution and to make good use of the time remaining before it enters into force, but also that it is indispensable to achieving certain crucial objectives, not only in the institutional sphere with such things as voting rights, numbers of seats, and foreign and security policy, but primarily for the public good."
"It has to be made plain that it is the Constitution alone that puts the citizen centre stage; that this is not merely a union of states but also a union of citizens, and that those citizens have rights; that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is of fundamental significance in terms of the future conception of the European Union; and that the European elections have something to do with the President of the Commission being chosen by the citizens and the Commission thereby being harnessed to the popular will."
"These are the crucial points where we have to make progress, and it is in this respect that we are sometimes lacking in courage."
"I was put in a very optimistic mood when a young Member State, two years after its accession to the European Union, on Europe Day – Schuman Day – ratified the Constitution by a 73:1 vote, and the country of which I speak is Estonia."
"Something that is equally remarkable is the tremendous achievement on the part of the Finnish Parliament last week."
"I hope this will be an incentive for the countries – such as Portugal – that will succeed Finland in the presidency of the Council."
"Further to what Chancellor Merkel said in the last week, I take it as read that the German Presidency will discharge the obligation placed upon it by its coalition agreement. We want this constitutional treaty, and we will do everything possible to see that it is ratified;"
"I hope, Madam Vice-President, that the Commission will join in this endeavour with all the courage at its disposal."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commission’s Plan D. We need debates and I know from experience in my country that the more people are informed about the European Union, the more positive they tend to be with regard to it."
"That is why people like Nigel Farage and UKIP have consistently opposed Plan D, the funding of it and its stimulation of debates about Europe."
"They want people to rely on their ill-informed prejudices about Europe."
"We must counter that."
"We must stimulate the widest possible debate."
"I think it is right for the debate on the future of Europe to be prolonged."
"We need at least another year."
"We need wider and deeper reflection."
"It is right to say that so far the reflection has been less about the text and more about the context."
"However, we also know that we will, in due course, have to address what to do about this text."
"The debate will need more structuring and more focus, perhaps along the lines on which Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Stubb spoke just now."
"We will have to address this issue."
"It is far too simplistic to say, as Mr Farage and Mr Kirkhope did, that the people have spoken and they have spoken against the Constitution."
"That is simply not true."
"We have different answers across Europe."
"A majority supports this Constitution, even in countries which held referendums."
"If you add all the referendums together, more people voted ‘yes’ than voted ‘no’."
"Overall, as Commission Wallström said, we will soon have 16 States in favour."
"In fact, if you add Romania and Bulgaria, 18 ratifications will be in the bag by the end of next month."
"That is going on."
"It is a question of divergence, not opposition to the Constitution."
"When we have divergence in this Union, we talk it through to find a solution to make it acceptable to everyone, recognising the majority trend and trying to find out what adjustments might be necessary to make the minority able to accept it as well."
"We have a duty to the minority to talk it through and find a compromise, but we cannot ignore the will of the majority either."
"– Mr President, Vice-President Wallström, ladies and gentlemen, the fundamental question is this: what do the public want from political institutions?"
"What they want is solutions to problems, and, from time to time, a vision – yes, that as well – and they want their problems, fears and worries to be taken seriously."
"What the results from France and the Netherlands show is that this European Union of ours has not, so far, been successful enough in doing this."
"This rejection did not, however, plunge the European Union into a crisis; rather, it did no more than make it clear that the EU was already in one."
"According to Eurobarometer, even in Germany, only 38% of the public believe that their vote counts, so we need to make an active effort to seek the public’s approval for the EU, and now we have the chance to do it, for the fact is that the first step is very simple."
"We have to make it credible that the ‘no’ uttered by two countries in the EU is actually accepted as such."
"What is worse than a ‘no’ vote is a ‘no’ vote that politicians do not take seriously."
"This does not mean that the constitution is dead, but it is a reason why we cannot vote again on a constitutional treaty in unamended form."
"The Constitution must be revised, with its component parts kept separate from specific policies."
"The simple fact is that it has to be made clear that, for example, the EU’s goals and values are not the same thing as policies on fisheries or electronic waste."
"As for argument – day-to-day political argument – well, we need that too."
"Most of it has to do with the sectoral policies; if the whole debate around the services directive showed anything, it was, no doubt, that the public are actually interested in what goes on in this place."
"Arguments are the salt in the democratic soup; many in this House will be aware that I was not happy with what happened to the services directive, but I was pleased that 30 000 people were here in Strasbourg demonstrating, for that is real dialogue with the citizens, in comparison with which Plan D has something artificial about it."
"It must also be clear to us that we have to hold fast to the separation of the powers, and that is why I want to spell it out to the House that anyone who promises, here in this House today, that national models of the welfare state will be transposed to the European level, is trying to hoodwink the public."
"We have neither the money, nor the legal basis, nor the powers to do that."
"If you want to make social policy – and it is quite acceptable that you should – then please use the national parliaments as your base for doing it."
"If we make empty promises, then the 20 million unemployed will be given no hope, and everyone else will make us aware of how they have become more – rather than less – disenchanted with Europe."
"So I urge you that what we should be doing is to democratise the European Union’s powers, perform its functions well and make sure, at the next European elections, that we get a Europe-wide referendum on the revised text of the Constitution, and also elect the President of the Commission from among our own number."
"Mr President, put the Constitution to one side and start afresh."
"Let us elect, by direct means, a convention to be given the task of producing a democratic constitution and a cooperation agreement between democracies."
"Let the voters then choose between them in a referendum in every country on the same day."
"In this way we can attain the ground rules that our people want."
"Until then we should introduce practical reforms characterised by openness, democracy and proximity to the people."
"Create new rules of procedure in the Council and the Commission so that, from now on, all meetings are open and all documents public unless there are good arguments for sitting behind closed doors or otherwise dealing with a matter in secret."
"Let the national parliaments question their Commissioner each Friday, and why not let the voters choose their own Commissioner directly next time around."
"Resolve that we will never vote in favour of an EU law that has not obtained a majority in either the national parliament or the European Parliament."
"Last year, the EU adopted 3 124 regulations."
"The European Parliament was involved in just 57 of them."
"Put an end to this democratic deficit now, and also listen to those who voted ‘no’."
"Mr Barroso and Mrs Wallström will be visiting Copenhagen on Friday."
"The official programme provides for not a single speaker representing the French and Dutch ‘no’ votes."
"You listen largely to yourselves, while the Commission pays for events, think-tanks and movements in favour of the failed Constitution."
"Close the purse strings to propaganda, or give funding only to events that are pluralist."
"– Mr President, at last the time has come, one year after the 'no' in France and the Netherlands, but the 'yes' from the majority of Member States and citizens of Europe, to finally start to 'de-demonise' the European constitution and push Europe forward."
"We decided then – and rightly so – that after the 'no', we should focus the debate more on the environment prevailing around the European constitution; in other words, we should focus on the context and leave the text to one side a little."
"Unfortunately, however, we spoke little about the context and, by contrast, we allowed a school of thought to burgeon that the problem was actually in the text."
"If, however, we look, for example, at the area of freedom, justice and security, we can see that, over the last year, it is the context rather than the text that is the problem."
"Thus, the European constitution protects democracy in the European Union by giving Parliament a codecision role on most matters in the area of freedom and security."
"The incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights demonstrates that we do not consider fundamental rights as a 'bolt on' to the necessary protection of the security of the citizens, but as a central part of our policy."
"Unlike the text the context has become more and more problematic over the last year: we have a series of laws that increase anti-terrorist cooperation."
"At the same time, however, the Council still contends that the much desired and necessary framework decision for data protection in the third pillar will probably not even be approved by the end of 2006."
"We must not allow the context to turn into a pretext not to debate the text."
"Europe needs leaders today; it does not need evasions."
"– Mr President, Madam Vice-President, the agenda for the citizens of Europe is a well-intentioned initiative, but, in the final analysis, a missed opportunity and hence a disappointment too."
"It is a missed opportunity because you give the impression that the whole programme could be realised by the existing Treaty of Nice and that the constitutional treaty could be put on the back burner."
"That, at any rate, is the impression that Mr Barroso has given in his speeches and statements, and that is what the people of Europe have come to believe."
"The new ‘plan D’ ought to do both."
"You ought to be setting out the great challenges and suggesting ways of resolving them, while also telling people what works with the present Treaty and what would work better with the new one."
"This is what you are failing to communicate; instead, you are hiding behind the governments and letting us here in this Parliament do most of the work, and that is not enough."
"All your posturing about the completion of the internal market will not help to defuse the prejudice against the new treaty, which is prompting people to spread rumours about this being a superstate, a neoliberal concept, about the unbridled centralisation and militarisation of the EU, and this ‘plan D’ is doing nothing to lay these prejudices to rest."
"When the day of truth comes – which it will – we will have to get the treaty accepted in the remaining Member States, and all I can say to you is that many small projects for Europe are no substitute for the great European project that is the Constitution."
"I hope you will succeed in combining the two; only then will you have done your job."
"Mr President, I think that the period of discussion and debate is now really beginning, as so far it had been a period of discussion and silence."
"It is beginning thanks to the parliamentary forum that we held in Brussels last week, which was a real success."
"It is also being encouraged by Estonia’s decision, the announcement made by Finland, the statement from the Irish Prime Minister, the speech made by Mrs Merkel before the and the words of President Napolitano who, when he took office yesterday, stated clearly that there was no alternative to the European constitutional process."
"It is being encouraged by all these factors, Commissioner, but not particularly by the words of Mr Barroso."
"Mr Barroso should be capable of providing the political leadership of a President of the European Commission who helped to draw up the Constitution and is in favour of it."
"That he should not be so is unbelievable."
"Yesterday I read your Communication to the Council very carefully."
"To be honest, it would be more interesting for any citizen to read the first and second parts of the Constitution, which are obviously easier to understand, than this document."
"Despite all of your good intentions, no one will understand it."
"What is its objective?"
"What is its purpose?"
"There will be solemn declarations next year saying that we need a Europe of plans rather than a plan for Europe."
"No, there is no Europe of plans, but a plan for Europe, and that plan is the Constitution."
"The objective can be nothing other than bringing it into force within the right timeframe, in other words with the changes that need to be made and in a different political context, but without losing our way."
"Mr President, I should like to welcome the Commissioner."
"I should also like to inform my colleague, Mr Stubb, that there was more than one group leader in the Chamber for the duration of the debate."
"When we look at what has happened in Europe and when we consider all the words, emotions and print pages that have been published on the future plan for Europe, one key element is missed. That is that what the people across the European Union have said, not just in the referenda on the Constitution but also in previous European elections, was a cry for help."
"They wanted a greater understanding and a greater knowledge of what Europe is."
"The people we meet on the streets every day are not afraid of Europe or of the European Union."
"They are not even afraid of further development or enlargement of the European Union."
"However, there is a lack of engagement with the European Union and often a lack of trust about where they see the European Union going."
"When we speak about Plan D for democracy and so on and we put forward these plans, they must be based on what people want."
"Many of my colleagues have spoken about the blame game and who is more to blame, because President Barroso did not say this or a government did not say that."
"Let us be realistic."
"Some Member States have agreed a text on the Constitution for the future of Europe and it is ultimately up to them to deliver on their agreement, to make sure they convince their people."
"I would never dream of going to France, Holland or Germany and telling the voters there what they should be doing."
"It is up to the representatives of those countries themselves to be realistic and not hypocritical, not to play party politics and hide behind doublespeak."
"Never was that more highlighted than with the Services Directive."
"Governments previously agreed in the secrecy of the Council to have a Services Directive, it was put together and then suddenly pressure was applied and they all backed off and said it must be changed."
"Ultimately that played into the hands of Parliament, because it made us look strong."
"We could take the concerns of citizens on board and force a change in those amendments."
"Plan D must be about proper debate and engagement with people; it must be about respecting the diversity in the European Union; it must be about giving definition to European Union."
"But, most importantly, it must be about debunking the myths, not just those in the media but the ones we ourselves perpetuate."
". Mr President, honourable Members, thank you all for your contributions as well as your criticism."
"I think it will help in the ongoing discussion."
"When I entered politics many years ago, I learnt that there were three basic tasks for any political party or organisation."
"The first: to be able to describe reality, so that people will recognise reality as it is and agree that is the correct way to describe the world in which they live."
"The second task is to be able to put forward a vision, to say ‘this is where we want to go, that is what we want to achieve one day’."
"And, thirdly, to be able to change reality, to implement or enforce the changes that we want to achieve."
"I think that is still valid."
"It is exactly the Commission’s line."
"We have a plan."
"We are willing to show leadership, first of all by being able to describe the reality we live in."
"Indeed, we have tried to help by describing what we have heard through our Plan D activities and from the Member States and all the institutions involved in these activities, including visits to pubs."
"I was in London last Friday to listen to the fears the British people expressed about the European Union."
"Secondly, we have been repeating that we want solidarity, prosperity and security, the values that we have set out in our treaties."
"Thirdly, we have been showing the way, by changing the reality of the world in which we live."
"That is the way to engage people and to prove the added value of the European Union: by working together to change people’s everyday lives."
"This we know from the Eurobarometer surveys and from all our contacts."
"That is what people expect from us."
"That is how we can come back and approach the constitutional issues, because that is the way to prove that we have to change the way we take decisions."
"We must prove that we have to make the European Union more open and democratic."
"We cannot stop that work now and say that we will just wait for a constitution."
"We have to do both things."
"We have to move in parallel on both those tracks."
"That is the only way to regain citizens’ trust."
"I feel a lot of frustration, as you do, at having lost a project of the kind the Constitution represents."
"But the way to remedy that is not through personal attacks or attempts to engage only in bold rhetoric."
"There has been a lack of concrete suggestions as to what to do in France and the Netherlands, where we have had a ‘no’ and where we have to engage with citizens again to regain their trust in any constitutional project."
"That is really what we ought to discuss."
"What kind of agenda can we establish to rebuild trust in those countries that are experiencing many problems?"
"One idea was mentioned has my strong support."
"Mr Méndez de Vigo suggested looking at the costs of a non-Europe."
"I think that is an excellent idea and worth exploring."
"Let us see if we can do that together and subsequently describe our findings."
"We have a number of examples to describe to people the costs of non-Europe: energy policy and the fact that we do not have a foreign affairs minister, etc."
"It will make us less effective, less visible, less democratic and less open."
"We definitely have to end the blame game, because we are not alone in this: we need the Member State governments."
"Why should the Swedish Government, or any other government that has not yet ratified, engage in a project or stick their necks out in a situation where they see that there is no solution?"
"Nobody has presented a solution so far, but there are at least seven or eight different ideas on how to take this project forward."
"The Commission’s idea is, therefore, to begin by proving the added value of the European project by changing reality and doing our best to respond to citizens’ concerns."
"Whether it is energy policy, tackling unemployment or fighting crime and terrorism, we have to take action."
"Meanwhile, we should also point out that a constitutional settlement would help us greatly to act even more effectively."
"At the same time, we must engage with governments to ensure that we sign up to the things we want to see realised in the future and that we share the same values and ideas for the future."
"That is a step towards finding a constitutional settlement."
"We do not want a two-speed Europe or core groups."
"We believe that Member States should act in unison and that we should hold the European project together."
"This means moving on both these tracks at the same time."
"We have demonstrated here that we have heard what people have told us regarding the priorities, and I think you agree with me."
"The first issues people raise when we speak to them in pubs, universities or elsewhere are the tangible issues."
"They want policies to be settled; they want us to take action on things that affect their everyday lives."
"That is what they expect from us."
"This also makes it easier to return to the constitutional issues."
"We can definitely follow up the idea of describing the costs of non-Europe."
"We should also establish a timetable for a constitutional settlement."
"That is why we pointed to the opportunity next year, when we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, for Member States to agree on the way forward."
"This is our response to citizens’ concerns."
"Being able to explain a citizens’ agenda – the people’s priorities – is a step forward."
"Mr Kirkhope is not here, but let me say that the fight against terrorism is a very important argument."
"Are we really convinced that national vetoes should remain?"
"The European Evidence Warrant is one example, and it is still blocked in the Council."
"This is a very important proposal that would help our law-enforcement authorities to do their work more effectively."
"We will move forward with these proposals."
"The Constitution is not dead."
"The Estonians explained that they ratified it, not because they think that this issue will be solved immediately, but as a political statement."
"That was their purpose."
"However, they also realise that we have to look for solutions that satisfy both the French and the Dutch people and the other Member States, including those who said ‘yes’."
"It is not that easy to tell those countries that they have to do it again because we have made some changes."
"Today we see no immediate solutions to this problem, but we will continue to show leadership on the constitutional issues as well as changing people’s reality and will set a policy agenda, a citizens’ agenda."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the report by Mr Rack on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the second ‘Marco Polo’ programme for the granting of Community financial assistance to improve the environmental performance of the freight transport system (‘Marco Polo II’) (COM(2004)0478 C6-0088/2004 2004/0157(COD)) (A6-0408/2005)."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am here today to present to you the proposal for a regulation on the Marco Polo II programme."
"This regulation is the successor to Marco Polo I, which was adopted in 2003, and has the same objectives."
"The new programme, like the old one, aims to reduce congestion on the road network, to improve the environmental performance of the transport system, and to strengthen intermodal transport in order to contribute to the implementation of an effective and sustainable transport system."
"The programme will run from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013, and will have a budget of EUR 400 million, which is higher than that for Marco Polo I. The programme is structured around the granting of direct subsidies to companies to launch intermodal services; it is the most efficient way of providing public funding."
"This programme was designed, in the impact assessment, such that one euro of subsidy granted under Marco Polo II will generate more than six euros in terms of social and environmental benefits for society."
"Although it is based on the mechanisms of the current programme, the regulation provides for two new types of action: those relating to motorways of the sea and those relating to traffic avoidance."
"These actions should help to reduce the volume of international road freight, and thus respond to the strong expectations of our citizens."
"The Marco Polo II programme incorporates the concept of motorways of the sea, which has also been incorporated into the framework of the trans-European networks."
"It puts forward objectives that are appropriate to services related to these motorways of the sea."
"The calls for proposals between Germany and Finland, and between France and Spain, are now in progress."
"The actions related to the motorways of the sea aim to reduce road traffic in a specific corridor."
"This clearly visible Community added value will be of benefit to European citizens and, due to that, it deserves a Community contribution based on projects planned by consortia involving shippers, transport operators and infrastructure providers."
"It is time to get the production sector and logistics systems more actively involved in a coherent sustainable development strategy."
"That is why the Commission has also provided for traffic avoidance actions."
"The industry has already taken an interest in this problem, in order to rationalise its supply chains and to reduce distribution and transport costs."
"Thus, we can see that the measures to improve industrial efficiency and the political will to reduce the negative effects of transport simply by trying to avoid it serve the same interests."
"Marco Polo II also extends the scope of the programme to include all of the European Union's neighbours."
"Today, Europe as a whole, and not only the Union of 25 Member States, will find itself at the spearhead of an integrated transport market."
"Our neighbours to the East - Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and the Balkans - and those in the Mediterranean region form part of a huge integrated market for transport services."
"Production and the characteristics of the supply chain do not stop at the borders of the 25 Member States of the European Union."
"The Council agreed on a partial general approach on 21 April 2005."
"I am delighted that the rapporteur and Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism have tried to achieve agreement at first reading."
"This constructive approach taken by the two institutions should enable us to adopt the regulation quickly and to launch an initial call for tenders under Marco Polo II."
"I should like to thank you, Mr Rack, and the Committee on Transport and Tourism of which you are the chairman."
"With regard to the compromise that has been reached, four points are worth emphasising: aid to small and medium-sized enterprises, the funding thresholds for the various actions, the possible impact of traffic avoidance actions and the particular attention paid to sensitive and metropolitan areas."
"Parliament was quite right to underline the difficulties that small and medium-sized enterprises have in accessing this programme, and the new text will quite specifically make it easier for them."
"I am grateful to Mr Rack for stressing this point."
"The minimum subsidy thresholds for the various types of action have been reduced in comparison with those proposed by the Commission, and we will look into how we can deal with the increase in assessment and monitoring work that will result."
"I believe that the fear that the traffic avoidance measures could potentially have a negative effect on employment and cohesion in certain regions has been satisfactorily addressed."
"The new regulation also aims to give greater attention to sensitive and metropolitan areas."
"Mr President, I apologise for taking such a long time in explaining this proposal."
"I should like to repeat how happy I am that Parliament has taken a very constructive approach to this report, with the result that, in my opinion, today's text is most satisfactory."
"I should like to thank you all, in particular the rapporteur and the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
". – Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, not even the Committee on Transport and Tourism thinks it makes sense to reinvent the wheel, and that is why we welcome the Commission’s action in consciously flagging up its intention to follow up the success of the Marco Polo I programme by attempting, with this proposal, to continue the approaches that made Marco Polo I successful, and to do so with seamless continuity, which, among other things, means, in particular, ensuring that we will, in time – that is to say, on 1 January of the coming year – be in a position to launch Marco Polo II."
"Vice-President Barrot has already described in detail what Marco Polo II is intended to achieve, and so I can, quite deliberately, keep this brief."
"In essence, the object is to continue the old programme, but with added value in two respects, in that a great deal more money will be available for Marco Polo II than was for Marco Polo I, and so we will have the chance of even greater success than before in moving traffic onto environmentally safer modes of transport."
"Although we have not managed to get the 47 million on which we originally set our sights, I do believe that the compromise – which had to be reached within the limits of the general financial perspective – does show that the Commission, like the other two institutions, the Council and Parliament, regards Marco Polo as an important programme."
"Another ‘plus’ is that we have taken quite deliberate account in the programme of the expansion of Marco Polo I in response to new and changing circumstances."
"We are working on the assumption that all the EU’s neighbours to the East, as well as those around the Mediterranean, are meant to enjoy the benefits of Marco Polo II, since it makes sense to intercept traffic, and transfer it to environmentally safer modes of transport, as near as possible to the point from which it started out."
"If I may keep to the analogy with the wheel, we have also given the actions a slight ‘spin’ by adding two new ones – the motorways of the sea, about which the Commissioner has already spoken in detail, and traffic avoidance, although it has to be said that we have had very intensive discussions among ourselves about how this issue might be better addressed."
"The Vice-President has already pointed out that the object cannot be to use European funds to move jobs around within the EU or out of it, and quite possibly in large numbers; the measures we are proposing must not have that effect and are not meant to."
"The Marco Polo II programme has, then, in essence had an advance green light from all three institutions, and that has prompted us to make the attempt to complete this legislative project as early as first reading and have it ready for use, and it is thanks to a great deal of willingness on the part of the Commission in particular, but also of the Council of Transport Ministers, that we have succeeded in this."
"In the ordinary way of things, the Transport Committee does not regard the Council as a partner with whom it has had a long and affectionate relationship, but we have, in this specific instance, managed to work together very constructively."
"This House regarded the Marco Polo II draft as already satisfactory and saw little need to make any fundamental alteration to it."
"We in this House saw it as important that we should ensure better opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, too, or at least opportunities equal to those that Marco Polo projects gave them."
"We have put forward a number of what I hope are sensible proposals, which have to do, in particular, with reductions in the threshold values applicable to the original Marco Polo I objectives."
"It is now for all of us to give what we have worked on tangible form, to foster greater efficiency and cut down on red tape."
"With this project we are sending out a proper and vital message, and I would like, in conclusion to thank all involved – the Commission, the Council and my fellow-Members of this House – for their constructive cooperation."
"Finally, there is something technical to be considered: because we wanted to wrap this up at first reading, we had to ensure that the two documents – from the Council and from Parliament – were technically compatible."
"There is still work for the lawyer-linguists in both services to do on this, and for that I ask the House’s indulgence."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fortunate development in the transport policy of the European Union that we are debating today the Marco Polo II programme to promote alternative and environmentally-friendly forms of transport, which will contribute to the competitiveness of our economy and, at the same time, to the quality of the environment and our quality of life."
"The new Marco Polo II programme provides many opportunities in this direction."
"It extends to our entire neighbourhood, as far as Russia and our Mediterranean partner states, it provides opportunities for maritime transport by creating a separate category of actions, motorways of the sea, and it promotes the rationalisation of international transport."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for the decisiveness with which you worked on the conception and structure of the programme."
"My congratulations in particular to the rapporteur, Mr Rack, because his proposals strengthen the added value which the programme gives to the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the European Union and its neighbours."
"It gives new room for intervention in small- and medium-sized enterprises, something in which the Committee on Transport and Tourism has often expressed an interest."
"Mr Rack also intervenes in promoting and strengthening the balance between transport efficiency, reductions in costs, pollution and road traffic, thus contributing to the objective of drastically reducing accidents, which is a primary objective of the European Union."
"I am convinced that the development of motorways of the sea will constitute a dynamic element in our planning and in the efficacy of our objectives."
"The sea is a force and capital that has not yet been developed in our policy and we must work in this direction."
"To close, I thank the rapporteur because, with his proper handling and negotiations with the Council, he made it possible for us to have an acceptable text which we believe will quickly be put into practice."
". – Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by taking this opportunity to thank my compatriot Mr Rack, the rapporteur, for the good cooperation, and also the Members belonging to my own group for their patience with me and the confidence they have shown in me in this matter, for, as Mr Rack said at the end of his speech, the Council’s rather roundabout approach to this has, time and time again, made amendments necessary at short notice."
"I really am, then, most grateful for your trust."
"As we are all aware, the European transport system will face major challenges over the next few years, and they need to be addressed right now."
"It is to be expected that there will be an increase in traffic of up to 60%, along with the predictable consequences in the shape of traffic jams, damage to the environment, accidents and the risk of a loss of competitiveness on the part of European industry."
"The Marco Polo II programme is, in this respect, certainly capable of meeting the requirements of business and industry on the one hand, but also those of the environmentalists on the other, meeting the needs of the environment and all that is associated with that; that is one reason why I was very glad that it was possible relatively quickly to draft an extended and adapted Marco Polo programme."
"There were of course positive and negative aspects to this."
"One negative aspect is the budget, which, having originally been quite generous, was then reduced to EUR 400 million, which is particularly disappointing when one considers the cuts that will have to be made right across the transport sector, and it appears that the EU has set itself the wrong priorities where the figures in the budget are concerned."
"Most of what can be said about Marco Polo II is, however, encouraging; it is in those terms that one can describe the reduction in the minimum grant thresholds, since the programme did not previously apply to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It is also important that the programme covers one aspect in particular, namely the shift onto rails and the modernisation of rolling stock."
"I also regard it as a particular breakthrough that, in contrast to the former Marco Polo programme, it is not only the tonnage that counts, but that, for the first time, the volume can be taken into account as well."
"This amounts to a considerable step forward."
"Finally, I think it particularly significant that the text addresses the jobs issue and that we have taken the initiative on this front too."
"I now look forward with eager anticipation to see how this turns out in practice and hope that the programme will be a good one."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the transport of goods on European roads will increase by more than 60% between now and 2013, and by 2020 it will double in the new Member States."
"In addition to the congestion that this is going to cause, it will have a major impact on our environment: what we call ‘external costs’."
"The Commission estimates that, for every euro spent on this programme, six euros will be saved on these external costs."
"We are not, therefore, happy about the cuts made in the 2007-2013 financial perspective to the budget of EUR 740 million requested by the Commission for this programme for the next seven-year period."
"We are going to support the proposal and the compromise amendments achieved as a result of considerable efforts by Mr Rack, but we would have liked projects to have been eligible for subsidy if they would have brought about a net reduction in road congestion, whether or not they transferred goods to other modes of transport."
"We would also have liked to have achieved even lower minimum thresholds for the indicative amounts per euro of subsidy, so that a greater number of small and medium-sized enterprises might have accessed the aid from the programme."
"However, we welcome the fact that the criterion of the volume of the cargo has been taken into account when evaluating the results of the measures that are subsidised, because it is not the weight of the goods themselves that pollutes and causes congestion, but the volume that they occupy, and consequently and definitively the number of lorries that are needed to transport them."
"We also welcome the fact that measures carried out in only one Member State are accepted as eligible for subsidy, provided that they represent at least a 50% improvement in cross border traffic with other States."
"Finally, as I do not wish to go on for too long, I would like to reflect on something, although this might be part of a different proposal: we believe that there also needs to be a discussion regarding our current model of production and subsequent distribution of goods."
"If we were really incorporating all the external costs of transport without exception, as well as the repercussions of that model on the distribution of the population and land planning, we might have to change the model."
". – Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by saying that the Greens will, of course, support this programme, even if there is too little money for it; that must be made clear."
"It was because we hoped that one result of the negotiations might yet be the extension of the programme that we did not immediately give our assent to everything."
"The hope may have been there, but it was, unfortunately, not fulfilled."
"I have to say quite frankly that the halving of the figures originally proposed was, in my view, a setback, but the programme itself has come out of the evaluation in a positive light, and it is for that reason that we will – as we must – support it."
"The fact is that Marco Polo, as a programme, had the potential to – and indeed does – play a core role in addressing the problems to which transport gives rise, and would not only actively help improve modal shift, but also boost intermodal transport, for, this time, the focus is on inland waterways and on short-distance sea transport – which I will not call ‘motorways of the sea’, since that always strikes me as a rather peculiar term – and we have had to accept that certain switches from one mode of transport to another are made impossible by the absence of key points and interconnection points between them."
"I regard intervention in this area as crucial and important."
"The programme would also send out a message to the general population, who suffer from the adverse effects of goods transport by road, such as emissions, noise, and the other hazards to health and the environment that people talk about, which they regard as tragic and which they wish to reduce."
"It is for that reason that this programme is so important to me right now."
"It has, unfortunately, appeared to us from some interventions by representatives of the Commission that consideration is being given, in the course of the mid-term review of the White Paper, to regarding the switching of transport to environmentally friendly modes of transport as no longer an objective of the European Union, and that I would regard as absolutely the wrong thing to do."
"If we regard the protection of the environment and public health as things to be aimed at, then what is needed is not just a programme costing EUR 400 million, but rather the sort of focused determination that intervenes and says clearly that transport cannot simply be allowed to trundle along as it is doing, but must be guided – which it now is being, albeit in the wrong direction."
"If the mid-term review really does entail the abandonment of the ‘modal shift’ change, we will lose credibility in the eyes of the public."
"Merely giving way to the interventions of the most powerful lobbyists and forgetting the interests of the people who live along roads constitutes an abandonment of policymaking; such a thing is no longer worthy of the name, for it amounts to nothing more than allowing the economic interests of a small economic sector to prevail."
". Mr President, the huge development of the motorway network and a reduction in prices for the customers have resulted in the enormous growth of freight transport by lorry, to the detriment of the environment and pressure on public space."
"The White Paper on Transport is right to mention the shift of freight transport from the road to rail and inland shipping as an important objective."
"Even after the forthcoming update of the White Paper, this should remain a priority, because without a modal shift, our transport cannot meet the demands of sustainability."
"It is likely that, since the financial wings of Marco Polo II, which is to run up until 2013, have been drastically clipped by a reduction from EUR 740 million to EUR 400 million, this objective may not be achieved as effectively or on time."
"Despite this, my group remains of the opinion that the present programme is of huge importance in order to improve the environment and to curb the growth in road transport that has got completely out of hand."
"My group is in favour of extending the programme to include the European Union’s neighbouring countries and also the extra attention for shifting more of the freight that is being carried along coastal roads to the Motorways of the Sea."
"At least as important is the reduction of unnecessary transport by achieving better logistical harmonisation."
"The number of miles driven can be reduced by preventing empty runs, by shortening the distances between the different processing stages as much as possible and by higher loading factors."
"We have always argued in favour of the principle of transport prevention that was introduced here."
"The lowering of the subsidy thresholds will produce additional red tape."
"Whilst the proposed volume equivalents are a positive addition to the calculation of saved tonnage miles, the 1 on 1 coefficient that was given for this could lead to a situation in which from hereon in, all applications are submitted in volume units, because this is more profitable for business."
". Mr President, the agreement with the Council about the Marco Polo II Programme mainly translates into better access to this programme for smaller enterprises."
"Since a huge number of those are active in the transport industry, that is a major advance, which is mainly attributable to projects being combined and a restriction of the financial and administrative burden."
"The only fundamental observation I should like to make with regard to this programme is that there is no assessment of Marco Polo I. The lack of such an evaluation means that it is impossible to say whether Marco Polo II will have the desired effect, simply because the link between goal and resources used is unknown."
"I am therefore pleased that an assessment will be carried out next year, the findings of which will, hopefully, reinforce the set-up and implementation of the programme."
"I should like to finish off by thanking the rapporteur for the result achieved which I will certainly be backing."
"Mr President, Commissioner Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the proposals and advances that he has put forward in his report."
"As a French Member of the European Parliament, and in view of the geographical position of France as a real crossroads in the European road network, I fully support all the initiatives aimed at reducing congestion on our roads, at promoting ways of transporting goods and persons other than by road and at improving the environmental performance of the transport system in general."
"I am also delighted at the position given to motorways of the sea in the Marco Polo II programme, as the development of these motorways will have a positive influence on reducing international road freight."
"As the rapporteur stressed, if nothing is done to reduce congestion on the roads, goods transport by road will increase overall by more than 60% by 2013."
"We will be faced with an increasing number of accidents, with greater congestion, with more environmental damage and, ultimately, with higher costs for European industry as a whole, which, to the extent that it depends on reliable and profitable supply chains, will become less competitive."
"That is why we must focus all of our efforts on developing intermodal transport."
"With the enlargement to the East, Europe's maritime borders have been pushed back, and we now have new conditions and opportunities for developing the motorways of the sea."
"We must make the most of them."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to warmly congratulate Mr Rack on getting the agreement reached at first reading and, at the same time, thank him for the way in which he has achieved this fine result."
"This success is due to much perseverance on his part, so let us count our blessings."
"Despite the on-going ups and downs surrounding the financial perspectives, an amount to the tune of EUR 400 million is available for this new Marco Polo programme, which is double the amount that has so far been available annually."
"All credit to the Commission for extending the scope of Marco Polo II in its proposal to include motorways of the sea actions and a reduction in transport, and also for the fact that there are more opportunities for inland shipping, so that a whole range of alternative and environmentally-friendly modes of transport can help promote the modal shift via this programme."
"I am pleased that Parliament, in its negotiations with the Council, has managed to carry out a number of important improvements in the proposed programme, the most important of which is a substantial reduction in the thresholds for awarding support, which, in many cases, have been reduced by half, for in practice, it still proves difficult for small enterprises to use this programme."
"I am also pleased that inland shipping has been given a more important position than in the original proposal."
"Thirdly, it is a good thing that public bodies, including regional and local governments, can also take part in consortiums."
"This too can give small enterprises a helping hand."
"The Commission has pledged to look into the possibility of awarding support to small infrastructure projects for the benefit of modal shift actions."
"Minor improvements, such as building quay walls, can be decisive in the success of those modal-shift actions."
"That is why I would like to ask you if you can inform us of the results of the study and whether you will actually include this possibility of small infrastructural projects in the programme."
"I would like to end on a practical note."
"The Commission, in its policy programme, has given priority to the reduction of the administrative burden and an improvement of rules and regulations."
"Practice, however, has shown that those who submit projects are asked to submit such elaborate details that very often, they do not even know where to start."
"I hope that in this respect too, the changes that have been made by Parliament via the rapporteur will lead to an improvement and can encourage enterprises."
"I would ask you to keep the finger on the pulse, though, because your services will need to be accessible and accommodating to those who want to apply for projects."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, wish to thank the rapporteur for his considerable expertise and cooperative approach to the job."
"Since he has set out in detail what Marco Polo is all about and has also evaluated it, I propose to focus on just a few aspects of it."
"What is to be seen in a positive light is that the programme is markedly better funded and equipped than its predecessors, ranging from PACT 1 to Marco Polo 1, but it has to be said that its funding and equipment are not going to be equal to the challenge of modal shift, and that is why we need, first of all, to be vigilant in ensuring that the projects are, firstly, genuinely cross-border in nature, so as to ensure an added value for Europe, and, secondly, in ensuring that the reduction by half of the minimum threshold values for grants really does put SMEs in a stronger position and increase their share."
"Thirdly, more inland waterway transport projects must be completed than have been in the past, and, fourthly, those national programmes that are either already in place or needed for the future must, at long last, be coordinated."
"Fifthly, attention should be paid to reviewing the instruments’ sustainability, which will involve the Commission in evaluating which projects are still operational after a period of between six and ten years, with the Commission – sixthly – reviewing which of the rejected projects are completed even without support, so that the induced effects of future programmes may be minimised."
"Mr Rack's report is, overall, uncontentious, and should be implemented as policy with the greatest possible speed; the added value of these measures will be immediately visible to the public, and that is something for which time is needed."
"Mr President, faced with risks to safety and the environment, with the practices of a sector that too often treats its employees as modern-day slaves, and with the expected major increase in traffic flows, the Commission seems to be realising that the problem is a serious one and that something needs to be done about it."
"Free and fair competition is leading us into disaster."
"We have before us a proposal to develop the motorways of the sea, rail and intermodality and to help industrial and non-industrial SMEs."
"In parallel to this, however, the Commission is continuing its crusade to privatise the railways, without even reviewing ten disastrous years."
"This direction is the right one to take, but there are not enough resources to make it credible."
"That is why my group is calling for a separate vote on Mr Rack's report and on the opinion of the Committee on Budgets."
"We will be voting against this opinion, because it can be summed up as 'tell me what you are missing, and I will tell you how to do without it'."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Rack report clearly highlights the challenges and expectations of European society faced with the unquestionable and continual increase in road traffic that we witness every day on so many roads and in so many cities of our continent, and goes so far as to predict the ‘imminent gridlock’ – to borrow the term used in the report – of road traffic."
"It is therefore the duty of the legislator to promote alternative and more environmentally-friendly modes of transport and, above all, to better integrate intermodal transport and to make it as functional as possible, for the purposes of both safety and quality of life, while of course seeking to mitigate the demands of the economy."
"In this regard, Mr Rack's excellent report presents timely proposals for the Marco Polo II programme, which I hope the budget allocation will make it possible to subsequently carry out."
"The party that I represent, the , has always supported the idea of the so-called ‘motorways of the sea’, which Italy itself designed for the Mediterranean as far back as the first half of the last century; such motorways are rightly taken into consideration and relaunched in the Rack report as part of the Marco Polo II programme."
"I clearly support – and I call on my fellow Members to do the same – Mr Rack’s amendments, which are aimed at revising the Marco Polo II programme for the purposes of reducing the administrative formalities required for intermodal transport."
"I believe that this is an excellent report, which I hope will gain the support of Parliament as a whole."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to begin by congratulating Mr Rack on his excellent report."
"I believe that his objective and that of most Members who contributed to the debate in committee was to address the need, above all, to rebalance the distribution of means of transport in a sustainable manner and to develop intermodality, addressing the congestion problem with efficiency."
"There is no other way to combat the anticipated increase in road freight transport, which is forecast to reach over 60% by 2013 in the EU alone."
"That being said, the excessive transport of freight on our roads is simply the most visible problem."
"Its costs in economic, security and environmental terms are huge."
"It is therefore essential to take consistent measures to offset these negative effects."
"Reducing road freight transport and transforming intermodality into a competitive and economically viable reality is the right way forward if we are to reverse the current trend."
"Against this backdrop, and fine-tuning the previous programme, Marco Polo II contains a broader and more complete range of necessary and welcome incentives and measures, which will be applicable not only on EU territory but also in neighbouring regions, and this is to be welcomed."
"It will make it possible to boost investment in rail transport, inland navigation and in the use of motorways of the sea more effectively, making use of European maritime islands and the outermost regions as thoroughfares between those routes – the motorways and inland navigation."
"It is also vital to promote the development of technical innovations that could bring competitive benefits for alternative modes of transport, especially as regards trailing loads."
"The objective of reducing international road transport, especially that of freight, implies pushing to the fore projects located in sensitive areas, such as urban areas in which traffic is mainly concentrated."
"Lastly, Mr President, I shall turn to the issue of funding."
"This programme, as we know, has been the subject of delicate negotiations in the context of the financial perspective, the result of which is an overall sum of EUR 400 million, much less than that proposed by the Commission."
"This is regrettable as it is indicative of less strategic ambition. As it is not possible to obtain greater resources, as the Commission rightly proposed, it will be the use and distribution of this sum of money that will dictate the success of the programme."
"I must therefore commend Mr Rack, the rapporteur, on the proposed reduction of the eligibility ceiling for some products. This will make this programme more accessible for SMEs, which make up a significant portion of the business world and which employ a significant proportion of the European workforce."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the objectives contained in this report and the solutions that it puts forward will certainly have a decisive impact on the future of Europe’s freight transport, in terms of its fluidity and its sustainability."
"It is therefore vital that it obtains Parliament’s support."
"I wish to say thank you, and particularly of course to the rapporteur, Mr Rack, for the work done by the committee."
"As many have said in this House, we must obtain a more environmentally friendly transport system in Europe."
"We have a very great deal of environmental pollution."
"At the same time, transport is extremely important for our regions and for companies out in the regions."
"Combined transport will become extremely important in the future if transport systems are to operate throughout the territory of the EU."
"The Marco Polo project also reveals the different conditions under which we live in the various regions of the EU."
"In many regions, there are long distances to be travelled."
"Companies in these regions are in many cases subcontractors for larger companies in more heavily populated areas."
"They are very important for employment in those regions that are a long way away."
"The Marco Polo project ought not, therefore, to lead to employment in the EU being relocated."
"I have proceeded in the committee on the basis of this view and can now accept the compromise relating to Article 1 of the report to the effect that the Marco Polo project should create added value for the EU without damaging economic, social or territorial cohesion, as well as the future Article 2 to the effect that the project should not adversely affect production or employment."
"Mr President, I am pleased to express my gratitude to the Commission by thanking Vice-President Barrot."
"I would like to thank him for this proposal, for this initiative and for his speech confirming the positive steps being taken."
"I would like to express my appreciation to Mr Rack for his work, as we have received a document which could make a significant contribution to more effective use of the transport infrastructure by means of active support for intermodal solutions."
"We are well aware that the European Union budget, including that for the period 2007-2013, will have much less funding available for transport than we would have wished to receive."
"This means that it will be better all round if the solutions based on using the existing infrastructure are as good as possible."
"I would also very much like to stress that this is a historical moment: an enlarged European Union, perhaps with two more members from 1 January 2007."
"We therefore have the opportunity to involve the new Member States in shaping a new European transport and logistics system."
"It is very important to maintain the role played hitherto by the railways in the new Member States."
"Finally, I am pleased that we see an opportunity and a new role for small and medium-sized enterprises, and that we are moving in the direction of stabilising the transport and logistics systems."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to cordially congratulate the Commission on its excellent proposal, and also the rapporteur and other colleagues, who have improved it in an exemplary and cooperative manner and achieved an early agreement with the Council."
"I would also like to congratulate us, the European Union, on the existence and improvement of this Marco Polo programme, which is achieving effective results through its efficient, although possibly too discreet, work."
"I value its achievements compared with other programmes and projects due to, among other things, its activities, which are on a small scale but add significant value in return."
"In addition, access for SMEs is being improved, along with short and medium-term plans, which gives an immediate visibility to the value of the European Union."
"This is a tool that is driven by demand and therefore produces effective and consolidated results."
"Finally I would like to highlight its strength as a means of proposing and driving forward innovative measures and policies."
"Regarding the addition of motorways of the sea, I must refer to the example of the successful relationship between Valencia and the Italian coastlines and the avoidance of traffic through the integration of logistics, and in the last few days we have learnt that a company like Mercadona – which is now achieving ratios close to those of Carrefour in Spain – is in discussions with RENFE regarding a permanent transfer from lorries to trains."
"We think that this is another example driven by this type of programme."
"To conclude, I would like to express two wishes: from the experience of Marco Polo I and this improved Marco Polo II, and looking to the review of the White Paper on Transport, I hope that the successes and achievements of this programme will help us to maintain a firm commitment to modal shift from roads to more sustainable modes of transport, and logistics will obviously be the key to this."
"Also, and for this I trust in the Commission and the Commissioner, who have the necessary ability and enthusiasm, I hope that the successes and formulas of Marco Polo are incorporated into the discussions on the trans-European networks, which ultimately have the same objective but on a very much larger scale, which sometimes makes them difficult."
"Mr President, I will keep my comments very brief."
"I will simply remark that the Commission envisaged EUR 740 million to fund 'Marco Polo II' and that the European Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism voted in favour of that sum and restated its keenness to secure proper funding for the programme."
"However, we now have a proposal for EUR 400 million over seven years, with new priorities that need to be funded, eligibility thresholds 50% lower and twice the geographical scope."
"Just as in the case of the trans-European transport networks, we are spreading ourselves very thinly."
"I rather doubt that, under these circumstances, the hoped-for trigger and lever effects will materialise, and I find that deeply regrettable, all the more so because 'Marco Polo II' is a programme that has already proven itself to be effective."
"Now more than ever, Europe must keep its promises if it is going to regain people's trust."
"We are not going to manage it with this kind of budget, though."
"Even though I welcome the efforts made by the members of Parliament's Committee on Transport to limit the reduction of this funding, I cannot vote in favour of this report, and I will be abstaining in the final vote."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, road freight transport in Europe has increased enormously over recent decades and will increase by more than 60% by 2013."
"This is a huge figure."
"This increase certainly has numerous negative consequences which we all know about: pollution, congestion of the roads, accidents and particularly high infrastructure maintenance costs."
"The way to cut this spiralling increase in road transport and limit its negative consequences is to develop alternative forms of transport and, in particular, to strengthen short-distance maritime transport by creating motorways of the sea and rail and inland waterway transport."
"However, this must be done in conjunction with the harmonisation of the networks of areas bordering the European Union, because a great part of the burden comes from there."
"The Marco Polo programme may help in this direction, by financing appropriate actions to prevent the risk of our road transport system collapsing."
"Certainly, like other programmes for the next period from 2007 to 2013, the budget is ultimately reduced in relation to what we had proposed."
"Finally, I too wish, for my part, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Rack, on his report."
". Mr President, I will be brief."
"First of all, I should like to thank Mr Rack and your Committee on Transport and Tourism, and also Parliament in general, for this work, which will allow the proposal to be adopted at first reading."
"The Commission supports the compromise reached during the informal trialogue with the Council."
"We accept the amendments adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which reflect the Council's position, and the new compromise amendments proposed by Mr Rack and supported by the various political groups."
"They reflect the compromise from the informal trialogue with the Council."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I have been struck by the level of agreement in the views expressed by the various speakers."
"We are indeed quite determined to avoid the dangers and risks of a continual increase in road traffic on Europe's roads and motorways."
"To achieve this, we need, particularly through the Marco Polo II programme, to actively promote all the alternative solutions: motorways of the sea, river navigation and a truly European rail network."
"Like you, ladies and gentlemen, I regret that we do not have more funds, but, as one of you said, I think we need to make the best use of the funds we do have."
"That is why I rather hope that, thanks to the promotional measures set out in Marco Polo II, we will be able to achieve positive results."
"I would add that the same philosophy will inform our decisions regarding the programmes for the trans-European networks."
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you once again for your work."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the vote."
". Mr President, I should like to thank the Commission for its positive response to the own-initiative proposal of the Committee on Fisheries."
"The response has been so positive that there will even be a change to the EU’s trade policy. At long last, we will be able to adopt our own sustainability policy, even in our export policy with regard to fisheries products."
"Secondly, this proposal gives all regions in Europe and civil-society organisations scope for implementing policy, something which will be brought to a close in the Commission proposal and probably also in the Council proposal."
"I am grateful to the Commission for taking that line."
"Mr President, I wish to raise a point under Rule 151(3) of the Rules of Procedure."
"I wonder whether you can help me."
"Should you declare Amendments 8 and 16 of this Doorn report inadmissible, since the Treaty of Nice is the only treaty that is in force?"
"There is no such thing as the ‘Constitutional Treaty’."
"Although there are many here who wish to forget that, the French and Dutch voted ‘no’ in their referendums."
"No treaty has replaced the Treaty of Nice."
"These amendments should therefore be declared inadmissible."
"I am sorry, Mr Bloom."
"I got your name wrong."
"I called you Mr Berlato."
"I apologise."
"How could I have failed to recognise you?"
"Your point is essentially political and very well made."
"We all take note of it, thank you."
"President Abbas, honourable Members, the European Parliament is very honoured that you are here today with us, and the massive attendance at this plenary sitting is evidence of that."
"I would like to thank you for returning to Strasbourg so quickly following your disrupted visit when events forced you to cut short your visit to Strasbourg in March."
"You have been in the eye of the storm ever since, because the storm is still raging in the Middle East, and these weeks and months are, and will be, decisive for the future of the Palestinian people and for the Israeli people, and they will also have a very significant impact on the whole region, and consequently also on the European Union."
"Mr President, all of us here want to do everything possible to bring about a viable peace process, and we are fully aware that if we do not act correctly, we run the risk of the world being driven towards a period of holy wars, religious wars, brought on by the election of potentially aggressive parties throughout the Middle East."
"Therefore, President Abbas, the European Parliament wants to listen to you: because of all your experience and your long, constant quest to bring an end to the conflict through dialogue with the enemy."
"No one in Europe has forgotten that, since the 1970s, you have paved the way for negotiations for peace, even way before the majority of your people were ready to accept it."
"You negotiated the beginnings of peace with Matiyahu Peled in 1977, and those agreements pointed the way towards a solution based on the co-existence of the two States."
"You led the negotiating team in Oslo, you were the person who signed those agreements on behalf of the PLO, and after your election as President last year, you sought to restart the peace process, giving rise to a truce between the armed groups in the territories."
"No one can therefore have the slightest doubt as to your commitment to peace and your will to negotiate, on the basis of international law and respect for the agreements already made."
"In addition you have the legitimacy of having been elected by 62% of the Palestinian electorate, on the basis of that commitment."
"Then came the legislative elections in January, which were a fresh opportunity for the Palestinian people to show their firm commitment to democracy, but at the same time, the results of those elections, which Europe respects and fully recognises, created serious concerns in the international community."
"That international community is, however, beginning to realise the dangers of suspending aid to the Palestinian people."
"The meeting of the Quartet last week gave the European Union the responsibility to find a mechanism for channelling aid to the Palestinian territories and therefore at least maintaining essential public services."
"The plenary of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which I had the honour of presiding over until a month ago, has made an appeal, which was reiterated by the bureau last week in Tunis, in response to the chaos that could result from the lack of international financial support and from the illegal withholding of customs duties that the Palestinian people have a right to."
"Mr President, you have the opportunity to talk to the representatives of the people of Europe about all of these matters and you can do so in the knowledge, which we all have, that you are the only person who is capable of talking to all the parties involved."
"You are the umbilical cord that can still take us from conflict to peace, and this is why we are so interested to hear your proposals and to help you to find the way to overcome these difficult times."
"You have the floor."
"Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, allow me first to express my gratitude for the invitation. It is an honour to address this Assembly, which represents a unique success story for the peoples of the Europe; a story that contains various lessons that can be used as a paragon for many countries and peoples across the world."
"When I speak to you today, I convey the message of the Palestinian people to the peoples of a continent we have always been linked to with relations of neighbourliness and as a result of our historical links of cooperation and friendship and partnership and association in numerous sectors."
"We would like to launch this cooperation through fruitful dialogue between civilisations and cultures which can enrich both sides of the Mediterranean and help all of us to defuse extremist views in order to ensure that our historically close links continue, and for us to be able to achieve peace in the Mediterranean area."
"As I speak to you today, I realise that I am addressing legislators who are very familiar with our problems, and many of whom have been eyewitnesses to the problems and the suffering of the Palestinian people during visits to our country."
"Only yesterday, the Palestinian people commemorated the 58th anniversary of the Palestinian Nakba in 1948, which represented the historical injustice when we, the Palestinian people, were uprooted from our land, forced into a Diaspora; when many of us were displaced and forced to become refugees."
"Throughout the political course and national struggle of the Palestinian people under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and following the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority in 1994 in the aftermath of signing the Declaration of Principles, the desire for a major, effective and active European role has always been a fundamental pillar in Palestinian policy and diplomacy."
"Our people have never forgotten the positive positions adopted by numerous European countries since the early 1970s in support of the Palestinian people’s rights and its national liberation movement led by the Palestine Liberation Organization."
"Our people have not forgotten either the European countries’ generous political, financial and technical support for building Palestinian institutions and a national assembly, and in helping us to deal with the consequences of the policies of occupation, besiegement and destruction."
"This support has strengthened our people’s confidence in the justice of our cause and in international law."
"At this point in time, another difficult time, we are quite logically looking to Europe, in that our region is open to all options, and that is why we seek and are waiting for Europe to play a leading role in the area."
"Despite the horror of the historical injustice inflicted upon our people, we have always been able to formulate a realistic policy to restore the rights of our people to self-determination."
"In early stages, European capitals were places where secret, semi-secret and public meetings between PLO officials and Israeli activists from the peace camp took place."
"It was in a European capital, Oslo, that the first official contacts took place between the PLO and the Israeli Government."
"The initial signature of the first agreement in history between the two sides in 1993 also took place in Oslo, before its official signing in Washington that same year."
"When the Palestine National Council approved in 1998 the Palestinian peace initiative and accepted United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, it offered an opportunity to achieve a historical reconciliation."
"I must honestly say that this was not easy for our people."
"But here I must recall the role played by our historical leader Yasser Arafat."
"It took courage to take these decisions; it took courage to put forward a peace formula enjoying the support of our people on the basis of establishing a Palestinian state on only 22% of the land of historical Palestine, which represents the land occupied by Israel in 1967."
"Following the establishment of the Palestinian Authority, we have continued our intensive search for peace."
"We repeatedly emphasised that the core of the process had to be based on the principle of partnership, a partnership committed to agreement and to the resolution of problems imposed by the legacy of a long, bitter and bloody conflict; a partnership that understood the legitimate concerns of the other and that could lay the foundations for a new and different future for both Palestinians and Israelis."
"The severest blow to the peace process, which was supposed to have reached its final stages within a few short years, was a result of the Israeli rejection of the logic of partnership and its insistence on practising destructive policies, particularly on building settlements, constructing walls and confiscating land to create a reality on the ground that would prejudice and pre-empt the outcome of negotiations."
"The abandonment of commitments and agreements and the rejection of international patronage have become a main feature of Israeli policy, and have resulted in the loss of momentum of the peace process and the consequent shaking of people’s belief in its usefulness."
"This policy has developed in recent years to the level of attempting to completely destroy the Palestinian National Authority and its institutions, and to the systematic destruction of our basic infrastructure, which your countries contributed in developing."
"For our part, and despite the state of frustration and suffering of an extent that I am sure you will realise and appreciate – particularly those of you who have witnessed it closely – we have been careful not to allow our national struggle to be diverted from its course and to make sure that it has complied with international law."
"We have rejected and condemned attacks against civilians."
"We have rejected terrorism in its forms."
"We have emphasised the importance of building a culture of peace instead of a culture of war, and we have done everything peaceful that we could to resist occupation."
"Sixteen months ago, the occupied Palestinian territory observed presidential elections after the death of President Arafat, in which I stood with a clear platform: to declare a truce and emphasise that negotiations were the only way to resolve the conflict."
"I also wanted to introduce a policy of reform in various fields, to strengthen democracy, to achieve a period of calm, to foster security, and to promote the rule of law."
"I am proud that the Palestinian people trusted me with this task."
"Our work started immediately, with the agreement of all the groups and factions, who agreed to respect this truce."
"It was the first time in years we had seen an almost complete halt in armed attacks by Palestinians."
"But our Israeli counterpart responded with the continued construction of the apartheid wall in the West Bank that divides our territories into scattered cantons."
"It has continued with its assassinations, arrests and military incursions into our towns, villages and refugee camps."
"It has continued its tightened and suffocating sieges; it has continued to reject agreements and understandings, including the understanding reached in Sharm al-Sheikh after the presidential elections in Palestine."
"And in spite of all this, we agreed to Israel’s plan to withdraw from the Gaza Strip."
"We ensured that it was implemented smoothly and calmly, and proved our ability to assume our own security responsibilities, especially in the border areas where monitors from the European Union have assisted us in ensuring the proper functioning of the first border crossing in history that is fully administered by Palestinians."
"The Israeli policy of rejecting our extended hand, of rejecting the opportunity of negotiating and giving peace a chance, has increased the frustration of our people."
"Israel’s policy has also exacerbated the deteriorating economic conditions in Palestine, and has made movement between one town and another long and dangerous because of checkpoints spread throughout Jerusalem and the West Bank."
"These checkpoints oppress and humiliate individuals who only want to lead normal lives, reach their places of work and their fields, travel to their hospitals and universities, take their children to schools or go to mosques and churches."
"The frustration and disappointment created by the practices of the Israeli occupation and the absence of a positive outlook for the peace process formed the background for the legislative elections that took place last January."
"The whole world witnessed how the transfer of power was smoothly and democratically implemented, and how we established the foundations and the tradition of a democratic process that we have no choice but to follow."
"We would reiterate once again that democracy remains without soul in the absence of people’s freedom and in the continued occupation."
"Over the past four months, we have been going through an unprecedented situation."
"The declared platform of the party that won the elections and formed the government does not conform to my platform and the commitments and prior agreements of the Palestinian Authority."
"Our approach to dealing with this situation is underpinned by the same principles that led us to carry out elections on time."
"We are addressing this problem inside our institutions and in accordance with our laws and regulations."
"The political activity in Palestine over the last few months is gradually producing a public opinion that emphasises respect for the agreements and commitments undertaken by the Palestinian Authority, and commitments to international law."
"I have asked the new government to amend its platform in order to conform to these international commitments."
"We are in a constant and continued dialogue that will take us to an expanded national dialogue in just a few days’ time."
"I hope that this will lead us to the required process of amendment."
"Our approach needs the support of the international community."
"The new government must be given the chance to adapt to the basic requirements of the international community."
"Stopping assistance to the Palestinian Authority, cutting aid to the Palestinian Authority, will only further exacerbate the deteriorating economic and social situation in the country, and will weaken the network of efficient and working government ministries, administrations and institutions that the countries of the European Union played a vital role in building and developing in the first place."
"Here, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the Quartet for its latest decision to resume providing assistance to the Palestinian people on the basis of a mechanism that will be developed under EU leadership."
"In that regard, we call upon Israel to fully release our tax and customs revenue immediately."
"The European Union can play a leading role here, and we would ask for your assistance in ensuring that Israel fully releases the tax and customs duties that are owing to us immediately."
"The Israeli Government is yet again repeating the slogan ‘No Palestinian partner’."
"You will recall that the Israeli Government used this slogan in the past as an excuse to abandon agreements and to refuse to return to the negotiating table."
"We are gravely concerned for the future of peace in our region as we hear about Israeli projects that aim to draw the final borders of Israel inside occupied Palestinian territory."
"These projects will foreclose any possibility of implementing the two-state solution because they will annex large portions of occupied Palestinian territory and will turn that which remains into scattered islands that lack geographical contiguity and vital water resources – water resources that the Israelis wish to claim as their own."
"This attempt to implement unilateral projects will destroy any remaining hope of reviving the peace process."
"It will also lead to another bitter period of tension and conflict, for which peoples in this region have already – for decades – paid a heavy price."
"The claim that there is no Palestinian partner or counterpart has no basis."
"I reiterate that, based on the constitutional power granted to me by our basic law, which entrusts the PLO Executive Committee, its President and its Negotiations Affairs Department with the responsibility of negotiation, we remain fully committed to returning immediately to the negotiating table to reach an agreement to end this long conflict."
"That is a fact I stressed when I spoke to Ehud Olmert by phone to congratulate him on taking office a few days ago."
"During that conversation, I stressed our true desire to immediately return to the negotiating table to negotiate peace."
"The whole world demands this of us, and we ask that the international community act immediately to support us, in order to prevent the region from sliding into an abyss and a new cycle of conflict that will have a negative impact not just on the Middle East, but on the world as a whole at a time when the region is experiencing other tensions too."
"We want action based on international law and the roadmap."
"We want negotiations between partners as an alternative to the Israeli policy of unilateralism, diktat and the negation of the other side."
"All of this is extremely important for us, because it is only through negotiations that we can in fact unify people in our region, while providing them with the principles of peace, development and modernisation that we share with the people of Europe."
"I once again thank you for this invitation and for your hospitality."
"I believe that I have just spoken before friends who share with us the dedication to promote the values of freedom, democracy, tolerance and dialogue."
"I am confident that you will continue to support the just cause of the Palestinian people until we gain our freedom and build an independent state in the Holy Land on the basis of the 1967 borders with the State of Israel."
"Thank you for listening to me."
"Thank you very much Mr President."
"You saw how intently the European Parliament listened to your speech."
"Your last words are also our own, as we remain committed to the solution based on the existence of two States."
"I am also sure that your words will have encouraged many MEPs to dedicate more time and thought to the Middle East problem."
"Since your ruined attempt to be here we have not adopted a new resolution on the subject, but we have held many debates."
"The debate that is about to take place in the Conference of Presidents will also help Parliament to be able to better define its positions on the conflict."
"Thank you again, Mr President, we wish the best for you and your people."
"We now resume the vote."
"Mr President, this information is only for my PPE-DE colleagues, as there were some minor problems with the first amendment."
"First of all, we did not have time to discuss the matter in committee."
"Secondly, both in the Polish and other language versions, Mr Buzek is mentioned as one of the authors of the amendment."
"This is incorrect."
"Although it is contrary to our voting list, I would nevertheless like to ask my honourable colleagues to vote in favour of this amendment as well as in favour of the whole report in the second vote."
"That concludes the vote."
"The Commission proposes removing customs duties for certain varieties of unpolished rice from India and Pakistan, a development we think is excellent."
"We Swedish Conservatives are therefore voting in favour of the proposal."
"At the same time, retained quotas are proposed for a number of other varieties of rice from the United States and Thailand in accordance with the agreements concluded by the Commission with the individual countries."
"We believe that all the customs duties on rice should be removed, since duties are to the detriment of the exporting country, consumers within the EU and general economic development."
". The text of Council Regulation (EC) No 1785 needs to be amended in order to incorporate the amendments to the arrangements for importing rice arising from the agreements established between the Commission and India (Council Decision 2004/617/EC of 11 August 2004), Pakistan (Council Decision 2004/618/EC of 11 August 2004), the United States of America (Council Decision 2005/476/EC of 21 June 2005) and Thailand (Council Decision 2005/953/EC of 20 December 2005)."
"These agreements established customs arrangements for imports on the basis of the nature of the product and the quantities imported, authorising the Commission to derogate Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 for a transitional period."
"As this derogation was due to expire on 30 June 2006, there is a pressing need to amend the text of the regulation in force."
"I therefore endorse the Commission’s proposal and support the Daul report."
"We have voted against this report."
"We believe that, in principle, the trade in rice should be free, thereby reducing consumers’ household expenditure."
". Broadly speaking, I am in favour of the adoption of this document."
"The collapse of the Fisheries Agreement between the EU and Angola was inevitable in view of the obligations created when the new legal framework came into force in Angola, which run counter to the EU’s principles on fishing agreements with third countries."
"I support the idea of making the current Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance more flexible and the derogation measures put forward in this proposal. I also feel however that, in the name of reciprocity, the EU should be aware of the fishing activities of Community vessel owners who stand to benefit from these measures."
"The Commission’s proposal differs from most proposals concerning fisheries agreements with third countries because, instead of extending the agreement or introducing a new protocol, the EU is cancelling the current fisheries agreement with Angola."
"The June List consistently votes against extensions to fisheries agreements and thus welcomes the cancellation of this agreement."
"We have thus voted in favour of this report."
"The reason why the agreement is being cancelled is that the Commission has certain views on the Angolan legislation concerning biological aquatic resources."
"The rapporteur regrets that the Community and the Angolan authorities have not succeeded in reaching an agreement."
"We regret, rather, that the EU still intends to conclude destructive new fisheries agreements and to extend existing agreements."
"The Commission and the European Parliament do not appreciate that the fisheries agreements with third countries have harmful consequences for the populations of the countries in question."
"We thus have a quite different perspective to the rapporteur when it comes to our approach to the EU’s fisheries agreements with third countries."
". In addition to the loss of fishing opportunities, of jobs and of the added value associated with fishing activities, the denunciation of the agreement will mean that vessels that depend on fishing off Angolan waters will have to be converted."
"Regrettable though this denunciation is, we must look into other viable possibilities for the vessels in question to be able to operate in other areas or under other fisheries agreements. New fishing opportunities or opportunities already in existence that are not being used must be negotiated."
"Alternatively, vessels in Angola could stay by means of setting up joint ventures."
"That way, jobs can be kept and vessels saved from scrapping."
"Measures must therefore be taken to facilitate the conversion of these vessels, for example by exempting them from having to pay back construction or modernisation aid obtained during the previous ten years, and temporary tie-up aid awarded under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance."
"Joint enterprises or other types of joint venture with a third country should be based on genuine cooperation projects that are mutually beneficial. The relocation of the fleet and the fishing industry from Community countries should not be encouraged, with the loss of jobs and economic activity that that implies, both upstream and downstream."
"– Mr President, the report on the place of supply of services has to do with the taxation of services for persons who are not liable to tax, and resulting as it does from the Commission’s report – submitted as long as three years ago – on the amendment of the rules relating to the taxation of services rendered to taxpayers, it relates to the business-to-business sector."
"There are a number of reasons why this House has not made any substantial amendments to it. The first is that the Commission proposal constitutes a coherent framework for the amendments to the sixth Value Added Tax Directive, which were proposed all of three years ago."
"Secondly, this framework achieves a good compromise between taxation at the place of consumption and European businesses’ ability to administer this tax."
"Thirdly, the proposal is an important step towards the reform of the European VAT system in a changed environment."
"Fourthly, we hope that the Council will adopt this regulation together with the proposal for the establishment of a one-stop shop for businesses, which will make it possible for European businesses to have less bureaucracy to deal with."
". Following the rather inglorious episode involving the Services Directive, another attack on the country of origin principle, this time with regard to the VAT payable on services, would be one more step in the wrong direction."
"If the ideas set out in Mr Karas's report are put into practice, this will have negative and dangerous repercussions, because the Commission and many of the countries in the Council want the place of consumption to be the determining factor for the provision of services, rather than, as now, the place from where the service is provided."
"However, abandoning the country of origin principle would create a complex, bureaucratic, uncontrollable and therefore impracticable system."
"Taking account of the place of consumption goes against the principles that, until recently, governed the VAT system applicable at Community level."
"The Member States need stability and predictability so that they can manage their public finances."
"Given that Community legislation was put in place very recently regarding, for example, e-commerce, it is quite unreasonable to suggest turning it all upside down."
"I therefore voted against the Karas report."
"Mr President, Police Officers Michaelis and Proske claim that our fellow Member Mr Pflüger used the word ‘shithead’, or ‘’, in connection with a demonstration in Munich."
"Mr Pflüger says that this word is simply not in his vocabulary."
"Accordingly, I would like to say that Mr Michaelis and Mr Proske are real shitheads – in claiming that our fellow Member said this."
"For that reason, I voted against this report."
". The decision taken by the majority in Parliament to lift the parliamentary immunity of Mr Pflüger, an MEP from the German Party of Democratic Socialism and a Member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, is highly significant."
"This is an unprecedented, blatantly political decision, which sets an alarming precedent, as it came in response to Mr Pflüger’s participation in a demonstration about the so-called ‘Munich Security Conference’, which takes place every year in that German city."
"This is the fourth time that Mr Pflüger has had accusations levelled at him in relation to his participation in this demonstration."
"In 1999, the Munich Court withdrew its allegations."
"In 2003, the proceedings were cancelled."
"In 2004, the police went as far as to offer a formal apology."
"This case refers to 2005, when Mr Pflüger took part in the demonstration for the first time as an MEP."
"The application to lift parliamentary immunity was submitted by the Ministry of Justice of the Federal Republic of Germany. Subsequently, Parliament adopted this application via the proposal tabled by Mr Speroni of the Italian ."
"Reading the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs reveals how incomprehensible and alarming this decision was."
"Hence our vote against."
"– Mr President, while I, in principle, welcome the compromise on which we have voted today, it must not be forgotten that primary responsibility for addressing the problem of obesity, especially among children, rests with the state."
"Consumers do, of course, need to be mature and well-informed if they are to take the right decisions, but even so, we should not seek refuge in unrestrained regulation at European level and end up imposing things on business and industry that they cannot actually afford."
"So, let us say ‘yes’ to information, but, please, can the state now take some action to address the obesity problem in a rational way?"
"– Mr President, it is surely also the task of the European something-or-other Union to do something to counteract the spread of illnesses closely connected with the way we eat, but I do believe that what the European Union needs to do in the face of Europeans’ pronounced scepticism about genetic engineering and the ruling recently handed down by the WTO is to push for studies of the medium and long-term damage to health done by genetically modified food, in order that the public may be, at last, rather less in the dark about it."
"While we are on this subject, we cannot of course overlook the contamination of some foods by radioactivity, which persists even twenty years on from Chernobyl, and the effects of which have as yet not been sufficiently researched."
"We Swedish Social Democrats should ideally have liked to have seen Parliament support the stronger proposals in both the Commission’s original proposal and the Council’s common position."
"It has not, however, been possible to reach an agreement containing these proposals."
"We believe that the compromise reached is the best outcome we can achieve right now."
"The compromise considerably strengthens consumer protection and makes it simpler for consumers to make healthy choices, if that is what they wish to do."
"We therefore supported the compromise and voted in favour of all aspects of it."
"Today, following a real battle, we have been able to reach an agreement between Parliament and the Council for regulating the claims made on food products and, contrary to all expectations, to have done so no later than at second reading."
"I am delighted about the fact."
"The wording we have voted in favour of has – at least – a dual objective: that of preventing certain improper claims or forms of advertising and that of preventing obesity."
"It is a practical achievement to have adopted the wording concerned. It demonstrates to Europeans, who appear increasingly to doubt the value of our project of European construction, that our continent is making daily progress and producing practical rules to improve their daily lives – in the event, by enabling them to make conscious choices about what they eat."
"The fact is, appropriate labelling is indispensable to consumers and, personally, I am delighted that, from now on, the packaging of a product that may be ‘low in fat’ but that also has a ‘high sugar content’ will have to have both facts stated on the same side, equally visible."
". The report adopted today represents an improvement on the text adopted at first reading, in that it tightens the conditions for using nutrition and health claims."
"A varied and balanced diet is a prerequisite for good health, and products taken separately are of less importance than diet as a whole."
"Nutrition and health claims, however, must be scientifically substantiated, in light of all the available scientific data and the testing that has taken place, which formed part of the adopted proposals, and to which our group lent its backing."
"We regret, however, the adoption of an exceptional amendment on nutrient profiles."
"Although the adopted compromise fell short of expectations on certain points, it does offer some protection and information to consumers, and seeks to safeguard the rights of SMEs."
"Explanation of vote in relation to the report by Mrs Poli Bortone on a draft regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on nutrition and health claims made on foods."
"The Commission’s draft regulation on nutrition and health claims is based on a number of assumptions about which we have our doubts: the assumptions not only that what is healthy is a matter of absolute truth and that sales pitches and advertisements are harmful and should be regulated but also that people’s eating habits can be controlled through political decisions."
"Finally, there is an assumption that the EU has a political task to perform in this area."
"None of these assumptions is valid."
"There is no absolute truth about what is harmful or beneficial."
"New discoveries are made, and old truths are re-examined, which is why it is quite inappropriate to use political decisions to force people into behaving in a particular way."
"Political decisions can neither guarantee that people have a balanced diet nor determine how beneficial or otherwise individual products are in their contexts."
"Each person must accept responsibility for his or her own diet on the basis of his or her own assumptions."
"Products based on new discoveries must be given a chance to establish themselves in the market so that they might compete successfully with existing products."
"At present there is no opportunity for voting against the Commission’s proposal. That is why we choose to vote in favour of the European Parliament’s proposal, which contains fewer regulations than both the Commission’s proposal and the Council’s position."
". The purpose of this proposal by the Commission is to plug gaps and to propose a European strategy for the coming years as regards information to consumers on the food products that they consume."
"Clearer, more accurate and more concise information could help consumers to alleviate problems such as cardiovascular conditions and obesity."
"The compromise amendments adopted have substantially improved an initial proposal that I felt was inadequate and insubstantial."
"The inclusion of imported products, the special attention to products for children, the facilitated access for SMEs, the exclusion of fresh foods sold unpacked and the ban on health claims for alcoholic beverages (more than 1.2% by volume) will make this a tougher and more complete directive."
"I endorse the Commission’s proposal and the Poli Bortone report."
"Despite long debates and a great deal of effort at persuasion, we have not managed to regain our grip on reality."
"What is crucial is not the composition of a particular food, but the whole picture involving the interplay of healthy and balanced diet suitable for people when considered in terms of their specific situation as regards activity, age and gender."
"Any profile ought to take all these things into account, but, as these factors are constantly changing, we have to realise that there are no such things as nutrient profiles and that, instead, the only way open to us is that of education and upbringing, what rural German women call ‘learning to handle everyday life’, and which is best communicated through the family and school and general education."
"I also hope that the ‘traffic light’-style labelling to which consideration is still being given is no more than a witless joke."
"Who knows, though, what can occur to ‘such clever people’?"
"One example of this approach’s divorce from reality is that no such information may appear on drinks, such as wine, with an alcohol content in excess of 1.2% by volume."
"On the one hand, then, scientific profiles are demanded, while on the other, the dissemination of scientific knowledge is prohibited."
"Wine is also governed by existing EU regulations, and that must also apply in this case."
"Our debates may well have been lengthy, but it is evident from the compromise that they did not go on long enough."
"I supported the amendments in the hope that they might make this squalid compromise tolerable."
"Although I approve of the compromise wording in relation to the directive on nutrition and health claims, which contains a number of improvements – in particular, Article 4 which requires a scientific analysis to be carried out before any health claim is made – I have nonetheless been anxious to vote against all the Amendments (90, 66, and 17) presenting genuine risks to public health."
"It would be dangerous for food products still to bear claims that, by not presenting the complete picture, could mislead consumers."
"Thus, it is unacceptable to highlight on a product the words ‘sugar-free’ when this same product might prove to have a high fat content."
"There is an ever-increasing incidence of obesity in Europe, affecting more and more children."
"It is vital to fight this scourge by not encouraging people to overeat and by no longer pulling the wool over the eyes of consumers."
"On the contrary, consumers should be directed towards balanced products."
". I welcome this report, which should lead to more honest and understandable food labelling."
"It should also make it difficult for companies to brand their products in a misleading way."
". It is a good thing to want to monitor nutrition claims in order to prevent the purveyors of cholesterol and diabetes from selling their highly sweetened drinks and high-fat food under cover of excessive claims concerning the energy they provide."
"It is, however, unacceptable to do as the Commissioner did yesterday and also to target wine in one’s efforts to promote health and to combat obesity and alcoholism."
"Wine is emphatically not a form of alcohol manufactured through industrial processes but a drink produced through the natural fermentation of fresh grapes."
"In Europe, wine is not water plus chemicals plus flavourings, as it is in the self-styled wineries of California or Australia, but a food produced from fermented grapes."
"It must, then, be possible to say so."
"It must be possible to make claims about the nutritional and health benefits of wine, with its antioxidants."
"Otherwise, what is the explanation for the fact that the geographical area covered by vineyards is also the area in which civilisation has taken root, while the geographical area covered by the health-obsessed, eugenically inclined Nordic countries is also the home of drunkenness, skinheads and cyclical depression, a place where not a single cultural miracle of any significance has taken place?"
". Labour MEPs welcome today's agreement on nutrition and health labelling of foods."
"We accept that this is a compromise package and there are some elements, particularly on Amendment 66, where we have reservations."
"We would have preferred the common position text, which allowed no derogations."
"However, the new law represents a major step forward in food labelling for consumers and improves the overall regulatory framework."
"It is on this basis that we supported the compromise package."
"I reject the regulation on nutritional and health information in the version adopted by the Member States."
"The regulation provides that, in future, nutrient profiles must be compiled for all foodstuffs."
"Food must then be advertised with claims relating to health and nutritional value only if those claims have previously been verified in a procedure standardised across Europe."
"It has to be said, though, that the rules that are intended to combat wrong dietary habits represent a major technical and bureaucratic imposition for the food manufacturers, without going to the roots of the problem."
"Obesity cannot be combated effectively by means of regulatory intervention, but only by changes in eating habits and lifestyle; what is called for is less time spent in front of the television or the computer, and more movement."
"Taken as a whole, the regulation also treats consumers as if they were helpless and concedes them no capacity to take decisions for themselves."
"The European Food Authority’s standardised procedure for approving health-related claims is objectionable, being a superfluous bureaucratic monster and, above all, a burden on our small and medium-sized businesses."
"Large companies find it much easier to cope with the extra outlay involved in applying for approval, but the additional costs jeopardise small and medium-sized businesses’ very existence."
"This law frustrates all efforts at reducing bureaucracy and the proposals for ‘better lawmaking’."
"I had the opportunity to express my point of view yesterday evening during the debate on Mrs Poli Bortone’s report."
"I wish, however, to explain why I voted as I did on Amendment 66, the notorious disclosure clause."
"I am opposed to calling Article 4 and the nutrient profile into question in any way."
"In my view, this compromise is therefore the worst sort of hypocrisy whereby it is permitted to make nutrition claims for food with high sugar, salt or fat content as long as the high content of these substances is indicated on the label. To put it bluntly, it makes it legal to give false descriptions."
"For example, ‘non-fat’ lollipops can happily be described as such, even if they are also ‘pure sugar’."
"And who cares if they give children tooth decay?"
"If, in spite of that, I have abstained from voting, it is because of what is contained in the remainder of the report."
"Firstly, we have come a very long way indeed from our vote at first reading which purely and simply killed off the nutrient profile."
"Moreover, many uncertainties have been removed, especially for SMEs."
"What is more, there is still a ban on health claims for alcoholic products."
"Finally, I am convinced that we should not obtain anything better by the end of a long and expensive conciliation procedure."
"Politics is partly about accepting compromises."
"This has been a highly contentious issue ever since the Commission submitted its proposal, and the majorities for it in this House have been very narrow, going right back to first reading."
"I am among the minority that regards the Commission’s proposal as a very good one and has supported it from the very beginning of the debate."
"The Common Position is very good too, and the compromise on nutritional values now achieved at second reading is the lowest common denominator still capable of being supported."
". The Parliament has voted to eliminate unsubstantiated claims on foods and drinks, especially products marketed to children."
"The EU was concerned that a food would, for example, be advertised as 'low fat' which might have lots of sugar or salt in it or conversely as 'low salt' which was high in something else."
"The aim is truth in advertising."
"In an ideal world it would be achievable but the problem is that producers must give evidence of health claims made for their product."
"Scientific evidence as understood by the legislation involves expensive trialling which will cost more than small producers can afford."
"Another problem is that though the nutritional profiles that will be required by law on all products will be a step in the right direction they will fail to distinguish the quality of the fat, sugar and salt in the food or drink."
"The nutritional profile will not distinguish between the bad fats that damage us and good fats necessary for health and growth, and similarly with salts and sugars."
"For myself, I want a complete list of ingredients and a mention of any nutrient-damaging process like irradiation, bleaching, saturation etc. to which the ingredients were exposed."
"The Spanish Socialist Delegation welcomes the adoption of this report, which will reconcile various requirements for health protection and correct information for consumers with the aim that the industry should not bear excessive costs."
"We do, however, wish to declare that our intention was to vote in favour of Amendment 49, which ultimately failed, as we think that it is an amendment of crucial importance to the Spanish Socialist Delegation, because of what it means for fermented drinks of agricultural origin (beer and wine) and for food use in a country such as Spain."
"This report, on which we have voted at second reading, entails improvements where health considerations are concerned, but a number of the amendments amount to a real retrograde step."
"This is clearly the case with Amendments 17, 66 and 90, which are aimed not only at legalising products high in fat, sugar or salt but also authorise claims that mislead consumers."
"I am very sorry that the aforesaid amendments, which significantly undermine the relevance of the document, have been adopted, and I regret their having been the subject of a compromise that I have no hesitation in referring to as dubious."
". As a fledgling MEP, my very first phone call to the Commission was about a proposal in preparation of a European law on health and food claims."
"This was 14 years ago now."
"Even then, it was realised that legislative action was needed at Community level, and so an agreement about a specific legal text so many years down the line is not a day too soon."
"The result is one to be proud of, for it strikes the right balance between, on the one hand, the consumer’s interest and right to health protection and information and, on the other, the requirement not to place an excessive burden on industry."
"Both the solution with regard to food profiles and the notification procedure prove that we achieved this in an adult manner."
"Consequently, this result receives my unqualified support."
". We voted in favour of the compromise proposals at this second reading, because we feel it is important that there should be a high level of protection for consumers regarding the addition of vitamins, minerals and other substances to foods, which we must ensure do not pose a danger to public health."
"In December 2005, the Council did not incorporate into the common position that it adopted some important amendments adopted by Parliament last May."
"We therefore deem it important to enshrine once again the bio-availability – meaning available to be used by the body – of vitamins and minerals. Otherwise, consumers will be misled and may even put their health at risk."
"Furthermore, safe maximum quantities for vitamins and minerals must be set and information for consumers must be made easy to understand and useful."
"We regret the fact that other positive amendments were not adopted, but we hope that they will at least be taken on board by the Council."
". I endorse the directive on the addition of vitamins, minerals and certain other substances to foods."
"I believe it to be vitally important that the various national regulations on the addition of vitamins and minerals, and of certain other substances, to foodstuffs, should be harmonised."
"What has become evident from these long drawn-out debates is that the Member States differ very strongly among themselves not only as to the necessity of the addition of such nutrients for a balanced diet, but also on the basis of their own differing traditions."
"Although this report deals only with the voluntary addition of vitamins and supplements, it is important to remember that the manufacturers’ sole intention in adding vitamins and minerals must be to do so with nutritional and health considerations in mind."
"The ‘other substances’ must be defined specifically and, with the protection of the consumer in mind, it follows that a negative list must also be drawn up."
"What is required – and will continue to be required – most of all is that the consumers be protected and kept informed, since it is they who, in cases of doubt, will be harmed, whilst the manufacturers will make a profit."
". I welcome this report on the measures needed to protect the elver industry in Europe."
"Changing tastes and a collapse in stock have transformed what was a local, cheap seasonal delicacy into a luxury product, almost exclusively for export to the Far East."
"The life-cycle of elvers is still not properly understood with gluts and shortages alternating in a not fully understood pattern."
"Yet the drop of stock levels over past decades seems to be outside the normal range of variation."
"If action is not taken, this small but locally important industry may die."
"I support the restriction on fishing, while agreeing with the Commission the need to identify when bans will fall needs investigation, as yields vary with the phases of the moon and not days of the month."
"I also support limits on exports to protect stocks, which I am sure the WTO will support, and financial help from the EU to ensure rivers remain open for the passage of elvers."
"We may have to revisit this issue in future, but at least we are finally taking some action."
". I welcome this report, although I feel that it could have set itself more ambitious objectives."
"First and foremost, I should like to highlight the fact that there is great variation between the river basins in the different Member States where this species exists. Consequently, different strategies and measures are needed to ensure the effective recovery of these stocks."
"Accordingly, I welcome the fact that it has been left to the Member States to propose their own recovery plans."
"I also believe that the EU must support the measures that each Member State deems appropriate for repopulating the various river basins."
"This includes, for example, the construction and/or adaptation of barrier-crossing mechanisms along rivers."
". The Commission’s main objective in tabling this proposal for a regulation to recover eel stocks is to set up national Eel Management Plans."
"The proposal is intended to guarantee a 40% escape rate of adult silver eels from each river basin, an objective that will be difficult to meet. The proposal also treats all Member States in the same way, without taking account of their particular characteristics."
"It is also proposed that there be a ban on fishing eel during the first 15 days of the month, which is excessive and would have a major socio-economic impact."
"These measures would have to be met by July 2007, a relatively short space of time."
"In this regard, Parliament’s proposals strike a better balance and rectify some of the worst aspects of the Commission’s proposal, thereby helping to contribute towards the recovery of eel stocks."
"The report replaces the ban on fishing in the first half of every month with a season in which the fishing effort is reduced by half."
"It also raises the 40% escape rate objective."
"It gives Member States the opportunity to operate solely in relevant river basins."
"Furthermore, the deadline for implementation has been extended to 2008."
"All of which gives greater powers to the Member States."
". I voted today against the EC-Morocco Partnership Agreement on fisheries because I am not satisfied that all steps were taken in respect of this agreement, which could and should have been taken to protect the sovereignty and rights of Western Sahara."
"Instead, intended ambiguity prevails so as to facilitate Morocco's abuse of Western Saharan waters and to avoid facing up to its illegal claim to the territory."
"Today, the European Parliament voted in favour of the EU entering into a fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"We Social Democrats voted against the agreement."
"We believe that the fisheries agreement should not extend to include Western Saharan territory because Morocco has been occupying Western Sahara since 1975."
"We believe that the agreement contravenes international law because there are no guarantees that it will benefit the Western Saharan population, which has not helped design the agreement."
". The Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Morocco sets out the principles, the rules and the procedures governing economic, financial, technical and scientific cooperation in ‘Moroccan fishing zones’ (Article 1)."
"Article 2(a) defines the term ‘Moroccan fishing zone’ as ‘the waters falling within the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Morocco’."
"The vote in favour by the Members who have signed the report before is naturally based on the definition in Article 2."
". Broadly speaking, I am in favour of the adoption of this document."
"The new agreement provides for a significant reduction in the number of fishing licenses awarded to the Member States."
"The number is to fall from 500 to approximately 100, with the loss of some important categories of fish, namely crustaceans and cephalopods."
"In any event, I still believe it important for the Community fleet, and the Portuguese fleet in particular, to continue to be able to fish in Morocco under a Partnership Agreement."
"In this regard, the broader interests of the common fisheries policy in the area of international fisheries have been safeguarded, and some important commitments have been made in the area of managing fisheries resources and the fight against illegal fishing."
". I should like to vote in favour of a Fisheries Agreement between the European Community and Morocco, but I must vote against it."
"This is because amendments were not adopted that were aimed at excluding from the scope of the Agreement the waters and fisheries resources of Western Sahara, a non-autonomous territory under United Nations Resolutions 1514 and 1541, which has been occupied illegally by Morocco since 1974."
"Consequently, to my mind, the Agreement – and the corresponding legislative proposal by the Commission – violates international law."
"The EU is again to enter into a fisheries agreement with an African state."
"We have on several occasions pointed out how damaging these agreements are."
"Those countries with which the EU enters into such agreements are deprived of the opportunity to develop their own efficient fishing industries."
"What is more, the EU’s fishing fleet is partly responsible for depleting fish stocks, something pointed out by both Swedish authorities and environmental organisations."
"Moreover, these agreements are expensive for taxpayers in the EU Member States."
"They amount, in actual fact, to direct subsidies to the fishing industry."
"This agreement in particular is especially objectionable because Morocco has been occupying Western Sahara illegally for many years."
"The International Court of Justice in The Hague has pointed this out. What it means is that Morocco has no ultimate control over its natural resources, including its fisheries resources."
"By entering into a fisheries agreement with Morocco, the EU is indirectly recognising this occupation and the human rights violations constantly committed by Morocco in Western Sahara."
"We have voted against the report in today’s vote."
". We regret the rejection of two amendments, which, in compliance with international law, specifically excluded the waters off Western Sahara from the fisheries agreement before us, restricting the Agreement to the waters north of the 27°40' N'' parallel."
"An even more worrying aspect of its rejection is the fact that the Commissioners involved and some MEPs consider Morocco to be the administrator of Western Sahara, a view that runs counter to international law. Furthermore, experience of previous Agreements has shown that ports in Western Sahara have been captured and used without the rights and interests of the Sahrawi people being safeguarded."
"I wish to emphasise, as the Polisario Front has done, that the United Nations reiterated condemnation of the exploitation and looting of natural resources and of all economic activity taking place to the detriment of communities in colonised or non-autonomous territories where such people are denied their legitimate rights to their natural resources, in its legal opinion on Western Sahara and its natural resources of 29 January 2002."
"As far as the UN is concerned, this exploitation and looting is illegal and a threat to the integrity and prosperity of these territories."
"Hence our vote against."
". The European Parliamentary Labour Party is concerned over the impact of the proposed fisheries agreement on the position of Western Sahara and the prospects for resolving that long-running conflict."
"For this reason Labour MEPs supported the amendments that would exclude Western Sahara from the scope of the agreement and voted against the agreement when the exclusion amendments fell."
". Following the report on the Partnership Agreement between the EU and the Kingdom of Morocco on fisheries resources, I should like to vote for the most appropriate regulation for the area’s environmental sustainability."
"In this respect, the Agreement is crucial."
"Both for the EU and for me personally, however, the issue of human rights is also crucial. That being the case, United Nations resolutions must always take precedence in this regard."
"It is clear to me that the purpose of this Agreement is to cover sea areas and territories that are not under dispute and concerning which there are no sovereignty issues, and no others, because no state should be allowed to make use of resources that are not under its sovereignty or jurisdiction, to the detriment of the self-determination of other groups."
". I voted against the EC-Morocco fishing deal because the people of Western Sahara are still under Moroccan occupation and have had no say over the agreement which allows fishing in their territorial waters."
"I believe that the Saharawi people should have rights over their territorial waters."
"It is for this reason that the EC-Morocco fish agreement should not include the waters of Western Sahara, as the people have no power to opt in or out of the agreement."
"I do not support an agreement on trade that violates the rights of other communities to determine the use of their own resources."
". In voting on this report I am extremely concerned about the impact of the proposed fisheries agreement on the position of Western Sahara and the prospects of resolving that long-running conflict."
"This is a campaign which some of my London constituents have been working with me on, under the guidance of the UK-based War on Want charity."
"For this reason I supported amendments that would exclude Western Sahara from the scope of the agreement and voted against the agreement when the exclusion amendments fell."
". I wish to make two brief explanations as regards this vote."
"I should first like to speak about Western Sahara."
"Mindful of the fact that this agreement addresses the issue in the usual manner, that is to say, following the tradition of not tabling any amendments to the European position, and the fact that the Commission’s legal services have decided that it does comply with international rules, I feel that it is inappropriate to raise objections regarding the Western Sahara situation here."
"As for the actual question that we are addressing, the fact that it has finally been possible to reach agreement on this issue is to be welcomed, although I must express my disappointment that the final outcome is not very favourable to Portuguese interests."
"All in all, however, everything points to this being the best solution, because it is a workable solution."
"I therefore voted in favour."
". In omitting from the fisheries agreement any reference to the territories of the Western Sahara occupied by Morocco, the European Parliament is sending out an important political message."
"I tabled amendments to that end, but, as these amendments have not been adopted, I have voted against the report."
". Because of the rejection of all amendments which would have prevented European illegal fishing in the waters of Western Sahara I have voted against this resolution."
"I am concerned that this agreement in its current unamended form will allow European boats (including Irish boats) to fish in the waters of Western Sahara, a territory illegally occupied by Morocco."
"If the agreement is implemented, the EU will be violating international law and helping to prolong a conflict which has already lasted for 30 years."
"The International Court of Justice and successive UN resolutions have made it clear that Western Sahara is Africa’s last colony, with a right to self-determination for its people."
"Morocco is not recognised as the administrative power."
"It has been clearly stated that no other country has a right to exploit the Saharawi resources without the permission of the Saharawi people."
". Mr President, the plight of the people of the Western Sahara will not be improved by the exporting of our own disastrous fisheries policies to their territory, under illegal occupation by Morocco."
"It is a poor show that the EU, usually a guardian of the rule of law, is in this case using technicalities and weasel words to justify making ourselves in effect complicit in an illegal occupation."
"I voted against this poor report and am saddened that the House approved it."
"I voted in favour of the report by my fellow Member, Mrs Frassoni, on the recent reports by the European Commission on monitoring the application of Community law."
"This report was keenly awaited in the wake of the Interinstitutional Agreement of December 2003. Known as Better Lawmaking, the agreement was aimed at reducing the volume of Community law at the same time as simplifying it and was designed to ensure that the legislation was properly applied everywhere, this being a necessary condition of creating an area of justice."
"Unfortunately, it has to be said that the Member States are bad at transposing Community law. Worse, they apply it badly and do so with an impunity in which the European Commission is complicit."
"It should be remembered that it is the Member States that are responsible for monitoring the application of Community law."
"Everyone can see the degree to which the present system does not work and how it helps create a gulf between, on the one hand, European integration and, on the other, Europeans, who are aware of the injustice of this situation every day."
"I wonder if the time may not have come to consider creating a European body of independent inspectors with the task of monitoring the application of Community law in the Member States."
"What the reports voted on today reveal are the growing number of difficulties in applying Community law and the proliferation of cases submitted to the European Court of Justice."
"On 31 December 2003, it emerged from the 21st report of the Commission that 3 927 offences were being examined, compared with 2 270 in 1999 and only 124 in 1978."
"This is partly because of the large amount of Community law but also because of the large quantity of sanctions that the European Commission can impose on any Member States reluctant to apply Community legislation."
"The issue of applying Community law is, above all, a political issue and not a legal or technocratic one as a number of people think and state that it is."
"In fact, what mainly happens is that the problem of existing conflicts between European power and forms of national sovereignty is concealed."
"In this connection, the recent decision - of 13 September 2005 - by the Court of Justice of the European Communities which, for the first time and independently of any legal basis, has made criminal law a Community matter is symptomatic of the way in which this institution has developed."
"It is, then, understandable why Member States are reluctant to apply Community legislation that they have not chosen."
". The monitoring of the application of Community law falls to the Commission, as ‘guardian of the Treaties’."
"The Commission is informed of any case of non-compliance with the Community Treaties, and cautions and sanctions the Member States responsible."
"The Commission’s annual reports on the application of Community law indicate the progress made by the Member States in transposing directives, with the purpose of ensuring efficient monitoring of the application of the law."
"This monitoring does not consist solely of an assessment of the transposition in quantitative terms, but also an assessment of the quality of the transposition."
"As regards the objectives of improving European policy by making it more transparent, the Commission has stated that its objective is to reduce the volume of legislation and to get rid of ineffective legislative acts, which is not the same thing as deregulation."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Commission’s services need greater human and financial resources if it is to enhance its ability to deal with violations."
"I also welcome the creation of coordination points in each Member State for issues relating to transposition, the application of Community law and coordination with national ministries and regional and local authorities."
". Although there is an extraordinary amount of Community law, both in force and at the preparatory stage, sometimes of doubtful need, it is possible to monitor both the transposition stage and the entry into force stage of new law."
"As the report says, it takes the Community institutions, and in particular the Commission, an extraordinary amount of time to monitor the application of European law."
"This is especially regrettable given that it reduces the effectiveness of the mechanism, and deprives it of virtues as important as enabling Member States to honour their obligations within the time allowed."
"Another important aspect of this process is that close monitoring of the difficulties of transposing/applying the law should represent an opportunity to improve the quality of Community law, especially as the process of so doing is already under way, as the report underlines."
". In view of the number of cases in which the transposition of Community law into national law has been delayed or has not taken place at all, the legislator needs to ensure that its application is monitored appropriately, and, more importantly, to simplify it and to ensure that the subsidiarity principle is upheld."
"I feel that the application of Community law will remain inadequate until Community law is made clear and comprehensible, and until the Community as a whole is made easier to understand."
"Without good Community legislation, it will be very difficult to apply Community law properly."
"I warmly welcome the Commission President’s proposal to promote a major drive to cut down the amount of legislation and to make law-making more efficient on the part of the Community’s institutions."
"Sometimes less is more."
". Mr President, I congratulate my group colleague Mrs Frassoni on this excellent report, which while perhaps not the talk of the town nonetheless deals with a crucial area of the Union's competence."
"It contains a number of sensible proposals to make our law making more effective in terms of how it actually affects our citizens, which at this time of increasing scepticism over the workings of the EU is often not paid sufficient attention, and I was pleased to support her today."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this report, albeit while expressing my doubts about the amendment that refers to the Treaty establishing a European Constitution."
"That Treaty was not actually approved, but rather rejected by means of popular referendums in France and the Netherlands, with the leave of Mr Napolitano, the newly elected President of the Italian Republic, who, in his inaugural speech, championed the cause of that Treaty, having forgotten that he was above the parties."
"That Treaty, in fact, was indeed approved by the Italian Parliament, but not unanimously."
"He who declares himself above the parties should not support something that has divided the Italian Parliament."
"I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague, Mr Doorn, on a motion for a resolution of the European Parliament on the application of the principle of subsidiarity."
"The way in which European legislation is applied continually creates a gulf between European integration and the nations."
"It is therefore a matter of urgency to bring about the vitally needed consistency between Community law, its transposition by the Member States and its practical application."
"Any pointless legislation should be repealed, and necessary legislation properly applied."
"I am in favour of the idea of the European Parliament being closely involved in monitoring the application of European law by the Member States."
". Of all the issues raised in this report, the one that deserves the greatest attention is the impact assessment of Community law."
"As I have previously stated, in spite of constant and perhaps excessive amounts of legislative output, it is possible to monitor closely the Community institutions’ legislative output and more importantly the impact thereof."
"This is an area that should always be high on the agenda."
"In this regard, subsidiarity is very much a relevant factor, which, in its broadest form, should be one of the cornerstones of lawmaking in the EU."
"This is perfect for subsidiarity, whereby the needs of each country are catered for, and close links between the authorities and the citizens are maintained."
"That being said, this principle is obviously inappropriate for a great many situations that should be approached at Community level."
"Yet this is also a key feature of this principle."
"I should lastly like to mention the importance of recognising the role of the national parliaments, which is vital to a good legal outcome."
"Without prejudice to the other elements, these are the key elements for better lawmaking."
". As I have said on previous occasions, in addition to having long been a vital requirement and one that ought to be given greater prominence, the subsidiarity principle is a cornerstone that sorts out the true pro-Europeans, those who are loyal, both in word and in deed, to the theme and the motto of the draft Constitutional Treaty – ‘United in Diversity’."
"The EU must give the highest prominence to decision-making at the level closest to the citizens, must assess the new laws it adopts and must ensure that existing laws are simplified on the basis of intelligibility, appropriateness and proportionality."
"I feel that the EU will benefit if it opts to make laws based on quality rather than quantity, and properly involves the national parliaments, and any other directly interested parties, in the process, in such a way that they can make their opinions heard at the appropriate time and can table alternative proposals."
". Mr President, I congratulate Mr Doorn on this report as I believe subsidiarity, properly applied, could make the workings of the EU so much more transparent to the citizen."
"Coming from Scotland, it saddens me that the Scottish Parliament is responsible for so many areas of life yet is effectively shut out of the EU deliberations as the definition of subsidiarity too often effectively stops at the member state capital."
"I believe this report represents a step forward, but we in the EU still have our work to do."
"I voted in favour of the report by my fellow Member, Mrs McCarthy, on a motion for a resolution of the European Parliament on the implementation, consequences and impact of the internal market legislation in force."
"The way in which European law is applied continuously creates a gulf between European integration and the nations."
"It is therefore a matter of urgency to bring about the vitally needed consistency between Community law, its transposition by the Member States and its practical application."
"Any pointless legislation should be repealed, and necessary legislation properly applied."
"I am in favour of the idea of the European Parliament being closely involved in monitoring the application of European law by the Member States."
"Given the problems there are in applying Community law, I also wonder if the time may not have come to consider creating a European body of independent inspectors. Directly attached to the European Union, it would have the task of monitoring the application of Community law in the Member States, and this with a view to ensuring that the internal market operates as it should."
"One of the reasons why European directives and other documents are not applied by EU Member States – a reason that, curiously enough, has not been referred to in any of the reports – has to do, in particular, with the way in which they are adopted."
"Indeed, such non-application is the unfortunate effect of extending qualified majority voting to the Council, as states that have been in a minority in refusing, for reasons of their own, to adopt a text will, quite naturally, have difficulty in applying it within their own territories."
"All this obviously creates genuine legal insecurity for all the institutions, countries and peoples."
"Priority needs to be given, then, not only to rapidly codifying the Community legislation in force but also to defining and limiting the powers of various EU bodies, the European Court of Justice included, which have created such large quantities of law. In that way, the Member States would no longer have to suffer the consequences of too large a number of unduly constricting legal or jurisprudential standards."
". The Commission’s ‘better lawmaking’ initiative is a vital factor in obtaining the trust of EU citizens, consumers and businesses."
"This trust is based on their experience or on their understanding of European law and the impact thereof on their day-to-day lives."
"Accordingly, in the context of the internal market this must be translated into effective, high-quality lawmaking that does not hamper innovation or give rise to unnecessary distortions and costs, in particular for SMEs, the public authorities or voluntary groups."
"Our lawmaking should therefore help to open up trade opportunities for businesses, to broaden the options for consumers and the citizens, and to protect environmental, social and consumer rights."
"If we do not do this, we shall be swimming against the tide, against the Lisbon Strategy, against growth and jobs and against the internal market."
"I therefore voted in favour of the McCarthy report."
"We endorse the repeal of irrelevant and obsolete acts in Community law, the purpose of which is to simplify the regulatory framework, so that decisions are appropriate, clear and effective and do not undermine the subsidiarity principle. I feel that the subsidiarity principle ought to be brought more to the fore in this report so that there are no doubts that it is being upheld throughout the process."
"We trust, however, that this objective will not be used to undermine certain principles that protect the citizens’ fundamental rights, including social rights and workers’ rights."
"We also advocate an amendment of the current interinstitutional agreements governing the quality of EU law."
"We therefore voted in favour of the report, although we have some reservations on some points, and actually oppose others, on account of their ambiguous wording, as has already been mentioned."
". Broadly speaking, I warmly welcome the report we are discussing and voting on, and the Commission communication on which it is based."
"The endeavour to analyse and review the Community’s legislative framework is a proposal that should be promoted with the aim of simplifying the regulatory environment, a vital prerequisite for greater legal certainty for both the citizens and lawyers."
"It also represents an opportunity to simplify the regulatory environment, a crucial factor in the development of economic activity."
"There is one point in the report and the Commission communication with which I do not entirely agree."
"The notion, put forward in both texts, that legislation via regulation is increasingly more virtuous than via directives is not one that I accept."
"On the contrary, despite the difficulties involved in transposing directives, I take the view that they are a means of lawmaking that uphold an idea of Community that I hold dear."
"This view does not mean that I reject regulations or fail to recognise their obvious usefulness."
"I am abstaining from voting."
"There are certainly positive aspects to the report, for example its call for the Council to become more open, but it otherwise focuses too much on growth and reduced costs when it should instead highlight sustainable development and greater cost effectiveness."
"Reducing costs is not an end in itself because it may lead to a constant undermining of public budgets."
"Cost-effectiveness is a better objective."
"It is excellent that useless and harmful legislative texts that contradict other Community provisions or that, above all, are incompatible with the much touted principles of subsidiarity and proportionality can be withdrawn from the legislative world."
"Any satisfaction that might be felt evaporates quickly, however, faced with a description of the exorbitant legislative powers wielded by the Commission."
"This institution – which, I would take this opportunity to point out, has absolutely no democratic or electoral legitimacy – can, as and when it sees fit, withdraw or modify a legislative proposal, inform or not inform Parliament of the reasons for its decision and take account, or not take account, of Parliament’s opinion. In short, it can do what it wishes."
"Worst of all, Parliament is happy with this state of affairs, which it acknowledges."
"Admittedly, it vaguely threatens to censure the Commission in cases where the latter might genuinely go too far."
"We know, however, that, even at the worst moments of the scandals that tarnished the Santer Commission, it has never had the political courage to disown the institution symbolic of the European superstate."
"The fact that a technocracy is exercised with the tacit agreement of a parliamentary assembly does not change the nature of that technocracy."
"We have chosen to abstain in the final vote on this resolution designed to display an opinion."
"Our basic view is that the Council of Ministers should be a stronger political force than the other EU institutions, since the Council of Ministers represents the Member States in an EU that we see as a form of intergovernmental cooperation."
"This means that, in our view too, the Council of Ministers should have the right to put forward legislative proposals, just as the Commission has."
"Nor do we share the view expressed in paragraph B of the draft report, which calls on the Commission to think twice before withdrawing 68 legislative proposals thought not to be in keeping with the objectives of, for example, the principles designed to produce better legislation."
"We believe, as a matter of straightforward principle, that it is good for the Commission to try to slim down its huge catalogue of legislative proposals at EU level."
". The issue raised by the communication before us deserves a broader scope and should not be confined to the issue of legal basis and the Commission’s limits on the withdrawal of legislative proposals."
"I feel that the main issue before us is that the previous situation led to a range of legislative processes in a state of limbo that no longer had any reason to exist, but that had also not been repealed."
"In addition to a debate on the powers of the different institutions, what is needed is an investigation into what is routine and bureaucratic in the Community’s legislative procedures."
"What is more, the fact that between them Parliament and the Council have more than 500 documents awaiting the attention of the legislators is an issue that is worthy of our attention and concern."
"The EU does not need to legislate a great deal in order to be relevant."
"What it needs to do is to legislate well in order to be useful."
"The next item on the agenda is the Commission’s statement on the report on progress made by Bulgaria and Romania in the enlargement process."
". Mr President, I am delighted to have the opportunity to present to you today the results of our assessment of Bulgaria’s and Romania’s preparations for accession and I look forward to discussing this with you."
"I would like to thank Parliament, in particular its Committee on Foreign Affairs, the chairman Mr Brok and the rapporteurs Mr Van Orden and Mr Moscovici for their contribution to this important exercise."
"I very much appreciate the concerted spirit of our frequent discussions on this subject."
"As you know, the decision that the Commission has taken today is the result of an extensive process of review and dialogue with all the major stakeholders."
"The starting point of our approach is that the European Union must honour existing commitments."
"At the same time, we need to be rigorous as regards the criteria to be met by acceding countries."
"I should like to make a few brief remarks before, with your permission, giving the floor to Mr Rehn, who will comment in more detail on the Commission’s findings in the monitoring report."
"Since October, the Governments of Bulgaria and Romania have worked extremely hard to deliver on their outstanding commitments."
"They have continued to make progress in their preparation for membership."
"Let us give credit where it is due."
"However, there are still some important issues which need to be addressed."
"I would highlight, in particular, the need for further progress in the area of justice and home affairs."
"The Commission considers that Romania and Bulgaria should be ready for membership by 1 January 2007, provided that they address a number of outstanding issues in the course of the next month."
"Let me first turn to the situation in judicial reforms and the fight against corruption."
"We expect any acceding country to have in place a fully functioning judicial system equipped to fight corruption and organised crime."
"This is of paramount importance, since it underpins the functioning of the whole society and the economy."
"Both countries have shown determination to undertake the necessary remaining reforms and our reports give them full credit for the results already achieved."
"Bulgaria still needs to demonstrate clear evidence of results in the fight against corruption, in particular high-level corruption, notably in terms of investigations and subsequent judicial proceedings."
"It also needs to further reform the judiciary and remove any ambiguity regarding its independence."
"We also expect Bulgaria to step up efforts on the investigation of organised crime networks."
"Romania needs to continue its efforts and demonstrate further results in the fight against corruption, notably in terms of further investigations and subsequent judicial proceedings."
"It needs to consolidate the implementation of the ongoing judicial reforms."
"Turning to the level of alignment of Bulgaria and Romania with the , we have registered further progress."
"However, we still have serious concerns about a few sectors: agriculture and food safety, justice and home affairs and public finance."
"Any acceding country needs to be in a position to implement the European Union policies properly upon accession."
"The rules of the club must be respected."
"We expect Bulgaria and Romania to take immediate corrective action in those problematic sectors."
"No later than early October, we will review the situation with those outstanding issues."
"On that basis, the Commission will consider whether it is still possible to adhere to the accession date of 1 January 2007."
"It is practicable for the two countries to be ready in 2007, but they must take decisive action."
"At the same time, the European Union needs to give a clear signal that it stands ready to honour its commitments."
"That is crucial, in order to keep up the momentum."
"Practical preparations for accession need to continue."
"I count on the support of all governments and parliaments that still need to complete their procedures to ratify the accession treaty."
"Our approach is based on strict conditionality and adherence to undertakings."
"That approach has allowed us to gain strength and confidence from each enlargement."
"Like the previous enlargements, especially that in 2004, the forthcoming enlargement will be a success."
"Enlargement has always been Europe’s response to strategic challenges and history has shown that this response has been the proper one."
"Time and again, it has been accompanied by a dynamism that has given the enlarged Europe a greater capacity to make its mark in the world."
"In the situation in which we find ourselves today, it is more important than ever to preserve the spirit of openness and ambition that has always inspired us to press ahead with the construction of Europe."
"That is precisely why Commissioner Rehn and I have decided to go to Bucharest today and Sofia tomorrow to explain these issues and give the two countries a clear message of encouragement."
". Mr President, on 1 May we celebrated the second anniversary of the latest enlargement."
"Looking at the past two years, we have every reason to be satisfied and proud, even though at the time there was no lack of doomsday scenarios."
"Yet the Cassandras have been proven wrong."
"We can succeed equally well in the cases of Bulgaria and Romania."
"Both countries are working hard to tackle the remaining shortcomings to fully meet the criteria of accession."
"The Commission’s duty is to assess the progress made by the two countries to see if they are truly ready for accession."
"It is our goal to welcome Bulgaria and Romania as members in 2007 and it is our duty, as the guardian of the Treaties, to ensure that once they join they really meet the conditions."
"Hence, when we last met in late April, I promised you a carefully calibrated decision that maintains the momentum of reforms up to and beyond accession."
"Now you have such a decision: Bulgaria and Romania may join in January 2007 on condition that they show the necessary resolve, mentality and results in tackling the outstanding shortcomings."
"By early October, we will report on their progress and consider whether the date can be maintained."
"Bulgaria and Romania have indeed undergone a monitoring process that is unprecedented in its scope and intensity."
"Concerning the political criteria, while much has been achieved, there is still room for further progress."
"It is necessary effectively to implement the reform of the judiciary and to reinforce the fight against corruption, particularly at high level."
"Bulgaria needs seriously to intensify its efforts to crack down on organised crime and corruption."
"It also needs to demonstrate clear evidence of results in the fight against corruption, in terms of investigations and judicial proceedings."
"Building on the progress made so far, Romania needs to continue its efforts and show further results in the fight against corruption."
"In the area of human rights and the rights of minorities, further efforts are needed by both Bulgaria and Romania."
"On the economic criteria, the transformation of the two countries is a remarkable success that is a win-win situation for everybody in Europe."
"Both countries have registered robust growth in the last years, creating a zone of much-needed economic dynamism at our south-eastern corner."
"As to the , our legal order, significant progress has been achieved and most of the areas are unproblematic, provided that the current pace of preparations is maintained."
"However, in some areas the preparations require increased efforts, and we also have certain issues of serious concern."
"Unless the countries take immediate and decisive corrective action, they will not be ready in these areas of serious concern at the envisaged date of accession."
"Since October last year, the areas of serious concern have been brought down from 16 to 6 in Bulgaria and from 14 to 4 in Romania."
"They still include certain agricultural, food safety and veterinary issues, as well as the control and management of EU funds."
"Should these serious concerns persist, we would not hesitate to use all our remedial tools."
"Our report specifies the safeguards and other protective measures under the existing legislation that we have at our disposal."
"These safeguards could be invoked if certain limited problems persist at accession in the areas, for instance, of the internal market and justice and home affairs, where we can also establish a monitoring mechanism based on the Accession Treaty."
"On the use of EU money, the will require a suspension of payments in case of serious problems."
"In agriculture, we even propose novel, stricter measures, based on the Accession Treaty That sends a strong signal that we are careful with our money."
"I trust that today’s carefully calibrated decision and its rigour will convince the national parliaments that have not yet ratified the Accession Treaty to do so."
"The Treaty itself includes the conditions, safeguards and monitoring mechanisms that ensure the countries can join only once they are ready, and that once they have joined, they must respect their obligations as members."
"Let me express our appreciation for the support of the European Parliament for the accession process of Bulgaria and Romania."
"As agreed between President Barroso and President Borrell last year, we have listened carefully to your views before presenting our position on whether or not to postpone the accessions."
"I am sure this constructive, transparent and rigorous approach will bring the best results for Bulgaria and Romania, and for Europe."
". – Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by assuring the Commission of how much I appreciate the presence of its President and, of course, of the responsible Commissioner, when such an important issue is being debated."
"The chairmen of the Groups are here, as are the Members of this House – there could be more of them, but today’s turnout is more or less acceptable."
"I cannot fail to observe, though, that there is nobody here to represent the Council of Ministers, any more than there was when the President of the Palestinian Authority was speaking, and I do not think it is acceptable that the Council should fail to be represented at such an important debate."
"I would encourage you, Mr President – and this has to do not only with the presidency, and it is not only they whom I am addressing, for this is also a matter for the General Secretariat of the Council – to use your influence on the Council to get them to actually be present for such important debates."
"You, Mr President, will have our support if you press this point home as clearly as possible to the Council, to its General Secretariat, and also to the presidency."
"Moving on to the matter in hand, Bulgaria and Romania are on their way into the European Union."
"We look forward to their arrival, and I would just like to say something by way of appreciation."
"The impression has been given in many quarters that we – the existing European Union of 25 States – are the ones from whom they have to learn."
"What a colossal effort it must have involved for Romania and Bulgaria to undo the damage done by 45 years of mismanagement under Communist dictatorship in order to become democratic states under the rule of law; we should, for once, acknowledge what a long road these countries have had to travel."
"Whilst we often – and often quite rightly – criticise the administration we have at every level in the European Union and in our own Member States, I would like say what a great benefit it is that the systems of administration we have in the European Union and in our Member States are founded upon law, so that it is possible, through the justice system, to contest any administrative measure or any action by an official."
"Nothing of the sort exists in the former Communist countries, and that is something they will have to develop."
"It is for that reason that it is so important that we should develop a legal system with the character of a state under the rule of law, and that will demand an enormous effort."
"To the governments, the parliaments and the people – not least in Bulgaria and Romania – I have to say that they should not take our debate and our concerns about the lack of progress as an indication of our desire to teach them a lesson; on the contrary, we want to work together to make the accession of Romania and Bulgaria a success for us all – for the two countries themselves and for the European Union as a whole."
"While we are not questioning the data, I do think that you, Mr Barroso and Mr Rehn, are well advised to say that we want to encourage both countries to address the remaining deficits by way of legislation and practical implementation in such a way – although they will be unable to get everything out of the way in the next few months – that we can hope, in the autumn, to be able to tell them, with a good conscience, that they will be welcome on 1 January 2007."
"That is why your decision – which we endorse – is an astute one and one that gives these two countries the encouragement to continue down the road on which they have set foot."
"Today, everything fits together."
"It also has to be pointed out that the people of the present European Union have their worries about this too; they have not yet quite got used to our now being a community of twenty-five members."
"Ten countries joined us on 1 May 2004."
"We have to take a positive line on this with our citizens and say that having Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and of course Malta and Cyprus too, joining us was a massive success, for the rule of law, democracy and the social market economy have prevailed in these countries, and that helps to keep the whole European continent stable."
"That is what we need to tell our people, rather than always focusing only on the criticisms and challenges, and it is on this basis that we still have a lot of work to do in order to enhance approval of the European Union."
"Over the past few months, this House – and I think, even though we must always be capable of criticising ourselves, we can take a bit of pride in this – has achieved a great deal, in the shape of the great compromise on the services directive, followed by the adoption of the Financial Perspective, to which we had managed to make significant improvements, but there is still more to be done, in that, where the REACH chemicals legislation is concerned, we must succeed in achieving a balance between economic and environmental considerations."
"Today, we discussed with Commissioner Wallström – who spoke on behalf of the whole Commission and indeed of its President – the most important matter for concern, second only to the improvement of the European Union’s political and psychological environment, which is that we should not allow there to be any doubt about the fact that the majority in the European Parliament wants the constitutional treaty to become a reality, and it wants that because we need the constitution if the European Union is to have ground rules for decisions and common values to bind us together."
"I hope that the Commission will take all that into consideration."
"Mr Barroso, I think it a good thing that you should have come to your decision today and then, immediately, justified it to the European Parliament."
"Tomorrow, you travel to Romania and Bulgaria."
"I hope that you have a good journey and that we can all share in a good European future."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, am glad that the President of the Commission has joined us today, for his presence here underlines the importance of the debate, and the reason why it underlines the importance of the debate is that what we are debating is important."
"The dramatic nature of the decision that we will have to take, that the Council will have to take, and that you have yet to take, not only in terms of its internal effect, but also of its effect on the two countries we are discussing is not to be underestimated."
"We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the social democrats in this House, stand by the wish that we have expressed, namely that, if there are no major obstacles, then 1 January 2007 should be the accession date for Bulgaria and Romania."
"That was, and still remains, our position, and I note that the President was very precise in the way he expressed it in his speech, saying that the Commission was working on the basis that the two countries should be ready for accession to the EU on 1 January 2007."
"Now you, Mr Rehn, and you, Mr Barroso, have chosen to express yourselves in forms of words that indicate the presence of deficits – deficits that you have described superficially rather than naming them one by one."
"If you are now, after seven years, going to travel to Sofia and Bucharest, then I have some good advice to give you: it is that, when you get there, you should use more precise language when talking to the governments there about what you have told this House, describing exactly where the deficits are to be found, and saying precisely what you expect by way of improvements, for that is the only way in which the governments there will have a chance of doing what they have already been doing, namely working hard to ensure that all the criteria expected and demanded of them are actually met."
"To do so is only fair, for, as you yourself – both the President and the Commissioner – have said, these governments are doing a great deal."
"The process of transformation that these countries have undergone – and this is where I agree with Mr Poettering – has been going on for all of one and a half decades and has made great demands on people."
"Now, in the final stage, when we need to take account of the hopes of the people of Bulgaria and Romania, of their hope that they will be able to join the European Union, this is a time when great precision is of the essence."
"We can accept what you – Mr Barroso and Commissioner Rehn – have said, but by saying it, you are shouldering a great responsibility, and so I want to spell out in no uncertain terms what that responsibility is."
"You will be telling the governments in Sofia and Bucharest which criteria have yet to be met."
"You will be describing what is to be demanded of them, and you have talked to us in terms of an October date."
"What that means, then, is that you, in October, will have to tell the Council and the European Parliament in very precise terms whether or not you think these things are as they should be, and, if they are not, then by the logic of your own argument the decision ought to be different from what you, today, expect."
"You are thereby taking upon yourself a great responsibility, and I want, today, to again impress upon you what that responsibility is."
"It is for that reason that today’s debate is a very weighty one and one to be taken seriously."
"Bulgaria and Romania are indeed to become Member States of the European Union, and we social democrats would like them to accede on 1 January 2007."
"We are well aware of the improvements that have yet to be made."
"We are confident that these countries can make them, so that the deadline can be met."
"We take it as read that you will keep a watchful eye on them as they do so."
"There is, though, one thing I would like to add: it is that this is not just about accession, any more than it is just about the treaties on the basis of which they will accede."
"We also need to consider why this accession is so important in the historical context."
"These two countries, constituting the Black Sea Region, have made enormous advances."
"Quite apart from the things you so rightly criticise, both Romania and Bulgaria have stabilised to an enormous degree, and this stability on the borders of the European Union is of great significance, for this region is also bordered by others that are also our neighbours and which are far from being as stable as we would wish them to be."
"It follows that we have a vested interest in these countries achieving stability – economic, social, political and cultural stability – as Member States of the European Union, and so, the sooner they meet the criteria, the sooner they will be ready for accession, and the better it will be for all concerned – not only for the countries in question, but also for the European Union."
"The social democrats in the European Parliament have taken note of what the Commission has proposed; although we regard its approach as acceptable, we would advise you to be more precise in Bucharest and Sofia than you have been today."
"What we would like to see is both countries fulfilling the criteria in such a way that they will be able, on 1 January 2007, to become Members of our Union."
". – Mr President, I would like to pay tribute to Commissioner Rehn for his balanced and thorough assessment and his competent handling of this dossier."
"I also commend Anca Boagiu and Meglena Kuneva and their predecessors as Ministers for EU Integration for their unstinting hard work."
"The author Mark Twain observed, ‘We can change the world or ourselves, but the latter is more difficult’."
"Tearing down the Berlin Wall was the easy part."
"Building a new democratic culture takes much longer."
"But the bricks of effort and the mortar of persistence are working."
"The decision to proceed in 2007, with appropriate provisos, is the right one."
"The Commission should not, in my group’s view, revisit its decision in the autumn, except in the gravest of circumstances."
"We are concerned that Romania and Bulgaria should be judged no more or less harshly than previous newcomers."
"Our monitoring must be in line with current treaty provisions and legislation in force."
"We therefore take very seriously the Commission’s expression of serious concern about continuing corruption and failure of the rule of law – areas which need urgent further action."
"Ill treatment of Romany people, too, continues to offend, which is why the Decade of Roma Inclusion launched by six heads of state and government is so important."
"In many other areas the Commission identifies failings."
"These must be put right without delay."
"But accession cannot be an examination in which candidates fail. For failure would be at least as much a failure of the Union as of the candidate states."
"What is most important to the health of a society is the direction in which its face is set."
"Bulgaria and Romania are looking and moving in the right direction."
"Can that be said of all current Member States?"
"Imagine, colleagues, that last autumn Romania’s Interior Minister had proposed detention of suspects for three months without charge or that the Bulgarian Prime Minister had used the secret services to spy on his colleagues."
"There would have been outrage."
"My group has always been wary of those who would pander to the fashionable anxiety about enlargement, making strangers of peoples who will soon be fellow citizens."
"I was delighted, therefore, to hear that Mr Poettering has defied some in his own party and thrown his weight firmly behind future enlargement."
"It gives added salience to his group’s decision to meet last week in a city called Split."
"I appeal to the faint hearts on the right to look at what has been achieved."
"Has not enlargement been the European Union’s greatest success story, its crown jewels?"
"Commissioner Spidla’s report on transitional arrangements shows that enlargement has brought more jobs and higher economic growth, particularly in those countries that gave open access to their labour markets."
"But far beyond economic considerations, welcoming new Members has enriched the culture of our Union."
"Bulgaria and Romania will be treasured assets, if only we give them half a chance."
"It seems that many of their people believe it is all a matter for government."
"On the contrary, winning the war against crime and corruption is a matter for each and every citizen."
"So I urge all Bulgarians and Romanians to work together with government to ensure the best possible outcome and avoid any delay to entry, not least because reform demanded to join the Union is the means to raise standards of living, quality of life, and security at home."
"I urge all colleagues in this House to show solidarity and demonstrate to the Bulgarians and the Romanians that they do not walk alone."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I did not know that my fellow MEPs, Mr Watson and Mr Poettering, embraced the attitude of young people of my son’s age who, when there is a problem, can be relied on to say: ‘but everything will be all right; really, it will’."
"For years, we get the same reply on the subject of enlargement: ‘but everything will be all right; really, it will’."
"I, for my part, hope that it will indeed be all right."
"The only thing is, Mr Schulz, that responsibility has not been accepted by the Commission alone. It is you too who accepted responsibility when, a year ago, you decided in favour of enlargement when we all knew at the time that neither Romania nor Bulgaria was ready for this enlargement."
"It is you, then, and not only the Commission, who has accepted this responsibility."
"So, stand to your responsibilities."
"– Or, to put it in German, Do as you have promised!"
"You share responsibility for this!"
"Because what is in the process of being done today is too easy."
"It is too easy."
"I have read what the Commission has said and repeated: Progress has to be made in various quarters."
"Mr Watson, what you say about Germany is true, but what ought to be said about Poland is just as true: Mr Haider is a democrat in comparison with a figure like Mr Lepper, who is a notorious racist, anti-Semite and homophobe."
"Today, it is in Europe – and, more specifically, in Poland – that a far-right government is in power."
"What has this Parliament, which rightly criticised Austria, said to denounce Poland?"
"Nothing."
"It no longer dares to say anything where enlargement countries are concerned."
"I am going to tell you something very simple."
"I am in favour of enlargement."
"I am for enlarging Europe!"
"Not, however, in just any old way."
"Otherwise, the time will come when we shall make the Balkan countries and Turkey pay for our attitude towards Bulgaria and Romania."
"Why should they be made to pay?"
"The fact is, it is not a question of rejecting Romania."
"It is not a question of rejecting Bulgaria."
"It is simply a question of saying that, at the present time, neither Bulgaria nor Romania can be integrated, given the prevailing situation in those countries."
"Instead of talking constantly of monitoring, you should state that these countries will be integrated into the EU in 2008 and you should introduce programmes that will genuinely make it possible to integrate the Roma, or travellers, into Romania and Bulgaria."
"Last week, I was in a Roma quarter."
"What I saw there was unbelievable."
"You are going to integrate these countries and have allocated funds to finance these programmes."
"What has happened to the money?"
"Ask the Bulgarian Government what has happened to the money."
"Please do so."
"It will be unable to reply to you."
"What it will say is that it has promulgated a new law."
"Making new laws is a very good thing to do."
"What, however, I, for my part, want to see is a change to the situation on the ground."
"That is why it is not enough to say that we are in favour of enlargement or that we are good Christians or good Jews or people who care about the world."
"No; the world has to change."
"The fact is, the attitude you have is not one that will cause the world to change."
"There is therefore a need to be clearer and more precise: yes to enlargement, but not on just any terms."
"Although it has the necessary instruments at its disposal, the Commission is not helping us enough."
". – I would advise my fellow Member to look at the integration of the Roma in Italy, and the integration of minorities in other Member States, in the old Member States and then to talk further, without interruption – perhaps."
"Ladies and gentlemen, when the then French and German leaders, President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl, decided in 1990 to address the countries of Central, Southern and Eastern Europe, they said: ‘Welcome to a European Union free of borders."
"We are inviting you to participate in a common project that is open to all the countries of Europe."
"We want to assist you in catching up rapidly with our technical standards and with bringing your legal norms into line with those of the other states.’"
"Several years later in Copenhagen three conditions were passed, which the states interested in joining the EU would have to fulfil."
"The economic component of the Copenhagen criteria is obscure and is usually interpreted as including acceptance into the WTO (World Trade Organisation), as well as an EU Association Agreement."
"The political component talks of the peaceful settling of relations with neighbouring states and of the politics of nationalities."
"That is something the old EU Member States have yet to master."
"In 1993 there was still no talk of selling off national assets, of liquidation quotas for agricultural products, or of the dismantling of nuclear power stations."
"The one fundamental requirement at that time was not to undermine conditions for the exchange of goods between the candidate countries and the EU."
"At the time, the Commission opened negotiations with 12 states."
"The negotiating agenda was technically broken up into 29 chapters, a section headed ‘Various’ and a section headed ‘Institutions’."
"After the end of negotiations, two years ago, 10 states were accepted as members."
"Up to this day there are some conditions – for example, those for drawing on funds – that have yet to be finalised for them."
"Their terms of accession include a whole series of discriminatory measures, and the fact is that these have been very poorly evaluated, especially in the areas of agriculture and the food industry."
"The inequality between the inhabitants of the old and the new Member States is all too apparent."
"We find ourselves today in a curious situation."
"An entire agenda has been negotiated with Bulgaria and Romania, there has been agreement on all of the chapters, and now a new set of strange and discriminatory measures are appearing."
"These involve restitution demands, the dismantling of modern generator plants at the Kozloduj power station and unequal terms for agriculture and the food industry."
"People talk of corruption, of reforming the judiciary, of the situation of children, human trafficking and so on. Everything that applies to the old states applies to the new states."
"I understand the fanatical opponents of nuclear power."
"It is clear to me that their views will not change and that they could not care less about the energy situation in the Balkans."
"What surprises me is the position of Italy and Greece."
"They rely on Kozloduj for some of their power supplies."
"This means that after the plant has been shut down, Italy will be more dependent on imports from France and other countries."
"How will Greece make up for the missing power?"
"Probably by burning more coal, regardless of agreements made under the Kyoto Protocol."
"They can always purchase emission permits."
"As for the Bulgarians, they will just have to burn candles, as the power station at Belene is still in the early stages of planning, unless the European Commission perhaps has another environmentally-friendly but workable solution."
"Just think for a moment, please, and try to explain how the EU is really contributing to the development of these two countries."
"Perhaps it is simply a matter of ensuring that they are not accepted into the Union on reasonable terms?"
"My group is wholly in favour of their being accepted within the deadline of 1 July 2007."
". Mr President, the two Dutch Protestant parties for which I can speak in this House have been consistently in favour of healing Europe’s post-war division."
"At the same time, we have always advocated a solid enlargement of the European Union, and hence an emphatic enforcement of the recognised accession criteria, the well-known Copenhagen criteria."
"We were saddened by the fact that Romania and Bulgaria were unable to join in 2004 during the Union’s biggest enlargement round in history."
"After all, following the revolution of Europe’s magic year of 1989, church and civil-society contacts were strengthened between our grassroots support and both candidate countries."
"We could, at the same time, completely relate to the delay of 2004."
"How do we feel about the two present accession dates of 1 January 2007 and 1 January 2008, respectively?"
"As I already said, my party is in favour of the ‘solid’ accession of Sofia and Bucharest, that is to say on the basis of a separate assessment for Bulgaria and Romania."
"The word ‘solid’ refers to facts and actual steps of reform rather than intentions."
"Finally, it was not for nothing that the Council and Commission added two specific safeguard clauses to the three regular clauses in the accession treaties with Bulgaria and Romania."
"This also mirrors our message to the Commission."
"We would like a clear signal in October about Bulgaria’s and Romania’s readiness to accede on 1 January 2007, for such clarity will be to the benefit of all parties in Europe."
". Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his presentation and congratulate him on his work on this very difficult topic, one on which I have had many discussions with him in the recent past."
"I would firstly like to make my key point and then we can discuss the wider issue."
"With regard to Romania and the situation of children in Romanian institutions, orphanages and foster homes, more work needs to be done; more action needs to be taken to treat those children as individual human beings with human rights."
"If sometimes that means allowing for international adoptions, then that should be the case."
"I know of many parents in Ireland who are willing to and wish to adopt children from Romania, especially children with mental and physical disabilities, and want to bring them to loving and caring homes in Ireland, but because of the difficulties they run into major problems."
"So I would ask the Romanian authorities to look at that again."
"However, we are back to where we are because of the statement from the Commission today and also because of the underhand moves taking place in certain capitals around Europe to try to prevent or slow down the accession of Bulgaria and Romania."
"Let us not forget that this is not just about those two countries living up to commitments that they made to us under the Copenhagen criteria and under their accession agreements."
"It is also up to us to live up to our commitments."
"We held out the hope and the desire and the wish that those countries could become part of the European Union."
"The first time we said to them: no, you are not ready, you cannot come in with the ten other countries on 1 May 2004; you have more work to do."
"They have progressed greatly in the recent past in changing laws, in amending systems that are decades old, to try and bring about a more realistic approach."
"It is now up to us to be generous in our praise of those countries, to give them genuine encouragement and not lectures on how their systems should operate, to give them our experience with the open method of coordination, under which you look at practices in other countries and take the best of them and try to achieve the best possible result."
"We all know what the basics are."
"The basics are the rule of law, the rule of democracy, the separation of powers, the rights of the individual and human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"Everything else can be sorted out by simple legislation."
"At one stage people said that politics is not that important."
"Politics is important because it affects people’s lives."
"We in this Chamber are often criticised for not being radical enough in our opinions and our viewpoints."
"What we need to do today is not just to tell the Governments of Bulgaria and Romania to continue with the work they are doing and achieve the goal they are trying to achieve; not only should we speak to the governments of our own countries and say they must be clear and even-handed and give a real response to those countries; we must speak directly to the citizens and the people of Bulgaria and Romania and say to them that within the European Union they have a home, they have a right, they have an entitlement, and we will defend those rights and those entitlements for them."
"– Mr President, there is no doubt about the fact that ending the European division by welcoming into the European Union those countries that had, for decades, suffered under the Communist yoke, was a great and historic accomplishment."
"It has to be said, though, that the justified concerns and fears of the European public have for far too long been taken insufficiently seriously, so that the mechanism of enlargement has been, so to speak, put in place without reference to them."
"The current debate about the various scenarios involving Bulgaria and Romania – with their deferments and means of exerting pressure – is the consequence of what I regard as an ill-starred development."
"If you are honest, you have to concede that it was in fact the inclusion of a rigid timetable in last year’s accession treaties that laid the foundation for our present dilemma, for it was only the prospect of accession that spurred Bulgaria and Romania on to renewed exertions in the hope of being accepted into the EU, so we have yet again denied ourselves the opportunity of exerting influence on prospective members in order to make them as well prepared as possible."
"While it is not a matter for doubt that Romania and Bulgaria belong to the European family of peoples, these countries cannot be expected to resolve their manifold problems – such as corruption and organised crime – within the space of a few months."
"It is in the interests not only of the European Union, but also of the peoples of both candidate countries, that their accessions should not be overhasty, for, if they are, so that conditions in them are painted in the best possible light, then there is plenty of evidence from the past that it is the people in the accession countries who will end up footing the bill."
"The intention is, no doubt, that the accession of Romania and Bulgaria should complete the reunification of Europe, but both countries must really be ready for accession, and ready for Europe."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, enlargement is the most successful of the EU’s policies, and much of the peace, stability, freedom and prosperity that we enjoy is attributable to it, but it can work only if it is conducted in accordance with proper rules, or else it will have an inherent tendency to unravel and the whole exercise will be doomed."
"I have to say to Mr Watson – although he is no longer here – that my party has always argued in favour of enlargement, and that my own country, unlike the United Kingdom, has never asked for a rebate in order to fund it."
"I would, however, like to say that action of the kind that the Commission is proposing will satisfy the requirements of the Treaty."
"If conditions laid down as binding in the accession treaties are not met, then the application of these rules does not amount to discrimination against a country, but is nothing other than the fulfilment of an agreement between the contracting parties."
"Reading, as I do, about the major problems that there are with corruption and organised crime, about the considerable differences that there are between the two countries, and looking closely at what the Commission has had to say about this, which is to the effect that Romania should press on with its efforts at consolidation, while Bulgaria has yet to produce any evidence of doing anything at all on this front, it strikes me that this is an important communication, and here we must act on the basis of ‘everyone on their own merits’."
"The second thing to be said is that we can make European funds available only if the structures in these countries are so organised that the money can get to its intended recipients in a way that will pass muster with the Court of Auditors."
"Until such time as they fulfil this requirement we have a problem on our hands."
"Reference has been made to a number of other similar examples, but always with considerable differences evident between the two countries."
"I would like to encourage the Commission to put the proposal into effect with the utmost rigour, to review the situation between now and October, and to give the countries in question a chance to address the specific deficiencies that they have."
"I hope that they will take this in a constructive spirit, thus making it possible for a better report to be submitted in October, failing which the relevant safeguard clause will be put into effect in the manner provided for in the Treaty."
"I would like to remind the Commission of this, and to congratulate them on the report they have submitted."
"– Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Rehn, firstly, I should like sincerely to thank Mr Rehn, whose work as Commissioner for Enlargement is appreciated by us all for its rigour, good sense and thoroughness."
"Thanks to him and to the work he has done, cooperation between the European Parliament and the Commission and between the European institutions and the Romanian and Bulgarian authorities has been effective and fruitful."
"The process of Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession is now reaching a crucial stage: that at which our institutions have to take a decision confirming or, instead, postponing the date – initially set at 1 January 2007 – on which these two candidate countries are to join the European Union."
"I endorse the spirit of Mr Rehn’s report. As in the past, the tendency is to favour accession in 2007, but accession subject to precise conditions."
"I have been pointing out for many months that our friendship for Romania and Bulgaria and our support for the process of their accession always goes hand in hand with a precise demand, namely that there be respect for the criteria and for the reforms needed if the countries concerned are to move towards accession."
"However, I would go further than Mr Barroso and Mr Rehn regarding the judgment to be made today concerning the outcome of the efforts made by these countries to respond to our demands."
"Indeed, I firmly believe that, only seven months before the anticipated accession date of 1 January 2007, it is our duty finally and clearly to confirm this date or say that it no longer applies."
"Moreover, I am now, unlike Mr Cohn-Bendit, entirely convinced that this date should be confirmed."
"In expressing a more precise opinion on Romania in my capacity as European Parliament rapporteur, I have on several occasions had the opportunity to state that, in my opinion, the postponement clause should only be regarded as a last resort and emergency measure."
"I have on many occasions pointed out in this Chamber how dangerous it would be for us to trivialise this clause or to use it as a pretext for drawing attention to a variety of real concerns and one-off causes of dissatisfaction, so rather losing sight of the overall picture."
"I do not think that that is what is happening now."
"The Commission’s report emphasises that Romania now satisfies the political criteria and those to do with the market economy and that the has continued diligently to be applied, although, admittedly, there remain a number of points in relation to which the country will have to make further progress."
"The Commission’s recommendations in this connection are valuable and must be put into practice."
"However, the report published today leaves me feeling certain that the country’s current situation is not so significantly wanting that a measure as radical as a postponement of the accession date would be the appropriate response."
"As for less serious concerns, the oral question that I submitted together with Mr van Orden and Mr Brok was designed to promote the other safeguard clauses of a quite different, and clearly less dramatic, nature."
"They offer the possibility of more continuous, sustained yet still very stringent monitoring, if need be accompanied by sanctions during the first three years following Romania’s accession to the European Union, and it would be the job of these clauses to respond to the various concerns that might remain regarding specific points."
"I also think it important to emphasise now what the cost would be of hesitating too long about giving a clear yes or no to Romania’s accession on 1 January 2007."
"May was set as the deadline by which the European institutions had to take a decision on the date for Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession, and that seemed wise to me. I still think it is wise."
"Postponing accession would present practical problems."
"The time allocated to ratifying the accession treaty would be restricted and would perhaps even be too short."
"The debate on enlargement would become still more tense."
"That is why, while keenly appreciating the rigour of the work done by the Commissioner for Enlargement and while concurring with his analyses and demands, I propose that we proceed on the basis of this work and of the very encouraging results that he emphasises and finally formulate our clear agreement to, and support for, Romania’s accession on 1 January 2007 on the conditions specified by the Commissioner."
"Mr President, I am delighted that I do not have to play cards against Mr Rehn, because he holds his cards so close to his chest and plays his trump card – his last card – at the very last minute!"
"Mercifully, in this instance, he is playing the cards on behalf of Romania and Bulgaria."
"He is willing them to win and it is absolutely clear that they are going to do so."
"I am confident that 1 January 2007 will be D-Day – delivery day – for Romania and Bulgaria, when they will receive full membership of the European Union."
"In fact, I am so confident that on 31 December 2006 I shall be buying my ticket to Bucharest in Romania."
"I want to thank and pay tribute to Fokion Fotiadis and to Jonathan Scheele, who succeeded him at the Commission delegation in Bucharest, to Mr Rehn himself and to Mr Verheugen, his predecessor."
"They have taken up the task of working hard to get both countries into the Union, fighting corruption and human trafficking, addressing all the different issues regarding the free market, the rule of law and transparency: everything that has been mentioned so many times over the last six and a half years that is now coming true."
"It is a hugely exciting moment."
"I am so pleased to have been able to work alongside several Romanian prime ministers, including the current Prime Minister, Mr Tariceanu, several presidents, including the current Head-of-State, President Basescu, as well as a huge variety of Members of Parliament."
"Here today in the Distinguished Visitors’ Gallery are Alin Teodorescu, as well as the Secretary of State for Adoptions, Theodora Bertzi, Gabriela Coman, responsible for child protection, and, of course, the Minister for Europe, Mrs Boagiu."
"All are so welcome and now they are to become our permanent brothers and sisters inside the Union."
"Inevitably, there are problems."
"The geographical location of both countries makes them vulnerable, particularly to trafficking, from eastern Europe especially and from Russia."
"Romania and Bulgaria were highlighted in the UN human trafficking report last week."
"It is true that there is more to be done and there always will be more to be done, but within moments they will be here beside us and they will be full members."
"I thank the Commissioner for all his work."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the Commission’s conclusions where Romania is concerned."
"Since that country has indeed made substantial progress over the past year, a case can be made for it to accede in 2007."
"That is why it would be wise to do a kind of final check in the autumn and that it would be very wise, following its accession, to closely monitor it to ensure that this progress that we have seen is also taking hold, although I must say that the sanctions for non-compliance are not very impressive."
"I also agree with the Commission’s reports where Bulgaria is concerned, because that country is not so much enjoying substantial progress as it is steeped in substantial problems, particularly where the fight against organised crime and corruption are concerned."
"That is why I do not yet agree with the Commission’s conclusions about Bulgaria."
"I think it is unfair to lump Romania and Bulgaria together and to say that 2007 is feasible for Bulgaria too."
"I have to say to the Commission that, if it takes its own reports seriously, then I do not believe that those weighty problems that it has flagged in them can be resolved in five months’ time."
"I am in favour of coming clean at this stage and saying to Bulgaria that, regrettably, they will not be able to join until 2008."
"I can see the Commission’s political dilemma, because there is no majority for this option in the Council, the body to which the Commission issues an opinion, but I think it unfair to lump Romania and Bulgaria together until the last moment."
"Why is it so wise and why would it be good to draw a distinction between the countries based on their own achievements?"
"This is about sending out a message, not only to our own people, but also to new candidate countries such as Croatia and Turkey."
"The message should be that it makes a difference whether you carry out reforms or not."
"If you carry them out, it pays off, if you do not, as is the case in Bulgaria, then penalties follow."
"At the moment, it very much looks like it does not matter what you do, and that the decision for accession depends on internal developments in the EU, opinion polls and votes, rather than on the candidates’ achievements."
"The lesson we should learn from this procedure is never to mention any more dates, for that then takes the pressure off."
"If there is cause for any doubt, we would be better off not mentioning a deferral date and we should not give the candidate countries any guarantees to the effect that they will be able to join if they meet the conditions."
"If they fail to live up to this, they will have to live with the consequences."
"Mr President, the pioneers of the European Union started with six states, mainly under the direct sphere of influence of Brussels and Strasbourg."
"Nobody could then seriously foresee that these European communities would grow into an overarching cooperative of 27 or more European states."
"Since the early 70s, those pioneers have nonetheless managed, gradually, to build a monopoly position when dealing with European states."
"States that used to belong to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) or the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) now form part of the European Union."
"The forthcoming accession of Romania and Bulgaria more or less puts the finishing touches to this development."
"It would benefit their membership if this enlargement could partly be explained as a victory in the Cold War against the old adversary."
"This will yield support that would otherwise not be there."
"It was partly for that reason that this Parliament decided last year that those two states that were not ready with the preparations in 2004 should still be admitted in 2007 or 2008."
"I was one of those who voted in favour of that idea."
"Despite this, the domestic situation of those two newcomers has come in for some widespread criticism."
"To this day, Roma people are driven out and their houses razed to the ground."
"To this day, nature and the environment are under more serious threat there than in other parts of Europe because motorways are built and minerals extracted in the cheapest ways possible."
"There is still no ready insight into the way governments spend their money and the companies that benefit from this."
"There are also doubts about the judiciary’s independence and objectivity."
"There are still ethnic peoples who feel they are being treated as second-class citizens, and people are still leaving those countries in their droves."
"The odds are, then, that their accession, will, with the benefit of hindsight, be seen as a huge mistake and a failure."
"Whilst those shortcomings may not change anything about their membership, they will generate additional arguments against further enlargement."
"The first country that will be at the receiving end of this is Croatia, a country that already meets those criteria better than Romania and Bulgaria, and has much in common with current Member State Slovenia, but may have to wait for a very long time nevertheless."
"That is even more the case for the candidatures of other countries such as Macedonia, the rest of the Balkans, Moldova and Ukraine."
"How can we stave off such a negative outcome?"
"Sustained solidarity may be better served with more active support in order for those countries to be brought up to speed quicker than the swift admission or more free market."
"In the Dutch Parliament, both my party, the Socialist Party, and the Christian Democrats, have concluded that the risks of enlargement in 2007 are too great."
"The issue of Bulgaria’s and Romania’s membership of the EU has, of course, already been decided in practice."
"The only matter that we can formally debate in this House is that of whether these two countries are to be admitted in January 2007 or January 2008."
"There are two reasons why the June List welcomes enlargement to include new Member States."
"Firstly, the more of us there are the more difficult it is to imagine Brussels’ being able to regulate the European Union’s development in detail."
"That constitutes considerable progress."
"Secondly, our admitting new countries to the EU is a great success for democracy, for the principle of the rule of law and for peace in Europe."
"We are, in that sense, adherents of what is usually called the EU’s soft power."
"In actual fact, the EU contributes to democracy and the principle of the rule of law in the countries on its doorstep for the simple reason that such countries wish, for all sorts of different reasons, to join the EU, and, before they join, we in the EU require them to fulfil important conditions, known as the Copenhagen criteria."
"That being the case, we must, however, take these considerations seriously. It is obvious that Bulgaria and Romania do not fulfil those requirements we chose to set down from the beginning."
"For the same reason, we can see that it was a mistake to begin membership negotiations with Turkey right now."
"Its treatment of the Kurds and of women and its attitudes to, for example, freedom of expression show that we should not have done so."
"We were right, however, to decline, for the time being, to enter into negotiations with Serbia on the grounds that General Mladić is still at large."
"What we can now do regarding the issue we confront today is at least to postpone Bulgaria’s and Romania’s accession to January 2008."
"With the future in mind, we should in that way be sending the correct signal to Europe, including Croatia, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine and Belarus."
"Mr President, every time we discuss the issue of enlargement, we touch upon the historical dimension of our work."
"For the Union, each enlargement represents not only a formal celebration, but a necessity and an opportunity."
"A significant problem posed by enlargement is the way in which it is perceived by the outside world, as it is easy to calculate the costs of aid transferred to new, usually poorer countries."
"However, this image is far from complete."
"One cannot see the extent to which enlargement can boost trade and investment and create opportunities for modernisation."
"Without enlargement we would not be able to boast today that we, as the European Parliament, are the point of contact for 450 million citizens."
"There would be 75 million fewer of us and Europe would be a correspondingly smaller player on the global stage, which we so eagerly aspire to appear on today."
"The greatest political lie being spread across Europe today by has-been politicians who did not succeed at home is to accuse the enlargement process of causing all the problems we currently face."
"The opposite is the case."
"The consequences of a lack of reform would be all the more serious were it not for enlargement."
"That is why I enthusiastically greet the prospect of two new Member States joining the European Union, Bulgaria and Romania, which have reformed their national political culture with much effort over the last few years."
"As a Member from Poland, a country that owes a lot to the European Union’s aid policy in recent years, I am enthusiastic about the prospects for membership of these two new countries, although we will soon have to share our dwindling Union budget."
"As a Polish Member, I would also advise you to pay no heed to the warnings issued by Mr Cohn-Bendit."
"It is difficult to believe advice concerning enlargement that comes from someone with as little knowledge of other Member States, such as Poland, which has been a Member State for two years."
"Perhaps political emotions impair the ability to rationally assess the new Polish Government."
"However, Mr Cohn-Bendit, we must be careful with our emotions, or we may say something foolish."
"Sometimes one could get the impression that the doors of the Union are closing like the doors of a lift, and that extra passengers are having difficulty squeezing through them."
"I hope that that is either an illusion, or a temporary fault in this lift called the European Union, as I would not want anyone to travel in a lift whose doors do not open."
"Mr President, I was 18 when I took part in one of the longest student strikes in Eastern Europe."
"It took place in Poland during the ‘Solidarity’ period."
"I remember the posters that we pinned to the walls of my university. They stated: ‘Banning is banned’."
"Today such a poster could well be hung up on the European Commission building, reading: ‘The banning of Romania and Bulgaria’s accession to the European Union as soon as possible is banned’."
"Yes, that poster which stated ‘Banning is banned’ was a reference to the student uprisings in May 1968 in Paris."
"Even then I knew of the role played in these protests by my colleague Mr Cohn-Bendit."
"For many of us at the time, Mr Cohn-Bendit was a kind of contemporary Robin Hood figure."
"Robin Hood could not be killed."
"What I did not know was that, a quarter of a century later, Robin Hood could commit political suicide by talking nonsense, as he has done in this House today."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit did not speak about the huge effort made by the Romanian and Bulgarian nations, which want to fulfil the European Union’s accession criteria."
"He did not dedicate much time to the measures taken by the governments of both these countries in this field."
"He used the debate as a pretext for talking rubbish about my country, Poland."
"If I were him, I would prefer to focus on racism and anti-Semitism in Germany and France, countries he is very familiar with, or perhaps on the social problems in France."
"These are the real threats to Europe, not the political fiction that Mr Cohn-Bendit deigned to present to us today."
"It is a good thing that Romania and Bulgaria are joining the Union in 2007, as I hope they will."
"We should not set up a new ‘Iron Curtain’ for these countries, a new version of the Berlin Wall."
"They do not deserve that."
"Let us encourage them to meet the Union’s accession criteria, but let us not create unfair barriers for them."
"Let us acknowledge the considerable efforts made by the societies and governments of both these countries in this field."
"I appeal to the European Commission to do just that."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Commissioner Rehn for the serious way in which Bulgaria’s progress towards accession is being monitored."
"According to the Accession Treaty, Bulgaria will accede on 1 January 2007 unless the Council unanimously decides, on a Commission recommendation, to postpone entry for one year."
"The Commission has made no such recommendation."
"Let us be clear on this."
"Bulgaria fulfils the political criteria for membership, she has a functioning market economy, economic progress has been maintained and the Bulgarian unemployment rate, while still high, is now lower than that of Germany."
"In relation to other matters, I note that the 16 areas marked as of serious concern in October have now been reduced to 6."
"Of course, these must not in any way be underestimated."
"Firstly, there is the need for more effective action against organised crime, fraud and corruption."
"That is the area that most perturbs the people of Bulgaria as well as our own citizens."
"There has been progress since October."
"I spoke about that in this House last month, but many of the crime bosses are still at large and there is concern about how far their tentacles spread."
"Over the coming months, we need to see dramatic results as well as further steps to improve the effectiveness and resources of the police, investigative and judicial services."
"The Commission must specify more precisely what outcomes are required."
"Secondly, not unrelated to the first point, is the need for strengthened financial controls for the future use of structural funds."
"That is vitally important."
"There must not be any possibility of what is effectively our taxpayers’ money going into the wrong hands or being wasted."
"As we have seen from the Court of Auditors’ consistent refusal to sign off the EU accounts, it is an area where the EU itself needs to put its house in order."
"It is up to the Commission to ensure that effective financial management structures to guarantee the integrity of the funding system are in place and, if necessary, to withhold funding until that is the case."
"I believe that the European Council, at its summit in June 2006, should endorse the decision for the accession of Bulgaria on 1 January 2007, at the same time confirming the remedial action that is required of Bulgaria in the months ahead and the nature of possible post-accession monitoring."
"In other words, it is ‘yes ... but’!"
"To a certain extent, I believe that is what the Commission is trying to say."
"For its part, the Bulgarian Government must take urgent action to deliver tangible results, particularly in the fight against organised crime."
"Much has been achieved in the last six months."
"It is vitally important that even better results are delivered in the next six months."
"Mr President, I will try to keep to the three minutes."
"I completely endorse the analysis which my group chairman gave a moment ago in a reaction to the Commission’s reports."
"My group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, has always been, and will continue to be, consistent where support for Romania’s and Bulgaria’s membership is concerned."
"Whilst I can imagine that people in Sofia and Bucharest are disappointed about the Commission’s ongoing refusal to commit itself one way or another, it may also be important to draw your attention to the good news in the Commission’s report, namely that according to the Commission, it is definitely possible to meet the target date of 2007."
"That is also our group’s ambition."
"Secondly, we are against separating the two countries in the way referred to by other speakers a moment ago."
"With Romania and Bulgaria actually being treated in the same way, we prevent those countries from entering into a race against each other."
"Another important point to make is that, according to the Commission, both countries have, to a large extent, adopted the ."
"The number of red flags has significantly decreased in both cases: from 14 to 4 in Romania and from 16 to 6 in Bulgaria."
"People have worked very hard and achieved a great deal in a short space of time."
"It is also important for the Commission, in its reports, to refrain from using the wording that one of the countries is clearly badly prepared in a certain area."
"That is phraseology that would immediately lead to a discussion about deferral."
"I think that the progress that has been made in both countries demonstrates the governments’ determination and the fact that we can use that as a basis for our optimism that 2007 is very much possible."
"As Mr Schulz has already indicated, this also requires an effort on the part of the Commission itself, which, indeed, shoulders a heavy responsibility in that it must specify what is exactly required from the governments in both countries."
"Particularly where Bulgaria is concerned, I noticed that there have been a few misunderstandings between the Commission and that country’s Government about what the exact criteria are."
"I think that both the Government and Parliament in Sofia do not want to leave us in any doubt as to their willingness to do the things that need to be done as quickly as possible."
"The difference between Romania and Bulgaria has mainly to do with implementation."
"In the fight against corruption, Romania swung into action earlier."
"I have no doubt that, now that legislation is in place in Sofia too, we will very soon see progress in the area of tackling serious crime and the fight against corruption."
"We have noticed that the Commission has decided in favour of a certain timeframe, and I think we have to resign ourselves to this and accept it."
"It is to be hoped that this timeframe is in synch with the ratification processes that are currently taking place, or are yet to take place, in a number of Member States."
"What is, and will remain, important is that the agreed accession date is respected."
"We trust that Romania and Bulgaria will succeed in this, and I think that both Sofia and Bucharest realise that this trust must also be earned."
"Mr President, Commissioner Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, Bulgaria and Romania will join the European Union on 1 January 2007."
"That is beyond question."
"Both countries have made progress in their reform efforts, but this work will continue for some time yet."
"We all know that."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit is right there."
"However, he is throwing the baby out with the bathwater, and that is irresponsible."
"It is the Commission that is acting responsibly here."
"It is right not to issue a blank cheque right away."
"It is also right to develop a perspective for continuing to monitor the reform processes, if necessary even in the years after accession."
"There are still shortcomings in some areas, some of them serious; they have been mentioned here."
"We must ensure that the laws are not only adopted there but also applied."
"I am thinking especially of the EU resources that will be spent there."
"Fair monitoring by the Commission can help here and should be accepted by both countries."
"Pierre Moscovici has said so."
"That is far less drastic than postponement or the like."
"The citizens of the EU and of future candidate countries will be keenly interested in enlargement policy in the future, too."
"That makes it all the more important that the EU should pursue a consistent and credible enlargement policy."
"This enlargement has shown that in future, we in the European Parliament must be careful to vote on enlargements close to the time of accession and not 18 months before."
"I want to make clear again that this is not the accession candidates’ fault, it is our own fault."
"There is moreover no point in including in treaties postponement clauses that actually have no teeth, like Article 39."
"The Commission cannot recommend a postponement of accession at all."
"What would happen if its recommendation were not followed because of just a few votes in the Council?"
"The Commission would be repudiated and there would be two countries sitting at the table of a Council, the majority of which had previously voted against both countries’ participation."
"No, that will not do."
"We will therefore need better instruments in future."
"The accession of Bulgaria and Romania is beyond question."
"Both countries have achieved a lot, but we too still have something to do in order to improve our enlargement policy."
"I also believe we should be holding this debate in Brussels and not in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, this recommendation is wrong."
"The decision is being deferred more and more."
"Why do we not honestly say that both countries fail to satisfy the criteria?"
"Much is only on paper and unfortunately the reality is different."
"If we take a wrong decision and allow these two countries to join prematurely, we will pay for it."
"Our trips to Romania and Bulgaria, talks with NGOs, members of parliament and government representatives from both countries in Sofia only last week have confirmed my opinion that, despite all their efforts, neither country is ready for accession yet – not in 2007, and not even in 2008!"
"Three examples from Sofia: crime, corruption, Kozloduj! 173 contract killings since 1990 – none of them have been cleared up."
"The Kozloduj nuclear power plant is dangerous and has still not been shut down."
"I do not have time to go into the problems of minorities – the Roma – and the conditions in prisons, homes for the elderly and disabled and much more besides."
"If we persist with this wrong decision, it will have repercussions both internally and externally."
"We will lose what credibility we still have with the Union’s citizens."
"Countries like Croatia, which are making great efforts and in my opinion are further on in many respects, will be blocked."
"Here, the liberals are supporting the liberal prime minister in Romania, the socialists the socialist prime minister in Bulgaria."
"We are not forced to stick to this wrong decision."
"Corrections must be possible."
"This self-deception is cowardly and dangerous."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, reasonable accession agreements have been concluded for Bulgaria and Romania, and the Union was to have been enlarged to include these states from the first day of next year, but the deadline has again been thrown into doubt."
"Allow me to make a few observations from my own experience, on the grounds that we were under the same sort of pressure that Bulgaria and Romania face today prior to our accession to the Union."
"We too were told that the Czech Republic was not fully prepared, that it had not yet sufficiently fulfilled this or that requirement."
"The outcome is that we still do not enjoy the same conditions as the so-called old Member States."
"Furthermore, I would venture to add that more than one member of the old Union of 15 might find it difficult to meet the conditions offered, for example, to the Czech Republic."
"The requirements placed on Bulgaria and Romania are tougher still."
"By casting doubt over their accession date and by imposing unequal terms we are increasing insecurity and providing ammunition to those forces in both states that oppose EU accession."
"In addition, we are creating for ourselves sharp internal divisions for the Union in the future, by which I do not mean to say, of course, that we should turn a blind eye to failures over tackling corruption in Bulgaria and Romania or to the issue of organised crime, any more than we should in other Member States."
"Yet it is not good for new states and their citizens to be joining the Union with the feeling that they are second-rate and unequal."
"In connection with this, I feel that it should not be our aim to bring about a repeat of the situation in the Czech Republic, where a majority of people, according to a public opinion survey, now believe that equality and justice do not prevail in the Union and that the so-called old Member States continue to enjoy advantages that are denied to the new Member States, in the form of subsidies that are withheld from the latter."
"In the case of Bulgaria and Romania we are, at the very least, going down the same route."
"I will give you one example of this."
"The Kozloduj nuclear power station – already mentioned several times – is just as safe as many others in Europe, according to international experts."
"The Union, however, is obliging Bulgaria as a condition of entry to shut down part of its nuclear capacity, which will turn it from an exporter of electricity into an importer."
"The question is who really benefits from this."
"When all is said and done, we have raised the hopes of the inhabitants of Bulgaria and Romania regarding membership of the Union and we should therefore not treat them like hostages and quibble over their accession date."
"It is possible that we, as Member States with our own economic interests, might have more cause for regret than Bulgaria and Romania if the enlargement does not take place by 1 January."
"Mr President, well, isn’t it all lovely?"
"Virtually everybody agrees – the Commission, the group leaders in Parliament – that it is jolly good that two more countries are joining."
"But could we please stop this farcical pretence that it has got anything to do with the criteria of dealing with the justice system or them fulfilling the ."
"Romania and Bulgaria will join on 1 January next year for political reasons."
"This has to happen, because you need a diversion."
"The peoples of Europe have lost confidence in you and in these institutions."
"All today’s statement represents is a victory for the political classes, the classes in the European Union who want this to be a world superpower to take on the United States of America, and of course a huge victory for the politicians in Romania and Bulgaria, who will enrich themselves enormously and give themselves jobs in perpetuity."
"So welcome to Romania and Bulgaria; let us welcome their politicians onto the EU gravy train."
"But what of the implications for the rest of us?"
"Well, I am all for free trade."
"I am all for the free movement of goods and services."
"I am all for us having the opportunity to work in each other’s countries, but to have an open-door immigration policy between countries with differing GDPs is madness."
"Already Britain has taken in over a third of a million people from the ten countries that joined in 2004 and it is now estimated by Migration Watch in the United Kingdom that when Bulgaria and Romania join we will take in another third of a million over the next three years."
"Our public services simply cannot stand mass migration on that scale, and Romania and Bulgaria will lose many of their brightest and best young people into the bargain."
"So you may have your diversion today, Commissioner, but the EU is failing, public confidence is falling and it will all end in tears."
"Mr President, yes, it will end in tears; the question is, which?"
"I do not believe you have taken the European Union forward with your decision, which you have announced today, certainly not towards being a superpower, but you have taken another step towards implosion."
"Because you are again acting quite contrary to what you claim are your criteria, there will now be a disastrous marriage between the cultures of corruption of Brussels and Strasbourg and those of Bucharest and Sofia."
"The people who are pushing you to do that, namely the British and Polish Governments, will have to answer to their electorates for it."
"I wonder whom the Commission will answer to? The day before yesterday, the wrote: ‘The real problem is not the supposed dependence of the judiciary, but on the contrary its almost complete independence from all means of control."
"Judges and public prosecutors need fear no supervision, because so far there has been none."
"The judiciary enjoys great freedom, frequently even freedom from justice and the law."
"There is plenty of scope for buying judgments’. Yesterday’s reports that the head of the Federation of German Detectives said on his return: ‘It is pointless."
"Whenever I tried to go into details they said disclosure was against the national interest’."
"The mistake was to promise them accession too early."
"Why are you still making even more mistakes by continuing to talk as though you wanted to take the Union forward?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I will read the report that you have just outlined very carefully, but allow me to make some preliminary comments on Romania."
"Firstly, you acknowledge the significant progress made on reforming the judicial system and fighting corruption, although you say that the efforts need to be maintained."
"I think that this is an area of serious concern, as has already been said."
"It was a real priority area, in which we now all acknowledge that the progress made in Romania has been very significant and we should celebrate that."
"Mr Rehn, you told us that there are still four areas of serious concern regarding the , for example on some agricultural and veterinary matters."
"In short, in any case they are areas on which I know that the Romanian authorities are working very hard, as I had the opportunity to see a fortnight ago, when I visited Bucharest with a delegation from my Group."
"Commissioner, as I said at the plenary on 26 April, I was personally in favour of making the timescale for accession clear as soon as possible, because this would remove the uncertainty for the governments concerned as quickly as possible."
"However, I can see that the Commission, although it recognises that Romania is working adequately towards the objective of 2007, prefers to wait, for the sake of rigour and prudence, until autumn to confirm whether accession will actually take place in January 2007, as I hope it will."
"I am convinced that the Romanian authorities will maintain their firm commitment to the common objective of 2007."
"In the October 2005 report the Commission mentioned a high number of areas, fourteen as you told us, affecting seven chapters of the that were causes for serious concern."
"Now I understand that these areas have been reduced to four, as you told us, and they affect very few chapters."
"The progress is therefore evident."
"And with these precedents, with the serious Europeanism of the Romanian authorities, I think that they will pay the utmost attention to your recommendations."
"I am sure that in the autumn you will be able to confirm the date of 1 January 2007 for accession, with no further conditions."
"I am optimistic."
"Finally, I would also like to encourage those Parliaments who have not done so to speed up the process as soon as possible for the ratification of the accession treaty."
"Mr President, I too welcome the Commission’s decision on the accession date of Romania and Bulgaria."
"I also wish to praise the Commission for its work, in particular the work of DG Enlargement."
"The European Council was right to decide to welcome the people of Bulgaria and Romania as from 1 January 2007 to our big European family – the European family to which they have always belonged since they share our historic culture and common values."
"Your message to the people of Bulgaria and Romania is the right one."
"Both countries have worked hard and they have achieved enormous progress so far."
"The people of both countries strongly supported their governments in this work."
"These people will now be even more motivated to support the reforms that are still needed and that are described in the Commission’s report."
"As the Commissioner has pointed out very correctly in numerous exchanges of views which we have had either in plenary and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Bulgaria and Romania have shown continuous progress in all the relevant areas."
"Both capitals are aware that they have to speed up and reinforce their efforts in certain fields and I strongly believe that they are going to be successful in fulfilling the expectations of the European Union, as expressed by its Parliament, and most of the expectations of their own people."
"As a Hungarian, I should also like to say a few words about the Hungarian minority in Romania."
"Firstly, I should like to thank the College of Commissioners for raising the issue of the situation of the Hungarian minority in the current report."
"Secondly, as I have said so many times in this House concerning this issue, one of the basic failures of the current Romanian Government coalition agreement was and is to adopt a law on minorities."
"Although I believe that the accession of Romania will provide a solution for the Hungarians living beyond the border, and that from 1 January 2007 onwards we will be able to live in a common Europe without borders, I also wish to emphasise to the Romanian Government that it should not forget its promise to adopt a minority law; both Parliament and the Commission will follow that up closely."
"Pressure has been exerted from many quarters in today’s debate, and there has been much speculation about the observations to be made and, naturally, a good deal of nervousness in the countries concerned."
"I am therefore pleased about today’s message from the Commission that we hope to be able to welcome our Romanian and Bulgarian friends into the Community at the beginning of next year."
"The road leading up to that point has been, and remains, long and difficult."
"Obviously, the consequences of the huge repression practised by the Communist dictatorships in Romania and Bulgaria and of the destitution caused there by them cannot be reversed with a wave of the hand."
"These countries’ politicians and people have made enormous efforts and sacrifices with the clear aim of reforming and democratising their countries and leading them into the European Community."
"A lot of work remains to be done, and we are painfully aware of the problems that exist: corruption, organised crime, the difficulties of integrating the Roma and the situation of orphans."
"We are all aware of the criteria too."
"They are the same for everyone, and we are relying on the Commission to carry out an objective and professional assessment and evaluation."
"We are also relying on you wholeheartedly to support and help Bulgaria and Romania tackle these difficulties so that we might make progress towards their becoming Members at the beginning of next year."
"We in the European Parliament will help out insofar as we are able to, and we are convinced that matters will progress well in the time that remains."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has for a long time advocated safety clauses for us all, new and old Member States alike."
"We know that, in the present EU too, the Treaties are infringed and human rights violated, and it would be helpful to obtain clearer mechanisms for becoming aware of these developments and remedying them."
"EU integration is like a tango. It takes two for it to work."
"The candidate countries must do their homework, but we too must do our own."
"We have internal problems in the EU with which we must get to grips, and that is something about which we talked this morning with Commissioner Wallström."
"We must also dare to proclaim the significance of enlargement and explain to our people why it is so important for Romania and Bulgaria now to get together with us and for Romanians and Bulgarians to sit in this House and be allowed to speak from the benches instead of sitting in the public gallery and merely listening."
"Mr President, for half a century Bulgaria was under Communist rule."
"However, when the Berlin Wall fell it was brought under post-Communist rule."
"Agents of the former secret service, the Darzavna Sigurnost, continued to control the state."
"The West did business with them during the privatisations, which were often carried out illegally."
"Financial support from the West hardly reached the unemployed Bulgarians and the victimised Roma."
"Only the former secret agents flourished in their roles as businessmen, judges, bankers, politicians and leaders of NGOs."
"Has the population ever had a fair chance under post-Communist rule?"
"In the 2001 progress report, the rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, urged the Bulgarian authorities to provide further information on the murder of dissident writer Georgi Markov in London in 1978."
"It was one of the many contractual killings left unaccounted for long ago and more recently."
"The report stresses the need for greater efforts for the social inclusion of Roma."
"I also agree with the Commission that further efforts are needed to combat all forms of intolerance, racism and xenophobia."
"I appeal, therefore, to all my fellow MEPs to sign Written Declaration No 19 – initiated by MEPs from five different political groups – on protection of people in Bulgaria against neo-totalitarianism."
"Holocaust-deniers in Bulgaria close to the former secret service do not belong in the EU."
"I am also grateful that the Commission has concerns about the unacceptable living conditions of the Roma."
"They are scapegoats, like Jews, Turks and homosexuals."
"Finally, I am very pleased that last week the Bulgarian Minister of the Interior, Mr Petkov, promised the Verts/ALE delegation that all the archives of the Darzavna Sigurnost would be opened before 20 July."
"Only then will we know who killed Georgi Markov, who committed other crimes and who is really ruling Bulgaria today."
"Let us support real reformers and free Bulgaria from its past, instead of postponing its future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, on the motorway between Istanbul and Sofia, there is a border post or toll-gate called Kapitan Andreevo."
"Remember that name because it is going to appear in all the newspapers as from 1 January if Bulgaria joins the European Union."
"Indeed, that is where, every year, 300 000 lorries arrive from Turkey. The queue is five kilometres long, and the lorries wait for three days."
"They are used for criminal trafficking in all its forms: drug-trafficking from Afghanistan, human trafficking from Pakistan and trading in amphetamines and forged currency."
"To monitor all this, there is one customs official per thousand lorries."
"As a result, everything gets through."
"There is an obvious need for at least one cargo scanner."
"Mr Rehn told us in this House on 25 October that radiographic equipment was indeed necessary, and EUR 8 million was paid out for this purpose."
"Yet there is no scanner."
"The fact is that everyone who liked Sangatte, Brindisi, Almeria and the Canaries is going to love Kapitan Andreevo, the gate for entering Europe from Asia and the focal point from which criminality will spread far and wide."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate Commissioner Rehn on the thorough measures he is pursuing in relation to the two countries in question and, from what the Commissioner has said, it is clear that Romania and Bulgaria have made progress."
"To have reduced the remaining unresolved points from sixteen to six and from fourteen to four in the space of a few months is, in my opinion, an outstanding result."
"Well, I think that we are all aware in this House that, when ten countries joined the European Union on 1 May 2004, the ten countries in question were not completely ready to enter the Union."
"We also know that the efforts made by those nations complement each other over time."
"Can you tell me that, in some of those countries, there are not problems with regard to minorities and that the fight against corruption does not concern each of the 25 Member States of the Union?"
"So what has changed compared to 1 May 2004?"
"Why was the emphasis placed on photographs and flags back then, while a much firmer and also much more formal position can be observed today?"
"I believe that we must acknowledge the fact that, if it is true that there are in fact problems in the two countries that are about to join the Union, it is likely that the main problems exist within the Union itself."
"Furthermore, if we ask ourselves what has changed compared to back then, the answer is that we were unable to carry through that Constitutional Treaty, which was a fundamental element of this enlargement."
"We must be careful, however, not to make those countries and those populations that have worked so hard to emerge from the historic era of Communism pay a price that they do not deserve to pay."
"To conclude, Commissioner, I believe that we are on the right track and I hope that 1 January 2007 will be confirmed in the autumn as the date on which Romania and Bulgaria will join."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us be honest and realistic."
"We must assume that these two countries, Bulgaria and Romania, will join on 1 January 2007, firstly because they will continue their own reform work – I am convinced of that – and secondly because the required majorities in the Council are in favour."
"The crucial thing for me, however, is how these countries will enter the European Union in 2007, whether they will somehow muddle through or slip in, or whether they will come in with their heads held high and we will be able to agree with a clear conscience."
"I agree with the Commission and with you, Commissioner Rehn, that there are things that still need to be done in both countries."
"Only I really would ask you to say very specifically what changes are necessary."
"Because you do not seem to be clear about some of the things in this report."
"You speak, for example, of ‘ambiguity regarding the independence of the Judiciary’."
"There must be reasons why that does not seem clear to you."
"The Bulgarians and Romanians must then each be told what they have to do."
"I believe both countries’ governments are prepared to make the changes."
"But if we are making so much of this issue, perhaps more than the Copenhagen Criteria or the allow – and there are good reasons for that – then we must say very clearly what changes are necessary; I must ask you to do that today, and when you are in those countries tomorrow."
"The changes must be spelled out specifically and realistically and they must be achievable, because there is no point in demanding things that cannot be achieved in this short space of time."
"If we do that, and if there is then special monitoring, in other words a precise period of observation, then I am sure that both countries will now take the necessary steps and really will be able to join on 1 January 2007."
"I believe they will then be able to play a big part."
"Some Members have maintained that crime and corruption prevail in both countries, but that is not the case."
"Both countries have done a great deal to improve things, and they will continue to do so. Pressure from the European Union has brought that about."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to say that Mr Rehn’s report and his work deserve the utmost credit, especially in the context of this parliamentary debate."
"I do not want the clear conclusions drawn in this report to be changed in the course of parliamentary debate."
"Romania and Bulgaria have, so far, done all that has been in their power to do."
"They have achieved what the European Union wanted of them. They have implemented regulations in the economic, political and social fields and have instituted the principle of the rule of law."
"The European Union and the societies of both these countries will now assess these achievements."
"I think that it is extremely important to stress the extent of the progress made by both of these countries, which will allow them to say that they are entering the European Union with a confident stride."
"During the period since 1 May 2004, countries such as mine have shown how to navigate accession to the European Union."
"I think that the success of that transition for both the old and the new Member States will convince those who remain sceptical."
"The fact that Great Britain not only had the generosity but also the sense to open its labour market immediately to people from Eastern Europe means that now, apart from Germany and Austria, which Mr Brok appears to have forgotten, many other European countries have followed in Britain’s footsteps."
"I would like to say that it is extremely important to be able to trust that, having been introduced, the rules of the game will be applied, and then to assess the situation."
"Poland’s example shows that the introduction of the principles set out in the Copenhagen criteria can be a good omen, but that these principles also have to be implemented once the countries have joined the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are sticking to January 2007 as the date for accession, but attaching to that date conditions that must be satisfied by October."
"It is a winding road the Commission is pursuing here."
"It is clearly suffering under the burden of its own past mistakes."
"We are eager to see, Commissioner, how you will explain to us in October that the hurdles you have erected here today have now been overcome."
"It was a great mistake to set 2007 as the date for accession when it was still unclear whether it could ever be met."
"The Commission is now trying rather desperately to find a way out of this into which it has got itself."
"Of course the proposal you have made today is sensible given the circumstances."
"That is why I am supporting it despite all its weaknesses."
"I will confine myself to a few remarks about Romania, since I have been there with a CDU/CSU delegation."
"Under the leadership of President Basescu and Prime Minister Popescu-Tariceanu, a determined and serious reform process has begun there, affecting home affairs, the judiciary and the fight against corruption."
"It has not been completed yet."
"The conditions are not yet fully satisfied."
"The corruption trials have not yet been finally concluded, but they are seriously under way and it will take time."
"I think it is important that we send this government a signal to continue determinedly down this road to reform."
"That is important."
"Romania is a European-minded country through and through."
"It will be a good ally for us in the European Union."
"There is a German minority there whose rights are satisfactorily enshrined in law."
"The law on minorities is an example to others."
"That is why, Commissioner, I would urge you to encourage the government to continue its process of reform."
"Commissioner, I would like to express my respect for your work but, as with all work, it is also necessary to have clarity."
"My only problem today is the lack of clarity."
"You are saying that our goal is to get the two countries on board on 1 January 2007."
"That is what we are all looking for."
"I cannot see any fundamental reason not to let them in on 1 January."
"So what we are really talking about is how we can promote further progress with those two countries as much as possible."
"The appeal I am making to you has already been mentioned by the chairman of my group, Mr Schulz, and by Mr Swoboda and other colleagues."
"If we seriously expect further progress in the next three and a half months, before your next report in October, what can be done in that time?"
"What do we expect?"
"A new State prosecutor in Bulgaria?"
"No."
"To what extent does immunity need to be lifted?"
"How many cases do we need to raise?"
"How many decisions in court do we need?"
"Do you see what I am getting at, Commissioner?"
"What we need now, if these countries are to work with us, is for you to be very precise."
"I have a suggestion to make to you."
"I propose that you make a scoreboard to present to the two new governments in Bulgaria and Romania, a precise scoreboard showing what we want of them in the next three and a half or four months in particular areas."
"It is not enough to say that we expect progress."
"It is very important to say what exactly we expect of them in justice and home affairs, so that the two governments know exactly what to do."
"The second thing I want to ask of you, Commissioner, with all due respect, is that there should be no extra work later."
"As some members of the Bulgarian Government said to me recently, ‘We cannot change our constitution every other week’."
"What we really need now is to be precise in our demands."
"My final hope is that the June Council will take a clear decision."
"As Mr Moscovici said, it is time now to send a clear signal, and the June Council can send a clear signal that they are welcome on 1 January 2007 and that we look forward to working with them."
"Mr President, I am pleased with the Commission’s proposal because it does justice to Bulgaria’s and Romania’s efforts and also to the concerns about lasting problem areas, the existence of which, by the way, nobody denies."
"To previous speakers, including Mr Cohn-Bendit, I should like to say that as far as I am concerned, this proposal is a shot in the arm for the reformers and thus a source of frustration for criminals, corrupt folk and xenophobes."
"Maybe Mr Cohn-Bendit ought to consider to whom he actually wishes to give his support."
"The notion that reforms will end as soon as those countries accede is nonsense."
"That notion was already mentioned during the previous enlargement and was disproved in the end."
"Moreover, reforms are first and foremost carried out by the people for the sake of improving the quality of life and not just for the sake of joining the European Union."
"It is, of course, also true that we must, as a matter of urgency, have an instrument by means of which we can tick off all EU Members, including current EU Members, if they fail to adhere to the rules, also where fundamental rights are concerned."
"I should like to argue in favour of long-term vision, for we all know that this is not the end where reforms are concerned."
"Corruption, crime, discrimination against minorities, and suchlike must all be tackled, also in future."
"One day, Bulgaria and Romania may well lead from the front in the European Union, just as they also demonstrated that economically, they are capable of much more and much greater willingness to reform than us in Western Europe."
"Who knows, one day, they might be the champions of fundamental rights and rule of law and may well adopt a leading role in the European Union."
"Finally, I should like to urge all Members in their own countries, to give the full account, rather than populist talk that is based on xenophobia."
"I will welcome Bulgaria and Romania on 1 January 2007."
"Mr President, Commissioner, while I value your work, please allow me to ask you a question."
"Why has the one and a half million Hungarian population, one of the largest minorities in Europe, vanished from this report?"
"All previous Commission reports, followed by the Parliament reports, called attention to the needs of the Hungarian community in Romania."
"This report hardly mentions it."
"We are pleased that, contrary to the preliminary news, it contains at least a general reference to the Minority Act."
"Commissioner, I can state with certainty that the Hungarian population of Romania has not vanished since October 2005."
"The issues that Parliament had expressly found to be problematic have not disappeared, either."
"These are unresolved matters."
"And it is becoming increasingly clear that there is no political willingness, either, to resolve them; for instance, there is no willingness to adopt a Minority Act based on cultural autonomy. Or to ensure higher education in the Hungarian language."
"Or to enforce the principle of self-governance. Or to amend the discriminatory Elections Act."
"Commissioner, the European institutions have a considerable responsibility to help the citizens of Romania, including the minorities, to recognise the possibilities provided by accession."
"Thus, the Hungarian community in Romania must also benefit from the European Union methods and techniques for the enforcement of interests."
"This needs support both from Bucharest and Brussels."
"Brussels has not given much help to this community today."
"But it can still help, it can help this community to recognise the possibilities and acquire the techniques."
"This will be a precondition of the competitiveness of the European Community."
"Therefore now, Commissioner, I will hand over to you the letter written by Members of the European Parliament, as well as, symbolically, a few of the thousands of letters written to you by people and civil organisations in Transylvania."
"We are, and I am, expecting a reply to these, too, in October."
"Mr President, Commissioner Rehn, you have a pleasingly straightforward way of presenting your findings in plenary."
"I will therefore be equally straightforward in expressing my thanks to you."
"Thank you, and that without any flowery words hiding qualifications."
"So an unqualified thank you."
"You have worked carefully, you have made the best of an unsatisfactory situation that is not primarily of your making."
"It would be difficult to question your findings and hence the grounds for your conclusions on the basis of the facts."
"I therefore advise those who may be tempted to feel offended in the present situation not to be, but to set to work and complete the tasks that are still outstanding."
"If in the autumn your report shows there are still deficits, the Commission should propose safeguard clauses."
"Parliament should then give the Commission its backing, although each of the two countries should be treated separately."
"For me, however, this debate is also an occasion to draw further conclusions, over and beyond the two countries at issue."
"Some other Members have touched on it, and I will say it again quite clearly: there must never again be accession treaties without the accession conditions being fulfilled in their entirety."
"Bulgaria and Romania in any case complete the list of 27 countries that were in the Nice catalogue, so to speak."
"There can only be further accessions if the European Union also does its homework and makes the necessary internal reforms to ensure its continued existence with more than 27 states."
"– Mr President, I am pleased that both countries have joined the Decade Programme, and they are doing everything they can to ensure that the Roma are integrated as soon as possible."
"However, the monitoring report describes abuses committed by the police and law enforcement authorities, in both countries."
"We must continue to monitor the problem areas mentioned."
"Segregation in the education sector is already mentioned in the Bulgarian report, but I would very much like to see that this issue is given increased attention in the case of Romania, where the level of segregation is just as high."
"According to reports of certain civil organisations, 80% of children classed as having learning difficulties are Roma."
"Even as recently as a week ago, on 9 May, I received a report of abuses committed by the police."
"The wounds inflicted on members of the Roma community by policemen of the Romanian authority can be seen on photographs."
"This is the third case that I heard of within the last six months."
"In spite of this, I voted for the accession of both countries."
"However, the significant difference between the two countries is that while Bulgaria acknowledges the problems related to the Roma population, Romania would like to conceal and deny them."
"I call upon the Romanian colleagues, the Commission and the Commissioner to ask the competent authorities to change this policy!"
"– Mr President, the enlargement is undeniably one of the EU’s biggest success stories."
"We do not realise enough what it means to those countries to belong to the community of values, often after decades of tyranny, but also what it means to the old countries."
"We would have always been worse off had the enlargement not been so successful."
"In order to gain and maintain support for this enlargement, though, it is necessary that it should take place in a credible manner and that the criteria should not be tampered with."
"Bulgaria and Romania belong in the EU, but those criteria are important if we want to hold onto public support, if we want the enlargement to reinforce, rather than weaken, the community of values, and last but not least, those criteria are important for the citizens of Romania and Bulgaria, and that is why I would say to Mr Watson, who spoke a moment ago, but also to my fellow countrywoman, Mrs in 't Veld, that adhering to criteria is in fact, not against, but in favour of, enlargement."
"Turning to the Commission’s present proposal, if one considers the level of progress there, then I think that the pressure tactic has so far worked, particularly in Romania, where Mrs Macovei, in her capacity as justice minister has achieved more in a short space of time than the Nastase administration in previous years."
"That is worth a huge compliment."
"At the same time, we must realise that more pressure is needed."
"Yet more change is needed in Romania, but particularly in Bulgaria, where some developments appear to have been more negative than anything else."
"In the light of the need for persistent pressure, the Commission’s approach is the best one."
"If we say that 2007 will be the year, then that would take the pressure off, but if we say that 2008 will be the year, then that would equally take the pressure off, for then people will know that they can join in 2008 come what may and that they can rest on their laurels."
"Dangling the carrot of 2007 as still being a possibility, is important, provided this is done under three conditions."
"First of all, the Council should not state that October is too late to decide."
"Secondly, if the countries are not up to scratch, we should really be able to say in October that they cannot join in January 2007."
"Thirdly, if we really talk about credibility, then we should dare assess each country on their own merit and one country should not become the victim of the other."
"That would therefore mean that Bulgaria and Romania would be separated and assessed individually in October."
"I would thank you and would once again like to congratulate the Commission on the line it is currently taking."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, twenty years ago, like the Bulgarians and Romanians are doing now, we were finishing negotiations for Spain’s integration into the Community."
"I recall our efforts to adapt to the Treaties and I recall the humiliation, in the face of obstacles, of leaders who at the time appeared to be much less committed than us to the project."
"However I remember, above all, the solidarity of many, their respect and their understanding."
"A few years later, having learned from this experience and as President of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, I gave my full support at the Bulgaria and Romania Council, as a first step in the process that will now culminate in their integration into the European Union."
"The Commission has put forward a report that is generally positive, but acknowledges some shortcomings."
"This is the Commission’s role."
"Parliament’s role, as an eminently political body of the Union, has to be different."
"As we represent our people, we must understand and support the people of Bulgaria and Romania, understand their difficulties and, by confirming their accession date for 1 January 2007, help them to gradually resolve the shortcomings found."
"Our role is above all to understand that in Bulgaria and Romania there are two peoples with deep Europeanist convictions, much more so than the majority of the Member States, whom we therefore really need in order to move forward with the European Union project culminating in the Constitution."
"Nothing would be more negative than to frustrate aspirations, spread uncertainty and mistrust and make Romanians and Bulgarians feel mistreated and discriminated against."
"Because we need them and because they are going to be the best of us, Parliament must give its full support to their accession on the planned date."
"This is the approach of my Socialist Group, the ultimate in solidarity, and of the Spanish socialists, given our own experience and the hopes and commitments that we share with the Bulgarians and Romanians."
"Mr President, enlargement is truly one of the great stories of the EU."
"The fifth wave, which enlarged the Union to 25 Member States in 2004, has actually been a great success, in spite of many dire warnings that the Union would be paralysed without a Constitution and that countries such as mine would suffer unsustainable immigration flows, including from the Roma population."
"The new Member States have, broadly speaking, become more Atlanticist, they believe in free markets and low taxation as an approach, which I welcome."
"I believe that the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, which is really the fifth-and-a-half wave as initially they were supposed to join at the same time as the other 10 new Member States, will also prove to be a great success."
"I still believe that the carrot of EU membership has proven the great driver of economic and political reform."
"Nevertheless, I do not underestimate the scale of the tasks that will face those two countries after joining in 2007."
"There is still a need for them to not lower their guards against public corruption, and some high-level indictments and convictions will certainly be a powerful example to deter further corruption."
"The problem of organised crime has been mentioned – people trafficking and drug trafficking are still serious issues."
"Bulgaria seems to have made less progress, with a spate of horrendous mafia-style contract killings, which are of major concern to all of us."
"It is fair to say that organised crime is still a problem, even in some of our current Member States, such as southern Italy."
"That in itself cannot be a cause to delay Romanian and Bulgarian accession any further, although there is a case to be made for invoking the one-year safeguard clauses in regard to particular chapters such as justice and home affairs."
"Let me raise two specific issues."
"Firstly, I call on Romania to settle its outstanding maritime border dispute with Ukraine over Snake Island."
"Ukraine, hopefully, will also be a Member State of the European Union one day."
"Secondly, I call upon the Romanian Government to reconsider its absolute ban on inter-country adoptions."
"Mr President, I should like straight away to thank the Commissioner for this new report, which is a very rigorous piece of administrative work on the part of the Commission."
"However, this very rigour is leading the Commission again to postpone its decision on Bulgaria’s and Romania’s accession date."
"In spite of the dynamism shown by these countries and although all the signs still point towards accession, the report expresses serious reservations."
"Once again, you recommend them to continue with their efforts in a wide variety of areas: agricultural administration, the monitoring of Community expenditure and the fight against crime, corruption and fraud."
"Moreover, those who have spoken in this House have added to this list: the integration of minorities, international adoption and the control of customs contraband."
"In my opinion, it does need to be acknowledged that Bulgaria and Romania are not alone in having these types of problem."
"Current events in Europe demonstrate every day how Europe falls short in all these areas."
"Why then, Mr Rehn, should new demands constantly be added to the accession criteria?"
"Why postpone a decision that gave rise to fewer difficulties for the ten countries that acceded last time round?"
"With this decision in view, you are being extremely cautious, and this will have an impact on Bulgarians’ and Romanians’ hopes as they anticipate the outcome of the decision."
"For a year now, we have been aware of the consequences of nations’ despair as they contemplate Europe’s future."
"With each consecutive report, the Commission multiplies the demands associated with the accession criteria to be fulfilled, then backs off when faced with having to take a decision."
"With each consecutive report, the Bulgarian and Romanian nations feel humiliated, despite the fact that they are making progress."
"The people of those countries have ever more doubts about their right to occupy a place in our European democracy."
"With each report that is published, populism gains ground."
"The moment has therefore come to take a clear and courageous decision about Bulgaria’s and Romania’s date of entry into the EU."
"In our opinion, this should be 1 January 2007, for these two countries are essential to a genuine European Union project."
"– Mr President and Commissioner Rehn. In my last speech on Bulgaria's process of accession into the European Union, I said that there was still a great deal of work to be done and a lot of reform to be implemented."
"I mentioned organised crime and the trafficking of babies towards Western countries."
"It appears that the Bulgarian authorities are addressing these two problems, although there needs to be more consistency if we want to see more concrete results."
"I am informed that, apart from corruption which is deeply rooted, there is as yet not enough control on drug trafficking, especially of heroin from Afghanistan as some have already mentioned before me, which is being sold to northern European countries at astronomical prices."
"The Chairman of the Bulgarian National Assembly, George Pirinski, said earlier this week that the European Union should use the same scale of measurement as it did with the ten countries that joined in the last enlargement."
"I think that all of us can assure Mr Pirinski and the people of Bulgaria that not only will the European Union ensure that this same scale of measurement is used, but that it will do all that is possible to help Bulgaria reach its necessary criteria."
"We should also add, however, that the European Union will never accept any candidate country, be it Bulgaria or Romania, Croatia or Turkey, as a Member of the European Union if they do not satisfy the accession criteria."
"I am sorry to say, for example, that the reform in the judicial system has not made as much progress as was necessary, and certain things still need to be clarified, including the independence of the Judiciary."
"There is a long way to go before we reach where we want to arrive."
"Finally, I think, Mr President, that the Bulgarian authorities should take this opportunity to continue implementing the necessary reforms in the shortest time possible."
"In this way, we can welcome them here among us in 2007."
"Thank you very much."
"– Mr President, the preparations for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union are taking place during a period of crisis in Europe."
"Heightened populist and anti-immigration sentiments are just some of the things that have contributed to this crisis."
"According to recent Eurobarometer surveys, around 53% of Europeans view the enlargement process with indifference, fear, irritation or frustration."
"At the same time, however, we have to remember that according to these surveys, the majority – 55% – still have a positive attitude towards enlargement."
"Bulgaria and Romania must not fall victim to the European crisis."
"We cannot increase the barriers to membership because of the emotional state of the electorate."
"We should not demand any more or less of Bulgaria or Romania than of other countries which took part in the accession process in previous years."
"We should accept and acknowledge the balanced report by the Commission, presented today by President Barroso and Commissioner Rehn."
"The European Union wants to uphold its obligations concerning the accession of Bulgaria and Romania on 1 January 2007."
"At the same time, and in order not to delay the accession date, both countries should fulfil all the criteria for joining the European Union."
"I would also like to express my admiration for the efforts made by society in Bulgaria and Romania on the path to joining the European Union, and for the work and commitment of judges, prosecutors, teachers, politicians, journalists and civil activists during the last few months."
"I would like to say that I am convinced that this effort will bear fruit for Bulgaria and Romania next year in the form of European Union membership."
"Mr President, as far as the criteria to be fulfilled by the two countries are concerned, everything has already been said."
"I would like to draw your attention to three other aspects."
"First of all, let us remember that building normality in Western Europe, in spite of democracy and significant aid from the USA, took a long time."
"Secondly, the Union has made the decision to accept these two countries and has set a date, which I think constitutes an obligation on the part of such an important political institution."
"Thirdly, have we, as the European Union, given enough assistance to these countries with respect to achieving these standards?"
"If Bulgaria and Romania were today located in the Pacific, we could wait for the criteria to be fulfilled, but seeing as they are in Europe, we cannot remain indifferent."
"The Commission needs to play an active role, as do the Council and Parliament."
"I do not see any other solution."
"I would also like to add that Bulgaria and Romania are naturally a part of Europe, they are natural members of Europe, part of this body, and our common duty should be to integrate these two countries into one body."
"As my speech has been quite short and I have saved some time, I should merely like to conclude by telling our colleague Mr Cohn-Bendit, who so vehemently criticised the Polish Government, that he also had the opportunity to judge his Chancellor, who represented an EU Member State for many years, on how he behaved just before leaving office."
"Mr President, the delegation of the Hungarian Socialist Party supports the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union on 1 January 2007."
"This has been our recommendation all along, while not forgetting the numerous justified criticisms and recommendations."
"Our support obviously cannot mean that the Romanian and Bulgarian government are released from their obligation to do everything in their power to eliminate the deficiencies listed in previous and current reports of the European Commission and the European Parliament."
"Hungary will do its best to help them in this respect."
"However, I do not understand the latest report of the European Commission, of Mr Olli Rehn, which has almost entirely forgotten about the issue of minorities."
"Could it be that the problems raised earlier have been resolved over the past six months?"
"The European Commission should call to account Romania, in the spirit of the previous decisions of the government, for failing to adopt the Minority Act, to return church property and to establish a state-financed Hungarian language university."
"Mr Olli Rehn, I do not ask for anything more than what you described in your October 2005 report."
"Commissioner, you recently stated that we cannot demand of Romania more than what we are demanding of current Member States, while in your earlier statements your starting point was different."
"The situation has not changed; has your position changed?"
"This inconsistency is only explained in part by the fact that there are no European standards for minority rights."
"Therefore in the future, the starting point should always be the situation of the country in question."
"It is wrong to refer to old Member States, some of which – and I do not wish to single out France – deny even the existence of minorities, and if they were to apply for accession to the European Union today, they would be definitely turned down."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, which is scheduled for January 2007, could be postponed due to the corruption that the Commission would have us believe is rife in those two countries."
"Such concern is altogether commendable."
"Before they start preaching, however, ought not some of our governments, including the one in France, to first put their own houses in order?"
"Romania and Bulgaria are authentic European nations and are all the more worthy for having been subjected to the Turkish occupation between the 16th and 19th centuries, and then Communism from 1945 to 1990."
"That is why we are putting them on their guard against another form of oppression, which is less brutal but just as dangerous: the Europe of Brussels, which has no borders, destroys our national freedoms and identities and opens its gates to Islamic Turkey by denying the Christian origins of our civilisation."
"Since the vote cast by the people of France and of the Netherlands in 2005, that version of Europe no longer has any democratic legitimacy."
"It is time that all the European nations came together to build another Europe, the Europe of nations."
"Romania and Bulgaria have been promised EU membership as from 1 January 2007."
"They have signed the accession agreement, and we have sent signals to Romania and Bulgaria to the effect that they are doing a good job and that, if they continue to work hard, they will also become members in accordance with the timetable."
"Meanwhile, there have been a number of developments in Europe that have nothing to do with Romania and Bulgaria but that have strongly influenced public opinion, including on the issue of these two countries’ membership."
"Romania and Bulgaria were promised membership before scepticism about continued enlargement began to spread, before a number of European countries voted against the draft EU Constitution and before the fear of social tourism began to spread in the old Europe."
"The fact that these fears are unjustified and the fact that current political leaders did not manage to explain this and give people a sense of optimism are clear signs that there is a serious lack of leadership in today’s Europe."
"That is not, however, something for which Romania and Bulgaria should pay the price."
"I am both surprised and perturbed about the fact that no one in this House today has pointed out that enlargement is really about security."
"The majority of countries in the Balkans are in the throes of forming nation states, which is a difficult and delicate process that could come to grief at any time and that has to be handled with both sensitivity and knowledge."
"In such a situation, it would not be sensible to postpone Romania’s and Bulgaria’s entry into the EU, particularly because it would most certainly divert both attention and energy from much more complicated issues in the region such as the status of Kosovo, the referendum in Montenegro and the status of that country and the constitutional changes under way right now in Bosnia."
"Romania and Bulgaria have done a good job."
"Hard work is needed, and both countries will work hard in the future too, just as other countries did during their first period as EU Member States."
"For the sake of security in Europe, it would, however, be best if the EU were to fulfil its commitments to Romania and Bulgaria and otherwise focus its efforts on the other, much more sensitive issues that have to be solved in the Balkan region in the course of the year."
"Commissioner, I have a personal dilemma: I represent a country that is pro-enlargement but a region that is urging me to vote against Bulgarian membership."
"Why?"
"Because my constituent, Michael Shields, is serving a ten-year sentence for a violent attack of which he continues to maintain he is innocent."
"The Bulgarian criminal justice system has not given Michael a fair trial."
"His only recourse is to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg."
"When new defence evidence came forward, it was ignored by the Bulgarian authorities; when another Liverpool man confessed to the crime, it was disregarded by the Bulgarians."
"I urge the Bulgarian authorities to restore our faith in their criminal justice system."
"I urge the Commissioner to ask the authorities to take up the offer of assistance by the UK to interview witnesses and examine pre- and post-trial evidence that was rejected in his appeal."
"Any EU Member States, including mine, can make mistakes."
"The true test of a democracy is the will to redress any potential wrongs and ensure that real justice is served."
"Commissioner, I will send you a copy of this independent documentary, which shows that my constituent did not have a fair trial and that there was a severe problem with the police investigation."
". Mr President, it is not a question of my timetable, but of media deadlines in Bulgaria and Romania."
"I trust you will be sympathetic to this excuse, because we have to get the right message across tonight to both Bulgaria and Romania, where we are heading with President Barroso immediately after this sitting to pass on the message of encouragement."
"We shall be rolling up our sleeves to tackle the remaining shortcomings."
"I would like to thank you for a very constructive and responsible debate, which also reflects the wide range of views in European civil society."
"That is, of course, the role of Parliament."
"In this debate I sense overall support for the Commission’s basic approach, which is that the target accession date of January 2007 should be possible, on condition that the countries can address the remaining shortcomings."
"Yes, some are more in favour than others and opinions differ as to the conditions, but the overall tone of the debate has been very clear and I can say that the Commission is in favour of the target and of sticking strictly to the conditions."
"In order to have a real dialogue, I would like to comment on the points raised in various speeches."
"First of all, it has been said that the conditions that remain must be achievable."
"I fully agree with that."
"We would not propose a final review of whether the conditions have been met in October if we did not believe that it is feasible for the countries to meet the remaining criteria."
"At the same time, it is clear that, as guardian of the treaties, we cannot recommend something that does not exist."
"We have to see that the conditions are really fulfilled, especially in the field of terrorism and the fight against corruption and organised crime."
"Otherwise, we would not be up to our task."
"Secondly, there has been a request for a concrete ‘to-do’ list or scoreboard for the countries so that they know what is expected of them."
"I agree."
"This is included in the Commission’s report and both countries are fully aware of the expectations and of the remaining criteria."
"That is precisely why President Barroso and I are going to Bucharest and Sofia today and tomorrow."
"We shall discuss what is expected of both Bulgaria and Romania."
"Moreover, we have to trust in the political maturity of the governments, parliaments and administrations of these countries for them to know what the Copenhagen political and economic criteria and the criteria mean, and plan their roadmaps of reform on the basis of these well-established criteria, which form the basis of our crystal clear report."
"I can give you a very precise example of one area in which we and Bulgaria and Romania have an interest in the countries fulfilling the conditions by the accession date, and that is that Community money should be properly spent and accounted for, which, I trust, is close to the heart of this House – at least it was when I was a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Bulgaria needs to establish the integrated administration and control system in agriculture in order to implement the provisions and funding of the common agricultural policy."
"This means that it needs to take aerial photographs of all the parcels of land, digitise them and block them into a system that links them to the owners."
"If this is not done, I am afraid we will have to withhold direct payments under the common agricultural policy."
"This should work as a very strong incentive to redress this shortcoming."
"I hope this example is concrete enough, but I could give you dozens of other precise examples of what still needs to be done in various areas of the Union’s policy and ."
"Finally, Mr Van Orden said that no reference was made in the Commission’s report to the recommendation of a possible postponement, which is one of the provisions of the accession treaty."
"To avoid any confusion or misunderstanding, this compels me say that in fact, in the conclusion of the Commission’s report adopted just three hours ago, we say that by early October we shall assess whether the two countries have been able to address the remaining shortcomings and on that basis we shall adopt a position as to whether the proposed accession date can be adhered to."
"This means, in clear English or other Community languages, that the Commission reserves the right to consider the use of this safeguard clause of postponement unless the shortcomings are addressed in the next five months, which is, as I said, fully achievable for both countries if they really make an effort."
"Our goal is the accession of Bulgaria and Romania in 2007 and our duty is to see that both countries join when they meet the conditions and are fully prepared to join the European Union."
"This is also a matter of the famous absorption capacity of the European Union."
"That is the best way to make the enlargement a success for Bulgaria, Romania and Europe."
"I trust that you will support the Commission in this objective."
"Mr President, 1 January 2007 is fast approaching, but the uncertainty seems to be here to stay."
"In Romania, in spite of the commendable efforts of the current government, there are still many serious problems waiting to be solved."
"The Copenhagen criteria, as in the past, apply to all candidate states equally."
"Alongside the need for the reform of the judiciary and for restraining corruption and organised crime, the issues related to the observance of human rights and the guarantee of legal certainty for minorities are raising doubts."
"There have been several positive changes in respect of the latter, which have been significantly aided by the presence in legislation and government of the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (RMDSZ), the political representation of the Hungarian community in Romania."
"However, it is mistaken to think that, as Commissioner Olli Rehn has stated, the participation of the RMDSZ in the government coalition is sufficient to guarantee the legal certainty of minorities."
"The political party representing the Hungarian community will never be in majority, and results can only be achieved with the help of the Romanian majority parties and their willingness to compromise."
"As a consequence of the lack of rational political will, a few basic problems are still waiting to be solved."
"Why is the adoption of the Minority Act delayed?"
"Also, the mother-tongue university education of the indigenous Hungarian community, in the form of an independent Hungarian institution of higher education, has still not been resolved."
"Another unresolved issue is the restitution of church property."
"The current Election Act, which is discriminatory against national and ethnic communities, should also be amended, in line with European standards."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is imperative that the issue of minorities is given appropriate importance in the report of the Commission."
"What would be the right decision in the circumstances, when the Council has already promised Romania European Union membership from 1 January?"
"The rational bridging solution would be to apply a close 3-year monitoring system."
"This would obviously need a precise drafting of the indispensable sanctions and of the conditions of safeguard clause activation."
"Mr President, the fact that neither Bulgaria nor Romania have completely finished their homework should not come as a surprise to anyone, for it is a Herculean task."
"The two countries should not, though, become the victim of the Union’s internal problems or of a lack of solidarity."
"I heard the Commissioner also mention ‘absorption capacity’."
"I really do not know the criteria against which this would have to be verified."
"Also, I think that the agreements that have been reached should actually be implemented."
"When our parliamentary committee visited Sofia, we saw for ourselves how much effort people are making in order to achieve the goal, and I think that we should support the reformers."
"The Commissioner tells us that specific examples will be given of what precisely will be expected of those countries."
"We really hope that they will be, that the criteria will be detailed and, above all, that those who are politically responsible in those countries will be backed in any way possible so that they can keep to the 1 January 2007 deadline."
"The Commission should not hide behind the Council any longer."
"It should come to us with a clear opinion."
"– Mr President, I should like by way of introduction to express my appreciation of the European Commission for the valuable work which it has presented to us today."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the accession of Bulgaria and Romania does not raise questions of political, economic or cultural geography for the European Union."
"Certainly there are deficits in institutional and administrative adaptation, especially in areas relating to the European area of freedom, security and justice."
"However, we should not overlook the fact that the order to adapt is ongoing."
"It is inherent in and directs relations between the European Union and a Member State."
"The crucial question, in my opinion, has to do with weighing the costs and benefits for the European Union in the event that accession is postponed."
"I believe that there will be a cost to the very credibility of the European Union."
"It will demonstrate a lack of ability to assimilate on its part."
"Just a few months before accession, the European Union should not send a negative message of postponement to the people of Bulgaria and Romania."
"The accession of these two countries will strengthen the homogenisation of the economic area of southeast Europe and, at the same time, will encourage the process of political and economic convergence of the Western Balkans on its path towards integration in the Union."
"In other words, there will also be a positive spill-over effect for the Western Balkans."
"The message that we must send to Bulgaria and Romania is a message to intensify regulatory work in the period of time remaining."
"To the extent that European governance – European multilevel governance – affects national unification or de-unification, we have only one option: a creative convergence of opinions which will allow the move from a European Union of the 25 to a European Union of the 27."
"The way forward is politically preordained."
"Let us make sure it is institutionally prepared on 1 January 2007."
"– Mr President, I believe that today's valuable report on Bulgaria and Romania presented to us by the Commission sets out in the most objective and fair manner the serious progress made by both Romania and Bulgaria during the final period to adapt to the ."
"I believe that, with this report, the Commission does not underestimate the progress or overestimate the shortcomings of the two countries and I believe that this balanced appraisal of the current situation in both countries by the Commission lends credibility to the European Commission in defending the strategy of enlargement, which we must all defend, and makes a constructive contribution to efforts by both countries to complete the reforms."
"The message which Europe is sending today is, in my opinion, loud and clear."
"It contains an incentive and a warning: the incentive of accession on 1 January 2007 in accordance with the timetable and the warning that this objective will be achieved if both countries intensify their efforts in accordance with the final report which will be presented by the Commission."
"Today, Mr President, the responsibility for the final outcome rests with the governments and political forces in these two countries."
"Mr President, it is a pity that the Commissioner had to go because now our immortal speeches will not make an impact on the EU’s future, but never mind."
"We have to congratulate him on a good job under very difficult conditions."
"Today we have to play tough but fair, and I underline the word ‘fair’, because we are not talking about the three months to come, we are talking about three generations."
"That is what we need to focus on."
"I am not about to underestimate the problems those two countries are facing, whether it be criminality, corruption, the judicial system or minorities, be they Roma or Hungarians, but we have to remember where those countries have come from."
"They have come a long way."
"That is what Finland has done over the last 50 years."
"Look at the fantastic progress Portugal has made in 20 years."
"Today we must say ‘no’ to populism and ‘yes’ to vision."
"We must say ‘yes’ to leadership, because the progress of those countries towards harmonisation in the bigger European family depends on political will."
"It depends on our will to build a more stable world."
"Let me remind you that we would not have had the Balkans tragedy if those countries had had the hope of joining the EU 20 years ago."
"This is the power of enlargement, and we must see the bigger picture and not indulge in populism."
"We have lots of ways of monitoring safeguard clauses, even sanctions, to keep an eye on progress, but it is essential for us to support democratic forces in those countries."
"We must support those who want to enforce the rule of law."
"That is what matters and we must believe that the democratic forces will win."
"Our moral duty today is to give people horizons – not borders."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nothing has been said in this debate about the with regard to equality between men and women; a guilty silence that sadly reflects the scant attention paid to this issue."
"Nevertheless, women in Romania have made great strides in the field of education: young women have a higher level of education than young men; in 2005, almost 55% of graduates were female, and women represent 40% of university lecturers."
"These data indicate the potential of the Romanian female population, but that potential is being frustrated in the political sphere, in which men completely dominate all levels of decision making."
"Another positive finding concerns the commitment made to secure more resources and administrative autonomy for the Romanian Agency for Equal Opportunities."
"Other measures have been undertaken in Bulgaria: the National Council for Equal Opportunities has been set up under the Prime Minister’s Office; the government has signed the optional protocol of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW); and with the recent elections, Bulgaria has become much closer to the European average in terms of the number of women present in parliament and in government."
"There certainly remains much to be done in terms of ensuring that there is genuine equality between men and women in the two countries, but the sooner Romania and Bulgaria become part of the EU, the faster this journey towards equality will be."
"I am therefore in favour of their accession on 1 January 2007."
"Mr President, I represent Poland, a recent member of the European Union."
"The memory of the large effort made by our country, the work of the citizens but also of the politicians and the civil service aimed at adapting to the exacting standards of the European Union, is still fresh in our minds."
"That is why I can appreciate the tremendous effort made by Bulgaria and Romania to implement reforms in preparation for integration."
"I therefore think that the European Commission should not delay the decision concerning the date of accession of both of these countries to the Community."
"Maintaining 1 January 2007 as the date of accession will be a sign of solidarity and an acknowledgement of the hard work that has been done by these two countries."
"Maintaining this date is all the more important because a change may be interpreted as an attempt to block or even reject the application for accession of both these countries, especially as we have recently witnessed protectionist tendencies within the European Union, or in other words moves to prevent access to the benefits of a common market and truly free movement of persons and services."
"I am aware that there are certain shortcomings which have been rightly pointed out by the European Commission in its report."
"I do believe, however, that the best way of overcoming these shortcomings is for the European Union and the European Commission to put pressure on the Bulgarian and Romanian governments to dispel all doubts and to solve all problems within the next six months."
"Indeed, I am thoroughly convinced that a clear and stable prospect of joining the Union is the best motivation for Bulgaria and Romania to make an additional effort and meet all the accession criteria."
"I am also convinced that, just as the enlargement of the European Union two years ago by 10 countries proved to be a political and economic success, the accession of Bulgaria and Romania on 1 January 2007 will prove to be equally successful."
"Mr President, this afternoon a very important event took place in Constanza County in Romania: the official opening of protected homes for over 100 people who currently live in unsatisfactory conditions."
"It came about as a partnership between the local county council, the Romanian Government and two Irish NGOs – Focus on Romania and the Aurelia Trust."
"There has been a lot of debate – indeed, dispute – in this House about how Romania is caring for its most vulnerable children and young adults with handicaps."
"If that focus has helped to improve – as I believe it has – the plight of these people, then it will all have been worthwhile, even if it has upset the authorities."
"Last week a report by Mental Disability Rights International caused huge concern and outrage because it outlined serious abuses in Romanian institutions."
"Today, that report is being discredited by some, perhaps too sweepingly."
"The problem of trafficking has been identified by the Commission, and all Member States – including my own country, Ireland – need to play their part to stop this cruel and horrific trade in vulnerable human beings."
"Perhaps, as Commissioner Rehn has outlined, we will resolve all these problems by October 2006, but these two countries must accede."
"– Mr President, it has been accepted by everyone that both Bulgaria and Romania have done a great deal in the direction of their accession to the European Union and I am delighted because the European Union is remaining firm in its position on the 'yes' it has given these two countries."
"Of course there are shortcomings."
"There are shortcomings in all countries before their accession to the European Union, but they remedy them."
"I am certain that both Bulgaria and Romania will use the time they have, working day and night, to demonstrate that they are in a position to take what we have promised them: the 'January train' for their accession and their unification with the European family."
"This is the historic challenge and I am sure that, with our and the Commission's and everyone else's help, these people will prove that they are big and will join the big family of the European Union on 1 January 2007."
"The debate is closed."
"I should like to highlight a problem that is very distressing in human terms: that of the adoption of Romanian children by European couples."
"By means of a moratorium dated June 2001, the Romanian authorities banned all international adoptions, except in exceptional circumstances: the adoption of siblings, of children aged over 6 years or of disabled children."
"Despite the fact that they were among the authorised exceptions, several dozen adoption applications have been left pending since being reviewed in 2001."
"Thus, 800 European families have been waiting for more than five years to adopt their children, even though their adoption applications had been validated prior to June 2001 by the Romanian adoption committee."
"These children know their adoptive parents and have a bond with them."
"They are now suffering from abandonment for a second time."
"What have become of the best interests of the child?"
"In December 2005, the European Parliament called on Romania to deal with these adoption application cases as quickly as possible, but no breakthrough has been observed up to now."
"All international adoption applications are systematically rejected."
"In March, applications submitted before the moratorium of June 2001 were rejected once again."
"Does the European Commission plan to put pressure on the Romanian Government so that a fair and humane solution might quickly be found in the interest of the children and of the adoptive families?"
"– In its communication of 25 October 2006, the European Commission highlighted ‘gaps in the preparation for membership which are of serious concern’."
"I will mention two main examples: corruption, which remains a serious problem that may threaten the internal market, and the substantial difficulties in implementing an effective system of financial management and control that enables the Structural Funds to be executed."
"There can be no denying the progress made or Bulgaria's and Romania's desire to join."
"Nevertheless, I doubt that the gaps of serious concern highlighted by the European Commission can be filled by the date on which these countries are due to join, 1 January 2007."
"With the arrival of the ten new Member States, socio-economic disparities have doubled in the enlarged Union, while the 15 are not stimulating European growth, their economic performance remaining rather average."
"Therefore, before we contemplate the accession of new countries, should not we first think about consolidating the Union of 25 Member States?"
"I do not believe, therefore, that the European Union, Bulgaria or Romania will be ready by 2007."
"That is why I am calling on the Council not to confuse speed with haste when looking ahead to these countries’ accession."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0207/2006)."
"The following questions have been submitted to the Commission."
". Mr Ebner refers to the need to protect children and young people from aggressive advertising for ringtones, mobile phones, games, etc. and asks whether the Commission intends to take action on this."
"The recently adopted Unfair Commercial Practices Directive bans aggressive commercial practices and gives specific protection to children and young people."
"If a commercial practice is specifically aimed at a particular group of consumers such as children, its impact will be assessed from the perspective of the average member of that group."
"Furthermore, the directive bans direct pressure on children to purchase."
"The Distance Selling Directive also protects consumers who purchase goods and services at a distance, in other words with no face-to-face contact."
"It includes provisions on prior information."
"When providing that information, the supplier must have due regard for the protection of minors."
"The Commission has already launched a review of eight of the consumer directives, including the Distance Selling Directive."
"Issues such as those raised by Mr Ebner will be addressed in the review."
"A communication on the review will be published this autumn."
"First of all, thank you very much, Commissioner, for your detailed and very reassuring remarks."
"You have said the first data will be available in the autumn."
"Is there also a further timetable that will allow us to see when the stricter rules, which from what you have said are certainly necessary in this area, will actually come into force?"
"Could you tell me anything more about this timetable, which will be set after the autumn?"
". The deadline for the transposition of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive into national law is 12 June 2007, and the new laws must be applicable in the Member States from 12 December 2007."
"In accordance with the better regulation principles, the Commission will work closely with the Member States during this transposition period in order to facilitate timely and correct dispositions and uniform applications."
"I hope that answers the honourable Member’s question."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child declares that the state should provide alternative care for children temporarily or permanently deprived of their family environment or for children who cannot, in their own interests, be allowed to remain in that environment."
"The Declaration also supports the use of options other than placing the child in an institution, wherever such options arise."
"There are many reasons why children remain in institutions away from their families."
"It may be because their parents are unable to look after them due to illness, death or imprisonment, because the children need protecting from abuse or neglect, or because the institutions are able to provide appropriate care for disabled or sick children."
"Children may also be placed in institutions due to delinquency or anti-social behaviour or because they have committed a crime."
"These groups share the common characteristic of a very high threat of social exclusion, and great effort is required to prevent them from slipping into persistent exclusion and poverty."
"It is also necessary to provide the support essential to their proper development and integration into society."
"At present we face difficulties in obtaining an accurate picture of institutional care in Europe, as there is a lack of comparable data."
"The Commission has noted, however, that many of the large traditional institutions are gradually beginning to be replaced by more short-term care, and that there is a general preference for reuniting families or securing foster care in a new family."
"Ever more attention is being paid to the living conditions of children and young people in the European Union."
"The European Council, meeting in March 2006, challenged the Member States to take measures towards a rapid and substantial reduction in child poverty and to provide all children with equal opportunities, regardless of their social background."
"In the action plans for social inclusion that the Member States submitted to the Commission, children who faced the threat of poverty and social exclusion were identified as a priority group."
"Some Member States have set out concrete goals at a domestic level for reducing child poverty."
"The Commission is aware of the fact that in some EU Member States the facilities that care for mentally or physically disabled children and adults make excessive use of methods of restraint, whether pharmacological or physical, and the Commission regards this as unacceptable."
"The communication recently issued by the Commission on the position of physically disabled persons in the enlarged EU places great emphasis on de-institutionalising the care for physically disabled persons."
"The Community has only limited powers in this area, of course, and the Commission therefore supports the use of a whole range of instruments, including an anti-discrimination programme, national action plans for social inclusion and the European Social Fund."
"The Commission would also like to state that it will soon be publishing a communication on EU activities in defence and support of children’s rights."
"Thank you for that very exhaustive, full and explanatory statement, Commissioner."
"I welcome the statement and I am grateful to you for giving so much attention to the position of those who are excluded from society, particularly when they are minors."
"I salute your determination to pursue a policy of inclusion across Europe."
"However, may I draw his attention to the Daphne-funded analyses, recently conducted surveys focusing particularly on long-term institutional care, averaging 13 months, of children under three years of age, which is the time when they are most likely to be damaged neurologically."
"I might perhaps send you those reports, Commissioner."
"I believe another one is about to start."
"My final point is that the use of caged beds in some of the existing Member States is definable as inhumane and I hope to take that topic up with you personally as well."
"Thank you, Commissioner, I am most grateful to you."
". Mr President, Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, I am of course delighted to learn about the DAPHNE report, as I am delighted to learn about every report and every piece of objective data that enables us to make progress in this field."
"The mere fact that the study has been financed through the DAPHNE programme provides a signal that Europe is making solid progress over this matter and is striving to achieve its goal."
"The question of de-institutionalisation is of the highest importance and I feel that whatever additional efforts we manage to deploy will be both reasonable and necessary."
"Concerning the question of caged beds, I think you are right that in some countries such beds are used fitted with nets and that there is often controversy as to whether they are used excessively or even simply for the convenience of staff."
"The problem – in my view – is not entirely one of technique so much as one of a generally restrictive culture which in some institutions and in some countries has persisted to a greater extent than would correspond to the high humanitarian standards which the EU is striving to enforce, since a similar kind of inhumane interference in people’s minds can also result from the use of pharmacological substances, if these are used without proper need and on the basis of a restrictive culture."
"I do indeed consider it necessary to clear away and overthrow this restrictive culture throughout the EU, but at the end of the day the techniques through which the culture manifests itself are not so important."
"You are right that caged beds may be a problem in several countries, but I have noted with some satisfaction that this is not the case in many countries, although only in some is there is a strong trend towards abolishing this method."
"– Commissioner, we know that child care is in a sorry state in Romania, as the Commission itself noted in the progress reports."
"Other problems now seem to be coming to the fore."
"Has this problem now been dealt with or solved, or has the Commission simply shifted its focus?"
"What is the state of child care in that accession country?"
". The Commission has of course not allowed this very important issue to disappear from view."
"In each case we can report striking progress, even though in some areas, for example the issue of international adoption, very intensive discussions are still continuing."
"The Commission has not in any way abandoned the idea of focusing on children’s rights, as I firmly believe that the European Union has a certain duty to be socially responsible, and this responsibility must also be implemented within the context of accession talks."
"It is therefore out of the question that we might fail to appreciate the importance of this issue."
"Commissioner, again and again we are shocked when cases of child abuse come to light."
"Sadly, the authorities often fail to act soon enough and, for want of cooperation, it can be months before the courts allow a child to be removed from the environment in which it was being abused."
"What steps does the Commission plan to take so that cases of child abuse are recognised better in future and action can be taken more quickly?"
". It is of course necessary to state that questions relating to the fight against child abuse fall within national jurisdictions."
"The dragging out of these cases, the long waiting periods, poor detection rates and the like are all a matter for national bodies."
"It is difficult for the EU to get involved in this area directly, although it is possible within the framework of the European Social Fund projects, or specialised projects, or within the framework of discussions and the exchange of information, and we are putting considerable effort into doing this."
"I believe it is also very important to build on and continue developing initiatives, which mostly come under the authority of my colleague Mr Frattini, and which relate to the fight against people trafficking, domestic violence and so on. Even in this area the European Commission is striving in the first place to formulate at least an exchange of the defining data, in order to be able to compare the situation in different Member States, and on the basis of this to formulate specific approaches."
"The basic principle still applies that social matters, which frequently include tragic and sensitive issues, fall within national jurisdictions, which means that if a case has not been resolved for a long time, it will be an issue much more for the domestic authorities than for the EU, although we should use such jurisdiction as we do have to the full."
"I am part of the advisory council for the Mental Disability Advocacy Centre and we have been raising the issue of caged beds for a number of years now."
"But you are quite right – it is not just a question of caged beds; it is restraints on the beds, the use of pharmaceuticals and, more importantly perhaps, it is the lack of community care spaces."
"Could you please do all in your power, particularly with the Green Paper on mental health coming to the end of its consultation period on 31 May, to address the issue of community-based care and getting people away from institutionalised care, not just for children but for people with mental health problems as well."
". Mrs Lynne, your opinion is clearly in complete agreement with the opinion of the Commission, as expressed in the relevant communications."
"For both of us, the way forward is de-institutionalisation, in other words transferring care as much as possible to local authorities, the community and of course families."
"I feel that in this situation we must also consider very carefully what sort of support to provide to family members or to the people who, although not direct family members themselves, have nonetheless taken over the care of another person."
"When we consider these things in an ordinary way, we think of financial support, but in my view it is also necessary to provide some form of qualification, since for families that have to assume such a responsibility it is very important to know something about basic nursing methods, and the basic principles that are to be followed, as well as the limits that such care can impose."
"It is an unbearable form of ethical torment to have the feeling that you can still go one step further when in reality it is no longer possible, so in this respect we can ease the burden on those that are providing help."
"In essence this is the Commission’s core strategy: a move away from institutions that are often inhumane, that often have a restrictive culture and that are often structurally incapable of accepting the individuality and quality of life of the people who come into contact with them, and in the direction of local authorities, natural communities and of course families, in the broader sense of the word."
". The Member’s question gives the impression that the Commission has proposed to increase the acceptable level of adventitious contamination of organic products with GMOs from 0.1% to 0.9%."
"I am very happy to have the opportunity to clarify this matter, because the issue has been raised both with myself and with my services on many occasions and in many different fora."
"In my view, the concerns are based on a misunderstanding of our proposal and of existing legislation regarding organic products and GMOs."
"To read our proposal as ‘to allow 0.9% of GMO content in products labelled organic’ is a clear misinterpretation."
"I should like to explain why."
"Not all consumers are aware of this, but currently there is no specific legislation on permissible GMO thresholds in organic products, there are no permissible GMO thresholds in organic products."
"The existing organic production rules ban the deliberate use of GMOs or GM-derived products without laying down any threshold for the unintended presence of traces of GMOs."
"There is, therefore, no question of these rules ‘already permitting a 0.1% contamination of GMOs in products labelled organic’, as the honourable Member stated in her question."
"These rules date from a period when GMOs were not generally cultivated or imported."
"This situation has obviously now changed."
"The proposal of the Commission maintains the ban on the deliberate use of GMOs or GM-derived products."
"However, we propose that an operator may rely on GM labels when assuring that no GMOs enter his/her production."
"These labels provide for effective evidence as, today, GMOs or products derived from GMOs generally have to be labelled as GM according to Community legislation."
"This de facto means that the same 0.9% threshold for the unintended presence of GMO traces applies to organic products as to other products."
"We believe that if we tried to impose a stricter labelling threshold for organic products, this would simply make life much more difficult for organic producers, because we realise that complete purity is unattainable in practice."
"Even so – and I would like to stress this – it does not mean, as the honourable Member states, that the proposal ‘increased the level of permitted GMO contamination to 0.9 %’."
"The operator will have to continue to take all appropriate steps to avoid the presence of GMOs!"
"What, on the contrary, would really change under our proposal is that a product labelled as GM could no longer be labelled as organic at the same time if the 0.9% threshold is exceeded, which is in fact possible today under the present legislation."
"On the health aspects, it has to be considered that GMOs may only be placed on the market following a specific case-by-case authorisation procedure."
"The European Union has arguably the most stringent and tough risk assessment and authorisation procedure for GMOs in the world, and that covers both environmental and health aspects."
"For this reason, the discussion about unintended presence of GMOs does not relate to safety issues."
"In conclusion, I really must emphasise once again that in relation to the adventitious contamination of organic products by GMOs, the proposal under discussion at present amounts to a very important tightening-up of the rules and not, as it has often been suggested, a weakening."
"This is very important."
"It is really a tightening-up of the situation."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for that very comprehensive clarification of a complex issue."
"As you appreciate, GMOs are in the top five of real concerns of European citizens, and public opinion in Europe is very sceptical about GM products and is very worried about ‘Frankenfoods’."
"The issue for us is: one, we have to get the right information out there and, two, how do we assure that with the Commission proposals, as you have outlined, this information reaches the public at large?"
"I can read you a number of emails that I have received in which people are very concerned."
"Recently the WTO confirmed the ruling against the EU in the case of GMOs."
"What implications are there for this in what you have just stated as the policy?"
". Then I am quite sure we received the same emails."
"Therefore, today is a great opportunity for me to clarify some of the misunderstandings."
"I believe the most essential step was that we were able to agree in the Council in November 2002 on the traceability and labelling of GMOs."
"That was crucial."
"The final outcome might not have satisfied everybody, but it was important that products that are produced directly from a GM product – for example, tomato ketchup produced directly from GM tomatoes – must be labelled."
"Therefore, consumers can actually choose whether they want to buy those products."
"Farmers can now avoid, for example, soybeans that have been produced by GM methods and buy the conventional type of feed for their animals."
"That was a major achievement."
"The WTO dispute we had with the United States does not change anything."
"I wonder if the Commissioner would be helped in her information campaign if she were to tell us how much it would cost producers of organic food to reduce the ceiling from 0.9% to 0.1% on GMO content."
"What would it cost the organic producers?"
"What would it cost their customers, and what would be the impact on availability of organic food for the customers?"
"Can she give me those figures?"
"No, but I can give you an idea of the consequence: if we were to reduce the ceiling to 0.1%, it would have dramatic consequences for organic producers."
"It would be so expensive that, in my judgement, the availability of organic products to the consumer would be reduced dramatically, because the price would be out of proportion to the price the consumer is prepared to pay."
"To give you a clear figure is simply impossible, but we have calculated and made it clear that if anyone did wish to reduce the ceiling to 0.1%, that would have a serious impact on the survival of organic farmers."
"– Commissioner, to date we still have no long-term studies of the effects of genetically modified organisms."
"In view of the European public’s marked scepticism about genetic engineering and the recent WTO ruling, is the European Union planning to make any studies of the medium and long-term health damage caused by genetically engineered food?"
". Before allowing the import or the growing of any GM product, the European Food Safety Authority has to have the possibility to go through all the details – both from a health point of view and from an environmental point of view – to calculate the risk or the consequences for either health or the environment."
"So, from my point of view these two areas are covered by all EFSA’s efforts to try to have the ruling in place before allowing either import or growing."
". We all know that the international roaming prices are very high."
"Parliament and the national regulatory authorities have drawn our attention to that fact several times."
"They have called for action at EU level to solve the problem, and rightly so, because the high roaming costs prevent citizens and businesses conducting cross-border activities from benefiting fully from the internal market."
"As a first step, in October 2005 I launched a website to provide consumers with transparency on prices."
"At the same time I publicly declared that six months later I would benchmark the progress."
"Should there not be a drastic price reduction, I would regulate."
"In March 2006 we compared the roaming prices to their level of autumn 2005."
"We saw that in 19 Member States the prices were more or less stable, in four Member States they had gone up."
"On that basis I announced a regulation and we started public consultation."
"The public consultation came to an end on 12 May."
"We had 150 contributions."
"My services and I are now analysing those contributions, and will draw our conclusions and present them together with an impact assessment before summer 2006."
"At the same time, in July, the Commission will present a draft regulation."
"I have noticed that in the meantime, understanding that the Commission will act, some market players have announced price reductions."
"That is a very interesting move and is in the interests of our consumers."
"I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for this initiative, as I did when I was preparing the question, and also for the explanations that you have given to us, which show the level of interest and concern concerning this issue."
"I would like to say that this Regulation needs to be set in motion as soon as possible."
"You have already explained this, but I think that this is an extremely important issue for encouraging mobility within Europe, both in terms of employment and in general."
"I hope that this Regulation will come into force as soon as possible."
"I would also like to thank the Commissioner for her initiative to date and her efforts in this regard, but I would like to ask her if it is the intention of the Commission to reduce the roaming charges completely?"
"In the internal market procedure, why should there be a difference?"
"We should have the same charges throughout Europe."
"This would, I believe, be the remit of the Commission and I would expect that to be the intention."
"I should like to express my thanks to the Commissioner."
"Roaming prices for a four-minute call still vary from as little as 20 cents for a Finnish consumer calling from Sweden to EUR 13.05 for a Maltese consumer in Latvia."
"Revenues from international roaming charges total about EUR 10 billion and regulation should save the consumer between 40% and 60%."
"Could the Commissioner confirm that it is her intention that whatever regulation is needed will pass into law by summer of next year?"
". I would like to thank honourable Members for their help in this matter."
"It is indeed a very important matter, not only for our citizens who want to take advantage of mobility, but also for workers."
"I am thinking most of all of the small- and medium-sized businesses that send their workers on trans-border activities."
"This is very heavy on those businesses, so we should try to bring the roaming prices down to the real costs."
"That is why we will now have to analyse what we have received as input with these 150 contributions."
"I announced in March that my intention is to switch to the home price tariff."
"Under which conditions this will happen is something I am considering at the moment on the basis of the inputs to the consultation."
"I can assure Parliament that the intention is to put a regulation before the Commission in July and then it will be in the hands of Parliament and the Council to see whether they can use the fast-track procedure to get this regulation accepted."
"Once this regulation is accepted it will go directly into implementation and that means, I believe, that before summer or in summer 2007 consumers and workers could profit from much lower roaming tariffs."
"As you can see, getting rid of roaming charges is one of the Commission’s most popular initiatives."
"I would like to return to the first question from Mrs Badia I Cutchet."
"She asked about the legal basis of this regulation."
"What will the legal basis be and how will you cooperate with DG Competition on this initiative?"
"The DG Competition makes regulations on the basis of a complaint that has been introduced, whereas the Internal Market and Services DG can work on the markets in regulations."
"Here we are talking about Article 95."
"I have consulted with the legal services to find out if Article 95 is the right basis."
"I will certainly continue to do so throughout the process."
"I am convinced and satisfied by the answers from the legal services that Article 95 provides an appropriate basis for our proposal."
"Commissioner, yesterday I was reading a British paper whilst I was travelling to Strasbourg."
"It is a rather lengthy journey, so I had plenty of time on my hands."
"I read an article setting out all the telephone providers’ arguments as to why you do not understand their objections."
"Is it not the case that those same companies benefit from access to the single market and from the European Union whilst foisting charges upon EU citizens?"
"Is this not another example of the European Union standing up for the interests of European consumers over the overwhelming power of monopoly companies?"
". The internal market works to the advantage of businesses, big and small, and consumers."
"The fact is that the internal market has worked to the advantage of developing the GSM system, which has become a world standard."
"We are very proud of that."
"But the anomaly is that although our citizens have one of the best – if not the best – telephone systems in the world, both fixed and mobile, nevertheless when they cross a border they are somehow punished for doing so and cannot take advantage of the common market."
"That is exactly why I thought it was indispensable for the Commission to step in."
"I am not the regulating kind of Commissioner; I always prefer the market to solve the problem by itself."
"That is why the market had been warned a long time in advance."
"It had been warned by Parliament; it had been warned by the national regulators; it had been warned several times by the Commission, and it did not move."
"The Commission had to resolve to put a regulation on the table before the first market forces began to move a little in the right direction."
"I believe that it is time the Commission gave back the advantages of the internal market to the small and medium-sized businesses and to our consumers."
"I would like to join in the praise for the tough stand the Commissioner has taken, but I want to reinforce what she said about not wanting to over-regulate."
"Can she confirm that she has taken real notice of the European regulators, who have, I think, been fairly critical of her initial approach and are being very cautionary about what she is proposing to do?"
"Would she please confirm to me that she is not intending to impose regulation in the marketplace that would require operators to deliver services below cost, because that would mean low-income users of mobile phones subsidising the premium rates of customers such as MEPs?"
". I have the impression that at the moment the low-income consumers are subsidising the consumers in large industries which are able to negotiate special prices with the mobile operators."
"We would like to reverse that position and see fair prices based on markets and cost for the consumer, not the unfair prices we have now."
"Most of all, we would like to give back to the consumers the advantages of the common market and promote mobility rather than being a barrier to it."
"I have read the advice of the European Regulators’ Group with great interest and I am working very closely with that group."
"It shares my objective, which is to bring about substantial reductions in international roaming charges."
"Our services are meeting members of the group today to discuss with them the details of how this should be done."
"That is why I am unable to give details of our regulation at the moment, because I have to see everything that is on the table – 150 contributions – and to listen to the national regulators."
"Having done that, I will draw up a paper on a draft regulation for the Commission and I am sure that Parliament will discuss this paper thoroughly later on this summer."
"Can the European Commission outline what initiatives it is pursuing to promote the safest use of the Internet in Europe?"
". The Commission is pursuing several initiatives to promote the safest possible use of the Internet in Europe."
"Since 1996 the Commission has been active in the fight against illegal content such as child pornography, or racist content, as also in the protection of children from accessing legal but harmful content such as adult pornography, violent content and gambling."
"Parliament is examining the Commission’s proposal to update the Television Without Frontiers directive in order to cover all audiovisual media services."
"A basic canon of rules will then apply to all audiovisual content, whatever the means by which it is distributed, including television and the Internet."
"These will relate to safety, protection of minors, prohibition of incitement to hatred, and include some qualitative restrictions on advertising targeted at minors."
"We also have a recommendation on protection of minors and human dignity in audiovisual and information services, which provides guidelines for national legislation about electronic media."
"On the basis of this recommendation, in 2005 we launched the Safer Internet Plus programme."
"That programme has established a network of 21 hotlines throughout Europe, which enable the general public to complain about illegal content found on the Internet."
"These hotlines investigate and refer complaints to the appropriate organisations, police, Internet service providers or hotlines in other countries."
"We also have a network of 23 awareness-raising projects, which provide advice to children, teenagers, parents and educators about the risks of the Internet and the way to deal with them."
"This is done either directly with the help of brochures, websites and TV spots or through the intermediary of multiplier organisations like schools."
"Then there is the filtering and parenting software, which is a key means to protect children from accessing harmful content."
"The Commission will provide guidance to parents on the effectiveness of filtering software and services."
"A study is under way and due to be completed by December this year."
"The Commission is also actively involved with the Internet and the mobile phone industry with a view to promoting self-regulation as a means of limiting the flow of harmful and illegal content."
"The Commission has taken legislative measures against spam, spyware and moleware, which are also viruses."
"A full list of these will be communicated to the honourable Members."
"I would also like to say that at international level the follow-up conference to the World Summit on the Information Society will tackle all these negative aspects of the new technologies."
"Let me say today that I am sure that with the help of Parliament the Safer Internet Day in spring 2007 will become a real important awareness-raising day in all our Member States."
"– Thank you very much for your answer, Commissioner."
"I also think it is a very good thing that the World Information Summit is to be held again."
"But do you think that the measures you have taken really will be enough?"
"What measures do you plan to take if this bad material nevertheless continues to be found on the Internet?"
"Are parents and guardians also being trained and made aware of these matters, by the Commission among others?"
"Mr President, I am afraid Mrs Schierhuber is right. This bad material is on the Internet and it will continue to be."
"We are doing all we can to get it removed from the Internet, but it is a world wide web and we do not have access to these contents everywhere."
"That is why the most important thing is to provide both parents and schools with the necessary information so that they can prepare children for what they will find on the net."
"With this in mind, all our information campaigns and awareness campaigns will, I hope, culminate in a very successful Safer Internet Day early in 2007."
"I would also like the European Parliament to support us, with Members taking related initiatives in their constituencies."
"A coordinated campaign would surely benefit our children all across Europe."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner."
"However, considering that to date the prohibition of these unwanted sites has not been so successful, what confidence do you have that your proposals will eradicate such undesirable sites from the Internet?"
". As I have already said, it is a worldwide web and everybody can submit content to it."
"That is why we need not only to raise the awareness of educators and parents but also to lobby internet providers, as I do regularly, to take responsibility and to establish self-regulatory measures."
"I really believe in self-regulation in that field."
"If many stakeholders self-regulate, there will be a result."
"In the revised Television Without Frontiers Directive, the basic values of our societies will also apply to the Internet."
"This will be of the utmost importance, and responsibility will lie with those working in online services."
"Commissioner, you cannot control what is on the web, but you can control access in the following way."
"With the advent of broadband, the Internet is on all the time."
"A lot of new computers have just one password to turn on the computer and do not have a separate password to control access to the Internet."
"Therefore children can wander in, broadband is on and they can access the Internet straight away."
"If there was simple control on access and more passwords on computers themselves, then parents, schools and others would have greater control."
"I ask you to look at that issue, particularly as broadband means the Internet is on all the time."
". We have a real problem with the new technologies, which is that for the first time in human history maybe children know more than parents and educators."
"That is why we have to provide parents with very simple software, simple filters and parenting devices so that they can take their responsibility."
"That is why we have launched a study to find out what filters and services exist for parents."
"At the end of the year, when we present this study, it will be most beneficial to organise an awareness-raising campaign on those filters in order to inform parents what they can do to help their children."
"Very often parents are lost in such cases because they are not very familiar with technology – at least not as familiar as the new generation is."
"Questions Nos 55 to 58 will be answered in writing."
"As the author is not present, Question No 59 lapses."
"Political attention within the EU on WTO negotiations has tended to focus on agricultural and textile production and has somehow ignored the far more significant economic potential of commercial services, including financial services."
"Poor access to finance, including a wide range of innovative financial products, hinders the economic growth in developing countries, especially in the SMEs sector, while the EU Member States cannot bring to fruition the enormous potential of financial services."
"What action is the Commission taking to incorporate new and improved GATS commitments on financial services into multilateral and bilateral requests to its WTO trading partners?"
". Let me assure you that the Commission is well aware of the significant economic potential of commercial services, including financial services."
"This is an important part of the WTO negotiations and it has not been ignored, even if it has received less publicity than other parts."
"The Commission has highlighted the importance of access to finance in developing countries on many occasions, for example in a communication that it co-sponsored last year in the WTO."
"Financial services are clearly one of the European Commission’s priorities in the services negotiations and, therefore, figure prominently in the European Commission’s bilateral services requests."
"Furthermore, the European Community was one of the co-sponsors of the recently tabled financial services plurilateral request and is particularly active in plurilateral and bilateral negotiations with our trading partners in Geneva."
"Unfortunately, the offers in financial services on the table so far are mostly disappointing."
"This applies particularly to many countries in Asia."
"Certain ASEAN members, with very low existing commitments, have not made any financial services offers and larger players, such as China and particularly India, also have room to improve their offers."
"In short, most of our main requests in financial services have not been addressed by our trading partners."
"That is why the Commission will continue to press very hard and at all levels to convince our trading partners of the need to correct the situation by submitting substantially revised offers in July this year."
"– I am very sorry that Mr Mandelson, a Member of the Commission, was unable to attend and I would not like to ask a question which is perhaps not in your area of expertise."
"I believe that in your work you are able to say whether the Commission is considering possibilities to broaden the financial services dialogue."
"Because now I have an impression that everything is focused on agricultural products and textiles, whereas in fact, once the trade structure has changed, the financial services sector would be in an ideal position to help changing the trade structure."
"Is the Commission devoting much time to debating the expansion and development of financial services?"
". Yes, we do that and we impress on our trading partners the need to correct this situation."
"We believe that they are in a position to submit substantially revised offers concerning financial services by July this year."
"We will continue to insist on it but, as you know, trade negotiations are bilateral and plurilateral negotiations: we need to receive this offer from them and we are trying hard to put pressure on them to make such offers."
"I am aware that Commissioner Mandelson has pushed financial services quite hard and I am pleased to hear from the Commissioner that he is intending to do so."
"Does he agree with me that it is somewhat ironic that a country like India, which has call centres from European companies selling insurance, mortgages, loans and other financial services to Europeans, denies those very services to its own people, and will he press India in particular to reform its protectionist system for financial services?"
". We are asking the Indian authorities to improve access to these services and I hope they will comply with our request."
"– Will the European Commission step up pressure on emerging economies and on previous developing countries to open up their services markets?"
"This is the core question and I believe that, for the European Union, the symmetry between the Union markets which have already been opened up in the agricultural sector, on the one hand, and the corresponding opening up of other countries in the services sectors in general, on the other hand, should be strengthened."
"This should also apply to access to the market for non-agricultural products."
"Without these preconditions, the Doha Round will not have symmetrical results."
"There will be no balance as regards its results."
". I can confirm what I already said."
"We are working all the time with those countries so that they improve or strengthen the services offered, including financial services."
"It is part of our negotiation strategy."
"It is not that we are only taking a defensive position on agriculture; we are active in all areas that concern the trade negotiations."
"We firmly believe that trade concessions should be reciprocal."
"On 8 March 2006, the Commission published its strategy for promoting biofuels (COM(2006)0034 final)."
"However, there are social and ecological questions to be asked about this."
"For example, it is necessary to organise compulsory certification of biofuels."
"This is intended to ensure that all biofuels placed on the market comply with a set of social and ecological criteria in order to be eligible for tax concessions."
"Another unsatisfactory point is that the Commission suggests that, in exchange for the use of biofuels, vehicle producers will not be expected to make as much effort to develop and market more economical vehicles."
"In the light of these problems, how does the Commission intend to ensure the ecological integrity of the use of biofuels?"
". Biofuels are needed for two main reasons."
"Firstly, our energy security depends on developing alternatives to oil."
"Among the solutions that can be put into practice today, there is none with the same potential as biofuels."
"Secondly, the transport sector is not contributing enough to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions."
"Biofuels can significantly contribute to this aim."
"The EU has decided to achieve rapid development of biofuels use."
"The Biofuels Directive, adopted in 2003, set a reference value of a 2% market share for biofuels in 2005 and 5.75% in 2010, compared with a 0.2% share in 2000."
"In adopting national indicative targets under the Directive, Member States have been somewhat less ambitious, but, overall, the target is a share of about 1.4% in 2005."
"In the light of this, the review of the functioning of the Biofuels Directive, which the Commission is due to carry out this year, is particularly important."
"We have just launched the public consultation exercise for this review."
"The public consultation poses a number of questions."
"First of all, will the 5.75% objective for 2010 be achieved through the present policies and measures?"
"If not, what can be done to ensure that the objective will be achieved?"
"Should the Community set objectives for the share of biofuels in 2015 and 2020?"
"The Commission has taken no position on these questions so far."
"Turning to the question of environmental impact, it is important to start from the basis that biofuels bring a number of environmental benefits."
"However, it is also true that their production can have some adverse effects on the environment."
"I believe that second-generation biofuels can have even greater environmental benefits and their introduction should be accelerated as much as possible."
"The Commission will make sure, therefore, that the promotion of biofuels continues to bring benefits in environmental terms, as well as the benefit of security of supply."
"For that reason, as part of the review of the Directive, the Commission is asking for views on the introduction of a certification system."
"This could ensure that only biofuels whose cultivation meets required environmental standards count towards objectives in the Directive."
"The initial reaction of environmental NGOs, fuel suppliers and other stakeholders has been encouragingly positive."
"As regards car manufacturers' obligations, carmakers have voluntarily agreed to limit average CO2 emissions from new cars to 140g per km by 2008/2009."
"The Commission does not consider that the use of biofuels should in any way reduce the objectives agreed upon with the car industry."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your response."
"I am delighted that the Commission would like to further sustain our mobility as a priority."
"That is absolutely vital."
"While I take note of the undertakings you have given, there is something I would like to ask you."
"What is at issue is not just the production of biofuels here in the European Union, but also the production and possible purchase of biofuels from outside it."
"We have received reports that this production is done under circumstances which are not ideal, these include deforestation of the Amazon, social exploitation and the excessive use of pesticides."
"What does the Commission intend to do about this?"
"You have also responded to my question about the automotive industry, but what you left unanswered is the question as to whether the automotive industry should not commit to producing cars that are more economical in their use of petrol."
"That is, after all, what this debate is all about."
"A reduction in fuels ..."
". The same environmental sustainability standards should apply outside the Union as well."
"As I said in my answer to the first question, we should look upon the issues in our trade negotiations."
"The development of biofuels should not be at the expense of the rainforests."
"It must also be done in a sustainable way."
"I believe that we have all the means to follow that path."
"On the car industry’s obligation to make more efficient engines and more efficient cars, we will follow that path as well."
"It does not replace the other path, however: they are two separate tracks going in the same direction – security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability."
"But on the matter of improved standards for cars, the answer is the use of biofuels."
"Only both combined can give the necessary result."
"Firstly, I welcome your reply, Commissioner."
"I would urge you along the route of certification."
"You are right, it would be quite wrong if, for example, the use of palm oil led to the destruction of forests in Indonesia."
"So I would push you in that direction."
"The other problem we have with biofuels is that while we are getting cars produced that can take biofuels and getting drivers willing to drive the cars, there is still a great difficulty in most parts of Europe in finding petrol stations that will stock biofuels and enable the consumer to take advantage of this ecologically friendly system."
"Will he do what he can to encourage more petrol companies to have a biofuel pump in their stations?"
". We recently adopted the biomass action plan and a communication on biofuels."
"Both these documents have been discussed in the Council and there is definitely a need for Member States to pursue a more proactive policy to bring biofuels onto the market."
"The Commission encourages this as far as it can, but many measures could be introduced by Member States themselves."
"It is not for the Commission to ensure that there are enough petrol stations stocking biofuels."
"For example, I wish there were more of them in Brussels."
"– Commissioner, I am very glad that it is at last being recognised throughout Europe and the world that we need to be independent of the politically unstable regions from which the European Union gets much of its energy."
"My question to the Commission is this: will the Commission also bring pressure to bear on the engine, car or, indeed, the motor vehicle industry?"
"We know today that biofuels can be produced without esterification, but engines have to be designed so that people can drive using both fuels."
"Is any thought being given to this?"
". I do not believe we need to do anything to achieve our objectives in the engine industry at present because admixture is permissible and technically possible in small quantities."
"Of course we will need more flexibility in the future."
"The car industry will follow our political trend."
"The most important thing at present is to show that the European Union really is prepared to do that."
"In reality, only very small technical changes are required to increase the use of biofuel."
"The most important objective should be to bring biofuel on to the market in as many Member States as possible, since it is not available everywhere yet."
"In some States it is already."
"The Commission is therefore trying hard to persuade those States that have not yet done enough to achieve their own objectives."
"What are the next steps for the Commission with regard to reducing the European Union's dependence on gas and oil imports from Russia?"
". I think this will be rather a long answer because it cannot be answered in just a few sentences."
"I would like to start by saying that today Russia plays a very important role in securing Europe’s energy supplies."
"Currently Russia provides almost 30% of the EU’s oil imports and 45% of our gas imports."
"Or, to be more exact, 25% of our consumed gas."
"As a result, Russia is the largest single external energy supplier."
"A considerable amount of our Iranian imports are also provided by Russia, so the EU and Russian markets for crude oil and oil products, as well as natural gas, are tightly interlinked with numerous pipelines, maritime and rail links and numerous contracts that our companies have concluded with Russian suppliers."
"A broad relationship and energy dialogue was established between Russia and the Commission in 2000."
"Moreover, the common economic space agreed during the EU-Russia Summit in May 2005 includes cooperation in a wide range of energy-related activities."
"So the energy dialogue aims to discuss issues related to energy policy and market developments, infrastructure developments, and EU-Russia cooperation in multilateral energy fora."
"I believe that Russia will remain an important supplier for the EU in the future."
"Taking into account the expected growth of energy consumption in the EU, I expect Russia to continue to supply around 25% of the gas consumed in the EU which, in absolute terms, would mean an increase in supplies."
"The European Union and many countries worldwide are becoming ever more dependent on imported hydrocarbons."
"I would like to reiterate that in the long term there are only three countries that have a lot of natural gas resources: Russia, Iran and Qatar."
"At the same time, the EU will import 70% of its energy in 2030, compared with 50% today."
"Over time, the remaining fossil fuel resources will become more concentrated, as I said, in a rather small number of countries."
"As a consequence, energy interdependence is becoming a global issue, with major shared concerns, such as increased demand for limited resources in the world, the lack of investment in new production and the climate change issues."
"Therefore, a broad range of actions at EU and Member-State level are required to address these challenges."
"It has been highlighted in the Green Paper."
"I have just highlighted one of the actions in my answer to the honourable Member’s previous question about biofuels."
"That is one of the actions that we indicate."
"The Green Paper emphasised opportunities, such as policies to improve first of all energy efficiency and energy savings, as well as enhancing the market penetration of renewable energy sources."
"It also highlighted external policy options, such as strengthening the framework for energy relations between the EU and Russia in order to give more confidence to both sides, as well as policies and measures to diversification of the geographical sources and transportation routes of external energy supplies to the EU."
"In this context, it is important to underline that the EU is making continuous efforts to improve energy relations with other energy-producing organisations – such as OPEC, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the countries of the Caspian Basin and north Africa – as well as with the consuming regions in the framework of the International Energy Forum, the International Energy Agency, G8 and through bilateral agreements and dialogues."
"This policy of diversification is not directed against our current suppliers: it is a necessity dictated by the global energy security challenges and by the challenge posed by global warming and other environment-related issues."
"Together with the Austrian Presidency of the European Union, I recently sent a letter to the Russian Energy Minister, Mr Khristenko, on the issue of energy cooperation and in particular gas interdependency."
"In this letter we reiterated the importance the EU attributes to deepening energy relations with Russia, the EU’s most important energy supplier."
"Furthermore, we stressed that the importance the EU attaches to diversifying sources of supply should not be interpreted as limiting deliveries of Russian gas to the EU market, particularly as demand for gas in Europe is forecast to rise."
"In this relationship with Russia, the EU is promoting such principles as market reciprocity, fair transit conditions through Russia and third-party access to infrastructure in Russia."
"Therefore, the short answer to the questions that have been asked is that we are looking for diversification, but it is extremely important to establish measures on the demand side, because only with demand-side measures, energy efficiency and savings can we actually establish our energy independence more strongly and, at the same time, look towards our goals of sustainability and competitiveness."
"Commissioner, I believe President Putin’s politicisation of Gazprom is just as dangerous as the politicisation of OPEC by a few Gulf States 30 years ago."
"Energy independence is therefore very important."
"Could we not therefore do more to promote heating materials derived from renewable raw materials, that is from biomass, elephant grass and even from grain?"
"Europe could provide for itself with these."
". Of course."
"That is one thing we are concentrating on."
"I probably did not say so much about it in my answer."
"We must make the best possible use of our own resources."
"The available biomass, wind and water power will not of course be enough, we will still need to buy energy from Russia and the OPEC States."
"But my answer today is: we must all do our homework at home, because that is the only way we will achieve our objective."
"I thank the Member of the Commission for his detailed reply."
"I agree that Russia is an important energy supplier and it is definitely essential to maintain the dialogue with Russia in the field of energy."
"However, there is a good Russian proverb saying that God saves those who save themselves."
"And the European Union would do well to bear in mind certain official statements from Moscow."
"I would like the Member of the Commission to comment on the statement made by the officials that apparently Russia will divert its energy resources to Asia, if Members of the European Union do not fulfil certain conditions."
". I followed President Putin's last address to the nation."
"He emphasised two issues that concern energy: first, he said that Gazprom has shown remarkable progress since he addressed the issue of energy efficiency."
"It is very important that Russia recognised that."
"He also said that Russia could play an important role in the creation of a common European energy policy."
"As regards the Gazprom announcement, I consider it one of the companies that have a monopoly."
"None of them would ever be willing to give their monopoly up."
"As regards diversification, we should accept that Russia will look for the most lucrative market."
"If the price is better in China, I am afraid it will try to sell the gas to China."
"The United States has higher prices and, with the development of LNG, competition between big consumers will grow."
"But, at the same time, I believe that the existing infrastructure that brings Russian gas to the European Union and highly diversified gas use in the European Union will make the European market very attractive to Gazprom and Russia in general."
"We are anticipating, as a result of dialogue, that Russia will follow in the gas sector the path currently being followed in the oil sector."
"That brings benefits to Russia and at the same time supplies the market well."
"I hope our dialogue will be able to bring about such a result."
"I know it is not easy but that is our goal."
"Geographically we are the best market and historically our companies have had very good relations."
"At the same time, I take very seriously the announcement by Gazprom that they would like to build a pipeline to China."
"That is no big surprise."
"On the question of reducing the European Union’s dependence on gas and oil imports from Russia, I would ask you, Commissioner, to elaborate on two issues."
"Firstly, is the EU in a position to counter the Russian pipeline monopoly in the transportation of oil and gas from Central Asia to Europe?"
"Secondly, is the European Union able to secure reciprocity and greater transparency on the part of Russia’s energy sector?"
". The first question was about gas transport from central Asia to Europe."
"There are two paths that we are following."
"One is definitely related to the Energy Charter and transit protocols under which such rights could be enjoyed."
"As for the other, I recently visited Kazakhstan to find out about the building of a trans-Caspian pipeline that can independently bring gas towards the European Union, bypassing the Russian gas transit system."
"As regards transparency and relations, at this stage there is some reciprocity."
"In the EU Gazprom is treated as a company that has a complete pipeline monopoly in production and transport."
"So it is clear that whenever a situation in the internal market is evaluated, then it is evaluated on all aspects."
"We are looking for more transparency and more mutual understanding."
"In October this year, we will have a conference on energy policies."
"It is also fairer to the Russian side also to ask questions as to what Europe’s views are and how far Europe is going in creating a common energy policy."
"It is also clear that they do not always have all the information and understanding as to what our goals are."
"Our goals are fair trade in these resources and fair markets."
"That, from my point of view, is beneficial not only for us, but also for Russia."
"That is how I see that the best results could be achieved."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes questions to the Commission."
"The next item is the report (A6-0161/2006) by Mrs Roth-Behrendt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (COM(2004)0775 – C6-0223/2004 – 2004/0270B(COD))."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by expressing the Commission’s thanks to the European Parliament, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and in particular to Mrs Roth-Behrendt, the rapporteur, and Mr Schnellhardt as second rapporteur for their hard work on this dossier."
"I would like to remind you that last year the Commission adopted the TSE roadmap."
"It served primarily as a discussion paper for future short, medium and long-term adjustments and also formed the basis for the detailed discussion of individual questions with the Member States."
"I would like to repeat one of the key points again here: there will be no change to our overall policy of protecting consumers and eradicating BSE."
"In view of this, the Commission is very pleased with the work that has been done so far and the compromise proposal that is now up for discussion and for the vote."
"This proposal provides a reliable legal framework that will allow the Commission to continue to take action on the basis of new scientific findings and at the same time to maintain the level of protection of human and animal health in the European Union or to raise it if that is scientifically justified."
"The compromise proposal is therefore acceptable to the Commission."
"The proposal also brings European law into line with the international rules, according to which countries are categorised according to their BSE risk."
". Madam President, the rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, has asked me to present her report here today because she is ill."
"We hope she will be back with us soon."
"The directive on TSE basically has two parts; firstly, the question of transitional periods and secondly the operational or substantive part."
"To allow us to discuss the substantive part at greater length and more extensively, it was suggested that we divide the report, which we did with the Commission’s agreement."
"In the middle of 2005, we decided to extend the transitional provisions at first reading, giving us sufficient time for the second part, which we are debating today and which we have also discussed in a large number of working groups and roundtables, including with Europe’s veterinarians and colleagues in Parliament."
"As Commissioner Verheugen has already indicated, we are determined not to weaken the directive but to put the emphasis on health policy. Under Mrs Roth-Behrendt’s leadership we managed that splendidly."
"She has called on the Commission to develop a kind of roadmap, which, while it has not been discussed in this house officially, will nevertheless guide us in tackling the difficult topic of BSE and TSE in the future."
"It is a very welcome initiative."
"Let me say something about the contents. Up until now, we have had five risk categories."
"That was good, it was right and it was helpful."
"We found, however, and became convinced that in order to be compatible with what is being done in other parts of the world, including the World Organisation for Animal Health in Paris, it was better to scale this down to three factors, which came more easily after much discussion."
"We found that many non-Community countries know relatively little about this animal disease and that the European Union and the OIE in Paris, too, can get much better information that is easy to compare using this new classification."
"That was the compromise after the rapporteur – and I strongly support her – agreed to this proposal."
"It is in the end also a factor in consumer protection and for farmers, because these questions can now be better coordinated and also policed across the globe in the developing world."
"It is again made clear that checks for BSE are an important part of it."
"Healthy, conspicuous and changed animals will continue to be tested."
"But if the surveillance shows a sustained positive development in particular areas, then things can be relaxed a little in line with scientific evidence."
"One contentious issue I will be pleased to talk about is the question of fishmeal."
"As a farmer, I am convinced that fishmeal should not be fed to ruminants."
"Some countries in Europe evidently see it differently, however. I have to respect that."
"Parliament said a clear No back in 2004."
"With the backing of many experts, the rapporteur took this subject up again and made clear that this fact – namely that herbivores should not be given fishmeal – will be included in this report."
"As an exception – and that is part of the compromise – it will be permissible to add it to feed for animals up to a certain age."
"I think we can agree to this compromise."
"One tricky and very sensitive area is the question of mechanically separated meat."
"How meat is stripped from bones is a very complicated issue."
"Anyone who has ever seen it will never eat it again."
"The Commission itself has said it will review it and make us an appropriate proposal for dealing with this problem."
"The minimum list of special risk materials is a matter of particular concern to the rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt."
"Brain and spinal cord, for example, will now appear in a genuine list and not in the Annexes as before."
"That is right and it is a good contribution."
"An equally good contribution is the question of how cohort animals are treated at present."
"These are siblings of animals that are sick."
"Earlier, all these animals were most brutally slaughtered."
"Now a good way has been found and the animals are kept."
"They cannot of course be eaten themselves."
"All in all, I would like to thank the rapporteur and everyone involved."
"They have done some very important work. And I am very glad that Mrs Roth-Behrendt was able to accompany us through this difficult terrain and I hope she will be here again soon."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the European Parliament and the rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, in particular have shown great dedication in coping with the BSE crisis, they have played a good part, and they have also been able to put the Commission on the right track with the various instruments like the committee of inquiry and the conditional motion of censure."
"We are pleased that we are now no longer having to deal with the start or the height of the crisis but with its tailing off."
"This was a man-made crisis and if we remove the causes of it we will find a way out."
"The Committee on Agriculture does in fact believe that we should have the courage to begin to move out of it."
"The end of this development will therefore again be that high-grade animal protein can be fed to non-vegetarian animals if it comes from animals that have been released for human consumption."
"What troubles us about this movement is that the Commission is now very much taking over the action in the comitology procedure and is taking the decisions."
"We believe the European Parliament should be involved."
"We are all somewhat concerned that in taking over the administrative and regulatory process the Commission is leaving the European Parliament out in the cold."
"We have therefore strengthened the decisions of principle to ensure that questions of consumer protection and environmental protection must play a major role."
"Overall, we believe that on the question of codecision in the comitology procedure the European Parliament like the Council must have the right to enter a veto if things are decided in the Annexes that really should be dealt with in the European Parliament’s codecision procedure."
". Madam President, Commissioner, I feel I must spend a little of my time sending warmest greetings to Mrs Roth-Behrendt, together with best wishes for her recovery."
"My group considers many parts of this report on the amendment of the Regulation on the prevention of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies an extraordinary success."
"In the hectic days when the BSE problem was at its height, we had to take very quick and very harsh decisions on many things, and science has advanced in the meantime."
"That is why we can now speak of a good proposal."
"What are the advantages I see?"
"Firstly, comitology has been limited to the necessary amount."
"The original proposal involved much more comitology, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf!"
"That makes for clarity and reliability in the implementation."
"Secondly, the introduction of three risk categories simplifies risk assessment without jeopardising safety."
"It brings an internationally agreed programme of measures to prevent BSE/TSE into force throughout the European Union, based on the proposals of the World Organisation for Animal Health."
"The results of risk assessment in all countries can now be compared. Among other things, that also makes exporting and importing easier."
"Thirdly, the age from which animals must be tested for BSE is now the same for all the European Union, because the rule has been laid down in the main body of the Regulation."
"For animals that will be used for food it is now a uniform 30 months."
"We know that a lot of countries have adopted quite different rules. This new rule will make it possible to compare Member States’ statistics."
"We will be able to get a much better overview of the situation."
"Fourthly, I also welcome the fact that the general cull of the herd when BSE appears is abolished."
"That is scientifically based and that is how it should be done."
"Fifthly, the introduction of tolerance thresholds for animal proteins adventitiously and unavoidably present (I want to stress that) in plant-based feeds takes account of reality and removes problems in the sectors concerned without affecting safety."
"I expect the Commission and the Council to approve the agreed value of 0.5%."
"I consider this figure to be just about acceptable, although the tolerance limits can be expected to differ greatly in this measurement range and the tolerances can be expected to be very high."
"Sixthly, the scientific prohibition on the use of animal proteins in cattle feed will remain."
"I very much welcome the fact that we have agreed on a rule allowing some fishmeal to be used for young bovine animals. All right, it is a compromise."
"I would have preferred it to be clearly separated. There would then have been a clear separation in the feed industry, too, and we would have had much more safety."
"All the same, this rule is to be welcomed."
"I really must also mention, and remind the Commission of the fact, that it promised to include the question of feeding kitchen and food waste to animals when revising Regulation 1774/2002."
"I consider that to be very important and I would like to stress that once again."
"In this connection I believe we can agree to this proposal with a large majority without more ado."
". Madam President, I endorse the congratulations to the rapporteur on her good report and also on the good work she has done in this field for many years, and I wish her a speedy recovery."
"I would also like to deal with a subject that for years has been close to Mrs Roth-Behrendt’s heart."
"I am referring to the clarification in Article 7, which several speakers have already mentioned, that animal proteins should not be fed to adult ruminants."
"Cattle are vegetarians, and they only take in animal proteins when they are young, in the form of their mother’s milk."
"That really goes without saying."
"However, the BSE crisis showed us that this principle had been anything but self-evident for a long time."
"It is therefore all the more important, now that we are revising the basic BSE/TSE regulation, that we should underline the ethical principles of animal nutrition and stress that this is important for the protection of human and animal health and also from the point of view of the precautionary principle."
"At the end of 2004, on the rapporteur’s initiative, the European Parliament blocked a comitology decision to allow fishmeal to be used in feed."
"Since then, this question has again been very hotly debated in this House."
"It is repeatedly pointed out that there is no TSE risk from fishmeal."
"It is not for me to answer this scientific question and I have no wish to do so."
"We in the European Parliament simply do not want fishmeal or any other animal products in cattle feed."
"I can agree to the compromise in as much as it provides for the possibility in future of feeding fishmeal to young calves as a substitute for milk when they have just been separated from the mother cow."
"The strict conditions and controls are to be welcomed."
"Apart from that, I think we should have learned from the experiences with the BSE crisis and we should be sending a clear signal for more animal ethics and better health and animal protection."
". The new case of TSE, confirmed yesterday in Austria, has illustrated the soundness of the long–term precautionary policy of the European Union to prevent, control and eradicate certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies."
"Mrs Roth–Behrendt had clearly taken good note of the views of Member States when, during an exchange of views before the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, she referred to the draft amendment to the 2001 regulation, and her comments also sparked active engagement on the parts of the British and Austrian presidencies."
"The outcome of that commendable work is a text on which MEPs agree in principle."
"We are unanimous both in our overall opinion that the transitional period should be extended by a reasonable amount of time and in our adherence to the principle of a consistent ban on the feeding of animal protein to ruminants."
"We support the Commission in bringing the existing legislation into line with new international requirements."
"Draft amendments, proposed jointly by several political groups, have highlighted inconsistencies and in certain parts they constitute a compromise which is not otherwise ideal, but which is practical at this stage."
"An example of this is the issue of feeding fishmeal to cattle."
"Fish are, in fact, not a risk factor, as fishmeal is not a vector for TSE."
"The problems with fishmeal lie elsewhere."
"Fishmeal is unnecessary to the physiological development of ruminants, whether old or young, and, as they are the only animals which can produce protein from grass, they satisfy their protein needs in other ways."
"Notwithstanding ethical reservations, this issue is also connected to questions of the medium-term orientation of the common agricultural policy and, amongst other things, the advisability of the prevention of protein aggregation in milk."
"We have opted for the solution of feeding fishmeal to young cattle under Commission supervision, for practical control reasons, as a compromise solution, with the aim of ensuring that there is not even a theoretical chance of instances arising on farms where fishmeal can be mixed with bonemeal."
"This is the reason for our support for the compromise solution, even though the unanimous view, backed up by expert opinion, is that there is absolutely no justification for feeding fish protein to young animals."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over the past decade, the European Parliament has played a decisive role in the political response to BSE, which, although this disease emerged in the United Kingdom as long ago as the 1980s, was given another dimension when the British Health Secretary stated in the Parliament at Westminster that there is a probable link between BSE and a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease."
"Parliament was quick to give its political response in the shape of an inquiry committee under the leadership of Mrs Roth-Behrendt, which carried out excellent research into the state of affairs and the Commission’s and Member States’ shortcomings."
"This was followed by a conditional vote of no-confidence and one of the key results was that food safety was taken away from DG Agriculture and became an area of policy that falls within the codecision procedure."
"Since the adoption of BSE legislation in 2001 and 2002 and the detailed regulations about animal by-products, quite a few controversial measures have also been approved under the comitology procedure."
"Since June 2001, BSE legislation has had no fewer than 19 updates on comitology decisions, and so vigilance on the part of this House must be the order of the day."
"Let me give you just two examples."
"The Commission’s proposal to reintroduce fishmeal as a feed to ruminants was only withdrawn following strong protests in this House."
"The second example is about feed provisions described in Annex 4 to the Act which were changed by comitology decisions, without Parliament’s involvement, from detailed descriptions taking up half a page to no fewer than 9 pages of detailed provisions and exceptions."
"The comitology procedure remains a huge problem, therefore, and one that we failed to resolve in this negotiation round with the Council."
"We are pleased though, that, from now on, consideration must be given to a scientific risk analysis in respect of the impact on man and animal, and this is certainly a good thing."
"The agreement reached with the Council at first reading, which is reflected in Amendments 41 to 56, receives our group’s unqualified support."
"The key areas in this respect remain the ban on all animal proteins as a feed for ruminants, the stipulation that fishmeal can only be fed to young ruminant species following scientific assessment and sufficiently strict control measures, as well as regulations about separator meat, which should finally be laid down."
"It is particularly regrettable that the rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, cannot be present for this debate."
"I wish her much strength, a speedy recovery and I look forward to her resuming her role here in this House very soon."
"Madam President, I should like to start by congratulating my honourable friend, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, on her exceptional work and to take this opportunity to hope that she will soon be well and back here with us, so that we can continue our very good cooperation."
"I endorse, on behalf of my political group, all the compromise amendments which we prepared following discussion, except for two: Amendments 41 and 48."
"My political group cannot support these two amendments, because we believe that the ban on the use of animal proteins should remain, even for young ruminants, for two reasons."
"The first reason is because we must oppose cannibalistic phenomena; we are talking here of herbivores being fed animal proteins."
"The second reason is because we are not fully convinced that the risks of this specific diet being linked to the risks of spongiform encephalopathy have been eliminated."
"I would remind you that years ago there was no established link between phenomena of spongiform encephalopathy and sheep and goats and yet recently we have had such cases, which are being carefully examined by the competent laboratory in the United Kingdom; for the moment the specialist scientists are not in a position to assure us that there is no such danger."
"With my congratulations once again to the rapporteur and my warm personal wishes, that brings me to the end of my statement."
"We say yes, except for Amendments 41 and 48."
". Madam President, profit-driven, unnatural methods of animal husbandry, together with the feeding of livestock with bone meal and mechanised meat separation have led to the recent increase in the risk of BSE spreading."
"Meat which still contains elements of periosteum, fragments of spinal cord tissue and other nerve tissue is more likely to be infected with prions dangerous to humans and animals."
"The positive aspects of the current solutions include prevention, the implementation of a variety of control tests and a return to using traditional feed."
"However, fishmeal fed to livestock still poses a threat."
"If the afore-mentioned practices had not spread to Poland as well, all farm animals would eat natural feed and meat would be processed using traditional methods."
"Fortunately, our agricultural sector is still organic, and there are no demands to introduce innovations for economic reasons."
"We are critical of excessively expanding the phytosanitary administration, implementing an unnecessary number of programmes, and also of unnatural compromises, driven by the financial lobby groups, all of which increase costs and increase the threat of diseases, not just spongiform encephalopathy."
"Madam President, having experienced not just the trauma of BSE but the very protracted and painful recovery until we recently secured the return of British beef exports, none of us wants to see that happen again."
"Thus I support the essence of the TSE structures endorsed in this report."
"I wish to raise one concern, however, with regard to beef imports into the EU."
"It is correctly suggested in one of the amendments that we legislate for acceptable feeding regimes for the cattle whose meat is imported."
"But my question is: how do we police those regimes so that the consumer can be truly satisfied that cheaper imports are subject to the same tough control as indigenous produce?"
"Not only must we lay down the same standards for imported produce as domestic produce, we must be sure that those standards are demonstrably met."
"That is the issue I invite the Commissioner to address when he replies in this debate."
"Madam President, in 2001, during the BSE and CJD scares and outbreaks, the Commission implemented a temporary ban on feed of animal and fish origin being fed to ruminants, pending thorough scientific risk assessment of the regulation."
"In accordance with the precautionary principle and as a measure to promote consumer confidence, a policy of zero tolerance of processed animal proteins and meat and animal bonemeal in animal feed was put in place."
"And although no case of TSE in fish had ever been discovered, the feeding of fishmeal to ruminants was also subjected to a temporary ban."
"This initial six-month ban has been extended on a rolling basis ever since, despite a categorical Commission announcement in 2004 that there was no risk of TSE occurrence, let alone transmission, from fishmeal fed to ruminants and that the policy of zero tolerance of meat and bone spicules in animal feed should be lifted."
"The Commission argued that this zero tolerance policy could not be implemented, since the technical detection methods for identifying processed animal protein had not previously been sufficiently accurate to take account of the so-called adventitious presence of small amounts of protein from small birds, mammals and rodents accidentally caught in the harvesting process."
"The impossibility of distinguishing these proteins and bone spicules, which do not pose a TSE risk from proteins of ruminant origin which could contain BSE-carrying prions, resulted in a number of high-profile, extremely costly, wasteful and unnecessary withdrawals from shipments and, more controversially, beet-based animal feed, owing to this harmless and unavoidable adventitious presence of non-ruminant proteins."
"The proposal before us is intended to amend and update the regulation."
"In particular, the categorisation of countries according to existing BSE risk, surveillance and monitoring, specified risk material, giving a permanent legal basis for breeding programmes for resistance to TSEs, giving Member States the option to keep BSE cohort animals in their herd and of course revising the feedback."
"Given the protracted uncertainty that the failure to come to a decision on lifting the feed ban has caused to farmers and industry, I sincerely hope that this dossier will be adopted at first reading."
"I welcome the compromise reached and support the provisions relating to the possible lifting of the feed ban, because the provision is based on sound science."
"I believe that there are sufficient safeguards in place to protect all interests."
"Furthermore, I feel it is important to underline that protein is a necessary component of animal diets and the current feed ban is placing us in a precarious position regarding protein supply for animal diets."
"In Europe, we are only 23% self-sufficient in proteins."
"Most of our higher quality proteins, for example Brazilian soya, are shipped vast distances from countries where the sustainability debate is now raging."
"While there is a debate on the ethics about how animals are being fed, it must be borne in mind that the alternatives sometimes pose even bigger ethical questions."
"The fact remains that the food industry in the EU is protein deficient."
"I am pleased that an agreement has been reached on feeding fishmeal to young calves that have high protein requirements."
"We cannot be driven by emotion; otherwise our credibility as legislators will be severely undermined."
"Scientific rigour is at the core of this regulation."
"We should respect the undisputed scientific consensus that fishmeal poses no risk of TSE."
"In conclusion, as regards setting the tolerance thresholds for adventitious presence of bone spicules and technically unavoidable contamination, it is imperative that we apply scientific rigour through standing committees under the comitology procedure."
"This procedure is not perfect, but it is more responsive than codecision and ensures informed scientific analysis and risk assessment, rather than risking emotive concerns guiding European decisions in technical areas."
"For this reason, I cannot support Amendment 57, which I believe would threaten the chances of reaching a hard-won first reading agreement in the interests of all concerned."
"But having said this, as parliamentarians, we should exercise fully and vigilantly our right to scrutinise the outcomes of comitology meetings and to hold the Commission to account when their standing committee experts’ decisions exceed the powers conferred on them by the TSE regulation."
"Madam President, may I send my best wishes to Mrs Roth-Behrendt for a speedy recovery and thank her for her long-term interest in this important issue."
"Thank you for your patience."
"Madam President, I should like to congratulate my colleague, Mrs Roth-Behrendt."
"She has drawn up a balanced report based on common sense."
"Turning to the issue of fishmeal, maybe I am a bit emotional, but I tend to agree with those who say that we should not go back to feeding animal protein to ruminants."
"We moved away from that a number of years ago."
"We continue to feed ruminants and eat them in our countries."
"Therefore I believe that is a step backwards."
"I wonder what the public would say if we asked them about this."
"Would they want us to go back to feeding fish discards to ruminants?"
"Is that what the public wants?"
"I can accept the compromise that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has put before us, because it makes sense and it would help us achieve a first reading agreement."
"The second issue is the policy shift on tolerance levels for small amounts of animal protein."
"In concrete terms, that means that, in my constituency for example, a feed plant which at the moment is producing feed for ruminants will be able at the same time to manufacture feed for pigs and poultry."
"At the moment they have to transport feed from other parts of the country at greater expense, with more of an environmental impact because of the transport."
"It is a common-sense idea to have the tolerance thresholds to make sure that we have proper clean-up between the different kinds of feed manufacture."
"I send my good wishes to Mrs Roth-Behrendt."
"I hope she will be back soon."
"She has produced a very good report and I know that she has worked very hard on TSE and BSE for many years on behalf of this Parliament."
"Madam President, I wish Mrs Roth-Behrendt a speedy recovery."
"She has produced an excellent report, dealing with the subject matter under discussion most diligently."
"Consequently I voice my support for her position on almost all aspects of her report except one: the issue of fishmeal."
"Fishmeal is a rich source of protein and it is extremely nourishing to animals, including ruminants."
"Such animals are able to metabolise the proteins contained in fishmeal and use them for their structural and energy needs."
"Therefore the use of fishmeal to feed animals provides the farming industry with an efficient low-cost diet supplement."
"There are two main issues concerning feeding fishmeal to ruminants."
"The first is how ethically correct it is to feed animal protein to animals that do not normally eat such protein."
"That is indeed controversial."
"It remains, however, an ethical issue and not one that concerns the aim of the regulation at hand today, which is to prevent, control and eradicate certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies."
"The second – and most relevant – question is the following: can certain TSEs be transmitted from fishmeal to ruminants?"
"The answer, based on scientific evidence so far available, is ‘no’."
"To my knowledge, there has never been a documented case of TSE being transmitted from fishmeal to a ruminant, even though fishmeal has, in the past, been used extensively by farmers and the practice continues today on many farms outside the EU."
"Of course we have the precautionary principle to consider."
"But how far can we take that principle when we have no hard evidence that TSEs can pass from fish to ruminants?"
"We know that, in the highly unlikely event of such evidence being found, we could halt the practice straight away."
"The precautionary principle works well only when used with caution."
"Otherwise it can be a severe impediment to our existence."
"For example, why do we not ban travelling in order to prevent transport-related deaths and injuries?"
"After all, we humans eat fish, and we are not worried about contracting fish-derived spongiform encephalopathy, something that is far more likely than for a cow to contract it from fishmeal."
"Had she been here, I know I would not have managed to convince Mrs Roth-Behrendt of my point that fishmeal is good as a ruminant food, but I hope that I have provided the rest of my colleagues with food for thought."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, warmest congratulations to Mrs Roth-Behrendt, best wishes for her recovery and many thanks for her excellent report and the good negotiations with Council and Commission."
"I am very confident that we will reach agreement here with the first reading."
"It affords an excellent guarantee of consumer protection."
"We fully support the stricter measures the rapporteur calls for."
"We consider the rules provided by Parliament, namely TSE checks for cattle over 30 months slaughtered for human consumption and for all cattle over 24 months that have died or been sent for emergency slaughter, to be sufficient and correct."
"This measure will save the small of Schleswig-Holstein alone 4 to 5 million euros a year without prejudicing the safety of consumers."
"The adaptation to the World Organisation for Animal Health’s three risk categories is also logical and necessary."
"The definition of active and passive surveillance categories safeguards epidemiological monitoring and preserves its quality."
"I believe the limited ban on feeding animal proteins to ruminants is correct, even if not totally adequate."
"Nature did not envisage ruminants eating animal proteins, except for calves in the form of mother’s milk."
"The argument that cleaned proteins from fishmeal are no different may well have a scientific basis, but in my opinion it is not correct."
"From an ethical point of view, I find the feeding of fishmeal problematical and undesirable."
"Periods of up to eight years in doubtful cases are sufficient for the ban on the sale of animals from third countries."
"The abolition of zero tolerance for the presence of animal proteins in feed as a result of accidental contamination is a quite crucial and logical step forward."
"In my country, zero tolerance resulted in tens of thousands of tonnes of sugar beet having to be destroyed because animal protein was found in it when it was delivered."
"The up to 0.5% protein admixtures that will now be tolerated come predominantly from small animals that were killed in the process of harvesting or had died in the fields long before and are certainly free from TSE."
"The new limit here is a real step forward towards sensible legislation."
"I agree to the proposal, but cannot refrain from making one small remark in conclusion, namely that life for Parliament would surely be even better and even more democratic if there were less or no comitology."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even ten years after the outbreak of BSE, prevention, control and eradication of certain spongiform encephalopathies are still necessary and still under discussion."
"The regulation on this, which we are also discussing today, is intended to bring EU law into line with international requirements and the standards of the World Organisation for Animal Health, particularly important among which are all the precautions."
"Food safety and consumer protection are both priorities, but it is equally important to take a measured approach."
"Wherever possible, action should be based exclusively on scientific evidence."
"As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I endorse the results and compromises achieved so far."
"I should like to express my particular thanks to all members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety who have been working on this issue for their constructive cooperation and their practical handling of this important issue."
"It has proved possible to push through pragmatic simplifications that reduce bureaucracy."
"Three aspects are important in this regard."
"The first is that we really want to see three instead of five risk categories."
"This will make it possible to take nationally coordinated action against BSE, and will bring greater safety overall."
"The list of specified risk materials also forms part of this."
"Secondly, a point on which we are undoubtedly in agreement is that animal proteins should not be fed to ruminants now or in the future."
"However, it is right to allow young calves – and by this I mean very young calves – to be fed fishmeal in some cases, subject to appropriate controls."
"Young calves do not yet have fully developed ruminant stomachs, and they need animal protein."
"The third point is that there should really be a tolerance of up to 0.5% for animal protein accidentally present in feed; be it a mouse, bird, small animal or bone in the field."
"Zero per cent tolerance is rarely achievable in this world."
"One of the most important points as far as the Committee on Agriculture is concerned is that the EC regulation significantly restricts comitology powers."
"Together with the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, Parliament decisively influenced risk management in the legislation in the first version of the regulation."
"Since then, Parliament has been bypassed and numerous amendments made through comitology."
"This does not seem very democratic and often impedes cooperation and acceptance."
"Let us take an approach to the beginning of the end that is characterised by moderation and responsibility."
"I should like to express my particular thanks to Mrs Roth-Behrendt for her good work."
"I send her my sincere good wishes and hope, for her sake and ours, that she is soon back among us."
"– Madam President, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, ‘better regulation’ has already become a catchword that no longer needs translating."
"It is important to review acts, regulations and directives on an ongoing basis, and it is right to then incorporate into the legislative text any amendments that new findings render necessary and possible."
"Consequently, I, too, welcome the Commission’s proposal to amend EC Regulation No 999/2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies."
"I am obliged to the rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, for her report."
"The improvements it introduces reveal a great deal of knowledge of practical necessities and possibilities, and we hope that the Council and the Commission will follow our recommendations."
"When we set this regulation in motion in 2001 – with inner uncertainty and without sufficient scientific evidence, and prompted by contemporary events – it was a good measure that pointed the way ahead. In the present day, we can see that there has been a change – indeed an improvement – in our sensitivity in dealing with animals, animal husbandry and feeding animals, at least."
"We support an internationally agreed system of measures to tackle bovine and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies at the level of the World Organisation for Animal Health."
"This will also make it possible to gather more information from countries that, unfortunately, do not yet have any data available."
"As Konrad Adenauer once said, there is no law against becoming cleverer."
"Our knowledge is now much greater as a result of the increased efforts in the field of research, too. Yet we have also been confirmed in our old knowledge of nature."
"Our measuring procedures have become so refined that it is possible to detect a sugar cube in Lake Constance."
"Zero tolerances can be measured, but they naturally entail problems – which some Members have just described – because zero tolerance does not exist in nature."
"That is why we need a tolerance for natural contamination of feed with animal protein, a practicable limit, which we should like to fix at 0.5% today."
"I think that this is a compromise that all parties can support, and for that reason I would also ask the Council and the Commission to support Amendment 57."
"Finally, I should like to remind the Commission that a loophole has emerged as regards the recycling of swill."
"The deadlines are about to expire."
"We are anxiously awaiting a proposal from the Commission on this, with a view to optimum, safe use and recycling of these materials, which are not waste products but recoverable materials that, if properly processed, can also be properly used."
"– Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I should like to join in wishing Mrs Roth-Behrendt all the best and a speedy recovery, and I should also like to thank her for her excellent report."
"We should not forget that there is no prophylaxis or treatment for transmissible and bovine spongiform encephalopathies in either humans or animals, that these diseases are always fatal, and that the impact chain with regard to the formation of these deadly prions has not yet been fully researched by scientists."
"I should also like to remind the House that the last few days have seen the discovery of a case of BSE on an organic hill farm in Upper Austria, and that the entire herd of 40 animals has had to be culled – which, of course, has entailed a loss of livelihood for the farmer concerned."
"Nevertheless, adjustments should be made in the way we deal with these justified precautionary measures."
"We can also note that there has been a fall in the overall number of cases of illness and that, therefore, the measures have obviously taken effect."
"On the other hand, these controls, or the measures taken, are very expensive and represent a real threat to the livelihoods of many farmers."
"Yet, in essence, the chain of measures should not be broken."
"In particular, the ban on animal protein in feed must be retained."
"The compromise reached, that is, that ruminants may be fed fishmeal until they are one year old, is an absolute maximum, in my opinion, and is really most accommodating to the fishing industry."
"I consider the adjustments contained in this proposal absolutely necessary, particularly if we consider that the measures have now been extended to all animal species and, in principle, are no longer limited to sheep and cattle."
"It is also important to extend these measures to the controls and export bans."
"The alignment with the requirements of the World Organisation for Animal Health, namely the reduction of the five risk categories to three, is justified; provided, of course, that this does not result in the measures as a whole being watered down."
"Another thorn in my side is that the comitology procedure is being fostered to a certain extent."
"Parliament as an institution should make a real effort to keep this to a minimum, so that these measures, which are after all very technical, remain subject to democratic control."
"Madam President, I was a journalist at the height of the BSE crisis, so I have very vivid memories of the unfolding of that story and its impact not just on politicians but on consumer confidence."
"It was story of the century in its impact on farming and how we do our business and on the animal feed industry."
"I recall interviewing a feed compounder at that time who had no idea where most of his ingredients were coming from, because the word traceability had not been invented."
"I think perhaps we forget how serious the situation was."
"In Ireland now, we are looking forward to not slaughtering cohorts when we discover a BSE case in a herd on farms, but many farms have suffered as a result of our more stringent policy in this regard."
"Fishmeal is an important protein source and I think that fear alone should not keep it out of the food chain."
"As has already been said, Europe produces only about one-fifth of its protein needs and we import soya to fill that gap."
"Much of that is genetically modified and it is ironic that European consumers are concerned about GM and yet we have to rely on GM protein for much of our animal feed."
"Zero tolerance is a big issue for the feed industry and for farmers."
"It has caused huge problems and is unworkable."
"In my view, Amendment 50 is better than Amendment 57 when it comes to the adventitious and technically unavoidable contamination of feed ingredients."
"We need science to rule here and we need scientific risk assessments of the level of adventitious protein sources in feed."
"I think the feed industry itself would welcome clarity on that, because too often zero tolerance has given rise to huge costs as well as concern and confusion within that industry."
"We are ten years down the road."
"I think it is good that tonight we are debating in less emotive terms than we would have ten years ago, but I would urge that people look at the science of the debate, rather than the emotion of the past, when they are voting on this very important report."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0107/2006) by Mrs Pleštinská, on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the financing of European standardisation (COM(2005)0377 – C6-0252/2005 –2005/0157(COD))."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking your House, and in particular your rapporteur, Mrs Pleštinská, the members of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and Mrs Herczog, for their prompt advice and this sound report."
"The adoption of this proposal by the European legislature creates a new, solid legal basis for the financing of European standardisation."
"European standardisation has already played an outstanding role in supporting European policy for more than 20 years."
"For example, it has made a major contribution towards the completion of the internal market."
"As part of the New Approach, standardisation complements European legislation and contributes to technical harmonisation, enabling unrestricted trade in goods within the EU."
"More than 20 directives have been adopted that follow this approach, a concrete example of which is the Machinery Directive."
"Standardisation is also an important tool for realising the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"In view of the positive experience with standards in connection with internal market legislation, there are plans to use the approach of reference to voluntary standards in other areas of law, too, within the framework of what is known as ‘better lawmaking’."
"Examples are legislation in the fields of environmental protection, control of foodstuffs and the energy and transport sector."
"In addition, standardisation has the potential to play an important role in strengthening the competitiveness of European industry, as it facilitates interoperability between different technologies, paves the way for the introduction of new technologies and promotes innovation."
"Currently, European standardisation receives financial support from the Commission on the basis of legal acts from the 1980s."
"In view of the development of budgetary rules, it is imperative to update the legal basis for the financing of standardisation."
"The budgetary resources for financing European standardisation must be approved annually within the framework of the budgetary procedure."
"These currently amount to EUR 19 million."
"The beneficiaries of Community financing are the European standardisation organisations CEN, CENELEC and ETSI, which are listed in Annex I of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations."
"Under special circumstances, support may also be given to other authorities in respect of activities necessary to support European standardisation."
"In the course of the discussions, many parties called for European standardisation to take sufficient account of all the relevant interests, such as those of consumers, environmental protection and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The Commission shares this view and is working towards improving the present situation."
"This decision is not intended to guarantee the financing of the individual interests concerned, however."
"I should like to point out in this connection that support is provided for the participation of experts, for example from SMEs, within the framework of our SME programme."
"The same goes for the involvement of consumer and environmental protection and occupational health and safety stakeholders."
"It is also the responsibility of Member States to guarantee sufficient participation of the relevant stakeholders."
"The Commission expressly welcomes the amendments drawn up in cooperation between Parliament and the Council."
"We can support all of Parliament’s amendments."
"I should like to express my particular thanks once again to Parliament and the rapporteur for their efforts to make agreement possible at first reading."
"Madam President, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen. Why does a sheet of A4 fit into an envelope?"
"Why do SIM cards work in all mobile phones?"
"Why would it be helpful to have identical power points throughout the European Union?"
"Once things like this function smoothly, they are so self-evident that we hardly notice them."
"For such apparently simple things to happen, however, requires serious thought on somebody’s part, and this ‘somebody’ is the European standardisation system, which is made up of three European and 29 national standards organisations, and more than 60 000 experts."
"They draft European standards, which are agreed by consensus and are based on voluntary agreement."
"Because the main function of common European standards is to remove technical barriers to trade and to promote the internal market, standardisation policy should be regarded a cornerstone of EU policy for meeting the targets of the revised Lisbon Strategy."
"For 20 years now European standardisation has, thanks mainly to the directives known as the ‘new approach’, greatly streamlined European legislation."
"Directives drawn up in the context of the new approach apply only to basic safety requirements, consumer protection and environmental protection."
"Technical requirements are set out in detailed technical standards."
"This, Commissioner Verheugen, is the correct way to achieve good European legislation."
"When I worked as an architect, standards were a tool I used in my work."
"They provided me with a point of reference in designing, assessing and approving buildings."
"This was one of the reasons why I accepted the assignment of reporting to the European Parliament with a proposal to the European Commission on financing European standardisation."
"The aim of this decision is to put in place a consolidated legal framework for providing this financing."
"Even though European standardisation is necessary for the functioning of the internal market, there has as yet been no legislative basis dedicated specifically to financing it."
"The EU’s contribution towards financing European standards is currently 2%, while national organisations contribute approximately 5%, and enterprises 93%, primarily by providing expertise."
"The Member States have their roles to play in technical standardisation, in that they have to ensure the adoption of European standards by the national systems."
"I am pleased that my country, Slovakia, has been among the quickest to transpose European standards thanks to the Slovak Technical Standards Act."
"I am convinced that European standardisation is a system that will help to create a favourable business environment."
"Business representatives and other interested parties are becoming increasingly aware of the role technical standardisation plays in the business world."
"It must be a priority for Parliament to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises, and in particular micro-enterprises and trades enterprises are able to effectively use European standards."
"It is in the interest of the Union to contribute financially to the translation of these standards into all official languages, to make them equally and transparently accessible, in particular to small enterprises in the new Member States which lack the financial and human resources to translate specialist standards."
"It would be helpful for handbooks to be available to SMEs explaining the standards to them."
"The seven-month discussions between Parliament, the European Commission, the Council and other interested organisations have convinced me that this problem has taken its rightful place in EU policy."
"In the approval process I supported all proposed amendments which helped to improve the Commission’s proposal."
"I am pleased with the enormous amount of assistance from all rapporteurs, and in particular the shadow rapporteur Edit Herzog and Paul Rübich, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy rapporteur who was asked to give an opinion."
"Please allow me also to thank the representatives of the Council and the Commission for their exemplary assistance and their wish to find a consensus right from the outset, allowing a financial framework for European standardisation to be found at the first reading."
"In conclusion I would like to express my conviction that my report and the support that Parliament has shown for it will lead to adequate financing for European standardisation, which will contribute to a simpler and safer life for all European citizens."
". – Madam President, although, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, I generally support the approach taken by the Commission, I should like to emphasise the political dimension of this matter and to point out, if I may, two shortcomings."
"For two years now, the European Commission has been seeking to develop standardisation in the context of health, social, societal and environmental services."
"It proposes to make wider use of standardisation work in the field of services, while preserving the monopolistic nature of the bodies mentioned in the report – which is, in my opinion, regrettable – even though standardisation has been mainly focused up to now on industrial products and nothing else."
"Standards, when viewed in the specific context of services, tend to be substituted for the harmonisation of European legislation, which is worrying."
"However necessary, indeed essential, standardisation may be, it cannot take precedence over legislation."
"These standards are required in all European invitations to tender but, until now, they have been drawn up exclusively by manufacturers, without any democratic control, and may accordingly constitute an obstacle to market access, which is something that we cannot accept."
"That is why it is important to ensure, in particular, that all of the parties involved can actually participate in the work of these bodies."
"That obviously includes manufacturers, but it also includes consumer associations, clients, local authority representatives or even environmental protection associations."
"The compromise amendments certainly address this concern, but only to a very small extent."
"On the other hand, I felt that, insofar as public funds were involved, the European Parliament had to be informed each year of the standardisation process that had actually been implemented."
"European standards organisations are actually associations of general interest in receipt of public aid from the Community."
"As such, they must obviously meet obligations with regard to transparency."
"The compromise amendment regarding this issue makes provision for a Commission assessment of standardisation activities to be carried out at least once every five years, which is clearly not often enough."
"So there you have my observations summed up in a few words, Madam President."
"I should like wholeheartedly to congratulate the rapporteur and the coordinators on the quality of the work done, but I deplore the insufficient efforts made to encourage greater plurality and regret that the assessments of standardisation activities should be so infrequent."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Pleštinská, for her excellent cooperation – which cannot be faulted – with the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and the impressive results."
"I should also like to thank Commissioner Verheugen, however, as he has managed, by way of better regulation, to create a new instrument – namely European standardisation – to enable the objective to be achieved faster and more efficiently."
"For example, we are currently addressing the issue of mobile TV: the problem of Nokia versus LG standardisation."
"European standards should be created for this as quickly as possible to enable us to take the lead in the global market."
"Another example is the allocation of frequencies in the linear-digital field."
"If carried out quickly, efficiently and well, standardisation offers prospects of gaining market shares in this field."
"A further example is mobile-telephone chargers: here, too, there is a lack of standardisation."
"The need for action on this is tremendous, and dramatic progress could be achieved by means of economies of scale."
"For this reason, I am also pleased that particular attention is being paid to small and medium-sized enterprises, and I believe that the next thing we need is a Green Paper on standardisation."
"This would enable our economy to achieve the Lisbon criteria significantly faster and more efficiently by means of standardisation that is accepted worldwide – one of the best examples of this being the GSM system."
"A Green Paper in this field could give us the opportunity of demonstrating where our future opportunities lie."
"This represents a challenge."
"Parliament is already pleased to note that its cooperation with the Commission on this is as constructive as ever."
". Madam President, it gives me great pleasure, on behalf of my group and as the coordinator for the committee, to congratulate Mrs Pleštinská on her first report in Parliament."
"I am sure that it will be the first of many."
"I am really delighted that she has taken on this role."
"It is entirely appropriate that, coming from one of the new Member States most active in the field of the internal market, she has not only blazed a trail for Members from Slovakia, but also has the moral authority to carry this forward."
"If you look at the internal market scoreboard, you will see that top of the list of countries that have transposed internal market legislation and adopted European standards are the new Member States."
"They are putting all the old Member States to shame in that respect."
"So I believe that she has done outstanding work here."
"I am also delighted that we have reached an agreement with the Council and the Commission in pre-conciliation to get this important package through at first reading."
"Let me turn to some of the issues."
"I have to take issue with the spokesman from the Committee on Budgets, who has totally misunderstood what this is all about."
"As you said, Commissioner, it is largely about the development of effective technical standards for products."
"That is one of your crucial responsibilities in the new allocation of portfolios in the Commission."
"But we must not forget that this is all part of the total development of the internal market."
"We are now on the verge of a very important review of the future of the internal market."
"I share the view of my colleague, Mr Rübig, that the role of standardisation bodies is crucial in making that market work better."
"We still have problems where those standards are not being recognised by Member States."
"It is still too difficult for manufacturers to take advantage of the single market."
"I have to ask the limited number of people here how we are going to create jobs and growth in the European economy if we cannot get the internal market to work properly; if we cannot engage all the tools and weapons at our disposal."
"I was really pleased that the President of the Commission, in the statement that he made this week about delivery for our citizens, put the completion of the internal market absolutely at the top of the list."
"That is where it should be."
"If we cannot make the internal market work, what else have we got to do to achieve success in the global economy?"
"Standards are part of that, not just in Europe but also in the world as a whole."
"As the rapporteurs say in one of their amendments – and I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteur, Mrs Herczog, for her work – we want to ensure fair and transparent access to European standards for all market players throughout the Union."
"That is what this proposal is all about."
". – Madam President, we may soon be able to form a club of those who spend their evenings in this Parliament."
"It is interesting that the questions raised here are always those that have been followed by the same MEPs every night."
"I, too, would like to start by congratulating Mrs Pleštinská on her first report."
"Like Mr Harbour, I, too, hope that she will draft many more reports in the next three years, during the time that we are MEPs here together."
"I would like to thank her for the very friendly environment she created both in the Committee on the Internal Market and in the course of the talks and negotiations with the Council, enabling us to reach an agreement."
"This environment enabled us to reach an agreement on every issue following the first reading, and hopefully everyone will be able to support the amendment proposals."
"I need to make another brief comment."
"Mr Harbour said that new Member States are at the top of the list in transposing internal market regulations."
"At this point we need to remember the work of Commissioner Verheugen in this area, because without him we would never have been able to do this so efficiently."
"At that time he was responsible for the enlargement of the internal market."
"Returning to the report, I think that the most important result we have achieved is that by starting this European financing, we are better able to ensure the improved operation of the internal market and clean competition for each market player and interested party; also, we have managed to achieve this without creating too much bureaucracy or, God forbid, a new institution, which we are so keen on doing."
"I personally like the approach of trying to increase the efficiency of the work of existing institutions that already operate efficiently, and making it available to everybody, using a relatively low amount of resources."
"The law in the process of being adopted ensures equal opportunities for companies in respect of Community assistance allocation and the handling of public funds, also ensuring an open and transparent procedure, while – and I emphasise it again: this is extremely important to us in view of the Better Regulation Programme – it prevents unnecessary bureaucracy."
"Personally, I feel that this is the greatest result achieved by this amendment proposal."
"It is very important to mention that the appropriate and competent Community assistance provided for standardisation is not an expenditure, but a clear investment."
"It is an investment in the better operation of the internal market, in the enhancement of European competitiveness, in the information, protection and increased safety of consumers using standard products and services, and in the improvement of the market situation and chances of small and medium-sized enterprises, even if – and I completely agree with the Commissioner here – this law is not meant to support small entrepreneurs individually."
"I would like to express my gratitude once more for the cooperation of all those with whom I have had the opportunity to work together in connection with this law, and my wish is that we will have many other laws like this, and that REACH, in particular, will follow along the same lines."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the mid-1980s, European standardisation has made it possible to achieve both the free movement of industrial products in the European Community and a high degree of protection for consumers and workers."
"European standardisation complements key European policy objectives by establishing a consensus between economic operators, and has now managed to establish itself in approximately 20 industry sectors."
"This has considerably simplified the process of making goods and services on the internal market both comparable and compatible, and so the Commission’s financial support and continuing development of European standardisation warrants our support."
"The catalogue of the three European standardisation bodies, CEN, CENELEC and ETSI, now numbers more than 15 000 standards and other European specifications."
"This standardisation work has often rendered detailed Community legislation in the areas concerned superfluous, and it is sometimes possible to avoid legislation altogether."
"For this reason, standardisation should be seen as an integral part of the continuing efforts towards better lawmaking and thus as part of a policy for growth and employment."
"In addition to the internal market aspect, European standardisation has the potential to support a whole range of Community policy measures capable of increasing the competitiveness of European enterprises."
"This applies in particular to the fields of trade policy, transport, the environment and security of travel documents."
"In the field of research and technological development, clear common standards are needed as a source of technical expertise and as a market instrument."
"As with GSM and Galileo, which have already been mentioned by some fellow Members, it is thus possible to create a common trading language."
"Despite this positive assessment, European standardisation and its institutional framework need to be improved and strengthened."
"The provisions of the new Financial Regulation require the creation of a clear, complete, detailed legal basis for European standardisation."
"I believe that the compromise proposal is capable of meeting these requirements."
"All the actors involved deserve thanks for their constructive cooperation, particularly the rapporteur, Mrs Pleštinská."
"I shall be recommending that my group support the compromise reached, and am confident that agreement will be reached here as early as at first reading."
"Incidentally, I believe that we should be holding this debate, too, in Brussels and not in Strasbourg."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, technical harmonisation is not only eliminating the technical obstacles to trade and everyday life, but is also ensuring a high level of consumer protection across all Member States."
"Following the introduction of the European standard for playgrounds in 1997, for example, the rate of children’s injuries fell by more than 25% in Austria."
"The aim of this directive is not to set up a new office, but to introduce a legal framework for systematically financing standardisation offices and agencies."
"There are many reasons for proper financing, but I would like to mention just one."
"The offices for standardisation have very limited national budgets in the new Member States compared to Germany, France or the United Kingdom, and they must also carry the burden of translation costs."
"This is because standards are incorporated everywhere into national law, but for the new Member States they are available only in English, German or French."
"Small firms, of course, do not have the resources for time-consuming translations."
"So if we want to ensure that all businesses make use of these worthwhile standards, they must be made available in all of the official languages."
"You will surely agree that it is in the interests of the European Community to contribute financially towards the cost of these translations."
"I value the Commission’s proposal highly."
"The rapporteur has, moreover, made some valuable additions to it which will, for example, assist small and medium-sized enterprises."
"She also proposes measures that will increase control and transparency in respect of the new financing."
"I would therefore like to thank Mrs Pleštinská."
"I appreciate in particular the care and attention that has gone into the preparation of this report, and I would note that she has played an important role in the drafting of a well thought-out and non-controversial proposal that will serve the citizens of Europe well."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is already rather late, and my fellow Members have already made many good points."
"First of all, therefore, I should like to join in thanking the rapporteur, and wish to offer her my sincere congratulations on the difficult work she has done."
"As deputy coordinator, I believe that this represents an important step."
"Tomorrow’s vote is the result of an informal trialogue aimed at bringing the issue of the financing of European standardisation to a successful conclusion at first reading."
"I believe that the compromise that the rapporteur has achieved is a respectable one."
"In spite of all the positive aspects pointed out here by various Members, however, I would venture to make a criticism, an objection."
"Frequent experience has shown that the economy, which is the main beneficiary from the harmonisation of the EU internal market, participates in these rules, and indisputably has urgent need of them, and therefore we MEPs must support this process."
"Yet experience has also shown that many citizens – and many mayors or other economic actors – are not seeing these rules the way they were intended."
"There are some rules, such as the pre-standard on the prevention of crime by urban planning and building design, to which mayors are objecting – not entirely unjustifiably, in my opinion."
"That was why I welcomed the rapporteur’s original proposal for the costs of standardisation to be oriented to a much greater extent towards the costs actually incurred."
"Owing to past experience, however, this proposal could not be pushed through in the agreement with the Council and the Commission."
"Nevertheless, I believe that it is perfectly appropriate for us MEPs to ensure that standardisation really has parliamentary legitimacy where the public is affected, and can also really be achieved by self-administration where only economic actors are concerned."
"In this respect, I hope that we can make progress with these issues, too, within the framework of the Internal Market Strategy – with which not only the Commission but undoubtedly Parliament, too, will be concerned in the coming months."
"– I would like to start by thanking my colleague, the Slovak Member Mrs Pleštinska, for her work in creating this thorough report."
"European standardisation has an important role to play in removing technical barriers to trade, and thereby promoting the development of the European single market."
"Technical standards replace detailed legislative provisions and simplify the rules, which will at the end of the day make the entire European economy more competitive."
"Defining mandatory basic requirements will also ensure a high degree of protection for consumers, health and the environment."
"Standardisation is indispensable in sectors such as health care, transport, telecommunications or electrical engineering."
"In the health care sector, for instance, there are some 10 000 different medical devices, and in this field European standards play an important regulatory role."
"Whilst setting out detailed definitions of the requirements for ensuring a high level of patient safety, they also encourage innovation."
"More than 80% of companies operating in this area are SMEs, which is why we appreciate the rapporteur’s efforts to ensure equal access to European standards for this group of players."
"Since 1985, when the ‘new approach’ to European standards was adopted, more than 15 000 standards have been issued."
"The European Union, however, makes only a minor contribution to the overall financing of European standardisation, even though studies have shown that the benefits to the economy far outweigh the costs."
"For this reason it is important for the EU to provide a sizeable portion of the finance for the entire system not just within the European Union, but also on an international level."
"– As the revised Lisbon Strategy makes clear, Community-wide rules underpinning a uniform understanding and implementation of technical standardisation constitute very important tools for creating and sustaining the conditions for policy implementation, and hence ensuring the competitiveness and constant sustainable development of the Community."
"We can regard technical standardisation as a binding component for development in many fields, such as research, industry, the economy and health care, and above all in the common interest, as it serves everyone, even if that is not immediately obvious."
"We only realise how important standards are when something does not work properly."
"I remember how the new Member States recently had to rebuild their technical systems."
"In Slovakia that meant revising more than 25 000 technical standards, scrapping almost half of them and incorporating 15 000 national standards into the remainder, all of which required a lot of investment."
"We must underline the great contribution to this made by the internationally recognised and long-established Slovak Standards Institute."
"We now face the considerable task of improving the financing for European standardisation in support of the competitiveness of European industry in particular, and of European policy on global competition."
"For this reason this decision is of the utmost importance."
"To construct, coordinate and further refine a complex and extensive mechanism of technical standards which functions dynamically requires clear, rational and adequate financial support."
"In conclusion I would like to draw attention to the praiseworthy and constructive efforts of Mrs Pleštinska, who has succeeded in building a consensus over this important issue."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my particular thanks for the very constructive spirit that has characterised this debate, and for the consensus that has emerged from it."
"This is very important, as technical standardisation is something that, astonishingly, is frequently entirely misjudged in the mind of the European public."
"We have all seen how certain standards have been seized on in the public political debate as bizarre examples of ‘excessive European regulation’."
"It has been rightly pointed out this evening that the European public would be very surprised if this instrument did not exist, as our daily lives could no longer function without it, nor could most economic sectors."
"It is a very modern instrument and, from a legal point of view, a very flexible one and the instrument of choice."
"Indeed, the question should be asked – and here I refer to a remark by the rapporteur from the Committee on Budgets, with which I disagree – whether it is always necessary to bring in the legislative big guns – laws, in other words – straight away when we want to regulate something, or whether putting responsibility for technical standards in the hands of those who need them, and merely laying down a policy guideline stating that a rule is necessary, would perhaps take much greater account of our own society’s right to freedom."
"I should like to announce to you once more this evening my political intent to use the experience we have gained with the New Approach over the last 20 years to extend this modern instrument of European legislation to other fields of the internal market and to other policies, too."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0136/2006) by Mrs Berès, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on appointment of an Executive Board Member of the European Central Bank (C6-0071/2006 – 2006/0801(CNS))."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament attaches a great deal of importance to the issue of the democratic control of the European Central Bank."
"On behalf of all of the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I imagine, but also on behalf of the Commissioner, I should like, if I may, simply to deplore the fact that this debate is being held at such a late hour."
"If we want the issue of monetary dialogue to be taken seriously, then it seems to us that a decision as important as the replacement of a member of the Executive Board should not be taken at such a late hour."
"All the more so given that, for us, it is a question today of defining our position on the issue referred to us by the Council concerning the last replacement of a member that has sat on the Executive Board of the Central Bank since the outset and of the last appointment that will be made before 2010."
"This appointment is therefore important with regard to the content of monetary policy."
"As rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I must point out in this House that, following a vote within the ECOFIN Council, the candidate put forward by that body, whose appointment must be validated by the European Council, required a majority vote in order to be presented as the candidate supported by our Parliament."
"In that consultation procedure, the profile expected of the candidate is one of possessing the necessary authority and professional experience in the finance or banking sector."
"Those are the terms of the Treaty."
"The candidate proposed to us clearly meets those criteria."
"The issue that was, in fact, very much the driving force behind the work of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was a certain anxiety with regard to the circumstances in which the debate was conducted in the Council."
"At a time when everyone acknowledges that monetary policy is an independent policy, when the political power does not have much to say and when practically all of the members of Eurogroup and ECOFIN have criticised the monetary policy when it came to raising interest rates, this appointment has not been the subject of any debate whatsoever."
"That is why, at the same time as assessing this candidature, we sent a letter to the President of ECOFIN, Mr Karl-Heinz Grasser, the main points of which I should like to go over in this House."
"We looked into the selection procedure of members of the Executive Board and we therefore question the Council on two aspects of that procedure."
"The first concerns the system of rotation of membership on the basis of nationality."
"I, for my part, understand that the main economies of the eurozone must be represented on the Executive Board, but that opinion is not shared by all of the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"In any case, the issue of how members of the eurozone are represented on the Executive Board was raised by members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, while that of the size of the Executive Board was not, for its part, mentioned."
"Next, the issue of the diversity of backgrounds represented on the Executive Board was also a matter of concern for the members of our committee, based on this idea that we perhaps need people within the Executive Board of the Central Bank who come from different backgrounds so that, when the monetary policy of the entire eurozone is at stake, all of the different points of view can be expressed."
"Our committee felt that, in the long run, the Council should be able to hold a genuine and open debate, with guidelines, on the profile that should be proposed by the Member State, which would have the opportunity to appoint a member by respecting the diversity of the member countries of the eurozone."
"We believe that the European Parliament should have the right to a vote of approval, as the members of the Commission do."
"That is the spirit in which we composed this letter to the President of ECOFIN."
"I believe that all of the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, with the entire institution behind them, are open to dialogue with the Council, thanks to which we will have a better and totally satisfactory procedure in 2010."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Stark, the Vice-President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, is a convincing candidate for the Executive Board of the European Central Bank."
"He was involved in the creation of the framework conditions for the euro as State Secretary of the German Ministry of Finance and is, so to speak, one of the founding fathers of the euro."
"Furthermore, something revealed by the hearing that is very positive is that he is a committed European."
"That should also be mentioned at this point."
"He stands for continuity in the European Central Bank, and for the objective of independence, which is particularly important at a time when increasing attempts are being made to subject the European Central Bank to external requirements."
"He stands for a low rate of inflation, for a stable currency, for the Stability and Growth Pact – which is very important at this particular time, when Member States are finding it hard to make savings."
"With the enlargement of the euro area around the corner, continuity is the overriding consideration."
"Speaking of the enlargement of the euro area, I should like to say that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats warmly welcomes Commissioner Almunia’s decision today in this context."
"The issue of Parliament’s role has also been debated."
"I, too, should like to see a strengthening of Parliament, and wish to emphasise that Mr Stark stated explicitly that the role of Parliament is very important to him."
"I hope that, in future, he will intervene accordingly on the Executive Board of the ECB when the CESR external expert group on clearing and settlement is engaged again, as it was just recently: we shall be looking at whether he really gives Parliament top priority."
"That was just an aside."
"Something that should play no part in Parliament in future, however, is screening of fundamental attitudes, and that is why we should think carefully about how to do things in future."
"What we need are candidates with a good image, with the relevant experience, like Mr Stark."
"It must not be a case of who shares our personal political views and who does not."
"That is not Parliament’s job, and I would not follow this course."
"I support the objective of ensuring that there are no national fiefdoms in the European Central Bank."
"We must also ensure, however, that both large and small economies are equally represented on the Executive Board of the ECB."
"In conclusion, I wish Mr Stark very great success with his new job, which we hope he will take up – for the sake of the euro and Europe, and an appropriate, effective, significant portfolio in the Governing Council."
". Madam President, in leading business circles there is a growing recognition that it is imperative to provide for diversity in management and supervisory boards."
"Diversity in educational backgrounds, work experience, age, gender and nationalities guarantees more sensitive, alert and creative cooperation than just adding more of the same sort of people."
"Replacing one Bundesbanker with another does not promise much diversity and creativity."
"If it had been a company operating in a fast-changing environment, I would have advised the ECB, when it was drawing up a profile for a new board member, to look at this aspect of diversity."
"But the ECB is not a company and its policy is kept static; it is apparently deemed that it should eternally remain as it was at its creation."
"I will not hide my criticism of this lack of dynamism in the development of monetary policy, although I agree that it is not only the ECB that should be addressed but also the political decision-makers, the Ecofin Council and the governments of Member States, which nowadays do not seem to be very inspired by macroeconomic coordination at European level that complements their common monetary policy."
"But in this debate tonight we are not dealing with the policies of the ECB and the eurozone as such, but with the appointment of a new Bundesbanker to the Executive Board."
"The strict remit of our ECON Committee is to assess the capabilities and competences of the nominated candidates and we do not have much to say in this debate, because the candidate meets the criteria and performed well in the hearing that we had with him."
"In my political group, the PSE, we are more interested in discussing the procedure leading to this appointment."
"Originally we proposed to do that in the report that we are dealing with now and we were disappointed that a majority of the committee did not support it."
"That was why we abstained in the vote."
"In the coordinators’ meeting following that committee meeting, we jointly agreed to write a letter to Mr Grasser, as well as starting a more fundamental debate about the nomination procedure, particularly the upgrading and reinforcement of the role of the European Parliament in such nomination procedures."
"It is very important for the European Parliament to counterbalance what I see as a strong renationalisation and non-integrationist trend in the way Member States deal with these issues."
"It is clear where our criticisms are focused: there is apparent evidence that large Member States have ‘reserved seats’."
"There is a lack of debate about profile and portfolios and this diversity of backgrounds, and a lack of choice."
"The issue of appointment is taken as an ‘A’ item in the Council debate and the European Parliament has a very limited role."
"We hope that if we have the opportunity to present more proposals, the Commission, the Council and the ECB will ready to discuss with us a change in this appointment procedure."
"But we hope to cooperate very well with any candidate put forward by Mr Radwan."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe welcomes the proposal to appoint Professor Jürgen Stark as a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank."
"The report presented by Mrs Berès clearly expresses this positive assessment, and therefore has the support of our group."
"Mr Stark gave convincing written answers to the questionnaire presented by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"At his hearing in committee on 18 April, he then proved himself once more to be an excellent candidate for membership of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank."
"He is convincing on account not only of his personal integrity, but also of his wide-ranging experience and his competence, particularly in matters of monetary policy."
"He played a substantial role in shaping the process of monetary union from 1988 until the introduction of euro notes and coins in 2002."
"Thus, he ranks among the architects of the Stability and Growth Pact, and he has spoken out consistently and clearly against watering it down."
"We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe welcome the fact that Mr Stark is a well-known advocate of the independence of the European Central Bank and attaches the highest priority to price stability."
"He has declared his unequivocal belief in the cornerstones of monetary union, and as a result we can be sure that he will endeavour, as a European, to act for the benefit of all."
"In addition, Mr Stark has given assurances that he is prepared to engage in an open dialogue with Parliament."
"We members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs shall take him at his word."
"I should like to conclude with a few critical remarks, which are of an exclusively procedural nature and have nothing to do with the quality of Professor Stark’s candidacy or with him personally."
"Although all the previous speakers have already pointed this out, I consider it sufficiently important to emphasise it once more: this nomination is not the result of a competitive process in which several applicants present their candidacies, but of political deliberations on the part of the Council."
"In addition, the large euro countries appear to look on the Executive Board of the European Central Bank as a fiefdom and exclude the representatives of other Member States from the outset."
"The Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mrs Berès, has written a letter to the Austrian Council Presidency proposing procedural improvements, as she has just stated."
"The ALDE Group expressly supports this proposal."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to Mr Klinz for distinguishing so clearly between the assessment of the candidate himself and the procedure, because we must not give the impression that our demands and desires as regards the procedure interfere with our assessment of the man himself."
"Today we are assessing the candidate himself, and, in Mr Stark, the Council has put forward a strong candidate to succeed Mr Issing."
"I should like to take this opportunity to thank the outgoing Executive Board Member Mr Issing once again for his work and constructive cooperation."
"Mr Stark represents a strong signal for the Stability and Growth Pact, for the Maastricht criteria, for the independence of the ECB, for a strong euro and for continuity and calculability – and continuity and calculability are preconditions for confidence."
"We need not only greater confidence in the EU, but also great confidence in the independence of the ECB and in the euro as a strong currency."
"For that reason, I ask all my fellow Members to demonstrate our great confidence in Mr Stark tomorrow."
"I would also ask that we refrain from sacrificing these facts, which are also set out in the report – committed European, competent expert, champion of the value of independence, advocate of prioritising price stability, firm conviction in monetary policy, openness with regard to the rights of Parliament, and commitment to stepping up the dialogue between the two institutions – to party political small-mindedness, because this attitude has no place in either the EU or the European Central Bank."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0162/2006) by Mr Rosati, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on public finances in the EMU (2005/2166(INI))."
". – Madam President, the state of public finances has a real influence on the rate of economic growth, employment and macroeconomic stability."
"It is also an important indicator of the health of the common European currency."
"This is why the Treaty on European Union clearly states that developments in the public finances of the Member States are of interest to the bodies of the Union, including the European Parliament."
"Exercising its powers under the Treaty, the European Parliament has once again reviewed the state of public finances in the European Union and will adopt a report on the matter."
"The main message behind this year’s report is the conclusion that public finances in the majority of the Member States are still not balanced and that this situation has not improved significantly since last year."
"This calls for continued efforts to improve tax policy."
"The total deficit of the 25 Member States of the European Union increased in 2005 to 2.7% of GDP."
"In the eurozone it rose to 2.9% of GDP."
"In effect, public debt has systematically grown in the last few years in relation to GDP and by the end of 2005 rose above 70% in the eurozone."
"Since 2003, 11 European Union Member States have been running deficits in excess of 3% of GDP, and 10 countries have been subject to excessive deficit procedures."
"Most worryingly of all, four of the largest economies in the European Union, namely Germany, France, Great Britain and Italy, also find themselves among those offending against budgetary discipline rules."
"This situation clearly shows that some Member States are experiencing considerable difficulties in restoring the balance of public finances."
"There is a lack of political will and determination to implement the necessary changes."
"This state of affairs also shows that the preventive and corrective procedures of the Stability and Growth Pact have not been very effective to date."
"One of the main reasons for this unfortunate budgetary situation has been the persistently low rate of economic growth in Europe."
"Failure to implement indispensable structural reforms, increasing international competition, uncertain job prospects and a lack of certainty regarding future demand mean that, for a number of years, Europe has been developing more slowly than other parts of the world."
"The policy hitherto implemented has not succeeded in changing this state of affairs."
"An expansive tax policy and a restrictive monetary policy have produced an unfortunate ‘policy mix’ and slowed economic growth."
"The situation is made worse by insufficient coordination of tax policy in the eurozone."
"This coordination is vital in order to increase the effectiveness of economic policy and in order to maintain confidence in the common currency, which requires tax reforms to be synchronised and measures that result in budget imbalance to be avoided."
"One of the reasons behind the tendency towards stagnation in Europe is the insufficient progress of structural reform in many Member States, and especially a lack of action to increase the flexibility of the labour market, to promote professional activity, to remove barriers on the services market, to promote innovation and to support entrepreneurship."
"In this context, the slow progress made in implementing the Lisbon Strategy gives particular cause for concern."
"Madam President, in the report we suggest a list of measures aimed at improving the state of public finances."
"First of all, it is necessary to adhere strictly and rigorously to the tax regulations set out in the modified version of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"This will help the Pact to regain credibility and strengthen its disciplinary role."
"We call for faster structural reform, and in particular for the decisive implementation of the Lisbon Strategy."
"We also propose measures aimed at streamlining fiscal procedures, increasing coordination and improving the effectiveness of tax policy."
"We call on the European Commission to assess the likely effect of increased tax policy coordination on economic growth in the Union."
"We recommend measures to improve the quality of tax statistics, the introduction of transparent rules for the assessment of assets and future pension obligations, the taking into account of the economic cycle in drawing up budget deficit estimates and an extension of the budget forecast timescale to two years."
"We suggest that a single set of macroeconomic assumptions whose source could be the European Commission should be accepted as the basis for drafting the budget in the Member States."
"Finally, we recommend that measures be taken aimed at strengthening motivation for the implementation of tax reform by Member States, including the publication of reports on the dangers associated with a failure to balance public finances."
"The measures mentioned are necessary in order for tax and budget policy to contribute to faster economic growth and increased employment in the European Union."
"The European Parliament should send out a clear and unambiguous political signal on this matter."
"That is why I turn to you, my colleagues, and ask you to endorse this report."
"Madam President, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Rosati for his excellent report and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for having taken the initiative to reflect on the situation of public finances in the economic and monetary Union."
"They have enriched this very necessary debate on how to conduct economic policy – particularly budgetary policies – so as to enhance economic growth and promote job creation, aims that we all share."
"I must begin my brief speech with two comments that set my position apart from the statements contained in Mr Rosati’s report, probably because some time has passed and has brought some positive results."
"Since last year, when the Commission drafted its report on public finances, the figures in which served as the basis for the Rosati report, we have received new information both on economic growth and on the balance of spending or public deficit situation in the countries of the European Union, which improves the outlook."
"I should like to discuss that briefly."
"On 8 May I had the chance to present the Commission’s spring economic forecasts and, in doing so, I was able to publicly state that, in our opinion, according to the Commission’s analysis, growth in 2006 in both the euro zone and in the European Union as a whole will approach our potential growth: in the euro zone it will exceed 2%, specifically reaching 2.1%, compared with the 1.3% achieved in 2005, and in the European Union as a whole it will be 2.3%, also clearly higher than the growth recorded in 2005."
"We are therefore entering a phase of much more evident recovery than we could envisage when we in the Commission presented the report on public finances for 2005, and that in itself is a positive sign."
"I hasten to say, however, that it is not enough, because growing at the rate of our current growth potential is not enough to meet all of our citizens’ demands or, above all, to create sufficient jobs to produce a clear, sustained fall in unemployment rates, which are still in excess of 8%."
"We have to increase our growth potential – and in that I agree with the ideas expressed in the Rosati report; we have to persevere along the path sketched out in the revised Lisbon Strategy; we have to continue to put the national reform plans into practice within the framework of that strategy; we have to continue reforming the product, service and labour markets; we have to correct budgetary imbalances wherever they persist, achieve greater sustainability for our public finances and, of course, improve the quality of public spending; in particular, we have to make a greater effort in all of our policies aimed at skills enhancement, research and development, innovation and education in general."
"The second comment that I should like to make relates to the particular subject of public deficits."
"The report notes that the situation worsened in 2005 and attributes that to the incorrect application of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The final figures for 2005 refute that statement; the public deficit in 2005 both in the euro zone and in the European Union as a whole was well below what we estimated a few months ago: it came to 2.3% in the EU as a whole and 2.4% in the euro zone, several points, therefore, below our forecasts at the time when the Commission published its report on public finances for 2005."
"According to our forecasts for 2006 and 2007, this situation will continue and, if the Member States adopt additional measures, we will see a clear improvement."
"In my view, I do not think one can say that the new Stability and Growth Pact has been incorrectly applied, but rather that the new Stability and Growth Pact has been successfully applied to correct the excessive deficits: there were seven countries with excessive deficits of 3% at the end of 2005, compared with 12 countries currently subject to the excessive deficit procedure, which will probably leave the procedure once those improvements in public deficits are confirmed."
"The stability and convergence programmes, which have been approved under the guidelines and parameters of the new Pact for the first time, show a qualitatively clear improvement in the Member States’ medium-term budget strategies, with greater attention to sustainability and a greater effort to improve the quality of public finances and to link budgetary and fiscal policies with the growth strategies included in the Lisbon Strategy and in the national growth plans."
"Apart from these two comments, there is considerable convergence in everything else between the proposals and statements in the Rosati report and the Commission’s opinions and criteria."
"We agree on the need to avoid pro-cyclical policies, on the need for a reorientation of public expenditure towards greater physical, human and technological capital accumulation, and on the need for greater efforts to make the Member States’ budgetary procedures more uniform, particularly in the euro zone; we obviously agree that we must place the accent on how to address the challenge of an ageing society."
"Now that economic recovery is beginning, now that we have defined the Lisbon Strategy, and now that the 25 Member States have defined their priorities for structural reforms aimed at growth and employment, I believe – and here I share the view of this report – that we have a unique opportunity to close the door on a period of low growth, economic pessimism and lack of confidence among economic operators."
"We have a unique opportunity in our hands to use Europe’s institutions and the European dimension to meet the people’s demands and aspirations."
". – Madam President, I should like to start by giving my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Rosati, who, together with all the shadow rapporteurs and others, has been at pains to draw up a report on which a consensus can be achieved."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs supported this draft by an overwhelming majority – I would almost say unanimously."
"Naturally, it has also been endorsed by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"We shall naturally assess the amendments tabled critically, and so I am very grateful that the Commissioner, too, has criticised two or three aspects of these amendments."
"Sound public finances are the most important aspect of Economic and Monetary Union as a whole and beyond."
"These are the only way of effecting a lasting economic upturn in Europe."
"Unfortunately, this idea is not popular with all European governments, who often lack the political will to make budgetary reforms."
"They have to clearly observe the criteria laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact rather than repeatedly attempting to circumvent them."
"In 1997 – several of us were present at that time – these were termed ‘stability criteria’, as they lend stability to the financial area and economy in Europe."
"European governments should not now view these criteria as a scourge or obstacle to their development, therefore, but as a sustainable path to a healthy economy."
"Large budget deficits have an adverse effect on economic developments."
"Indeed, as we have just heard, there have been some changes in this regard."
"Increases in these deficits only perpetuate this spiral, and it is imperative that they be stopped."
"Naturally, we must increase expenditure on the correct channels: on innovation and on developments with a promising future; but this does not change the fact that there is still expenditure that needs to be included in macroeconomic calculations."
"In this connection, I welcome the independence of the European Central Bank – something that others have already made clear today – with regard to its interest-rate policy, which must continue to pursue price stability as its primary objective."
"The write-down in the case of special expenditure on innovation, such as in company accounting, that has been called for by some of my fellow Members, would open the way for further new debt and weaken the European economy dangerously in the long term."
"A long-term policy of balanced public finances is needed in the current euro countries and must also be made an indispensable requirement for all future accessions to the euro area."
"To do so does not require the creation of any new national bodies to monitor public finances, as stated in the amendments, however, as these would only result in an increase in bureaucracy and in a heterogeneous system in a single monetary area."
"The Stability and Growth Pact and the monetary policy of the European Central Bank provide a reliable, satisfactory framework, and all we need to do is to stick to it."
". – Madam President, I should first like to respond to what Mr Almunia said about something that is included in paragraph 8 of the report with regard to the incorrect application of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"I agree with him that we did not claim either that this would be a case of incorrect application."
"That is why we have tabled an amendment to correct this wording."
"I would also ask the other groups to look into this."
"Our Amendment 7 tries, in fact, to remove this wording altogether from the text."
"With regard to the statistics and prognoses, your remark that the content of the 2005 report has seemingly been superseded underlines once again how relative these prognoses and statistics are."
"I would also like to stress this in the light of what you said today about Lithuania, a Member State that wants to join the eurozone and in respect of which comments can indeed be made if one considers the figures."
"Only one figure matters, in fact, namely that of inflation, while many Member States would envy that country for its achievements in other areas of public finance."
"I only say this to illustrate the relative nature of the figures."
"We consider the recommendations that are issued to the euro group in a bid to improve the procedures another important element in this report."
"I think we are well on our way in this respect, in the framework of the Lisbon Strategy to joining forces with national parliaments and to seeing how a number of public finance procedures in the Member States can be streamlined in terms of timing, but also in terms of assumptions that are made about the oil price development and other parameters that are important for the planning of policy."
"I think that in this respect, there is much room for improvement in order to make this more predictable and more comparable in a European context."
"While I would, once again, like to bring those recommendations to the Commissioner’s attention, I think it is also necessary to bring them to Mr Juncker’s attention, as chairman of the euro group, to ensure that we make serious headway there too."
"I think it is crucial that this be flagged in this report."
"The same also applies to the quality of the statistics."
"That is another important point we have raised several times, and we would like to support the Commissioner in his attempts to make improvements in that area too."
"Finally, I would like to draw your attention to, and at the same time underline, the last paragraphs of the report."
". – I thank the Member of the Commission for the good news about the European Union's improving economic situation – this is one of a few pieces of good news for Lithuania today."
"However, I would like to talk about the public finance policy."
"According to the Treaties this should be formed at the national level, but the stability of the common currency – the Euro – and growth in the competitiveness of the entire European Union is dependent on its successful implementation."
"Therefore we must determine reference points in the public finance policy which would help to reconcile the Member States' interests with the objectives of the Community."
"It must be emphasised that the report presented by Mr Rosati reflects to a degree the endeavour of balancing both these viewpoints, and I would like to thank the rapporteur for this."
"It is the ALDE Group's opinion that the following measures could ensure more effective coordination of the European Union’s public finance policy."
"Firstly, measures of organisational nature, that is, forecasts of basic economic indicators made at the Community level, which would increase the reliability of the Member States' financial forecasts."
"Secondly, preparation of coordinated timetable of budgetary procedures of the EU Member States, preferably for at least two years."
"Thirdly, we would encourage public statements and transparent obligations of the Member States’ governments, proving that they are striving for fiscal balance, as this would ensure public supervision."
"Measures of an economic nature, which we would support, first of all include the need to define a European macroeconomic policy which is outward-looking and competitive."
"In this respect there could be more coordination in ECOFIN Council meetings."
"Appropriate tax initiatives, which stimulate modernisation of the economic structure and citizen activity, should also be a priority."
"The third priority should be the fostering of fiscal discipline, based on the best practices of the Member States."
"We use this method rarely, but some countries have actually achieved rather good results by solving fiscal administration management problems, and the Commission could prepare a report or document summarising the best examples, instead of shall we say, reproaching one country or another all the time."
"The fourth measure is extremely important – we believe that attention should be turned from encouraging private investments to encouraging savings, as this is one of the basic macroeconomic initiatives."
". – As this report states, and as the recent spring economic forecasts demonstrate, there continues to be weak economic growth throughout the EU, along with high levels of unemployment, and more than 70 million people living in poverty, who tend to be forgotten by the Commission."
"The time has come to rethink the level of priority that continues to be attached to the monetarist, neoliberal policies of the Lisbon Strategy and to the guidelines of the European Central Bank."
"No matter how much the truth is muffled, it cannot be denied that the monetary and fiscal policy based on the Stability and Growth Pact and the priority attached to price stability has a negative impact on economic growth and employment growth, a phenomenon that has been evident in Portugal."
"What is therefore needed is a monetary and fiscal policy that will boost economic recovery and help combat unemployment. Furthermore, the Stability and Growth Pact should be repealed and replaced with a proper social development and progress pact."
"We emphasise the need for an expansionist policy coordinated jointly by the EU and its Member States, which will be aimed at strengthening internal demand, public investment, research and education, high-quality public services in areas such as health and housing, including infrastructure and equipment, which promotes high rates of employment with rights and which guarantees economic and social cohesion and balanced environmental development."
"We feel that these are some of the vital proposals that will also help us gain the trust of EU citizens."
"Without that trust, we will certainly continue to live in this atmosphere of pessimism arising from policies that do not address the problems currently facing people in the EU."
"Madam President, public finances have a huge impact on economic growth, the creation of new jobs and on macroeconomic stability."
"The Maastricht Treaty clearly stated that the course followed by public finances in European Union Member States should be carefully monitored at European Union level."
"The main and most pertinent point of this year’s report is the unbalanced budgetary positions in the majority of Member States."
"Four of the largest EU economies, France, Germany, Italy and Great Britain, are among the countries subject to excessive budget deficit procedures."
"The basic causes of the problems are still an excessively slow rate of economic growth in Europe, as well as failure to implement the structural reforms required to strengthen public finances for the future."
"The rate of economic growth in the European Union is significantly slower than its potential would suggest, and significantly slower than that of other global economic powers, such as the United States, Japan, China or India."
"The reasons for this situation also lie in the low level of internal demand and uncertainty concerning job security, social protection, salaries and pensions."
"High energy prices, unstable fuel markets and constant current account surpluses in the majority of Asian countries have all shaken the faith of many businesses in Europe."
"A loose fiscal policy has proved to be ineffective and has not encouraged growth in our economies."
"The indicators show rising levels of debt which pose a real problem, especially in terms of long-term budget stability, across the whole of the Union."
"The initiation of attempts to implement the Lisbon Strategy in 2000 was supposed to ensure a comprehensive programme of reform."
"Bearing all these problems in mind, I think that we should take decisive steps to increase the effectiveness of preventive measures, as well as implementing corrective measures to strengthen and consolidate public finances."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, paragraph 11 of the report states the following: ‘Stresses that in the context of an EU with low consumer and investor confidence, it is vital to correct public deficits’."
"I would underline this statement, especially as the Lisbon Strategy is calling for more money and greater investment, including from public finances – I need only mention education and research."
"We have committed ourselves to increasing our Official Development Assistance to a minimum of 0.7% at long last, we face the challenge of globalisation, and we find ourselves in a situation in which demographic developments represent one of the nails in the coffin of the European continent."
"If we do not put our social security and pension systems in order, we shall be the losers of globalisation at all events."
"I am pleased that there has been a trend reversal in the public consciousness with regard to public deficits in recent years."
"Prior to the introduction of the euro, public budgets tended to be the preserve of experts."
"Since the introduction of the euro, of the Maastricht criteria, of the Stability and Growth Pact, there is a public interest in a discussion on the structure of public finances, on the causes of the annual deficits, on the impact of public debt."
"We have achieved a reduction in public deficits, and we must continue on this path, as we need to increase our scope for the future."
"For that reason, I also congratulate the Commission on the decision it took today, as it makes it clear that we take our rules seriously."
"This decision is not aimed at anyone in particular, but rather at ensuring that we take the Maastricht criteria and the Stability and Growth Pact seriously."
"That is why I am pleased that the public debate has intensified and that we have thus contributed to making the structure of our budgets more future oriented."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I shall begin by thanking the rapporteur for his contribution to our debates."
"I should like to point out three factual elements."
"The first is the cyclical conditions that place a strain on the public finances of the European Union."
"Given the rise in oil prices, this is an exogenous factor that we must take into account in our public finance strategies."
"The second element is, for its part, practically exogenous with regard to our public finances: I am referring to the policy of the Central Bank and, in particular, to the policy of raising interest rates on which it has embarked."
"The third element is undoubtedly more political, and is also an aspect that my political group holds dear, namely that the plea that some people make for structural reforms without accompanying it with a strategy for boosting growth is likely to fail, as there can be no structural reforms without genuine support for growth."
"That is why I should like to point out two lines of action that I consider to be absolutely crucial."
"The first line of action is an investment strategy to help genuinely implement the Lisbon Strategy."
"From that perspective, I am surprised that my fellow Member, Mr Karas, can, on the one hand, speak in favour of an increase in the allocation for the Lisbon Strategy and, on the other, be getting ready to vote, tomorrow, in favour of the financial perspective as it is proposed to us in the compromise drawn up between our institutions."
"I believe that there is an inconsistency there for which I hope our fellow citizens will not have to pay a heavy price tomorrow."
"The second line of action concerns the issue addressed by Mr Rosati at the end of his report with regard to the conditions for growth and coordination of economic policies within the eurozone."
"A large number of commitments have just been made under the responsibility of the President of Eurogroup, with the Commissioner's agreement."
"I believe that we are on the right track, particularly with regard to the harmonisation of the timetable and of the macroeconomic data on the basis of which the Member States evaluate and draft their budgets."
"That being said, we still have a great deal left to do and, to that end, I believe that work carried out between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament should make it possible in the coming months and weeks to come up with practical proposals that would enable the European Union to have a eurozone that is more in line with the kind of prospects for growth that we have a right to expect from having a single currency in our favour."
"Madam President, I take the floor in the debate on the report by Mr Rosati concerning public finances in order to draw your attention to the following issues."
"Firstly, the sanitising of public finances cannot be an aim in itself, but must be a means of generating higher economic growth and creating new jobs."
"Secondly, measures taken in this field by the European Union Member States are unfortunately not yielding satisfactory results, as is reflected in the falling rate of GDP growth from 2.4% in 2004 to 1.5% in 2005."
"This fall has been even more marked in the eurozone: from 2.1% to 1.3%."
"Unemployment has remained high at around 9%."
"These indicators confirm that the European Union is not only failing to catch up with the United States and other developed countries, but is actually falling behind."
"Here we should add that GDP growth in the United States stood at 3.5% in 2005 and was therefore more than twice as high as in the European Union."
"Thirdly, a low level of economic growth and continuing high unemployment make significant reductions in budget deficit and public debt difficult."
"In the European Union of 25, the budget deficit has fallen from 3% of GDP in 2003 to 2.6% of GDP in 2004 and from 3% to 2.7% in the eurozone."
"However, public debt rose from 61.4% in 2002 to 64.1% in 2005."
"In the eurozone it rose from 69.2% to 71.7%."
"Fourthly, as the figures above show, budget deficits, and public debt in particular, are significantly higher in the older Member States than in the new, and yet it is unfortunately to the latter that the warnings and recommendations of the European Commission are mainly addressed."
"Finally, the new Member States are implementing very difficult reforms based on fundamental changes to pensions systems."
"In spite of moves from a budgetised system to a capitalised system, as has been the case in Poland, for example, the European Commission (Eurostat) wants to treat the contributions to this system as budgetary spending which increases the budget deficit."
"It thus, in fact, wants to punish these countries for implementing far-reaching reforms of their public finance systems."
"I would like to voice my strong objection to this manner of dealing with the difficult reforms being implemented in the new Member States, especially Poland."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Rosati, because I think he has produced an excellent report, which takes on board contributions from the other political groups."
"In my speech tonight, I should like to focus on the relationship between public deficit and economic growth."
"The Commissioner has provided us with more up-to-date information."
"Despite that, I would dare to regard the European Union public deficit situation as worrying: 2.4% on average is better than 2.9%, but it is still worrying."
"The fact is that the European Union – Europe – is the region of the world, including the less developed parts of the world, that is achieving least growth at a time of international economic expansion."
"Thus Europe is not keeping its own house in order and it is not doing what it ought to be doing in terms of balancing the international economy."
"That has a great deal to do with the public deficit situation, as other speakers this evening, such as Mr Karas and Mr Hoppenstedt, have pointed out; they have said that, in a European economy afflicted with a lack of domestic demand, public deficits are a cause and not an effect."
"Therefore, I have to insist that we must improve the European Union’s mechanisms in order to improve confidence and, in the last analysis, so that income levels in the European Union grow."
"It has the ability to do so, but its problem is that its growth potential is so terribly low, incomparably low."
"We are the area of the world with least growth potential, and that is where the problem lies."
"That can be solved, in effect, through structural reforms and also, of course, through public finances that have been straightened out by means of political willpower to contain public spending to the point where it becomes sustainable, so that European citizens can pay reasonable, modern taxes."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent report."
"The report begins by stressing that the EU’s main problem is weak economic growth, the persistently high level of unemployment and the inadequate use of the production capacity in place."
"This, in my view, is a crucial message."
"The first signs of recovery that you mentioned, Mr Almunia, are not sufficient either to guarantee the EU’s competitiveness on the international stage or to make up for the years of stagnation that we are still enduring."
"Indeed, balancing public finances must not be seen as an end in itself."
"It is also true that neither the way in which the Stability and Growth Pact has been interpreted nor the opening of proceedings relating to excess deficit has been successful in preventing persistent imbalances in the public finances of the major European economies."
"There are two main recommendations that, to my mind, emerge from this report: The first relates to the need to ensure that the balancing of public finances is entirely compatible with the process of revitalising European competitiveness, and that this process is pushed to the top of Europe’s political agenda."
"The early shoots of growth have emerged in spite of, rather than because of, the Pact."
"Public and private investment must be increased in the fields of innovation, education and the development of new skills and technologies, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy."
"Intergovernmental cooperation and the coordination of economic policies at EU level are key factors and are currently not being sufficiently exploited."
"It is also regrettable that this priority of growth has not been sufficiently reflected either in the interpretation, as mentioned in the Pact, or, more importantly, in the financial perspective that we are supposed to be adopting tomorrow."
"The second point concerns the need to continue to clarify the accounting concepts and practices of the Member States’ statistical institutions, that is to say, disseminating good practice, and harmonising concepts, timetables and methodologies."
"Maintaining sound public finances is only of interest if it is sustainable in the medium term, which often means taking measures of a structural nature."
"It is time for economic operations based on extraordinary measures or creative accounting to disappear for good, because they undermine credibility and erode the trust of investors and consumers."
"To sum up, public finances must be consolidated, but it is only worthwhile doing so sustainably and provided that this goes hand in hand with the strengthening of the European economy and the skills of its citizens."
"I feel that these are the two key messages to take from the report before us today."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to be given the floor once more this evening, at an hour when, in fact, the debate is drawing to a close."
"In my view, the report by Mr Rosati on public finances in Economic and Monetary Union is an extremely important one, as it rightly draws public attention to the fact that, in the present situation, the Member States are responsible for EU finances and also for the resulting debt for future generations."
"The rapporteur is right to address his appeal to the Member States. However, in my view, he occasionally goes too far – I should like to expressly endorse the words of the rapporteur from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Hoppenstedt, in this regard."
"I take the liberty of drawing attention to a further point."
"In 2007, Germany’s budget deficit will be below 3%, and consequently we shall meet the criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Indeed, Commissioner Almunia said so himself in appropriate terms."
"The development of Germany’s economy will thus give the EU as a whole new momentum – or at least that is my hope."
"The chief concerns are well known, and so we need increased coordination of economic policies, particularly by Member States, so that individual Member States are not able to push up costs for the whole economic zone."
"I should like to refer once more to the report by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, which considered the state of the European economy during the last part-session, with Parliament’s concern being the development of an intelligent growth strategy for Europe."
"I believe that we have not yet gone far enough down this route and that some work remains to be done in this regard."
"Despite the rise in oil prices, inflation remains stable, and even consumption in the EU is at a level that could certainly be called acceptable."
"For this reason, we do not need pessimism, but rather action, particularly with regard to the improvement of the economic climate and the further integration of the internal market."
"In this respect, I hope that the report by Mr Rosati also points the Commission in the right direction."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Member States’ economic policies are a matter of joint interest."
"Supervision of their public finances is essential to ensure that their commitments, which are greater in the euro zone, are fulfilled and that our shared aims are achieved."
"I congratulate Mr Rosati, because his report identifies the main problems with public finances and provides valuable guidelines for treating them and improving their future course."
"The situation is worrying but, as the Commissioner has said, the turning point may have been reached in 2005."
"Until then, the public debt ratio had done nothing but rise ever since the euro had been brought into circulation."
"There are still five members of the euro zone subject to the excessive deficit procedure and, indeed, growth in the European economy is lower than in the most advanced countries."
"Part of the success may be due to the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, because it has introduced some rationality."
"Defining medium-term budgetary objectives, while taking into account each country’s situation, its cyclical conditions and sustainability status, provides a more consistent fiscal environment and better incentives for structural reforms to raise growth potential."
"It is important that budgetary procedures have a uniform calendar, respond to common economic parameters and are based on uniform assumptions that improve statistical governance."
"It is also necessary to use a cyclically adjusted budget concept, as the rapporteur proposes."
"It does not seem that public investment should be subjected to greater rigidities than private, and it is therefore reasonable that the Council should look into authorising investment for purposes specified in the Lisbon Strategy, to be amortised over a similar time period to business accounting, and it is also important to make progress on sustainability."
"Along these lines, I consider it important for national reports to be drawn up on the sustainability of public finances, based on common elements."
"Madam President, I should like to thank all the Members who have spoken in this debate, referring to initiatives or positions held by the Commission."
"I believe there is quite a considerable level of agreement and consensus on the diagnosis and on the main guidelines as to what the European institutions’ response should be, so that public finances and good fiscal and budgetary policies can help to produce more growth and jobs and more effectively meet European citizens’ demands."
"Indeed, in recent months there has been a significant improvement in confidence and optimism among economic operators and also among European consumers."
"All the indicators point to that."
"We are now in the process of trying to convert this confidence and optimism into real evidence of an upturn in the economic situation, with more consumption, more jobs and more economic growth."
"I believe we are partly succeeding, although that does not mean it is an easy task."
"There is of course a problem – and I agree with those who have pointed it out as one – with the low potential growth of the European economy."
"The European economy by itself, without further reforms, is incapable of growing any more than the figures that we are estimating for 2006, namely slightly more than 2%."
"There is evidence of some extraordinarily dynamic competitors, both in other industrialised countries and in emerging countries; there is a risk, which some of you have mentioned, arising from the fluctuations in energy prices; there are global imbalances in other important areas of the world economy that may affect this phase in our growth."
"When we find that we have the answer to the question of what to do in this situation, we have a relatively strong consensus: good fiscal and budgetary policies, which are not pro-cyclic, which are anti-cyclic, which improve the quality of revenue and expenditure, and which contribute better to growth and skills enhancement; better operation of the internal market; use of our enormous potential as a market of 450 million consumers; and, as we have all mentioned, the need for better coordination."
"Having witnessed the monthly operations of the Eurogroup and ECOFIN, I have to agree with all of you when you call on the Council, and the Eurogroup in particular, to provide more coordination."
"I can also tell you, however, that the Council and the Eurogroup are willing to improve their coordination and to improve the involvement of all sectors and all the institutions – including this Parliament, of course – in the dialogue needed for this coordination to set the right objectives and priorities and to be effective."
"I believe we are facing a very good opportunity at this turning-point, which Mr Sánchez Presedo mentioned a few minutes ago."
"We must not let this opportunity slip away, and we must not fail to learn from the mistakes that Europe’s economies and the euro zone made in the previous period of economic recovery, when they failed to make use of the good periods of economic growth to consolidate public accounts and thus improve sustainability, or to use the dynamism of their economies to provide more and better jobs, which is what our citizens are demanding of us."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"One of the problems with EMU is that there is no control by the financial market of the way in which Member States conduct their economic policies."
"However large the deficits run by Member States as part of their overall debt, their ratings are not affected appreciably."
"There is an implicit guarantee for countries within the euro area, irrespective of what is said about countries’ borrowing not being guaranteed by other countries in the euro area."
"My view may be summarised in three points."
"Countries newly set to enter the euro area must hold referenda before they introduce the euro."
"It is important that people be made fully aware of the real implications of changing their currency."
"They must appreciate the consequences of having a fixed exchange rate and of not being able to conduct their own monetary policy."
"The example of Sweden shows how important it is to have referenda."
"Secondly, new countries that have public debts in relation to GNP more than 60% in excess of GNP should not be approved."
"This rule has not so far been applied stringently enough."
"Thirdly, a proportion of new countries’ state borrowing should compulsorily be from the long dollar market, involving for example ten-year bonds."
"This should of necessity give rise to a rating without a corresponding implicit guarantee from the EU countries."
"I believe that such dollar bonds would provide a more accurate picture of the countries’ economies."
"Ladies and gentlemen, today, 17 May, is International Day against Homophobia."
"I would remind you that, last January, our Parliament approved a resolution on homophobia in Europe."
"In accordance with that text, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has organised a seminar this afternoon entitled 'Ending the Hate'."
"I believe that it would be a good thing for the Members of this Parliament to contribute to the success of this seminar by attending it if they can, since, although we all say that we want to combat all forms of discrimination, reality demonstrates that, in practice, this discrimination still exists, that freedoms are still not fully guaranteed and that exclusion often generates violence."
"I would like to congratulate the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on this initiative."
"– Mr President, I have been in politics for 32 years and regard the freedom of speech and of the press as democracy’s greatest assets."
"For two days now, early every morning – yesterday, it was at 8.15, today it was at 8.30 – I have been being followed and harassed by a team of television journalists, who have been pestering me with improper questions."
"I really do feel under threat."
"I would also like it to be known that yesterday – as witnesses will confirm – Mr Hans-Peter Martin was behind this team, although he was not there today."
"I would ask you, Mr President, to cause appropriate action to be taken, since I find this sort of mobbing intolerable."
"Thank you for telling us about these events, Mrs Schierhuber."
"The Secretariat will immediately contact the security services and I would ask you to contact them yourself as well so that the appropriate measures can be taken to prevent these things from happening again."
"– Mr President, following on from Mrs Schierhuber’s statement, I would like to add that we, here in this European Parliament, are engaged – and rightly too – in enacting laws intended to prevent people from being mobbed and harassed at their places of work."
"Since this House is our workplace, we should ensure that its Members are accorded the same protection that we demand for Europe’s workers."
"This is not the appropriate time to open up a debate on this, unless you are asking for an amendment of the agenda."
"We shall deal with this issue in a practical fashion by means of Parliament’s security services."
"– Mr President, since my name has been mentioned, I would like, further to Rule 149 (1) of the Rules of Procedure, to simply say that I, too, have been questioned by a television crew, and, before misleading rumours arise, that it is indeed the case that I was using my car early yesterday morning in Kehl, but this is no cause for even more speculation."
"Quite apart from that, I do – difficult though you, ladies and gentlemen, may find it to accept – believe in the existence of the fourth power, namely the press, the independence of which we should respect."
"Of that I am all in favour."
"Mrs Schierhuber, I see that you are requesting the floor, but you will appreciate that we cannot turn plenary into a place for discussing all of the incidents that take place in Parliament."
"I shall give you the floor for the last time, but from now on, when you wish to deal with an issue of this kind, please do so by means of the procedures laid down in the Rules of Procedure."
"– Mr President, Mr Martin was not travelling by car, but I can give the security services the name of the young lady."
"He was on foot outside the hotel."
"I would ask the Secretary-General to call a meeting with the security services and that will give you the opportunity to speak as you see fit."
"If Mr Martin has anything to add, he will also be invited to that meeting so that the appropriate measures can be taken and any repetition of this kind of event can be prevented, since this is not the first time it has happened."
"Mr President, I would like to refer to the Minutes of Monday’s sitting, specifically in relation to the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance, which include a speech by a Member of this House which discredits this House and a Member State, namely Spain."
"The Spanish People’s Party has once again used this Parliament as a trench from which to shoot its lies at the Spanish Government, accusing one of its Ministers of an assault against Spanish democracy."
"He also said that he would take those lies and that complaint to the Commission and the Council."
"I would like to remind the European citizen that he lives under the rule of law, with institutions and procedures that work perfectly well, and that to wander around the European institutions with a bag full of national party-political lies, resentments and concerns is not the best way to do his duty as a Member of the European Parliament …"
"Mr Moreno, what you have said does not relate to a point of order and has nothing to do with the Minutes."
"Speeches on the Minutes are intended to point out that the Minutes do not reflect what has been said, not to express an opinion about whether or not what has been said is relevant."
"What you have said is not appropriate unless there is an error in the Minutes or unless they do not reflect exactly what has been said."
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"- the report by Reimer Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the Institutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management [2004/2099(ACI)] (A6-0150/2006), and"
"- the report by Sérgio Sousa Pinto, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the conclusion of the Institutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management [2006/2028(ACI)] (A6-0144/2006)."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following difficult negotiations, we are today able to put before you the draft of an interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline and sound and sustainable management of the Budget."
"I would like, at the outset, to thank all those in this House who helped make it possible for this result to be achieved, in particular Mr Lewandowski, Mr Walter and Mr Mulder, who made up the negotiating team, along with the groups’ coordinators and staff, with especial thanks to the staff of the Bureau, who have really done a splendid job of work over the past months."
"Whatever our differences, this way of working together was and is the strength of this House, in that we feel a sense of obligation to add value to Europe rather than engaging in a one-sided debate about net contributions and the backflow of financial resources."
"The title of this agreement is a programme in itself, in that the Commission, the Council and Parliament are committing themselves to the framework conditions of the annual budget procedure and of multiannual financial planning until 2013."
"They are committing themselves to improving the agreement that has been in force up to now and amend the Council decision of December 2005."
"What that means is that our budget procedures can be more flexible."
"It means that we can respond better and more quickly to exceptional political, humanitarian and economic circumstances."
"What we have managed to secure is a reform of the Budget legislation, the simplification of the Budget Regulations, certification of EU programmes and reporting responsibilities for the Member States, more reliable financial planning and clear agreements when new agencies are to be established."
"The Commission, the Council and Parliament are also committing themselves to modernising the financial instruments by drawing on the European Investment Bank’s lending facilities."
"That will be important in terms of research, innovation and small and medium-sized businesses and could create an important leverage effect by boosting investments."
"The agreement with the Council in December was also underpinned by what I have no option but to call targeted rebates and Christmas presents."
"By way of contrast, what we have secured through our negotiations is additional funding for programmes that really do provide added value for Europe, namely programmes for lifelong learning, for the trans-European networks, for research, for social policy, for innovation in the small and medium-sized business sector, for cross-border cooperation, for Natura 2000, for Life +, for health and consumer policies, for culture, youth and media."
"In foreign and security policy and in the neighbourhood policy, too, we have been able to make substantial improvements."
"The whole may well, when added up, be a small amount when set against financial planning overall, but it secures the programmes that matter to the public, that bring added value to Europe and bear our signature, for this House, unlike the Council, was intent upon something more than a debate about 1%."
"What we wanted to do was to define an across-the-board negotiating position on the basis of an in-depth analysis of the political and economic challenges of an enlarged EU, as documented in the June resolution, with internal and external priorities, modernised budget structures and better-quality budget management."
"We have not, by a long way, achieved everything, but we have been able to negotiate a big package and, to some extent, to make cracks in the Council’s concrete structures."
"Implementing the reforms, in particular, will bring considerable pecuniary benefit to the Union, to the Member States, and to those who have implemented the Community programmes."
"We have managed to enhance Parliament’s prerogatives as regards all the external policy instruments;"
"Parliament has been accorded an appropriate role in the forthcoming 2008/2009 audit, and it will be possible, on the basis of the Commission's statement on the evaluation of these agreements in 2009, to ensure that the Parliament that will by then be newly elected can have its say."
"Some deficits, though, still remain."
"The Galileo satellite programme is still underfunded, and there are – to say the least – question marks against the decisions on rural development and on voluntary modulation in agriculture policy."
"Natura 2000 has been left to decay somewhat; work on it and on other projects remains uncompleted, but I would ask our friends in the Council and the Commission to watch their step, for the 8 June 2005 resolution goes on to describe the financial resources and reforms that are – from our point of view – ideally suited to achieving the ambitious objectives of a union of citizens and states, and that is something to which we shall return time and again."
"We will be very vigilant in ensuring that the letter and spirit of all agreements are complied with."
"I wish to express my gratitude to the Austrian Presidency, for our negotiations with it were constructive and fair."
"The Presidency can certainly not have had an easy job with so many opponents of reform in the Council and in COREPER."
"I should like to conclude by expressing my deep gratitude to the Commissioner with responsibility for budgets."
"Following on from what one might term a period of weakness and a Commission position more strongly influenced by the Council, she has come back to making a positive and essential contribution to the final outcome that gives us hope for the future."
"All in all, and under the prevailing conditions, the result incorporates important points on which progress has been made for the good of the public and with reform, a modernised budget, and the defence of Parliament’s prerogatives in mind."
"It is for this reason that I recommend that the House should vote to approve this agreement."
". – The opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the Interinstitutional Agreement is a positive one."
"I wish to point out that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has been asked to deliver an opinion on the compatibility of the Interinstitutional Agreement with the treaties in force."
"There is no legal obstacle to its adoption."
"Although it is not for the Committee to assess the merits of the agreement, it should be noted that, on an institutional level, the agreement respects Parliament’s prerogatives as an arm of the budgetary authority."
"In this report, Parliament emphasises that future financial frameworks should be set up for a five-year period, in line with the terms of office of Parliament and the Commission."
"This in our view is a necessary step towards greater public scrutiny and democratic monitoring of the Union’s budgetary options."
"The compromise that has been reached between the parties does not live up to the vision and ambition shared by many Members of Parliament, myself included."
"At various times during the negotiations, the opinions of the Council, especially as regards financial appropriations, fell well short of the statements of intent expressed by the negotiators in successive conclusions of European Councils and in numerous speeches made by national and European politicians."
"In spite of the difficulties, Parliament was able to obtain this satisfactory compromise, which safeguards cohesion as a fundamental principle of the Union and the priority attached to the Lisbon Strategy."
"For Parliament to give its public assent, it does not need to consider that the agreement reached is perfect."
"With its shortcomings, the current text represents huge progress from the initial negotiating positions, and is infinitely better than brandishing an interinstitutional iron fist, which would have been irresponsible and for which the Union and its citizens would have paid a heavy price."
"The agreement on the review 2009 ensures that Parliament will participate on an equal footing."
"The review will cover all aspects of the Union’s system of spending resources and will have to address the issue of the reform of own resources."
"This key debate will benefit from the experience of implementing the agreement before us."
"This interinstitutional agreement was negotiated under extremely difficult circumstances. It is clearly a success and good news for Europe, especially given the atmosphere of crisis surrounding projects and leadership that has beset Europe in recent years."
"I should particularly like to commend Mr Böge, who led the negotiations on Parliament’s behalf with great skill and personal commitment on such a broad, complex issue, in a hostile political climate characterised by a crisis of confidence in the European project, by deep differences between the Member States and the institutions, and by a degree of confusion over the Union’s objectives."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my apologies for the slight delay in my arrival."
"Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to address your House on the subject of how our Union is to be funded in future, and on the interinstitutional agreement."
"We all know that the negotiations on the Interinstitutional Agreement were never a simple matter."
"What made them a particular challenge this time round was the fact that there were 25 Member States to negotiate with rather than 15, not to mention the fact that your House has become, as an institution, stronger, with more clout, and, quite rightly, greater importance, and acts with the self-confidence one would expect of such a body."
"I can assure you that your House’s negotiating team did not give us an easy ride."
"I am, however, very grateful for the consistently positive and constructive atmosphere in our conversations and negotiations, and I would like to extend very warm thanks to the team from your House that negotiated with us, consisting of Mr Lewandowski, Mr Böge, Mr Walter and Mr Mulder, for making it possible for us to do so in a constructive spirit, with one single end in view, that being to find a solution for the European Union."
"The way in which we worked together can be taken as an example of how our two institutions should collaborate generally, that is to say, with the political will to find a solution, even if we did perhaps start out from positions at a great distance from one another."
"The result is one with which you will all be familiar, and so I would like just to sketch it out point by point; there is a detailed description of it in Mr Böge’s report."
"We know that there is no getting away from the fact that we will attach different values to results such as this one."
"It is inevitable that we cannot all be completely satisfied with what emerged from the negotiations, but I can offer you some consolation."
"There are some members of the Council who feel exactly the same way, that they cannot go along100% with what the presidency and your House have hammered out together."
"That is how it is with any and every compromise."
"I believe that the result is fair and evenly balanced."
"The mere fact that we have been able to achieve a result on a matter that is central to the European Union is something I regard as a triumph in itself."
"We all agree that 2005 was a difficult year for the European Union, and it was good, necessary and important that we should have been able to demonstrate the capacity to act as a European Union that currently comprises 25 Member States and will soon number 27 of them."
"I believe that every institution has done exactly what its responsibilities demanded of it, and that the search for the best possible European solution brought forth a climate of cooperation."
"If you look at the figures, I am certain that we can, on the one hand, face the public, the taxpayers, with confidence and tell them that we are being careful with the Community’s tax revenues."
"On the other hand, though, we are deliberately prioritising those areas where there is a need for more growth, more jobs and a reduction in the number of unemployed, which is our common goal."
"If you make a comparison with what we are now, in 2006, spending on important categories such as trans-European network, education and research among others, then I think we could negotiate and agree together on decidedly marked increases for the next period."
"I have just three brief observations to make."
"I think it would be right and proper for us to agree on a new Part 3 of the Interinstitutional Agreement, dealing with the economic management of the EU’s funds."
"I believe that it matters that EU funds be subject to more effective controls, and, just as I have in the past, would like to stress our willingness to engage in dialogue on the common goal of improving those controls and the ways in which we plan our finances."
"Secondly, there is the overall ceiling to consider."
"We all know how very difficult it was to achieve consensus on this in the Council in December, and that raising this ceiling was therefore a very difficult issue for the Council."
"I think we really can regard the present increase in funds as a good investment, and am glad that it was eventually possible to achieve a satisfactory and well-considered compromise that has also secured the balance between the institutions and has therefore made no excessive demands on any of them."
"My third point is that it is also, I think, important that we should have agreed on a statement on the review of the financial framework, one of the most important reasons for that being that it takes full account of Parliament’s rights and responsibilities."
"I will conclude by saying that I have always been convinced that there can be only one common solution to the vital question of our joint financial arrangements and the agreement between the three institutions."
"This is a fundamental issue for the EU, and division on it would have done the Europe in which we share no good whatever."
"Our consensus is a demonstration of the fact that, together, we are capable of acting on behalf of this Union of ours and sends an important message to our people."
"The day before yesterday – 15 May – this Interinstitutional Agreement was approved by the General Affairs Council and I ask your House to join with us in giving it your approval and adopting it today."
"Again, I thank you for the good negotiations and for your willingness to allow me the time today to say what I have said."
". Mr President, on behalf of President Barroso and the Commission, I would like to welcome the agreement achieved by all negotiators from all three European institutions."
"I would like personally to thank the European Parliament’s negotiating team, Mr Böge, Mr Lewandowski, Mr Mulder and Mr Walter, for the remarkable job they did."
"Their support and tight cooperation has brought great results."
"I would also like to thank the Minister for his untiring efforts to reach an agreement."
"That was also very helpful."
"We understand that this agreement does not reflect every area of our original ambitions, but it is the best possible compromise for today."
"It is a success, in particular because it encompasses not only quantitative elements but also includes a new chapter on sound financial management and a number of solid institutional commitments towards more effective budgetary management."
"The way EU money is spent is at least as important as the level of expenditure."
